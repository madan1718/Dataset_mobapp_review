"Well made game that is fun and has some learning to it. My daughter loves to play it. My biggest issue is that there is too much non-educational play between the learning about the body and the facts that pop up go away too fast. She will see an interesting fact and want to tell me about it, but it disappears and she can't remember it enough to tell me. It would really help the facts stick if she could tell them to me. Add more education into the game and I'll let her play more.",
It's educational and fun to play,
For them and other kids the best the best the best 😁,
My 8 year old son LOVED it.,
I want to have money ok,
Good,
Love it,
See above,
"I believe that the most chart is fanbestic. As you can see in the woods missing and misspelled that it's not perfect. Anyway, it's nice to have this personal contact with the doctor and I think it gets a 4 but it's still can be improved. That is why I did not give it a fi very much. Appreciate your effort. I wish I was much younger so I could Give it a perfect record in time. And maybe I will be able to. Because i'm only seventy and I hope to be here for at least another twenty years as long as",
I love ❤️ this app its a blog blessing. For the simple fact that I can stay In continus contact an religiously check this app an I love the simplicity of the app really simple to use. Which the Healow app would be compatible an able to link to my chart. I wish they would push up the date on when you will be able to link both epic my chart and Healow as one. I'm so stoked when that happens.,
You need a camera to take pictures of the results of the app because no screenshot is allowed The health care providers can hold up the results until you require them to release the results If you get a 1.54 am message and it rambles on for 2 pages you know they made a bad mistake. Trying to convince you not to pursue the matter. Trying to sign the documents they require is impossible. Doesn't work on either of 2 a13 samsung,
Extremely slow doesn't matter if I use Wi-Fi or cell service and have tried multiple Wi-Fi networks. Enjoy all the info being in one place but even moving from 1 area in the app to another is so slow.,
Update: thank you for the help in locating the passcode option and for your quick response! I used to be able to sign in using a Passcode on my old phone. Since installing on my new phone this option doesn't seem to be available. Super annoying to have to remember all my different login and passwords for my different doctors,
"Great Idea, but with limited benefits! Allows you to view scheduled appointments or communication. But, it removes those appointment or communications after viewing them, unless you book marking them. Sad but no appointment reminding abilities or scheduling conflicts between facilities or within facilities!",
"Takes forever to load things, sometimes it just flat out refuses to work. I have cleared the cache for the app, force stopped, switched to data instead of WiFi, and restarted my phone. Fairly garbage considering it's a patient portal.",
Like having access to medication list and to test results but very frustrated that it won't let me correct or remove wrong information on me. Continue using this app but I don't really like it it's difficult to find information there's a lot of info I would just like to remove it's like junk mail,
Love the app but recently it required me to verify my phone number which is not a big deal but I never get the text for verification after multiple attempts and verification of my phone number. The app will not allow me to schedule any appts without this step being completed. Frustrating.,
As Central. Ever since I signed up I get ads every time I turn my phone on. Even when I'm trying to answer a call. I'm constantly getting ads in the middle of watching something. I'm ready to drop this app and hope I can remember my appointments,
"Totally awesome for all medical From Records to easy and simple for anyone wanting to communicate with there health team. Works flawlessly always for me , so easy to navigate as well.Thank you for everything and making a reliable up to date App for Android at least that's what I use and can speak for.",
Poor functionality! I get alerts saying I have a letter or message but the app will never fully load and mostly just gives error messages. Definitely needs major improvements especially considering it contains pertinent and often time sensitive health care data,
"Fantastic way to keep in touch with your care team and have records. Appreciate the ease of switching between different facilities also, as long as they're enrolled.",
"Very easy to navigate and allows me to access everything I need, from scheduling to test results to communicating with my providers. Having everything in one place is great.",
"The app doesn't show any bills at att. It says I owe nothing but they finally sent me an email back 7 months later saying I owe over $5,500. They need to make sure that people are doing their jobs right but they can't. I will be contacting my attorney about this huge problem. I will also be looking for a new doctor elsewhere and leaving Ascension.",
"Features are usable and convenient. Everything you need to know at your fingertips. Really like how you can send non urgent messages, check balances due and see results.",
"I used the Same phone, that I used in my visit to Bellevue. However My Chart keeps telling me that I cannot login What a flawed app I use a standard Android phone . Both with a cell phone plan with a major provider. The company that sells This app does a great job ,of sales. And a poor job of integration with other data bases",
"Current in house! For such a large facility that the wifi is so touch and go! My last three visits it's been hard for me to video with my family. For some patients this may be there only way to see out of town relatives. For the most part I like the upgrades and I haven't had the problem other's have had! I hope that wifi will be addressed at some point! Not sure about adds yet...ok, I see the adds, I've seen 3-4 adds while waiting for them to stop channel 58 hln.. forensic files... 0300-0315",
"Great app, with some short commings. Would be nice to be able to update procedures, meds, etc that were performed by non MyChart providers. My personal chart is always behind, not up to date and no way to correct.",
"I've had MyChart for close over 10 years but recently, in the last 3 years, this App has gotten noticably Worse! It's confusing and irritating most of the time. Plus to make it worse, I've had all my information leaked or cyber scammed on more than 3 different occasions and that's Scary to me. Right Now, on the App, I'm not able to find any of medical history information or any of my previous doctors or anything. That's Not Good but what other options do I have!?",
"MyChart is wonderful for so many reasons. Checking in to appointments ahead of time is very helpful and saves time. Records are easily accessible, and you can look at what the doctor noted, when your appointments and procedures were and more. Test results are posted on MyChart, so if I am waiting for something important I know right away (and then the doctor calls to explain the results). Making payments is so fast and easy on MyChart too!",
"This is a great idea. It's nice to be able to view your medical records. Only problem is, they're in Doctor speak, so I have no idea what it means. The other thing I find curious, is that no one mentions or explains what it means to me when my results are not in the normal range. Few doctors talk to you at all, much less explain issues that might have come up in testing. Or what I could or should do to correct them. UPDATE: Very limited app. still disappointed.",
A great resource but more often than not when I try to log in with biomedical i get a message saying there was a change to your saved biometric. Please log in and re-enable biometrics. So frustrating!,
"Love it! Convenient, easy to use and the ability to give my husband access is wonderful! As a parent, it is super helpful to have access to my sons records. Can pull shot records, or whatever is needed, anytime I need it.",
Very handy having my medical history instantly accessable. I appreciate the features of being able to see lab results immediately as well. I would seriously recommend this to any and every one.,
"This app gives patients a unique and valuable service. I keep appointments and providers straight for multiple people using MyChart. I'm able to access test results, double check locations, meds, instructions and more. One of my most valuable apps.",
"I never had any app as useful as MyChart to stay in touch with my health care. From visits, test results, reports from each doctor, list of your medications, plus a message system for questions you may have. I would strongly recommend signing up for this app.",
"I LOVE MyChart! It's easy to navigate, keeps your medical info at your fingertips, and has most medical providers utilizing the EPIC program so multiple hospital systems are all in one place and you can allow your doctors to communicate and share your results. If it's offered, I highly recommend to take advantage of this free app.",
"It seems IMPOSSIBLE to get from one screen to another sometimes. The ""How to use"" video shows a back button that is non existence on most screens. This app needs to be more user friendly.",
"Difficult. Confusing I went into Phoenix, Oregon branch and staff helped me to sign up. Now, I have to sign up for MORE information you need. You make everything impossible and complicated: Access codes, biometric sign up, 2 step verifications. I hate it. I am mentally unable to use this new technology...I am old, live alone, no family, and Isolated. I hate this system. NOW I can't figure out how to access my own account. My user code and password should be enough to access my own account.",
"This app is great. It lets you do everything you need to do with out calling someone. Can order meds, make appointments, cancel appointment,see test results quickly, see you past history, send msg to you health team and many more things.",
"During my previous employment, I added a person to my chart. I have repeatedly requested that the additional person be deleted from my chart as she is not related to me. I have not been able to get her removed and I no longer work for that Organization. I continue to receive communication about the added person despite contacting help twice for this problem.",
it would be nice if I didn't have to sign into every single hospital location individually and it would also be nice if my chart and epic you know communicated with each other between organizations instead of just being a giant roadblock in my health care I don't want to have to put in a password I don't care if someone sees my medical record it should be your choice. or at the very least you should get more than two attempts at opening it with a fingerprint before it deletes the fingerprint,
"This has helped me get and stay in touch with my doctor better than I ever did on my own. I am able to see results for tests that I always stress about even when there is no reason to worry which has eliminated so much anxiety. Could not recommend using MyChart more, it's been fantastic.",
"It really is good, it's just that l get a reminder 3-4 times a week! One reminder is plenty. Also it has u go through the whole thing, when nothing has changed. Thanks, Deb",
On point. Everything you need at your finger tips . This app keeps you up to date with upcoming and past visit. Helps you locate urgent care close by and virtual doctors visit depending on the situation you may be having. I'm so glad that MyChart is available 24hours a day for my family and me. Give it a try . Trust me it worth it . Keep track of meds and med management. Refill request to doctor.,
"The app is terrible, I can never pay co-pays on it or sign documents. The location settings don't ever seem to work. The clinics and hospitals who partner with this app don't seem to be pushing to make it better.",
"Finally they worked the kinks out and it is wonderful. I have everything medically in one place, and now the site works great. I used to have a hard time getting into MyChart, but whatever they did with the update is perfect. The ease of using this is now patient friendly.",
"To me it's just so far away from the experience I want from my doctor. I get times are changing but you should be able to have to to explain things to me on the phone , if you have time to type all that out you have time to call. I find it useful for some stuff, but mostly just feels like another way to just push you off.",
Most time when trying to view something I keep getting a message saying an error has occurred please try again later. HIGHLY ANNOYING. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but the same thing keeps happening.,
"Getting worse. My last review was three stars, now it's so unfunctional I can't use it at all. My main reason for having it is the messaging function and access to records, but just keep being met with ""server error"".",
Generally easy to us. It can get a bit complicated for non routine scheduling. It reminds me of appointments and delivers after vist summaries without visiting the main web site. I use the wed site for appointments most of the time . It's a good tool to have on my phone to access current medications information .,
I like the convenience of having easy access to my medical history and doctors' notes in one place. I was using the web browser based system but prefer the app for the layout. Thanks for a great tool!,
"I think this app is great, however I feel that it should be expanded to include the other hospitals in the Ottawa area instead of having to look them up in another application. Some information is outdated such as COVID vaccinations and flu shots.",
Doesn't have the option to print you messages or test results. It only will let you screen shot or save as PDF file. I don't have enough memory on my phone for those options.,
"Hi everyone,this app is so convenient especially if you contact your Dr and what not. Downside is if you have tests to do tests you should be able to have the option of scheduling your appointment with out having to call customer service and wait on the phone for a long while or even having to call the referral department if one of your test requests expires..other than that I enjoy using this app. Thank you",
"It's great to use but you can't make appointments, they NEVER RESPOND TO A REQUEST. You're outta luck to get a doctor to respond to a question or request, it's like it was never written to them. Basically it's only good for personal use not to stay on top of things like appointment, conversation ECT.",
Great app for keeping track of medical information. Recently my friend had a family member have an emergency and the information was updating faster than the doctor could inform them. This caused a panic. I would recommend having emercency medicine updating after a set amount of time.,
When I first started using the app it was awesome. Here lately when I attempt to access my messages I get a server error and to try again later to no avail. Less than ideal having to using a browser when you have an app.,
My only sugghestion is when there is something new posted a marker is given on the icon showing the number of new posts. That is good. Better is to also show a new posting indicater in the main menu on each of the threads where new postings happened like new posting to messages would have an indication on the icon. As I get use to the system ill have more to say. So far it is good.,
"I love being able to contact Dr.'s, e-check in, pay, and have my medical records in the palm of my hands when and if I need it! Being able to link accounts together and keep the information available to whomever I am seeing keeps me from butchering whatever medical information I need to tell another provider. The convenience of these apps is amazing!",
"Very easy to use, covers everything from booking appointments to paying your bills, even offers customizable payment options, and you don't have to spend forever waiting on hold to get results/answers, xfinity needs to copy this blueprint for their services",
"My Chart is amazing! I enrolled in the program when I lived in Hawaii. A nurse told me about it. She connected me. I could see all my lab results, upcoming appointments, and everything that was important for me to see. I moved to California and was able to connect to My Chart here. I can message my Dr's. Also, receive important messages. Everyone should be connected to My Chart.",
"Great companion app for healthcare. Haven't had any issues with it. Schedule, message your team, script refills, etc... It does a lot and you don't even have to talk to anyone.",
"MyChart is a GREAT resource that's VERY user-friendly. It offers options to chat with your doctors, which is one of my favorite features!! You can request medication refills and view notes from your visits. It gives an ALL inclusive feel and viewpoint into your personal medical care...",
"MyChart is by far the most convoluted mobile med app ever. Healow is compact and graphics more pleasing to the eye. And, much more easier to navigate than MyChart. I don't need all of my med info linked and shared with other Epic institutions. I choose who and what info to share my medical info with.",
"I use this app to schedule doctor appointments. It allows you to view all of your medical information from visits to your primary care physician, specialists and trips to the ER. You can use the medical dictionary, ask questions and watch learning videos. There are so many features I can't list them all. I would recommend this app if it's available through your doctors.",
"Too many glitches. My primary care physician doesn't show up as someone I can message, I spoke to tech support and they say it's a known glitch; sitting here in waiting room , other patients said this app sux and they don't use it. It's too frustrating. Poor customer service in terms of tech support",
"This system is absolutely amazing. I love being able to get on at any point in time to access all upcoming and previous appointments, and being able to message my care team. This is just an all around wonderful setup.",
Fantastic to see all your health care and scrips and medical history and doctors and shot records all in one easy to use app. Love it. And able to send texts to your doctor and get responses is great. Also has pre registration and many more uses. They can email all your meds to your email too.,
This app DOES NOT send me an alert for any new appointments OR new messages. At present it expects me to check the app every so often and does not send me an alert of any kind. As a result I almost missed my admission for surgery. Please improve this app so it sends me an email or phone alert every time I have a new message.,
"New to 'my chart' I was repeatedly told to sign-up, but was hesitant because I pretty 'old school' and was concerned about navigating it and having confusion. Seems great so far.",
"I like being able to see my test results, but I'm disappointed that the blood pressure read and weight check that was done during my visit is not reflected for that visit. Also, the follow-up appointment I made is not showing. It shouldn't say ""no future appointments,"" when in fact I do have an appointment scheduled.",
"Ok app. Needs work. Requested errors be removed 2 yrs ago but keep popping up. Says Im wheelchair dependant. Im not. Never have been. Showed up on chart 2 days ago. Dont want vaccine reminders. Cant remove. Dont want vaccines, reminders are spam. Way too much reliance on AI. My last visit has several errors but cant remove. Wrong primary physician. Not wheelchair dependant. Not having weakness. No way to correct this in app. App needs to do better. Im looking elsewhere. Too many mistakes!",
"Adorable graphics, clunky and slow, but I'm glad to have it. Now, all I need is my medical professionals to call me instead of using messages, because I get the notifications, too late. 😶‍🌫️",
It makes it easy to read your own test results and appointment reminder and days and times as long as your Dr are using my charts. Easy to navigate. I love it. Easy to use.,
"In today's world of communications, MyChart blends perfect with all my devices and allows me access to my medical information with ease. I also benefit from communicating with providers directly through the app. It's a world easier for everyone!",
1. It takes forever to buffer. 2. When finished buffering only a blank page shows. 3. Test results show hours after discharge from hospital. 4. The update did not help the blank pages from appearing.,
"This is so helpful. It helps me keep up with my appointments and medications. It has all my medical information at my fingertips. It also allows me to communicate with my Dr if I have any concerns that are not urgent, but need to be addressed without making an appointment. Any necessary documents such as insurance card or test results can be accessed thru My Chart as well. Thank You, My Chart Team at Auburn Multi Care.",
I find the MyChart app very useful to monitor my personal medical info. It is great to get test results from blood work back speedy fast. It's great for getting appointments setup and questions about health issues resolved very quickly. Thanks much for having this app available to me.,
"Tough to access. Never stays logged in so you always need to have a verification code sent to your email. Code will take 5 or 10 minutes to arrive, so if you want to or need to access your chart promptly, forget about it. No idea why it takes so long for this app to send an email but it's a little ridiculous.",
Its alittle difficult to navigate through the app. I supposedly had an appointment with a MD and didnt even know about it. Could be easier to find messages instead of them being in two or three different places,
"Highly recommend it. It keeps everything in one neat app. You can fill out your information for upcoming visits. You can message your doctor, see test results, pay your bills, reschedule appointments, all from the app.",
I always have issues with receiving email messages. They dont go thru so my email address can never be verified and i dont know why. This has caused me to have to call the office and reset my account on several occasions because i cannot access the app to login. Can this ussue be fixed or not.,
User friendly and definitely helps to complete things in a more timely and efficient manner. Love the feature that allows me to also give access to my husband in the event anything happens.,
This app is definitely great to have especially since I see many different doctors. I get my results quickly as well as it alerts me to any upcoming appointments n I can also communicate with my doctors offices through messages using MyChart. This app is definitely a must have and if you don't already have it I say wholly get it.,
"I love the My Chart app! It's amazing! Can see upcoming appointments, past appointments, test results, phone conversations, list of medications, and more. Very user friendly!",
"The only thing that bugs me is when you see a number alerting me that I have a message waiting for me after I sign in. Ok... I've signed on.. then I start looking for my message. The HUNT is on! Unfortunately, 50% of the time, I look and look without any luck. So I just go on down the road and hope I'll 'run into' something accidentally. With 'MyChart' id getting close to being a great site now. It won't be long before they'll be hanging their coats on the 'Perfection Hook' in the Hall",
"I have multiple specialist in completely different groups but can see the appointments, results, and messages from each in one app. Thank you for helping me keep track of it all here.",
"Hardly ever works to schedule or see stuff on phone. Epic needs to put some serious effort into making the app have less bugs. When it works it is nice, but that hardly happens.",
"As someone who is not technically savvy, this app has made a big difference in my ability to keep track of all the requirements for my upcoming surgery and treatment for my bladder cancer. While my condition can be overwhelming, this app keeps me informed on what has been done, what is upcoming, and what I need to do, and keeps all the important information at my fingertips.",
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE This app is okay IF IT WORKS IF YOU CAN LOGIN WITHOUT HAVING TO CALL SIT ON HOLD FOREVER WOST RAN APP EVER. Every other time I try and login it wont let me and i call SIT ON HOLD AT LEAST AN HOUR NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF DAY I CALL. THEN ITS TRANSFERS AT LEAST 30MIN MORE. WE DO THIS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND THEY NEVER SAY WHAT THE REASON IS. They keep reports from issue calls. Right hand doesn't seem to know what the left is doing. They secure our medical records.🤯🤬🤬,
"1. For the patient, the ability to link My Chart to access all content of care by previous and current Medical Providers is extremely helpful for retrieving Medical Record documentation. 2. As a retired nurse in an IT trainer role - EPIC is the most efficient EMR system I have ever used. Integrated data in a User-friendly navigation is incredibly valuable to clinicians.",
"This is the best app. It is so informational. Anything you want to know about your health, your appointments. A complete history of your medical. You can also see all your test results at the same time the Dr gets them. Very user friendly. Can add all your Drs so they can have access to your test results. reminds you of all vaccinations you need. Love the fact that any info you need is at your fingertips. No waiting on the phone for the next available. Can request and download your records to.",
"This ap is a wonderful method of correspondence with your provider(s). It's so easy and convenient to use anytime! You can see any test result the minute they are done evaluating them, they send you a notification at that time, sometimes before your dr has even seen them. Highly urge everyone to use this!",
"I really like that I can see the chart notes the Dr writes, plus get test results quickly. I get quick messages to and from the medical staff. Also, I can make appointments without all the time spent on the auto portion of the call.",
"I really like except for 1) Can't message all my specialists if I have an issue as I have 9 ortho & other specialists, 2) getting in touch with IT has not been helpful at all for my issues, 3) there needs to be more reasons one can choose or area to put in reason for canceling, 4) due to my conditions & extent of my conditions can not put them all in again IT told me to do my best well having had cancers & breaking my neck & spine & other conditions that is not an OK answer!",
"My first review was a little bit of review on the whole health insurance steaming dumpster fire that it currently is. I suppose this app, having to exist in the afor mentioned fire, isn't that terrible. You do have to invest the time and effort to get efficient with the app so you don't have a total meltdown at your worst medical moment's . Myself guilty of such. If your Dr. or specialist uses the app you probably should too.",
Awesome app. The hardship is having 3 sources and they do not sync data. So all 3 tell me various things the other charts say are done. Which is the accurate is hard to decipher,
"It has screenshoot option you have to allow it on setting and the app is a Great way to see medical records for the entire family members I really enjoy using it easy way to schedule appointment, review well checks, you can also precheck in by the app 🙂",
"This app continously times out with the message ""an error has occurred on the server"". This happens no matter where I'm at, even inside the hospital. It also creates appointments when no appointments have been made. It's annoying and reflects on Henry Ford Hospital.",
"Best app for your healthcare. Easy access for patients and I love the ability to contact your provider. Much, much more simpler than having to call in and never be assisted or directed to the dept you need.",
"I really like my chart , wish all my doctors would use this. Its the easiest to work with, see appointments coming up, get reports, lab results and even message Dr if have questions about any labs or test results. I haven't given 5 stars because its all fairly new to me and I like to try longer before just jumping to 5 stars.",
"MyChart is an amazing app that makes things so much easier between patient and doctors. You can check your test results, book appointments, message your doctors, and look up all your medical records. It also offers you the option to share your records with a family member or a clinic that you go to. Saves everyone a lot of time and you can see your test results almost the same day with having to go see. You doctor. It's works with multiple different hospitals.",
"Ok I'm pretty sure I gave this app a 5 star review previously. But I would like to give it a 10☆ now. After being able to review past medical tests, I found one from 2019 that I didn't remember having, and my Dr retired right after. Turns out I have a 5.6cm left complex cyst may be ovarian. Noone ever went over results w/me due to me having back surgery,constantly falling,& that covid crisis. If I had NOT been able to go over my past records... I let you know the outcome, going for new test.",
"I absolutely love MyChart! It is so convenient and easy to use! I always have my information very quickly after my appointments, and that's great! I would recommend MyChart for everyone to use who has doctor's appointments and test results!",
I really love the convenience of the app and the ability to message my doc! Only issue is about 70% of the time it won't let me view my messages and comes up error.,
"This app has been very helpful for after visit summaries, appointment reminders, messages and questions. It is also an easy to navigate app and keeps all my records, doctors etc... In one place. I'm very thankful for this app!",
"Stop telling me that I have upcoming prenatal appointments when I've had a miscarriage. I canceled these appointments, please stop these reminders from appearing on the app. Edit: If I canceled the appointments, and my provider knows I canceled them, then they're canceled. I shouldn't have to contact a health insurance rep and tell them I had a miscarriage.",
I love being able to see test results. Being able to schedule appointments and contacting my providers is a big plus. Being able to schedule our appointments is an awesome feature.,
"This app is fantastic! When I had cancer, I found out 5 days or so before I could get an appointment with the Dr. He apologized, and made sure everything worked speedily and properly as someone would wish from then on! Other tests I can go back on by reading reports when I can't remember what was discussed with the doctor previously.",
"I'm not sure if it's the app or Samaritan doctor's or nurses playing doctor. But 8 out of 10 times sending a message about needing my prescription refilled, I eventually ended up having to call in because they haven't responded or refilled my prescription for blood pressure medication that I have been taking for better than 10 years. And I end up running out.",
"I am appreciative that my appointments, test results etc are at my fingertips. I have been seeing other Health providers and unfortunately I'm unable to message my PCP with updates. I thought this feature was provided previously.",
"It's great to see all blood tests and all other tests with reports right away! If I have a question for my Dr, all I have to do is ask! He answers wherever he may be! I can send pictures, example of wounds! I can't say enough good things about Epic!",
"Today, I am completely unable to log in. I keep getting error messages. I am unable to reset my password or username or perform any other action. I wish the error message would be able to say if the server was down. I can't imagine what else it would be. I was able to log in yesterday. Most of the time I have no problem.",
My chart app is very informative. I love it! The only thing is there should be a option to change the profile picture. I don't know where they came up with this Pic but I don't like it. You could of got a 5 star with this option.,
"My experience with this app has been great. I love the fact that I don't have to try to remember things, or write them down. It's all right there for you to see. Tak to a Dr., meds, and other important medical related things. I wish other things were as easy as this app.",
It's an easy way to set appointments and get all the info you need. Just missing a fast messaging option for better text communication.,
I love this app. I've had 3 kids & have used this app the whole time while going to my obgyn to keep up with my pregnancy each time. Also this app is good for messaging my doctors if I have any questions or problems with anything. They usually reply pretty quick too. Like kr i said before.. I love this app!,
Horrible app that never works rebooted my phone several times & still can't retrieve important messages just keeps saying error occurred & won't work never had trouble with any apps & as much as I do with this app please fix these problems!!!,
"This service is excellent. Results, letters, messages, are all passed through quickly giving you time to review and if necessary contact for further information. I find it extremely helpful.",
"Great. I can check in,see doctors notes,even surgery notes. I like being aware of what's going on with my body. This is a big help. Especially for this lengthy rehab process . I can also have all my different hospitals and doctors linked on here for easy access.",
Progressive! I've used MyChart and the App for 5 years. The one aspect that I appreciate is being able to link several medical systems and hospitals within the app and have all my medical in one place. It does take some time to setup and it's worth it.,
"I love this app!! Best app for health care in my opinion. Sometimes it does weird loading glitches but that's due to my wifi and not the app. You can't screenshot in the app which is WOW! THANK YOU! even tho sometimes I need info my doctor said put into my phone, but that's okay! I recommend this app! 👌 NO ADS SO FAR!",
"Great app except the biometrics aren't working. Requires a security code by text or email every time you sign in with biometrics, which pretty much negates the usefulness of biometrics. And, often the text doesn't come.",
"I like how easy it is to switch organizations and link accounts. I'm always traveling and having a multiagency app to manage all my healthcare needs in one place is really helpful. Thank you devs, for doing a really good job with this app",
"It is not as good as other health record apps. The one for Southlake Hospital in Newmarket, for instance, shows you all written reports from doctors involved in your care. This app only really lets you view blood test results.",
"The app is dependable and mostly intuitive. It makes communication with my doctor and medical support team very easy. It's much preferred to the old model of playing phone tag or waiting all day or days for replies. As a Retiree on Medicare, I wish the Home Health Agencies would use MyChart.",
I really like I can communicate with providers for simple questions. Having the ability to view appointments as well as test results just in case you forgot something it's right there.,
I absolutely love this app it's of very importance to Me. It helps when you don't bring all medicines to doctors appointments it helps when you have test done so I can also see results and ask questions if need be. I absolutely like this app I have access to my health fill.,
Should be able to change your profile picture within the app but I don't think it's an option. Had my profile picture taken during an appointment and didn't know the picture was being taken. When asked an office can they Change it I was told no... just self checked in and it gave me an option to change my picture,
"Mostly use it for my 6 month old. Being able to view notes from his visit, test results, and being able to message his doctor's whenever is a HUGE deal. Any time I have concerns or questions, I'm able to send a message and get a response usually no l later than a day.",
This is supposed to be an updated version of the app for Intgeris & Me but I honestly prefer the other app. Nothing is loading and when it does it takes way too long. Also now I can't schedule am appointment through the app anymore. It's not better at all.,
It can be informative. But it's not all that easy to use. But then a lot of the new apps are like that. A lot of them seem like they're developed by first year community college students that didn't do real well in their web design class. 😔,
I absolutely love MyChart. All my information is in one place and it's easy to access. And they've added more features. Like linking to out of network(Bayhealth) sites/doctor's.,
"I love having ""My Chart"" available to me!! I can get test results faster, and I can read notes from my doctors appointments after wards, and it's much easier to communicate by email to my doctor!! Love the App!!",
"I love this. Easy to use. I can see my test results. Make a payment if needed. Request refills on my script, check up coming appointments. I signed up my husband and my sister. Its better than a 20 minute phone call. Makes my life easier!",
MyChart app alway seems to have something wrong with it. From not loading to showing server error when trying to eCheck-In. When contacting support its always same answer we will look into it. I deleted it.,
"Copy to clipboard disallowed which makes it much harder to discuss my medical problems with other medical providers. Need to be able to attach any file in any format to messages. In line virus / malware screening not that hard. Problems with mychart because of arbitrary and bad decisions, presumably by development team or their management. Development team can contact me to discuss.",
Honestly the app is convenient and helpful but the overall operating system of the app is terrible. I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to function correctly.,
"I just started using the program to give my blood pressure online. It seems to be working well in my doctor is receiving the information. Too soon to give a five star rating. My Chart is over all a good app. Although slow at times, it does what it is supposed to do.",
More complicated than previous. Have to switch to different things I've phone or computer to access information. Does not help those who are not computer literate.,
"It sometimes will alert you on appoints and other times it goes silent. It then will alert you 50 times about something and go completely silent for days. I have checked the alerts and setting in my Pixel but seems the app does, what the app wants",
"I am chronically ill with lupus and this app makes it very easy for me to stay in contact with my doctors and specialists. You're able to see your lab results , you can schedule, cancer and even look to see when your appointments are, it also keeps track of all the medications Ian case you ever forget. It makes it super easy to stay in contact",
I cannot imagine going back to managing my medical needs without this app. One effective and efficient way to communicate with all my providers across multiple agencies. Cannot recommend this enough!,
"Very helpful. I like being able to pull up reports easily and seeing exactly what the doctor said we needed to do moving forward. Sometimes in the moment, you don't catch everything and this is a great backup. You also know every appointment time to be sure you or your child don't miss anything.",
Well...... I'm not up to par with technology so it took me a minute to figure it out. Once I learned how to utilize MyChart it's all very simple to access for any of your patient/doctor information. What's best is there is no wait time! Love it!!!,
"Overall, I think this app is truly awesome! Great interface & simple enough for all 'Walks-Of-Lives' to navigate. I only have 1 issue and I'm not sure of it's relevant to the Devs or if it's within the hospital(s). I added my 16yr old to my MyChart account as any parent would. He had a virtual appt, and had to sign in with my credentials. He could see all of my personal information. I reached out for help but it still wasn't clear as to what or if there's another way to do this separately.",
"Works great!! Makes it easier and really convenient to keep up with everything ie: bills, test results, upcoming appointments, etc.",
"I recently relocated from North Carolina to Delaware. Having the ability to gain access to my medical records using MyChart was a humongous blessing. No calling NC to find out when my last check-up was or my last test results were, is an AMAZING thing!!! Thank you MyChart. Best and most useful app ever!!!!!",
"So thankful for this incredible, highly functional, FREE app. This is a legit public service. It has every scrap of information (Dr notes & summaries, tests & results, diagnosis, incidents,etc.) from all doctors I've ever seen, if they use MyChart, and all in one place. Freaking amazing! THANK YOU!",
"First of all, Norton's is an excellent organization to be with. All of my doctors I see are very appointment accurate. there is very little waiting... And every time I have blood labs or any other type of tests turning my health, I receive relusts within 40 minutes of my visit with the doctor. Every single bit of information you need concerning your medical history......easy and instant to find. You do not have MyChart, you are missing out on the medical health history made easy",
This app is great. It does all the basic things you'll need. It just keeps getting better. I live in 2 states like many of us retired people. I'm also lucky enough to have both of my medical teams on this app. I can keep track of all my medical items in one place and easily share them with the 2 teams.,
"I really like this new my chart, it shows you on a colored scale and I like that. If possible keep going with this idea ,it's very helpful.",
Love making appointments or leaving messages instead of calling. It's so easy to seen when you had lqb or x-rays done all with results. It's easy to use. Don't ever change it,
I like the fact that I can access my healthcare information from anywhere at anytime. If my memory of what the doctor said isn't clear I can just access my report and read it. Only complaint is that the app. seems to be running slow and is so right now as I'm trying to leave this review. Hopefully it will get better. If not I hear patience is a good thing to practice. It's all worth the wait. Thank you!,
"The easiest and fastest way to communicate with your PC and refill requests. Easy to navigate and get test results quickly. Appointment check-ins, scheduling, or questions in general can all be done using the app. Also, you can link specialists to get access to labs, demographics, and reminders for annual exams.",
I tried to get my letters the program just keep circling around and going back to the beginning does not ever show me the letter that I requested to see. Then when it says what she has ordered for the next test I click on that and it just goes right back to where it's at the beginning it does not ever show me the letter or what she wants done.,
"Getting onto MyChart was difficult. However, with help from FCN I was able to get established. I truly like the ability to retrieve information . And I have a clearer idea of my health status.",
"The way that this app helps bridge the ""inclusion gap"" between the physician's and the patients. I'm speaking from an (EPIC Systems-patient's standpoint) helped me understand exactly what I was dealing with! In turn I have been fortunate enough to recover my ability to walk... The app provides their patients with the actual notes from your doctor's, your current upcoming appointments, messages from your care team, and test results, billing, coberage, E. O. L. Planning. And much more. No images!",
"""An error has occurred ..."" is an oh-too-familiar message I get when attempting to read messages, book appointments, etc. We used to have MyCare which worked beautifully. This MyChart is virtually useless.",
"Its an amzingly comprehensive app. Has all the different hospitals, doctors and pharmacies. It's crazy the ammount of stuff you can do with this. Super helpful if you want a quick refill or message your doctor or test results.",
"I love having MyChart. All of my medical info from all 3 hospitals in one place. I can find all my info very easily. From meds, to appts., to all my test results. Which I especially need with having Cancer. This was the best app they could have invented!",
"This is an exceptional personal medical info app. And when you move to a different state, you can easily switch accounts as long as they use the Epic system. Leave msgs for doctors, schedule apts... it's awesome.",
Does ok on the majority if tasks but forget reading test results. File format isn't compatible with any reader and you have to export from app to look at which makes it less secure.,
"The app is good. It's nice to know what is being put in your record. I find that the degree of doctor patient caring and confidentiality is no longer a priority. The app just verifies my intuition as to my degree of care, and to that, I am not pleased.",
"Very important app that retains all your medical issues and plans... All basic information .. Medications, visits past present up coming. Request appointments make appointments...reach your doctor for help, your care team, end of life paperwork, summaries of visits ...bills..procedures, reminders test results...it does it all and easy to use...I am thankful for this 💖 This is a great app to have Everyone needs an appointment like this",
You are able to become more apart of your health care and play the part you need to in order to feel better about yourself. The tools are at your finger tips it's not perfect it's a start in becoming a better system toward improving our health care! Thank You?...,
"Everything you need to know about your results, keeping track and making appts. so easy and check-in a snap. I feel like I'd be lost without this app. now.",
My chart through Trinity Health has been by far an awesome and easy way to convinently keep in contact with my childs health care professionals and his health. This app is easy to navigate and offers a lot of security and comfort to our home because of it. Thank you,
It's a shame Dr's get to pick and choose which test are put on my chart .what good is it if we can't see the whole picture!...very disappointing and makes me distrust the whole system.,
"I love this app!! Helps me to keep up with all my appointments and tests as well as allowing me to get checked in for my appointment before I arrive. I'm also able to message my Dr anytime I have a question or concern, and so far they seem to respond in a very timely fashion which I really appreciate!",
Changed to the new version now I can't compose and send messages. Schedule appointments or anything. Very frustrating. I might as well not have the app.,
"Love it! Very user friendly. I can order records and have them available for download within the hour. I can make appointments with my primary, and schedule urgent care televisits. All information pertaining to my health is at my fingertips.",
"I use MyChart to schedule appointments, ask questions from my providers, ask for refill of prescriptions, and communicate back and for if I have questions. I also get test results that I can view in the app. I have not had any issues. The app works great for me.",
Poor layout. I receive a notification of a new message but then trying to locate which section it is in is nigh on impossible to the point that sometimes I have never found it. I use it because I have to rather than I want to...,
Absolutely love this app. It makes keeping up with appts and medications a snap. So much more available by using the app from paying co-pays to completing pwork etc. The list goes on and on. Would highly recommend getting the app and learning how to use it.,
"Functional, but app is stuck in 00s. Has unreasonable restrictions on message body length and attachment size that makes it excruciatingly nightmarish to share an out of network test result with ur pcp. File must be PDF or jpg, must be (smaller than average size of medical image file), can't copy paste text more than 2k chars (img reports are 5k). Imagine u are a senior? Forget it",
"Takes a minute to navigate, but once it gets familiar, it's easy. I like that you can request prescription refills. Hard to schedule appts, like mammogram.",
The app doesn't work well.I can hardly ever get through to messages or medications there is always a problem. It's nearly useless. When it works it is great but who knows when that is.,
I love this app. I can do everything and then some that I used to have to do with a phone call and sometimes be on hold or be transferred several times. I get my answers quickly and thoroughly and I know that I am not wasting my provider's time with a problem they did not need an appointment. I wish I had this 20 years ago.,
"I greatly appreciate this app , I can contact my Dr or a nurse at my Drs clinic directly. I can see the results of my lab test within 48 hours after testing , sometimes within 24 hours. The control you have when making your appointment's is great. This app simplifies making your appointments , changing or canceling yr appointment, getting test results back quickly, allows you direct contact with your Dr , check in for yr appt prior to getting to yr Dr. office. It really is a great app !",
"I love this app, but recently been having problems with it. It won't take my biometrics, it just closes itself. I'm having trouble signing into one of the hospital sites. Was there an update I missed or something glitching?",
"All your test results at a fingures touch. message your docs if needed, automatically syncs appts w your callander, tells you about meds prescribed, easy to use.... I've found it very helpful...",
"I love my chart, I really wish all doctors had it, it allows doctors to collaborate and see what your medications actually are, which is a huge safety advantage in my opinion. It also interfaces to Google calendar really well and I assume the other calendars as well",
This makes my healthcare so much easier. It keeps me in contact with my doctors and makes scheduling appointments and seeing results form labs and tests so much easier. It also saves a TON of paper!,
"MyChart has made my life so much easier especially moving from one state to another. Being able to link my accounts and get my records over to my new doctor alleviated a lot of stress from the transition. It also great to be able to view all my past medical history, appointments and medications in one place. Highly recommended!",
"Found results quick and informative, but came a bit too early, before i had seen consultant for biopsy results, which stressed me out a bit , and someone a bit confused would have a problem i think. But apart from that, a quick service . Yours sincerely, mary smethurst.",
"I really appreciate the my chart app ,it helps keep you in the knowing of health records of yourself by a quick & easily opening of the my chart app ! 😁👍 say goodbye waiting on hold do to many callers calling in to ask for personal medical questions keeping the front desk of reseptshionest busy & say hello to this wonderful app called my chart where you have control over refills, scheduling appointments, asking questions, and much more if your not already using my chart you should 😁👍",
"It's useful when it works...which is not often. Just tried to check in for my appointment and got kicked out of the app five times in a row before I gave up. It's up to date, my phones up to date, etc...",
"I really like this app I have one issue and that's with find a doctor its options aren't very many and like u can't find a hematologist , thyroid doc, different ones like this and if u can I am sorry but I didn't HV any other options , then general, cardio, and just 2more and that was it ..and ok another thing my county and another have same medical name ex, BABTIST HEALTH AND I ALWAYS GET REFERRAL TO THAT PARTICULAR ONE , WELL OTHER HOSPITALS ARE JUST AS CAPABLE, BUT NEVER REFURED ..THAT GROUP",
"I like the program. It's very comprehensive. I would add a dashboard for the family appointments and add back the icon for the appointments list instead of the ""add appointment"" icon.",
I love using MyChart. Everything you need to know concerning your medications and doctor's notes is at your fingertips. You never have to wonder about anything and you can communicate with your doctor or nurse through the messaging system. I absolutely LOVE it!!!!!!,
"Some aspects work really well, like seeing future appointments. Frustrating: not all care providers with whom I have appointments appear in list of providers - why? Limits appt request ability. Medications do not get updated even after review at visits, discontinued meds continue to be listed in medication lists of some providers, cautions about meds prescribed by one (rheumatologist) end up listed in after visit summary of a non-relevant doctor (ophthalmologist). No refill request status info.",
My chart is constantly senting me messages that I have a new message on the site when there are none showing! When showing appointments it would be helpful if it included all the appointment info and preparations needed for the appointment.,
"Cannot use copy,paste for passwords. Password app like 1password does not work. I keep having to change passwords to log in. Cant use copy paste for 2fa for code from sms. Logging in to multiple providers has multiple problems. Contacted you before on Issues with biometric login..only one org works, if it works at all. It is getting worse over time.",
I love the myChart app. My doctor's office moved to my Chart and so far it has been easy to use and very informative when looking at my overall health and understanding my test results.,
It's fast and easy and it shows everything you have had done. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't have a place to show them that if you been out of work for 3yrs and can't go back for a while. How do they expect you to pay your bills. Unless you have $ but I was living from paycheck to paycheck.,
"Great app for all my medical stuff. Don't have to wait until I see the doctor for test results, has all my tests that I need to have done and by what date, if I have a question about anything I can ask and I usually get an answer that day or the next, and it has all my referrals and the date they're scheduled. For me it's been a great app! 8⁠-⁠)",
I really like that MyChart let's you view your test and lab results quickly. I find it fairly easy to navigate and find what you're looking for.,
"Site is ok. But icon on desk top says I have 3 notices or something. I go to Mychart and have no idea what the 3 things are. The problem I am having is that I can get in, but the site sends a code go to get it come back and that part is gone to enter it. Then I am in regular site",
"I don't think my medical professionals should communicate with me through an app. It is an overwhelming size and too easy to not receive the needed messages. If the office called me I would know the information, not have to keep looking for it.",
Amazing app. So easy to use. The communication with my care team is amazing. And the ability to see all my records in one place is priceless.,
"I love that I can link most of my doctor's in a complete summary database, I have several unique immune disorders and several other diseases that have arrived due to medication due effects, so I have serval doctors. Due to the economy, some of doctors have left their practices, retired without informing their patients. I don't like to change doctors, due to this I have had to change doctors and with some 1-1.5 hrs away. With. Multiple Sclerosis, Addison's Disease, Type 2 Diabetes this app is VIP",
"MyChart is a great tool for tracking your health, medications, and communicating with your medical professionals. You can have virtual visits, update prescriptions, make appointments, and ask questions. This app is AWESOME!",
"If I would have reviewed the app six months ago I would have given three stars, but with the updates, everything has got so much easier, especially rescheduling appointments. I give it five out of five stars.",
Easy to use...perfect answer for all patients...keeps medical records digitally and organized in one spot for quick and easy access...to the patient AND the doctor(s).,
Enjoy using this app for me and my daughter. Makes our lives so easy to ask our doctors questions and make payments. However sometimes there are glitches and certain areas of our doctors office aren't able to apply their appointments.,
"I like the fact that everything is at your fingertips. Easy to send messages to your Dr, and get messages back from the Dr. Keeping up with your appointments is a snap as well. Updating your info is easy on the app. Love love love this app.",
Mychart is absolutely great to use . It is easy and let's you communicate very fast and easy . You are way ahead of all your needs by using this app . Thanks Mychart!!,
"Your Dr. is able to manipulate what they want you to see and not see. It's called My Chart however it's not yours. It's only what your Dr. wants you to see. Test results can be posted for you to see and your Dr has the ability to remove them so you can't. So results can be there one minute and gone the next. That makes it ""Their Chart"" not yours! They could possibly be removed before you even know that they are there.",
"My experience with this app has been totally phenomenal! There is an issue with some clinics not updating the information you give them but as an app it works so well with all of your ""stuff"" right there. You can even link other hospitals you've been seen/ treated at so less room for error everyone on your carteam is on the same page. Password reset isn't as complicated as I thought it would be. It makes scheduling appointments a breeze with reminders built in that will send an email.",
"Very helpful and useful app. You can schedule/cancel appointments, refill prescriptions, and make payments. Easy to navigate through.",
"Very difficult to use. Does not pick up past information, perhaps lost during recent upgrade of your system. Thus previous tests, vaccinations and allergies are missing Just trying to sign up for a shot. Can't do so. No guidance or help to figure out why the option is not available.",
"It's a bit confusing to use at first, but once I started just randomly clicking buttons, I got the hang of it, haha. The customer service people are very nice as well. Easy on the app and web browser!",
"Love love love this app! It's imperative for my overall health since my breast cancer diagnosis April 2021. This app contains all of my records in one place and all of the different hospitals, IU Health, Reid Health, Tri Health and Eskanazi Hospital. I am still visiting all of them and I have only ONE app that controls and contains all of my medical needs and the message options are outstanding and such a time saver!!! Stress reduction is a huge blessing! All of my doctor's share my info as well",
"I love the app, it makes it extremely easy to message my doctors, schedule appointments and get medication refills. It makes keeping up with all my doctors a lot easier...",
This is truly an awesome way of communicating potentially virtual information with the patients. I Love it and give it a thumbs up and would suggest or recommend it to everyone that has a need to know what's going on with their health status according to their lab results.,
"It's working really well!! I can see next appointments etc. My community doctors need to add their names to my file so they show up. The app shows all blood work and scans etc. But no old information. Also, they should add my immunization records.",
"Awesome App. Quick response time, records easily accessible as well as reference library. Very user friendly. Even for an old lady!",
"It's taken a while to navigate the changes re: UH vs. CCF. Now that the two are consolidated under one My Chart, it's been so useful.",
"I'm not sure what happened with the latest update but when I try to schedule an appointment in the app with my provider now, it says there are NO providers in my area even though my provider is listed in my info and I have been seeing her for 20 years.",
I like the app which the hospital I talk to are pretty quick in responding. I wish there was a way to print or download your labs in the app. I wish all the departments and adding at least Nurse PA instead of selecting the doctor all the time for the hospital were on there as well.,
"Please fix the app. It keeps telling me a problem with the system occurred. I can get In the app, but can't retrieve the information, due to the error I keep receiving.",
"While I like having all my info in one app, it's very unintuitive, especially if you want to switch organizations. One time, it shows on top, and the next time, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom. How about some consistency? It should be easy to find, either right up top or in the menu, not buried under everything.",
"With this app I can communicate with my doctor, see test results and do early check-in for appointments. I've never said this in a review before but I love this app!!! There are no ads shown inside the app.",
"Actually accessing test results, visit summaries, and messaging to providers is nearly impossible. I am constantly getting the message, ""An error has occurred on the server. Please try again later."" I see the error message literally more often than the actual information I am trying to access. This app is junk and a huge waste of time, and its website is equally awful, yet the three medical facilities I use insist on using it.",
"I absolutely love this app because I can see my lab reports, x-ray reports, doctors visits and notes as well as schedule appointments and/or send messages to my care team and refill medications. Able to pay my co-pay and check in when I arrive for my appointment. An absolute gem to have.",
"Mychart used to work phenomenally. The past month or so, I've been having problems making appointments or viewing messages. When I try, I get a spinning loading screen and after a minute or so, it says an error on the server has occured and to try again later. I try again later to no avail.",
"Happy with app. Although it's helpful to have the option to save appointment to calendar, it only saves date, time, consultant name & the phone number of the clinic. It would be more helpful if it copied over the clinic address too, as if it is a large hospital complex, it has outpatient departments & clinics spread over a large area on different floors & sometimes buildings. I've found out that the app won't let me copy & paste the clinic address details either. Apart from that it's a good app.",
How you have 4 star plus ratings and reviews I don't know ?... I am new to it and not used to 16 fancy digit passwords... and such a hard form to feel inn for forgotton login I suggest you need to consider people with learning and even mental health problems Id so not suggest this too anyone... you have none in hospital who can help me learn or understand and i cant seem to delete or reset..... -1 star from me hate it !!!,
"Nearly every time I get a notice of a message, new lab results, or appointment reminder on MyChart ... I open the app. Click on the new message, reminder or result, it spins for a while, the says, ""Error:, Try again later."". It sucks and needs to be fixed, as I depend on the app for contact with all of my cate providers.",
"I love being able to see test results in a super timely manner. I now have 8 notifications. I open messages, test results and appointments, etc. There are no numbers on each of the buttons for each topic to see. Is it possible to rectify this situation? It's annoying to see notifications for things I've already looked at. Thank you for this opportunity to express my feelings.",
So bug issues with this app. It is always crashing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled too many times to count. This is very frustrating.,
Love this app. Easy to use. Works with multiple hospitals. Love I can see all appointments and where in one location. All medical jnfo is kept but privacy security is in place.,
It's extremely easy to use. There are many hospital districts on it. I moved from North Central Texas to East Texas and was able to access both districts and share information quickly.,
"I really like getting lab results as soon as they are available. I like the summary of visits and the ease of requesting most refills. When in the ER, I don't have to wait to see lab work until the doctor comes back in, so I know what I'm dealing with quicker.",
"Mychart is great in theory but most of the time, I can't get into parts of it without getting an error message and it's frustrating. I tried to do the e-check in and it sent me back to the main page. It Happens often when I try to check messages, schedule appointments, or review test results. It's extremely frustrating.",
While it works mostly for managing myself and a child it is a prime example of the annoyance of pop-up technology. 1 or 2 weeks before an appointment e check reminder is ridiculous. Dr. Sends a doc no direct link. Constantly loses bio metrics and resetting is a pain. And your pop-ups draw over and interfere with other apps such as a music player. It's all technical issues,
"I would be TOTALLY and medically lost without MyChart! This app covers absolutely everything I need. I can schedule appointments, see what appointments I have coming up, add them effortlessly to my calendar, send & receive messages to my providers, see test results... honestly, the list goes on and on! You really would have to see for yourself to appreciate it as much as I do.",
"Makes everything convenient and simple. Love being able to set appointments, get info, etc without having to call and/or wait until the medical teams are open.",
"No easy way to share information from the chart. Simply printing a list can be blocked unless I change the platform from the tablet app to a desktop browser version. Often can't find the same information twice ---- the detailed views are there somewhere, it's just not clear how to get back to them.",
"Messages from scheduling or provider do not give alerts when there are messages in the app. If your provider uses this, be sure to tell them to also follow up with calls, as when trying to get a procedure scheduled, you will not get notified of new messages. It forces you to set up reminders in your calendar to consistently open the app daily to get your messages. If you're like me and don't have that kind of time, you miss the window for the booking of the appointment.",
"MyChart provides all of the essential information I need to help me maintain my health. Appointments are extremely easy to manage, especially being able to send them directly to my calendar. My medications are all listed for easy reference. Thank you.",
"This app will periodically send multiple messages in the middle of the night. When I open the app, I can't tell if there's a new message or if it's bugging me to get the same old pneumonia vaccine that I've already had. I can't seem to dismiss it. Also, not directly mychart's fault, my healthcare org changes staff frequently, and doesn't let me know who my primary physician might be. The app might be just fine, but it doesn't do that much for me. I've been healthy, knock wood, so I don't ac",
"Amazing! Have all the information you need where ever you go for your medical care. List of meds, notes from your providers, test results, scheduling, contacting your providers. I think all medical providers ought to use this excellent app!!! Makes contact easy for you and your provider. You don't have to remember everything, it's at the touch of your phone!",
"Completely useless. TFA will not work via SMS. Request to disable will not work. I would be satisfied only using biometrics to authenticate. When you're forced to get into after using email, home screen appears and trying to use anything from the text menu or GUI causes the app to think, then nothing happens. This used to be a great app, until several months ago. At this point, it's just taking up space on my phone.",
"Fantastic. I love this app so much more than the competing health app in my area follow my health. With MyChart I can actually contact my doctors without picking up a phone. As someone who is a major introvert and doesn't like calling doctors' offices, I love this feature. And my test results are all in one convenient place. I highly recommend this.",
"After years of dealing with another system, this one seems a lot more organized, easy to navigate and make changes if need be and leave messages for my provider's, amongst other thing's. I believe they are working to make things more readily available for us and make checking into our appointments faster, which in turn helps the provider's if there has been any changes from the last time being seen.",
"I only finally signed up for My Chart so I could check on past tests, etc. I don't like using it. I call for appointments. I prefer real letters, pH calls and/ or leave messages, texts are ok. No, I don't like it,press things by guess. You can take it away as far as I'm concerned. I'd rather have paper copy of tests. I'm old and like it the old way.",
Easy to use and up to date. I have been using this app for 3yrs now and I have never had an issue. I really like the lab results are ready and visable within a very short time.,
"It works great for access to your health records, but if you need to schedule an appointment or anything else, you're much better off calling because they don't respond to the messages that are sent through the app very often, which is definitely inconvenient. Otherwise it is a wonderful tool to be able to keep track of your health, appointments, and overall well-being!",
"This is rubbish compared to patient view, which has closed. On patient view I could see results from other hospitals not just Manchester. Plus on Patient View I could view past results on the one page. Unfortunately there is no option to this useless app.",
"I performed the setup configuration for automated check-in using my phone. I arrived for the appointment and it never gave me that option, REQUIRING ME TO USE THE KIOSK TO CHECK IN! Why offer a function that either you can't support, or that you choose not to?",
"The app is only listing a handful of clinics in OR and WA as options for scheduling appointments. I'm in NY and there's a clinic in my town, but it says there are none within 50 miles. There's no obvious setting that would affect or change this, and no ""help"" option that I can find. So I'm leaving a review and hopefully this issue will be seen and addressed. Two stars because I'm able to get my test results without any issues. But the app is useless for making appointments at this time.",
"I'm oh so tired of having to verify with a code sent to my phone or email EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to log in. Doesn't matter if I check the box to skip it next time or not it makes me go through the verification process again and again a nd again and again.... I used to like the app and I still need it to carry on with my continuing care. I have a chronic condition that will ultimately kill me, so I use the app a lot. But I really dislike it these days.",
"My Chart is a good application. however, the appointment scheduling system at the Sansum Clinic is out of control. It is impossible to schedule an appointment. Phone calls are not answered, long hold time, no returned calls or no appointments are available for 2 months. Call back in 2 months. This is a ridiculous system.",
Everything is pretty good except the ability to change username if there is a mistake. Since it uses your email address as a username in the event one enters in the data incorrectly one cannot correct it without having to contact support which is a pain sometimes. Other than that the app works in itself very well. Just the providers need work at checking messages and updated health record requests. Yeah also having trouble with logging on certain devices but yes I know I have to call to fix it.,
"It has some good points as being able to message Dr, seeing OV, test results and meds. The billing part won't let you select which bills you want to pay. I'm not going to pay one which is wrong. You have to call for that. It's convenient when bills are correct.",
Overall the experience has been good except that I have set up biometrics SEVERAL times and it only works for certain medical systems! I have checked with each medical system individually and they can find no issue as to why biometrics gets turned off. Very frustrating to have to enter your password EVERY time!,
"I really enjoy this app and the consolidation of information that it allows. I wish all of my health providers used MyChart, which would make it easier for me to access all of my appointment info, test results, etc. within one app. I find the app very helpful, easy to use, and convenient.",
"This site is a nightmare to use. It is definitely not user friendly. It's like somebody with attention deficit created the app,its all over the place. Difficult to find things and very unorganized. If your doctor posts a message to you the app will send you MULTIPLE announcements. Difficult to delete messages after u have read them. Usually have to end up calling the office to confirm or double check things anyway because site can be unreliable.",
"Wonderful App! I absolutely love how easy it is to keep track of my medical information in one place. The appointment information is thorough, and my test results are available. It has been very useful when visiting doctors who need to see test results but aren't with MyChart. There are no ads, and it's very user-friendly.",
"The MyChart app is the best and the most convenient, quickest way for requesting medication refills when due. The wait time is sometimes not even a day. The doctor and the nursing staff are outstanding! Using MyChart is easy to use and the best way to stay on top of your medical reviews, history, appointments, medications, and much more!",
"Everything is right there. All upcoming appointments, and past appointments w/ after visit notes, all x-rays, and test results. You can receive and send messages with your doctor, ask for refills, even pay your bill. It's so very convenient!!!",
"The app is wonderful. You can set up appointments, communicate with doctors, refill meds, and see test results all in one. You don't have to call and be put on hold. The communication turnaround is great within 24 hours. Don't ever get of this app. It helps patients and doctors communicate.",
"MyChart is one of my favorite apps! Seriously, this app is a lifesaver in so many ways! It helps save so much time and has changed the way doctors and patients communicate by opening an extremely easy way of navigating and understanding one's entire medical history to us.",
"MyChart is supposed to make requesting refills for maintenance medications simple. Well, my experience has been miserable. This is now the third time I've run out of blood pressure medications because the refill request won't work for me. I don't wait until the last minute; I've been working on this for 10 days now. It shouldn't be this difficult. Some functions are simple, I appreciate that see my chart, and message my healthcare team. But the prescription refill issue is so frustrating.",
"Good medical management app. Allows for messaging directly to scheduling and care providers. Front page is really busy and should be re-designed. That said, I just click and read maybe 3 messages and I know what is going on. If you are over 60, get it and learn to use it. It will make your medical life easier.",
"Scheduled online annual appointment using this app with an available new doctor near me, as I moved away from my original provider's (wakemed only) location. Everything was seamless and nice and then got a call. Apparently I can't do that it seems. App is not reliable. Moving out of this mess.",
Definitely like the app. If not for this app there would be no way for me to keep organized track of everything I have going on medically. It's been a really nice tool for scheduling and communicating with my doctor's. I've uploaded all of my legal documents that might be necessary for medical reasons so I know that no matter which hospital or doctor I see they will have access to that information immediately. Anyone I choose can keep current on everything through this app.,
"I depend on MyChart both on my phone and on my PC. It's easy to use, user friendly, and helps get answers to my medical questions and refill requests. There is a slight learning curve but I find it easy to navigate once you learn how.",
"My chart is very useful by has certain faults. Pros: quick was to see your test results. Easy to make dr. appointments. Excellent for remembering appointments. Cons: too much information. You see results that you have no idea the meaning. I recieved my results on a Friday night with a few red colored results. We googled and found them to be dangerous. On Monday, after a stressful weekend, I called the doctor and was told that it's no big deal with my history. Not well thought out.",
"MyChart is a good app for tracking your medical appointments, medications, appointment check-ins, etc. My only complaint is that I often see a notification that I'm to take some action, and I have to check what action I'm supposed to take. It would be great if the app indicated ""you have a doctor message"" or ""check your medications."" Other than that, it's a good app.",
"It makes it a LOT easier to communicate with my doctor, schedule an appointment, view test results and request refills. Highly recommend, I use it often. You can also add other doctors and facilities, even ones out of state.",
"Works great! Easy and efficient way to see all medical in one place. Look at all records, lab reports and account balances. Letters to and from physicians are easy and efficient. All pre-op and post-op instructions can be seen, and contact with medical staff is easy. Check into appointments as well from the app.",
"Always easy to use, great layout, I love the ""asking questions"" option, response is quick (according to your doc maybe) great accesss to everything past present and upcoming needed details and their always there to review again. Easy to show family etc... I recommend it if your wondering.",
"Hard to use, doesn't seem to work most of the time. For example, I made an x-ray appointment. Then when I logged back in later the appointment was gone and had to redo it. Then again the next day the appointment had been removed or it not saved and had to redo it again.. I think the AP is a bad joke",
"A great tool! There's so many things I can connect with in the different departments of my clinic and hospital. For e. g., my health care provider, an online nurse if need be, the lab, even billing. My health records, medications and test results are all at my fingertips. I can keep track of any future tests and appointments. Also like being able to send messages to my doctor's office and receiving helpful responses. Had this for years and still glad My Chart is available to me and my husband!!",
"I wish all providers had this app, or a version of it. It's easy to use, easily accessible, send easy to understand. You can schedule appointments, view test results, and message the Dr directly. What's not to love!",
"Absolutely the best! Provides a convenient way to stay in touch and get information I need from my PCP and healthcare team of specialists, no trouble with bugs or hangs, All I need to help my health stay on track. Quick access to Appointments, messages, test results communication with my physicians also making telappointments.",
"Twice now, I've had an""outstanding balance"" that I should have (IMO) received an Email or txt to notify me about as I don't check MyChart very frequently. The first one went to a Collection Agent before I knew about it! App allows you to input your Contact Info, it should be used.",
"My chart has been a lifesaver for me. So nice to have everything in one place. To see your labs B4 the doctors do, lol, kind of cool. Being able to make appointments and having reminders, to talk to and work things out with the wonderful crew in the billing, they go out of their way. I love being able to see the doctors notes after an appointment, as you do not always catch everything while in the office. I love the communication that you can do with your nurse or doctor through the non-urgent a",
"The app seems to work great. Lots of information. It may be my Dr's office, but it lists the option to cancel, and then it prompts you to call. As an introvert, I just want it canceled without calling.",
"My Chart was easily accessed by a third party who changed my records. Removed all the tests I.e MRIS Cat scans and all other important medical documentation. In addition, the comments and after notes were altered. If it weren't for my digging in all forms did I find the information who had ordered the tests. I'm being treated for vertigo. There are parts of doctors notes missing. Some one found a backdoor to your medical record system. Your program is NOT SECURE",
This app used to work great no problems with anything loading or signing in but now it rarely loads I can rarely sign in messages don't load visits don't load I have to close out the app several times in order to even log in. I don't know what's happening over the last two months but this app went from being great to barely working right like ever,
"Pretty easy to use. Doesn't exactly explain medical terms where average people can understand. The notifications: You can't tell what exactly it is addressing, so I'm not sure if I got it or are missing something. The check-in never works. You have to do it AGAIN when you arrive. The billing situation is ridiculous. Never matches my insurance co-pay that's right on my card. Lastly, why aren't we able to address a specific person or know who in the office sees ""mychart ""?",
I really like it. You can't forget an appt because it reminds you. I like being advised that an appointment has been set up. I get it immediately and can adjust my schedule way ahead instead of being notified by mail or my Dr's office calling me when they get time. All the info is there.,
"Game changer for medical experience. I spent a couple of days in the Marin hospital after a bike crash and this app helped me understand what was coming next and show me what just happened. X-rays available 15 minutes after a scheduled visit to my room. I've paid most of the bills using the app. Digital health has taken a long time to catch up to the rest of the digital world, but my chart is a big leap forward.",
"I had been very happy with this app, until opening it recently to find I can no longer chart or graph past results for a given test. The ability to easily compare results over time was a very useful feature. ¿What happened? Is this a temporary glitch? Please restore it now!",
"I am very pleased with this MyChart app. All my appointments, messages and treatments across all the different hospitals i am attending appear on there. I find that follow up appointments appear on there by the time I get home. It is also visible to all the different clinics and my GP as well. I did have some problems when MyMFT was introduced last year because I was missed in the changeover. Eventually sorted out and now is excellent.",
"Overall I really like the app, BUT one of the best features, the ability to take a picture and upload your insurance card DOES NOT work. This size limit for the picture is so low that whenever you try to upload the image it says it is too big. The same thing applies for uploading attacments. As a result these great features that do not work are worthless. Don't you do any real world quality assurance testing? You need t fix this BUG.",
"Usually a good app but right now whenever I try and view anything after I'm logged in it doesn't show anything but this text: ""This is a marker file generated by the precompilation tool, and should not be deleted!"" Even the website on the browser does this. Help!",
"I find My Chart to be very useful. I would like it to have the option of a dark background, like many other apps have nowadays, but other than that, it's a great app and easy to navigate around.",
I love being able to see the notes my doctors leave after I visit and having access to everything right from my app. My husband is downloading it right now. It is very easy to navigate and understand.,
It's awesome I absolutely love it except for the fact that it don't keep you logged in and you have to get a code every time to log in. It's easy to use and the physicians are very prompt and fast responding to my messages.,
super easy to confirm appointments. you can send messages to any doctor in the system and ask questions request medication refills or request an appointment. works very well and a great way to remember appointments by allowing your calander to remind you with an alert.,
"I've used MyChart for several years, it is very helpful. It's easy to look up my account for billing info, test results and to ask a quick question to my provider. I appreciate the app. Thank you",
I like being able to talk to my doctor and the nurses about issues without having to go in or call. As long as it's something that I can wait for the answer for. It's actually very convenient for me. And they're always great about getting back ASAP. I understand there are other patients I think that's why it works for me. I can still continue on with my life while I'm waiting for them to contact me back.,
"So far I'm very pleased with the system. All improvements you did to the MyChart made a big positive difference. Everywhere I go, I experienced friendly people and professional treatments. Keep up good work.",
"Easy to use. Very efficient for busy parents. I am able to make appointments, request refils, read and send messages to the doctor, and so much more, all in the app!",
"I use this chart several times a week, if not every day. I forget the appointment dates and look them up. Where they are and witch doctor it is. This is soooo handy once you get to know how to use it, it's easy,,try it you'll like it..,...... Thank you....",
Awesome app to use between medical providers. Great to keep track of appointments and lab work. Easy way to communicate between doctors and providers.,
I find it very difficult to know what lab work or tests need to done. New vommuniis difficult also. Really need phone calls for those of who are not on the phone often!!!!,
It keeps singing me out Especially when you are talking to your Doctor All so it very slow as well when you click your page I feel like given 2 stars due to there is still bugs to be fixed. Don't give up kno,
"This app is very convenient. User friendly. Shows everything about your medical history, previous appts, upcoming appts, doctor's summaries, and referrals submitted. You can email your doctor and also make doctor's appts through the app.",
"Very good app, I like how I can receive test results and message doctors from it. My only complaint is that it would be a little easier to navigate.",
"Great way to keep in touch with my care providers, lab results, and visit results. The messaging is great instead of relying on leaving telephone messages and playing phone tag.",
"Love this app. Makes it so easy to see my information all in once place. Additionally, my healthcare network is excellent with updates so it's so easy to find everything I need.",
App and pages will only load half the time. That's if I actually get it to load the first time. Tryed loading off cellular network and off wifi. Nothing works,
"Love this app. It updates child's records, meds, appointments, messages dr leaves and it's a direct line to the drs office. Faster way of communicating rather then waiting hours on the phone.",
"App is glitchy I can't do video visits as Dr cuts camera off, she says it's glitchy on her side, not an app that should be used for video visits! Was great before but now terrible.",
Easy to use. I like being able to pull up test results quickly and being able to communicate with my PCP via the message function.,
"It's super easy to make appointments, view test results, and get refills. Makes my life much easier.",
Inconsistent. Records just disappear. Some doctors don't respond or use the features. Some offices managers get upset or rude when you try to point out what doesn't work right.,
"I really like that everything you need is at your finger tips. You can schedule/cancel appointments, check on results of tests, see what preventative needs have to be scheduled..like a mammogram, yearly check up, flu vaccine, blood tests, etc. Very informative. You can also email your doctor/NP/nurse that you most recently saw to ask a question you forgot to ask or clarification on a result from a test he/she ordered. And this information travels everywhere with you!!!",
This has helped me so much with remembering appointments and you can actually Contact your actual doctors and office's. You can see all your medical information and access results allot faster. While I've had covid this has been the best way to get ahold of my doctors without exposing anyone to covid.,
"Great for seeing what meds, shots, and making appointments but would be a better application if one could search for doctors, and health plan information instead of having to log into a different URL.",
"Very good experience, have no complaints what's so ever. Love the communication, easy access. Love the alerts I get to keep me informed.",
It is so convenient. I love the notification reminders I get about upcoming appointments. The ability to view Doctors notes and to get my lab results first had before I even get my phone calls,
It is really convenient to keep up on Appts and your health conditions and medication refills..also you can pre register for some procedures and close contact with your Dr's and nurses... I like the App and use it regularly,
My Chart is for doctors or nurses to read. It can't be for the average person because we do not know what anything means. It should have an explanation of your test results in lay people vocabulary.,
I very seldom can log in successfully. I can only add appointments to Google calendar by the app. Not my provider's the website. So very frustrating.,
"App is great keeps all my doctors, test, and medication organize. Also reminds me of coming up appointments and I'm able to check in with doctors when I arrive through app.",
"""My Chart"" has proven to greatly improve communication with my health care providers and l feel I'm kept more in the loop about my health. I would say telephone communication seems to have become a little more problematic with the advent of ""My Chart,"" however.",
"This app is the most efficient multitasking app ever. Whether you want an appointment, refill, check your immunization records, or simply ask your doctor a question. Great tool! 👍🏻 👍🏻",
I love this app!! I have alot of doctor and hospital visits and this app helps keep them in order. Plus you can pre register for your appointment and no waiting.,
"For some reason I'm unable to use the app for any correspondence with my doctor. As someone who doesn't get a chance to really stop working during the normal nine-to-five period, it sure would be nice to be able to use the app to communicate with my doctor.",
"It is very easy to maneuver on site and get to what you need access to. Also, echeck in saves time.",
"Keeps well-informed on all my appointments, test results, etc. It is also a great way to communicate with all my doctors and medical caregivers.",
"I really glad that this app was developed, because it gives me my appointment day and times. Easy to request my prescription refills and so much more! Thank you!",
MyChart is the best for keeping track of you appointments and medical records. I get the test results before the doctors do. Great for making appointments. Great app.,
"Great app. It's so nice to have all my health info in one spot. Oftentimes, my test results are ready and online before I even get home from the appointment.",
Well designed app for a wide variety of medical needs. Good for reviewing medical history and test results. Good for communication with medical staff.,
"Very, very much informative. It's fantastic. There are times when I forget my doctor's appointments. Upon checking my chart, I find it, along with all of my blood work and doctor visits.",
"Very clean interface and I love being able to see all of my appointments, medications, tests, and visits. Very convenient and easy to use.",
"I love having this one place to check all my medical needs. My appts, my test results, my billing, my vaccinations, my medication list, my messaging. All SSM doctors should use this. Very convenient.",
The best app out there runs smooth is so helpful it has everything and does what's it's supposed to ...user friendly and one of the best additions to Android and anyone's health regiment..thanks my chart !!,
"It is a great resource to patients to be able to interact with your care team and see your medical records,tests amd apts in one place.",
"To hard don't know if it's the right one, this was before now I think it is wonderfully put together. Some time i have trouble getting in between the two sight.",
"I love this app, easy to use. Getting messages from all my doctors is nice, this app is cool. Prescriptions straight from my doctor's thru the app is wonderful and easy to use.",
Ease of use most helpful compared to apps used by other facilities. Prescription refill has a section that requires unknown information and i end up messaging office for refills. Otherwise it is good.,
"Excellent tool for monitoring records, meds, appointments, etc. Works best on a laptop or tablet, mostly because of the amount of info displayed",
It excellent to use to view your records and communicate with your doctors. It's also nice that you can add people so they can keep up to date on your condition.,
This app is so convenient and reliable. It allows you to check anything that maybe upcoming. If you forgot something you can always go online and check with this app. Number one app to me,
Awesome App To Use. It's easy to utilize and access your appointments & medications. Still learning to play around and make appointments & talk with the doctor.,
Your records are there when you need. Helps promote proactively on your own health. And don't got to bug your doctor as much to see what is going on. Thank you.,
"I love the MyChart app, I got the information I needed, I could go back and check it anytime. It was clear and easy to understand, I was prepared for my surgery when it was done. Thank you very much....",
"I love getting my results within 24 hours of testing and getting able to keep in constant contact with my doctors by messages, scheduling appointments and ECT. This is amazing",
"Not intuitive, almost always having technical issues, only use because I'm forced to. Absolutely terrible product",
"So where to start, my personal experience has been very satisfying. From booking an appointment to seeing Dr. Webber or McGrail. They have addressed all of my concerns and or questions. I have grown to appreciate all they do. However, they are relocating to yet another site. This concerns me because Raleigh has become too congested.",
Using this app is SOOOO convenient! Very easy to use and to do all the paperwork ahead of time and setting up appointments. Love this app!,
"Great experience with this app. Easy to see my appointments, test results, and message my doctors without having to call. 👍",
"MyChart its a great app, I can see all my appointments at glance, so I dont forget any, also con reorder my meds, saw my test results and much more, its really a great tool to have",
Exceptional. Quick access to all medical records and medication. Easy appointment access. User friendly.,
"Great app!!! I get lab results quickly - some results arrive before I get a mile from the draw station! THANK YOU, My Chart!!",
"If it weren't for me having this app, i wouldn't know that cancer was found during a surgery that I had a few months ago. My surgeon, nor anyone else involved in my hospitalization told me....to this day!!! I went for my post-op appt. & the nurse I seen panicked when I asked her about it because she had no clue but was able to locate the scan that I had prior to surgery that showed the growth. smh. NO ONE WILL LOOK OUT FOR OR TAKE CARE OF YOU LIKE -YOU- CAN!!!",
Really pretty good. Easy to use. I love the ease of being able to reach out to my doctor. Requesting prescription refills is also super easy. I can schedule or cancel an appointment easily. The only negative thing is about what I can edit/delete to keep my chart current and up to date.,
This app works great! Now I no longer have to call and leave a message (I have anxiety). Quick response back from my doctor.,
"Love the app and all the features! Sometimes a little buggy with loading features, but overall great!",
"No way to pay outstanding balances! At the very least, the app could provide a payment site link. Major flaw in my opinion. Otherwise the app provides relevant information. Update: Payment options have been added! Thank you! 5 🌟",
"This app is a great way to communicate with all of the doctors who are involved with my health care. I can send any team a message with questions, submit requests to refill my prescriptions, and make or cancel appointments as necessary. It is much easier than making phone calls to do all those things.",
"Love this app. All your medical history, test results, bloodwork plus drs notes, everything is very easy to use. Very informing.",
"This does help with no calls to the Dr, and you can order scripts, and leave messages to Dr's. One thing I would change is, NOT put tests results on app until AFTER seeing the doctor, it's too worrisome to the patient if these are not explained by the professionals.",
This is a great app! It makes it easy to communicate with my heath care provider without having to go into the office. If I need to go in then I can easily schedule an appointment using the app.,
"Cannot communicate with Dr assistant. Their the ones who answer back. I understand that. When I need a refill thay always want to schedule an appointment. I live 3 hours away, not driving 3 hours during weekday to get a refill.",
"WITH THE AGE OF BEING ON LINE: MyChart always makes easy to know next appointment with which one of my doctors,time & dates. Check-in is so easy on phone when arrive.Lab results set right to me with the normal values for each. Appointments are easily made .Insurance abd bills is right there,you know how much you owe and how much you've paid .Recipes sent right to my phone .",
Great app for all your one stop shop health info. But doesn't always have the info available when you click on it. Says it's not available right now. If it went for this problem i would give it 5 stars,
Very easy to use never have an problems with it either also very convenient has all my upcoming appointments on there what shots I am due for and when really love this app and will definitely keep using it.,
"It's OK for looking up something. However, you can not print, make an appointment or fill in blanks. It will not allow putting an appointment on the calendar.",
MyChart is a wonderful and essential tool. It reduces a great deal of paperwork and allows for better sharing of medical information. Great app!!!,
"I've had no issues using this, and it's very informative and I get test results back as my Dr's get them. I can read reports, gain better knowledge and ask better questions when I see my Dr's.",
This helps me communicate and make appts. I have an excellent primary along with her staff and I feel it saves them time too instead of having to stop and take a call. Circle of good for all. Thank you for app,
It is very easy to use and provides access to information you would normally have to see your PCM to get. It also facilities easier check in since you can start check at home a few days before your visit. I am very pleased with the app.,
Hard to find items/mssgs. Seems like they slapped 10 capabilities into the app w/out any organization. Literally can't find a message from my doctor that I saw yesterday.,
Makes easy communication and scheduling. Keeps all records and tests available and organized. Love biometrics access ones less password and user name to forget.,
"Very useful app. Allows you to see all of the medications past and present, all appointments past and upcoming, and what was discussed with Dr. and / or Nurse. You can also communicate the same as txt or email with Dr. or Nurse through the app.",
I love this app. It's the best way to connect with my Dr. and to see all of my health issues from past to present. I can also order my prescriptions from the app and it doesn't take very long to get them filled! If you aren't using this app you don't know what you're missing.,
Great App. I can connect with my medical team across many networks. I can text with my doctors and medical facilities and see my test results in detail and so much more.,
I do not Recommend These types of Apps as A Form of Connecting for Professional Appointments Such as Dr Visits! I wasn't able to Connect with Medical Staff for Important Appointment because I had to Rely on this App!My Medical Dr Meets with me All the Time Since Pendemic Via Text and that's more Dependable than these Apps!,
Is hard to use. Someone made my login and is wrong. Went in the first time and and try a second time. Went in and saw the mistake. And Again can't get in. They use my email wrong. Need to reset it to the beginning.,
I appreciate the ability to see all of my diagnoses in one place. It is helpful to be able to track my medical history and see how my conditions have progressed over time. I also find it convenient to be able to leave a message for my doctor and receive a quick response.,
I love this app!! Very user friendly. Great and easy way to communicate with your providers. I really like I can access ALL my medical records and prescriptions.,
"Definitely love love this app!! Results get back ASAP, everyone is communicative, and it's very well organized and easy to locate what's needs to be seen. Thank you Beaumont hospitals, thank you MyChart❤️",
A little confusing at first especially when trying to personalize parts of the program.I did like the ability to create a passcode.,
I love this app not only for making and keeping track of appointments but also to find my musical information if I need to show another Dr. Or someone instead of going through the annoying process of trying to get all my medical records,
The app is fine. But charging to communicate q the health care team.is just another way for the facility to make more money. Soon they will probably be charging for inbound and outbound calls.,
"TERRIBLE. I've tried for hours to logon only to be given the exact same non functional message. I have no doubt about my password or my username, but I decided to logon to ""forgot username"" to see what would happen. Instead of being helped it just keeps taking me to the same page where it is about the legalese of the site. NATIONAL JEWISH HOSPITAL was a lot better off before using MyChart",
"I started using this app on the advice of my nephrologist. It is very easy to use, provides me with good information, and allows me to interact with my provider quite easily.",
I like the My Chart it's just that they send TOO many reminders for apps. I had 4 in one week. Then it has you go through the whole list again.,
"I like the app, but at least 3 to 4 times a week a push notification says I have a message, but when I go in the app there is nothing. Please do an update so this will stop.",
Amazing app. Having the ability to track everything health related is a game changer. App is fast and all health related info updates before I even see a doctor or nurse.,
I used to love this app. I have an android and did everything for my appointments on this app even messaging doctors. Now it won't log me in and the phone number says doesn't exist in my area. What did you do to this app fix it soon,
"Using the my chart, software simplifies the entire process of communipatient with the doctors and care staff period it is so easy to use without any instruction whatsoever. Everyone should consider using this software.",
I love using the my chart it is a great way to communicate with your doctors it is a great way to communicate especially when you have trouble talking or breathing so they understand what you're saying instead of the secretary trying to figure out words that you don't understand,
If you have several Drs who use MyChart you can't get all there reports or test results. I have many who has MyChart please fix this. Otherwise this is a good app. I can't seem to remove other health care clinics or apps.,
"I love this app, I can schedule, cancel, or reschedule appointments. Send messages to my doctors and get notifications of upcoming appointments.",
"I like this app, it helps me keep up with my appointments. I get my blood work quick and I can make my own appointments if I need to. It's getting better always room foe improvements.",
"MyChart is an excellent tool for checking your appointments, messages and test results from your doctor's and labs. It's also a good format for other doctors to view your progress.",
It is convenient and nice to be able to communicate with nurses and doctors on the spot. For example I had a rash and wasn't sure how to treat it so I sent in a picture to my Dr and right away she personally calling me and said to get to the er bc the red line I didn't see but she could was traveling up my leg. It was a brown recluse spider bite. Another time was another rash but she wasn't to concerned talked me through it what to use and it went away. I'm thankful for all my Parkview doctors.,
"Love my chart is easy to use, quick access to my doctor. Quick way to refill my prescriptions, but I can't say enough about my chart. If you are not using it, you need to start using it. Saves time, saves you a drive to Roanoke if you live a ways from your doctor.",
"I love the fact that it's so easy to navigate,not only in the app but from one organization to another. Being able to message your doctor is definitely a plus.",
"I like the app a lot... Helps me keep track of everything health wise.. all my doctor appointments, payments and notifications about need to do doctor visits.. I can see my test results and get in touch with my doctors.",
I love the easy access and information that app has to offer And I also love the way it keeps up with my medication and how much it cost I can also text the doctor and ask him for information when I need it They quickly apply Back It is a awesome app,
This app used to work great. Now it glitches constantly and is unusable. Anytime I click on an appointment to get more information the app shuts down. What happened?,
I have tried to verify my phone number a million times and it never works. Somebody at the office told me it doesn't work correctly. Please fix this - I'm tired of getting a message for something that can't be resolved!,
This is a great app! Cuts call wait frustration. If you have questions you get answers quickly. It's easy to set up and easy to sign in. LOVE IT,
I absolutely love this app. Everything I need to know from results to visits. Extremely beneficial to anyone with regular visits. A must have app.,
I have used this app ever since I found out about it it's super convenient to make appointments as well as speak to your physicians or care team. It is a great resource to have!,
"Love the ease of being able to view my medical charts, test results, and messaging my PCP as needed. I do wish it had the ability to allow me to change/update my username.",
"Personally love the app! Super user friendly and a great way to pay bills, message docs, see history, and the eCheck-in is awesome!",
"I have been to many different doctors, having to download sooo many different apps. MyChart is by far the best! I decided to only get care by medical professionals that use this app.",
"I really don't know what I would do without the MyChart App...Arranging doc visits, telehealth visits, etc...for the whole family!!..it's an amazing app and easy to keep health docs all in one app!!",
Such an informative and helpful app. Easy to use and test results are uploaded and ready to see so quickly. Absolutely the best app I've downloaded on my phone!,
"I have been using MyChart for a few years now and no issues! I can access all my medical records, email my care team and set up Zoom appts. Awesome app!",
This app has been so helpful. It is answered quickly. This is the best thing yall could have done to help patients. There are so many aspects to this app that are so beneficial and helpful. Thank you.,
"very friendly, just it would be more convenient if we could print all lab results in one place and one click.",
Crashes on appointments when trying to view details. Thanks for the email address. All that and they say they can't help me!!!,
I have been trying to access my test results for about 15 minutes. The little wheel just keeps spinning. This is poor performance. You say to speak with your doctor. It is impossible to speak with your doctor if you don't have a problem to discuss. This is not the first time I have had a problem with this app.,
I absolutely love MyChart app. I can make MD appointments and send messages to my Doc and always get an answer back that day or the next. I like that I can see test results also,
The ability to navigate thru My Chart is incredible. Also the security it offers is very reassuring.,
Easy to use.Separate categories to locate information at different sites is great! The sharing between MDs of the record keeps me from having to remember what I said.I think this app is great! Margo,
Nice to watch my appointments and results. But it usually crashes when I try to look at teat results or messages.,
"Very easy to use and navigate. Nice to know I can communicate to my doctors and request appointments, labs, medical records, etc.",
"It's ok ,I don't enjoy getting notifications about appointments that don't apply to me. I wish there was a way to choose the notifications I receive.",
"Very helpful with connecting with my med team. Fast availability of tests, reminders of appointments and the ability to quickly connecting with your provider.",
Excellent experience with being able to view test results and view appointments. App is easy to use and very useful,
"This app helps me greatly. I'm finally staying on top of my health and making communication with my providers a priority. I attribute my health improving to this app, truly.",
It's much easier to use than all the other ones. I can look at tests I have taken before I see the doctor so I can ask any question on what was said in my chart. I love it and can understand everything.,
"Frustrating , it's always something with this app , there's always a error with the server , how is someone suppose to view there information ??? SMH !!",
"I love having access to all my medical information. Recently, a medical facility accessed my information, and it was very helpful to them.",
The lab functionality does not work properly. It gets stuck on the most recent lab and it does not allow you to see others.,
"I don't like having to do the same questions over and over for different doctors. Especially in the same week or month. Things don't change that much or that often. I think 1 and done should do it, and maybe 2 times a year.",
"It's incredibly frustrating that through the updates, the app has completely deleted my information, and there is no way to access and login to your account without going through each organization and logging in. The unfortunate thing is that even with that login, it still does not show my history. This is supposed to be my main connection to MY medical records. Each doctors office has recommended this app to use. This is MY information that should be easily accessible. Just disappointing.",
It's the best app I've ever used. It keeps all my medical information right in the chart. You can message with you Dr. You can view tests results within the next day and the Dr. Will go over them with you without needing to come into the office. It's keeps track of all your upcoming appointments and it let's you go ahead and fill out and paperwork before your appointments so you're not having to waste time in the Dr. Office making it faster for you to be seen and in and out faster. So much more,
As long as I've had the spp it does not pull my documentation from all offices connected with the KU products! Tired of having to switch from KU KC offices to the Topeka Csmpuses and offices in my area. Please clean your app up and make user friendly!,
Horrible. Can't get into my account. Won't accept user name or password. Spent at least two hours trying to access my health info with no success.,
"I love that I can message my doctor about any health issues I may be having. I love that I'm able to view all test results. If there are any issues, I can see all the information needed for me.",
"This thing works great. Appointments, lab and test results right in the palm of your hand sometimes before your provider gets them!.",
I love using the app to check information from past/future visits and to schedule appointments. It's very easy to use!,
"It is nice to be able to check test results , keep track of appointments, communicate with your doctor. A very useful app and easy to use",
Absolutely love this app. It's so easy to speak with the doctor and staff and also schedule appointments with ease.,
"When the icon has a little number, indicating I have a message, that should starred or something to be able to see what the message is. Then afterwards go away.",
"Really appreciate how quickly I receive test results and the ease of making appointments. Also, messages are replied to in a timely manner.",
Love the app! Very user friendly. Able to use the app to complete requests instead of having to make phone calls.,
"I love this app. It makes remembering appointments, and check in a breeze, and most of all being able to communicate directly with my provider. It's invaluable! Bill pay feature is nice, too.",
"It is an invaluable tool. As someone who has had cancer. It kept my appointments, messages, surgeon, nurses, and other Dr's like my ENT all on the same page with my care and medication. They were all able to access my medical information without having to go pick up films, or wait for the information to be sent by fax, email, USPS, FedEx, or however they send/ receive information according to their company policy and gov't regulations. I wholeheartedly recommend using this to stay organized.",
"Generally good. Provides some health information and interfaces well with mobile calendar. I hate that it kicks me out of being able to sign in with my fingerprint after just one miss, though. It just deletes that capability completely until I re-register. Even my banks give me more of a break than that.",
"Overall a good app, but not without it's issues. Loses passcode with each update. This is less beneficial than web interface. Paperless billing fails to download requested documents. Web interface more consistent, but so is postal service. Good scheduling feature.",
"Absolutely much easier and everything's in one place. No more multiple phone#. You save time not waiting on hold. Your whole family's info in one place it secure. You may leave messages, cancel, reschedule order medication, labs even more with the new update. Your doctors office will be happy to help set it up if needed. Busy doctor can help you faster and it's easier for them too².I love my physician he's GOOD and busy so when he knows what I need ahead of time it helps.",
I enjoy using the app for checking into my appointment. I can check in from home and when I arrive I can use my phone to let the staff know I have arrived bypassing the Kiosk that everyone else touches .,
My Chart has made it easy for me to get in touch with my Doctor and keep track of my meds refill as well as my appointments. The easiest way to get after visit information.,
"I appreciate being able to review test results, make apts, get reminders of tests due. I can receive and send messages to my Dr. It's a must have app. Thank y'all.",
"Works for the basics, but I'd like the option to pick from ANY doctor at my clinic, not just the last one I saw. I'd also like be able to schedule for VIDEO visits. Lastly, I'd like to be able to download the EXACT paperwork given at the end of an appointment; the current summations are too complex, making it difficult to find specific info.",
I love this app instead of calling to get refill or make an appointment or message on the phone that take a long time I can do it here in just seconds. Love it,
It's a great app haven't had any problems so far. I'm going to watch some videos so I can further understand it. Not get back to folks,
Enjoy having my medical record with me but seems to be less user friendly than it was before update. Important info is buried and hard to find.,
"I love how easy it is to use. Schedule appointments, request med refills or even talk with providers. Love this!!!",
"Absolutely an essential tool to manage your Healthcare, access all interventions review test results and measure outcomes. Please download and UTILIZE this powerful tool providing the patient access to all your points in care, interventions, outcomes, medications, doctor notes, health summary reports, data trends and more. I have no affiliation with this app. I'm a patient with complex health issues who decided to take control of my care, and participate and accountability with my careteam.",
"My Chart is an excellent way for a patient to communicate with their Healthcare team. My PCP responds usually within 24 hours and it is much easier than trying to get answers from calling the office. As a Healthcare provider myself, it would be nice to be able to access information about my patient such as results of tests, but currently only the patient has access to their My Chart account.",
"Dropped a star since I can't tell if a statement that's shown, is it old or new? Our fantastic healthcare surprise billing doesn't help, but if MyChart could help by showing a statement has been read would be useful, especially since everything is going (thankfully) paperless",
For the most part the app works well. I have an issue with medication list. I have to maintain a list for each organization. Why not have a single list of medications that can be shared by all organizations I give authorization to.,
"EPIC is a control freak. They won't even let you take a screenshot of your own EMR. I use an old phone to take photos. They're so dumb. When you try to reply to a message rec'd from your provider, the original message is not shown. So you need to be a genius to remember what was said in the message. They lapse the emails, so the Reply button is disabled. I guarantee one of their PMs will say it's all HIPAA, and that their hands are tied. What a bull. It's just their way of monopolizing the markt",
"The best thing to ever happen to health care! You get fast info on test results, a schedule for appointments, and the check-in feature avoids all of that redundant crazy paperwork! Bravo MyChart!",
Absolutely Useless How does a company introduce a platform that they say will be very helpful and convenient to the patient and staff (all lies) and when you try to sign in for a teleheath appointment the system will not allow u to move forward until you fill in your entire medical history. #entire. I don't get paid to enter information that is already in the hospital's possession. #NotMe,
"Took a bit for me to navigate , but I love this App. All my Info for appointments is there, along with results. Super quick turn around. Highly recommended for use",
Great app for me! Being able to see test/xray results quickly. Being able to message with my Dr has saved me alot of phone/waiting for return calls time. Being able to read the doctors notes about me is the best!,
The my chart is very simple to Access and get all your results before the doctors come back in the room... But it would be nice if it could be easier to understand what the doctors are talking about...,
Great app to see appointments and owed balances. It can be a touch tricky to set up accounts at times but overall it's a great app.,
I am not happy with it. I plan to contact my medical office to clean it up. My notifications are also not working. Don't know why changes have to be made to something that was successful. I would appreciate hands off.,
"I really like the convenience of the app, I don't really have a bad thing to say about it, it's not something that I'm gitty over, but it is a very nice app to have, your have everything at your fingertips. Really good app, is definitely recommended! Edit : I still love this app, but there are times that I can't read letters, or messages, other than that I don't have a bad thing to say! :D",
"I keep getting notifications to log in for an updated appointment that's now available, but when I do, there's nothing there. It's happened at least five times in a row now. This is bothersome. Otherwise, the app is fine.",
"There are far too many reminders given for each appointment, making it very confusing for patients because it seems like we have far more appointments scheduled than we actually do. One reminder is sufficient.",
"Having all my medical stuff in one place has been a game changer for me. Being able to see appointments, meds list, and able to message my doctors is a huge bonus.",
"I had exceptioal care from staff. Alfreeda, Veronica, Savanna Mechelle, Katlyn and most all of the staff. They were ready and availabe help in all ways that were possible. They made my stay enjoyable, pleasant and informative. I will suggest the Tulsa Rehabilation Hospital to all I speak with. Many thanks and appreciation and love to you all. Keep up the good work.",
"This app has been so helpful! You can message about appts, look up tests and read results. I really find it to be a huge timesaving.",
This app is a big help for non emergency issues. It does sometimes take a day before getting a reply but it is better than having to go into the office when an office visit isn't really necessary.,
"User friendly, push notifications are great, everything I need is in one place, enjoy being able to message doctors/nurses about meds, updates, questions etc. Love this app!",
"It's easy to look up your blood work or make an appointment the same opening they have if you call is the same on the app. I could also text my doctor, and within the day or 2, he gets back to me",
Great app! Super easy to navigate and super convenient! Also helpful when looking for height and weight to fill out school forms .,
Easy to navigate. I appreciate Care Everywhere. One thing that would be beneficial is if there was an area to flag old reports to ask a new provider or document non urgent questions to ask at a future visit.,
"The is easy to use. The test results are uploaded quickly. I like it. I would like it better if I knew what everything meant, but that k God for nurses and doctors who are able to interpret the information and keep me informed.",
Have tried for three days to signup wont let get past the captia so Iwill be deleting this app you would not one star but you make me give something before Ican post this as of 5/25/23 have been trying to access my chart and it keeps telling me that an error has occurred on their end the app is great when and if it ever works something needs to be done about it ether fix it or delete it new review app still a piece of junk it still telling me error occurred on there end it's 7/26/23 two months,
"This app is wonderful! MyChart makes keeping track of your healthcare and all your healthcare records easy and accessable all in one app. MyChart post all patient care notes and testing results performed in network, from lab results, radioligy imaging, ER Visits, to Dr. Visit summaries!",
"IT HAS MY NAME WRONG AND I CAN'T CORRECT IT! I never use my middle name but MyChart does. I wound up on a 3 way call with my insurer & registrar, finally corrected the name. But the insurer moved to their own My Chart app. Happily, my past health records are still available to me",
"Very hard to contact my physician. My. Chart has not optimized RX requests for new or refills. Medications did not migrate totally from My Chart-Martin Health to My Chart-Cleveland Clinic. I cannot simply request renewals or refills from my medication list on My Chart as before. I visited my Dr. Robert J. Barry on Jul 24, this year. He reviewed and approved my meds. Cleveland Clinic had advised once one sees their physician, the refill/renew buttons would again be activated. This did not occur.",
The previous company handling the Integris and me system was awful. This is night and day. The app always would and it does it quickly and accurately.,
"My Chart is very user-friendly, incredibly intuitive, and very effective. Easy to download... Easy to use.!",
Attempted to login several times unsuccessful logged in a different way with no problem continues to say that my password or name is incorrect scary feeling making me feel that the site is very unsecured I refuse to change my name and password constantly instead I choose to log in a different way downloaded MyChart app I'm unable to actually login sadly this seems like something you guys should and want to work on,
I never see ads. But my chart has sure helped me keep all my stuff in order. And when I forget all I have to do is look at my chart and it tells me everything. I love it. Thanks for my chart,
"From a Healthcare perspective, I would be lost without this app. Keep appts straight, communicate with your care providers, schedule appts., etc. Love it!!",
This app really lags it doesn't even need a one start but I give one because it open other then that it sucks I can't read my notes from my doctor been trying to message my doctor and it won't let me do anything. Everthing it's says is not need to find a better app to use.,
Love everything about this app. Its so easy to get ahold of your doctors & normally you get a response within a couple hours. Overall it's extremely easy to use & very helpful.,
"I appreciate My Chart because it helps to order medications, make appointments, get lab results quickly and review my medical appointments. The app is easy to use and convenient.",
"Using the MyChart app is so much more convenient than logging into MyAltaMed website. The MyChart app gives me all the same reports, functionality, and communication tools as the full independant website. So exceptionally pleased my AltaMed doctor told me about the MyChart app.",
"I love the convenience in using this app. And all the information, relating to everything involved in my care. It's really helpful in having a recorded history of All my health care.",
"It's fairly user friendly, provides access to all your medical information and lets you do a lot of things via the app i.e. appointments, view records, messages, etc...",
"Convenient, but printing out your lab report is not because you have to print each part separately. You end up wasting many pages to get it all.",
"It works well for me, no thing i have issues with is uploading documents. Other than that, i is convenient and works for me.",
"Cannot make appointments with my own MD. Also, I called the office for doc to call me regarding a reaction to med, did not get call only note in system saying to come in for appointment... disappointing how the electronic system has taken away any responsibility and made it impossible to get personalized care without having to pay for an in person appointment. Just need a phone consultation or even a Tele med appointment to strategize next steps.",
I do love the MyChart app! I've never had issues... except to retrieve my password... so I trust their security measures & it's fairly easy to navigate,
"Great app. Helps keep me on top of my vosits and my overall health. Very easy to request refills, reschedule appointments and check test results. I would highly recommend this app",
"It is a nice idea. Yet the implementation is poor. Often orders do not show (bloodwork, MRIS, etc) . Having a convoluted system that separates everything is a nice idea on paper. In reality, it creates needless confusion and gets in the way of being able to functionally understand our treatment plan, not to mention create one. OUCH. Months down for faceID and TouchID??? Who's your CEO?!? Update ""sometime this summer"". REVISED to 1*",
App don't let me schedule appointments or reschedule because it freezes or takes to long to load. And this app is important for me to have because my kids see many doctors for health conditions. Please fix the app.,
This app is ridiculously glitchy. Most of the time it's completely unusable and I have to log in on a desktop browser. Pointless.,
"I can not get into my chart regardless. I have made the attempt 3 to 4 times with out success. This is irritating and now I'm wondering, is there an issue????",
This app is user friendly. Everything from scheduling appointments to getting results is easy to do! I wish all my providers used MyCharts.,
It's a nice app to gather information....but if you are going to put lab test results up.....they need a little more information as to what the individual test are checking and what it means.....without that they are near useless,
I don't know why you guys didn't hook up this app with the actual calendars in your phone or on your computer One like I set an appointment for my doctor puts it in the computer and it goes to my calendar right away so I don't double book anything,
This app is perfect for keeping track of ur appointments and checking Information from ur doctors office. And u can message ur doctor to ask questions or get refills on medications and more! Very useful and definitely a recommended app if u want to keep track of or check on ur medical info or contact ur doctor this is the app for u,
I like the app but wish that I could see the family balance to pay instead of going into each account. Parents should have more control over the accounts since the children don't make appointments or pay the bills.,
So much easier than trying to call and get through via the phone lines. Makes a world of a difference. Doctors]and nurses are fairly quick and prompt at getting back to you via MyChart.,
"It took getting used to but I love it! Keeps me informed and handle all my appointments and medications. I like being able to text my doctors with concerns, too!",
"I love My Chart, and how quickly and accurately information and test results is uploaded to the app. It works great for me!",
Very happy with the app and UAMS. I am able to print the information I need. This app helps me when discussing issues with another physician and help not duplicating any tests and bloodwork done.,
"I'm pretty new so this is a first opinion. Maybe I just need to learn more. However, it is annoying to have the alert icon for new information always there, even when I have reviewed the most recent information. Is there a trick I should know in order to get rid of the alert?",
I absolutely Love MyChart because it's so easy to communicate with your Doctors about any questions or Health issues that you may have ! Also. it's very easy to see what vaccinations You need to update.,
"MyChart takes away all three headaches of making it to appointments on time, waiting in the office for the doctor when they get caught up with a needy patient, I thoroughly enjoy waiting in my home behind a screen instead of waiting in their office! The test outcomes, and all other results at my fingertips, my insanely long medication list right there for me yo share instead of remembering and writing it down over and over again at every new doctor visit.",
Slow! Biometrics doesn't work. Outdated design... --added-- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work with Android 14. Do the new security updates with Android. ---New--- With newest update 7/12/23 biometrics work again!,
"It saves a lot of time to E-check in especially when you don't feel good already, and then have to sit and fill out paperwork. And all my team respond better then leaving voicemail,",
"I have used MyChart with other medical facilities before & it was a lot better, easier to use. OU MyChart is USELESS! & when you call the OU MyChart support line, they are also useless & cannot help you with anything!! (1) I see multiple doctors at OU but they are NOT on my Care team, despite asking multiple times to have all my doctors on my Care team! (2) I can't send messages, request refills or ask questions to the 1 doctor listed on my Care team! I still have to call the office! Useless!",
"My biggest gripe is the lack of a dark mode. As someone who is visually impaired, having a dark mode is a huge help.",
"I've gad a very positive experience with this app. It provides a good summary of treatment, a schedule for upcoming appointments, and an easy payment process.",
I love having and using the MyChart. It is very convenient. I like getting the results of tests and keeping up with my appointments.,
"Convenient and easy to use! All my appointments, test results, care providers, etc in one spot! Wish I knew about it sooner!",
"Sometimes difficult to use, most times handy for the doctors I suppose, but mostly confusing to me as too how I can use it to help my Healthcare issues that the primary care and surgeons don't already know and have.",
"When navigating in the app, things WILL NOT load! You only get ""Webpage Not Available"" You cannot check messages from your physician because of this. Makes it very frustrating!!!",
"NERVE WRECKING!!! There's an indicator that I have 4 messages; I don't. Cannot edit my specialists( delete/add), which makes it impossible to send a message",
"This app sucks! Most of my medical information is omitted. Difficult to navigate. My physician previously used Athena, which is updated and easy to use. My Chart is a rotten app.",
Love the app but only draw back is if you accidentally add the wrong company yu can't delete it. If there was a way I'd give it a 5 Update: so developer sent me a reply and fixed the issue. TY updated rating to 5,
"This has made it SO much easier for my doctors and myself to keep up with my health and medications. My pharmacy included. No more taking notes or trying to remember. Or worse, carrying my entire pharmacy of medications with me from. One place to another. LIFE SAVER!!!¡",
"There is so much ease of use. If I or mom have an issue, I can drop a descriptive note, and they will get back to us when they have the time. If they need to see us in the office, they'll call us. It's so great. Now, if I could just get ALL my Dr's to use it. I would be perfect. Maybe how I pick my Dr's offices in the future.",
Very convenient to see all of your health test results in one place. Easy to communicate with your Healthcare providers. Thank you dev for responding I am now able to screenshot! 5 stars.,
Program is fine. The medical industry is the problem. This Dr doesn't use the program the other one does. So I end up getting 5 patient portals none of the doctors have any clue what the other is doing :(,
"It's great to be able to follow medical appointments, message your medical team, recieve test results, billing, and so much more. Nicked it 1 star as slow response",
My experience with this app has been nothing but positive. I really enjoy the messages for upcoming appointments. Otherwise I would forget. Thank you for making my experience a positive one.,
Too much fluff. Not easy to navigate. No descriptions in the billing. Terrible experience.,
This app is USELESS!! NOTHING BUT ERROR MESSAGES WHEN TRYING TO USE IT. CONTACTED EPIC AND GET NOTHING BUT EXCUSES. I JUST GO TO THE DULY HEALTH AND CARE WEBSITE AND USE MY CHART THERE WITH NO PROBLEM. I UNINSTALLED THE APP BECAUSE EPIC JUST DOESN'T CARE. THE APP IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME!!,
"Why is this app stupid? Biometric only works with one organization. You login to another one, disable biometrics, then re-enable it and it works on that one, but stops working on the first one. Ridiculous.",
This is improving each time I us it. Doesn't replace phone direct communication but the none urgent issues are a lot easier to do through this app.,
I love that my medical information is at the tips of my fingers. App works well and is user-friendly. I also like I can swap between medical companies.,
MyChart makes managing all my appointments a breeze! My medical info is always at my fingertips. I can get any questions I may have for my providers addressed much quicker and hassle free than trying to call the office. I ❤️ MyChart!,
Apps like this do offer convenient methods of sending and receiving information. However they remove much of the human interaction with medical professionals.,
"MyChart is the best way to get ahold of my doctors. I have access to my records and tests, and can schedule most of the time as well. Would recommend to anybody that has a doctor that uses it!",
"Need help- I have linked a second hospital network to my account but it times out every time I try to activate it. Emailed chat though the app but it goes to my original hospital who doesn't know how to help. Epic, your response has nothing to do with my problem. I know my password. I need to like more than 1 hospital to my account and it's not letting me.",
"I like the app,, very convenient to make appointment and for refills,, the staff is always very helpful, very responsive",
Mychart is amazing. You can leave messages with your doctor and you can also save your appointment to the calendar and your phone without getting a Time mixed up or the date mixed up MyChart is the best thing ever,
"Love this app. It's my first stop for all healthcare contact needs. I make appts, order refills, communicate with my provider, etc. No need to call and be on hold anymore!",
Test results are fast and everything is explained really well! The appointment and health reminders are great too!,
I like to be able to follow my appointments in and my test results on MyChart. The app is easy to use and I do use it often to communicate with my doctors.,
It's been mostly convenient. It's hard to stop the reminder calls through my chart. Now my answering machine is over filled with stupid reminder calls.,
"Providence MyChart app is super awesome! Easy to navigate, gives me my lab results in less than twelve hours and my care team along with my doctor I just a click away on this app! 😀",
"Easy to use, beneficial test results, ability to set out patient Dr. Appointments, especially if a family member is in the hospital you can help with their daily meals, ability to keep up with meds and ongoing treatment.",
"I have pooh for brains and I always forget my appointments, this app helps me keep informed and helps remind me what I need to do. And less papers in the trash bin. ( yes I'm old enough to say trash bin )",
Great app but would be better if there was a running data entry portion so a patient can enter and track their blood pressure and weight so both the patient and Dr can follow the history.,
"I love having all my medical information in one spot, all my prescriptions located easily together, reminders for vaccines needed, screenings needed, all my appointment dates and times together...I never miss getting anything I need done!",
"So helpful, as someone who deals with epilepsy, and so much more. THIS changed my life and possibly saved it many times when I went to different ers",
This has helped alot with communication problems. Update: recommendation- depending on how closely devs work with each facility; I suggest allowing parking stubs to be validated by QR code after visit.,
I like using the app. My suggestion for improvement is being able to send referrals as an attachment.,
"Don't know what I'd do without it!! However, I frequently am unable to open visits and messages without trying 4 to 8 times.",
Really easy to use everything in the app. And I can message my care team/doctors. And schedule appointments is also easy to do.,
"My soon to be ex-wife has broken into my account as a provider and changed my information and ""My Chart said there's nothing they can do about it. I filed 2 complaints with HHS and they won't do anything about it. I've changed my password 5 times and she is still able to get it. I can't believe nobody wants to protect my privacy.",
This app is very easy and informative it makes it easy to keep track of all of your appointments and medication. If I could give more stares I would,
Old version was much better. This one asks the same damn questions every time. It's not very user friendly. Please fire the person who thought this new version was better 🤬🤦‍♀️,
"Love having all my healthcare providers, results, appointments and communications tied together in one handy app. Technology working for me not the other way around.",
"Can't seem to add more than one person on the same account, which is REALLY inconvenient when you have kids. I've sent several messages about it and gotten zero response.",
"This is a wonderful app, most of the time I can see my results before the doctor even calls. If you have even a rudimentary knowledge of health care and terms you can figure out your results.",
"Very easy to use, can make appointments with no problem. Can also message all doctors and staff. No ads to worry about.",
"Great Medical app. Allows you to stay on top of what is going on with tests and information in real time. This should be a standard thing anywhere you go, but unfortunately, it is not.",
I get very frustrated with this app bc it won't pull up my code for me to go further. I wait and wait and it never sends it to my phone#. I receive the emails but no ph# texts.,
"My Chart is a Wonderful way to keep up with your appts., your test results and to contact your doctor. I am so glad it is available!",
Best thing I ever downloaded and gained access to all my medical records from different office I've visit or went to and makes it much easier to get results that medical staff get and u can also check to see what all there test and results indicated,
"I love my chart!! It keeps me updated on EVERYTHING I need for my apps, labs whatever i cover with my doctor It's available 24/7. I absolutely love it!!! Thank you 😊",
"Love it. Makes everything so much easier. My only problem is I often have a lot of trouble getting in. I don't think it should be so hard. I've got nothing to hide. Aside from this, it's 5 star",
I feel like I have more control over my health care. I am able to access my lab tests as soon as they post it. Usually within about an hour. I can communicate with my doctors and do Video appointments. I find it invaluable!,
Very helpful app that is well organized and easy to navigate. And no ads of course.,
App works great and helps me handle my conditions. I highly recommend everyone view their test results themselves. Doctors keep lying saying tests are normal and thanks to mychart I am able to see they are not being truthful!,
I love it. I can message by doctors and request refills. I can also reschedule my appointment or make a new appointment. Great app.,
"This is an amazing app that allows for easy communication with your care provider. It's very hands-on for getting up-to-date test results, such as labs, screenings, and diagnostic imaging.",
"App works very well is super fast,I get a notice from visit within an hour. Bloodwork results the same day. Very convenient.",
I have used another my chart from Sanford Clinic and it doesn't even compare to this app. This app is very detailed and organized. I enjoy using it!,
"Great app has everything you need to know about your upcoming appointments, test results. You can even schedule appointments. Great app",
"Super helpfull! All the information, and everything I need for healthcare at the tip of my fingers! Keep up the excellent work all around! Thx!",
"Great app, keeps you up to date!!!!!! Keeps up with appointments, as well as payment plans, if you get behind!!!!!",
"It's good but it could be a lot better, with complex patients accessing many services it often feels clunky and not intuitive",
"It annoys me that I cannot just call my doctor directly, but I realize this is not a MyChart problem!! But maybe it will be related to the proper source, Thank You!!",
"This app is awesome! I've never had this kind of transparency with doctor notes, ability to see upcoming appointments and procedures, where to go and what to do. I can't say enough good about it.",
Every single time I log in I have to reset my password and user name. Tired of this. UPDATE: TERRIFIC customer service!! All fixed and working well. Happy little olegal here!!!,
"Truly convenient everything you need for scheduling, contacting your Dr. Reviewing your results and billing. Makes all your appointments convenient and easy to access.",
"I love having all my information in one place for all my doctors to review. It is important to me that they see all the medications I am taking so that if there are future medications prescribed, they know what new meds would interact adequately.",
I sometimes have a little bit of trouble getting into my files but that's usually on my part. I enjoy the fact they keep me updated on results and reports.,
Love being able to see future appts and connect internally with my team. Love how it keeps track of all past appts and any results you can see.,
Like having a personal assistant for appts & billing. Also quick & easy to get test results & to see my doctor's comments on my appts. I can also message my doctors office if I have questions.,
User friendly and very helpful to see all my doctor visits and test results as well as communicate with my practitioners. Love it!,
This has been incredibly helpful over our last nine months of treatment. We will have many years after the nine months and I'm am glad there is such a great tool to use in our journey.,
"Very difficult to download and set up the my chart, it keep saying ""security password not strong enough"" very frustrating, spent over an hour try to download the app.",
"Excellent app. I get test result before the doctor sees them. I can check appts, read notes the Dr when you don't remember what was said at an appt. Love this app!!!",
The best way for my daughters multiple specialist doctors to share information with me and her pediatrician. Thank God for Children's of Alabama and MyChart. My daughter has Trisomy21 and this has been a huge help since downloading.,
"I love the app, what I would really like is to be able to download the instructions for doctor visit or surgery for main campus to my email like where to park, which building to go to etc.",
"Great app. It is really easy to check in for doctor/hospital appointments, and I always know what they're planning on doing. I love My Chart!",
This is a great app so you don't have to do so much paperwork when you actually go in. And you can contact your doctor right at home instead of going in.,
"Very simple and easy to use. A great way to keep up with my health care. You can communicate with your provider, get test results, and make appointments",
"11-15-21...I can see what the APP developers are TRYING to accomplish, however, when I have an appointment at 900am on the next morning morning of a message stating that my appointment changed to a different time the next day {message rec'd around 1130pm, I find I unacceptable}. Also, no way to get in touch with drs staff AT ALL aside from messaging the Dr himself, I also find this unacceptable. Horrible app! Update: Also does NOT show any procedures that are upcoming when you are in hospital!",
The messaging system rarely works as the server is not working or allowing me to view my messages. Incredibly frustrating.,
Very informative & easy to navigate. I love the fact that I can link my Mercy Health Chart with my Summa Health Chart in order to read information from various facilities in one location.,
Quality app for keeping up to date with my consultant and appointments and also test results what I get before my own GP!! Easy to navigate around. Cannot fault it,
For months now I've not been able to use my chart to the fullest it keeps saying I have a error I've uninstalled and reinstalled no help so for now I don't like it is of no help to me,
"Really nice layout,easy to use, and all your health information insight. Love how the doctors can interact with patients online. Great time savor for both Doctors and patients.",
Navigating through the app is easy. My biggest concern is the inability for me to print needed medical information.,
Can't send messages or schedule appointments etc because no recipients are listed. They were there at one point about 6 months ago.,
"Most times information isn't viewable, even though the data like medication and notes exist it rarely shows up, usually blank.",
"Its great having a place to see all your current medications, a place where you can call to make appointments or just ask questions about a test result. VERY CONVINIANT.",
"Easy to use and navigate! Information and results are available, sometimes immediately !! Love it!",
App is pretty easy to use once you're finally in. Setup can be a little annoying though.,
Perfect site for scheduling appointments and even viewing details from previous visits or tests. It also helps me keep up with all of my prescriptions.,
Love being able to connect with medical providers..renewing meds and access to medical and immunization records. Really appreciate the ease of using MyChart.,
"A lot of hospitals in the Pacific Northwest are on this MyChart app. It is so nice to just be able to log in and send a message to your provider, make appointments, and refill medications. I was able to link up my OHSU MyChart from Oregon with the St Luke's MyChart here in Idaho.",
Great App. Allows you to get health info at the same time as provider gets it. Wish x-ray and scans were also available.,
Easy to use. Good at keeping medical records in one place. Makes sharing information easy with all of your doctors who are connected to mychart.,
"Easy way to check test results, appointments or chat with the doctor. Had worked well for me and all my info is in one spot.",
I enjoy reading my results from labs. I feel more in the know about my health. I can also message the provider with questions I do have. MyChart gives the patient the ability to be proactive in their healthcare.,
"Finally decided to get app an first time using it, it FAILS!!!!! Guess I'll stick to logging on through internet, never, ever had problems.",
"I love this app! I'm learning as I go when to push what to see the information. Example: click the Dr's name and open information about myself. I do have brain trauma on my left side, slowing me down some. However, I'm doing good at pulling up my information, confirming appts, and making my appts times. This app, ""My Chart,"" is great!",
Having to provide a verification code requires I switch back and forth when I get a message from my provider. Just a big hassle.,
"It's very useful to have all health related documents in one place. Makes things fast and convenient (scheduling, test result reviews, result discussion with PCP) The only downside is that loading time can be a little better. However, I do think this is the best health record app out there.",
"My Chart is accessible, user friendly and gives you great info to tests and lab work. Great tool to commumicate with your doctor. Love it!",
"I do like it but unfortunately not used to full capacity. It works for some things and not other things. But for the most part, scheduling is definitely easier.",
Very easy to use and understand. I can communicate very easily with my doctors when ever I need my medicine or make appointment.,
"It be ok if it would actually let me pay my bills, but since it won't and has no easy way to contact certain offices for said bill I can only give it 2 stars right now.",
"Works well, doctor messages populate almost immediately. No bugs I've ran into. Facilitates access to doctor in a new and immediate way. Very nice.",
"Confusing and not very friendly if you're not tech savvy. It also switches me to different languages sometimes & I get lost now. I really just want to go back to the easy to understand and use MyChart. I hate using this now. Really wish they would stop ""Improving "" MyChart... I now have to try multiple ways and times before it allows me in... It doesn't recognize me thanks to all the ""Improvements "". Not to mention, I now look in multiple places before I can find what I'm looking for",
It's so much easier to make appointments and get refills than actually calling. It's pretty quick to respond. I would definitely recommend,
It a good way to stay informed about the various medical professionals I visit. I actually don't like dealing with Doctors that do not have a portal to use.,
Perfect to communicate with physicians on non emergency topics. Makes me feel more at ease when little things come up and I need confirmation or peace of mind.,
"I have pretty complicated health issues, and this app DEFINITELY helps me keep everything straight. I am able to communicate with my providers, look at my appointments and test results, and even schedule appointments super quick and easy. It's awesome!!",
"Love, love it. I don't have to call my doctor all the time to get my results of any test. Can ask questions, and my doctor responds in a very good time back. The best.",
"Overall it's a great app. Lately though, I've been having a hard time getting onto the site due to server errors, not on my end I recently upgraded my internet. Don't understand why all the problems recently. This is how I renew scripts, get ahold of my doctor, find my test results and so much more. I hate to be disappointed, but......",
"This helps me keep track of all my lab work results, appointments, & medications. This app has been such a lifesaver for a busy mama of little kids. I'm so thankful for MyChart",
"Awesome, all my tests, scans, blood draws, etc are here, from the tech's report to the doctor to the doctors notes of my visits. I can even navigate the MRI and CT scans. I can leave messages for anyone on my care team, from my surgeon to the woman who emptied the garbage in my hospital room. Big kudos to Yale Medical Center for using this. I'm a huge fan.",
"Wish all my doctors used this app... It makes managing my medical appointments, tests, labs and medication's easier! I like that I can now print from MyChart.",
"Game Changer. Get this app! This app was a game changer for me. It has streamlined every step in the provider/patient visit process. Everything I need in one place; summaries, doc notes, schedule that can jump to my calendar, script refills, test results, asking questions and much more. The best part ‽ ‽ ‽ No more wasted paper!! Mother 🌎 is 😊 I've never had even one problem with this app.",
"My Chart is user friendly, great way to track test results, communicate with care team, etc. Just wish Franciscan and Multi Care would link together.",
"This app has been a real help to me, excellently done, easy to navigate and just great all around. Lightning fast test results enemy before the Dr. and Care team have looked at them. Please don't go changing this app. Period",
"I love the convenience of MyChart. I see test results, appointments and I can request refills on medication. Other things as well.",
I have been trying to access my my chart with updated information. And it has been 2 weeks and I am missing appointments because of that.,
Good to have records available BUT that does not include records and test results that I've brought to the doctor.. Can't see same test results over time that doctors see so have to write them down which is annoying . I keep getting alerts for an MRI that I had done elsewhere and no way for me to delete it. Plenty of other things lacking. I used to do QA and thus app needs a good QA review.,
"I love this. Any non emergency question is answered in a fast response. And if I have to go the hospital for any medical reasons, I can check in on my phone with this app.",
I really like this app cause it helps me to be able to be in touch with my Dr and review mental reports. It's a very good resource to have. I recommend it to everyone.,
Cannot edit. Difficult to correct wrong info. Narrow categories restrict input. Printing very difficult as is sharing info. Information rarely updated.,
Broken. Updates have made it impossible to move past opening the app. Way to test your new releases epic (insert eye roll here).,
"MyChart is a Godsend. It allows Doctor, Nurses, MA's, PA's, and Patient to Communicate safely, securely, and effectively. It alerts Staff when you have arrived for your appointment after you have done Pre-Check. It reminds you of upcoming tasks or appointments, messages, even allows you to add stuff to your Calendar. Not sure how much time and money this valuable app saves.... I believe it to be pretty significant though. Any improvements are welcome by this user. Thank You Developers!",
"Thanks to this app, I can keep all of my appointments straight and review the results of any testing. All of which helps me to stay better informed of my health.",
This app helps keep up my well-being. But I need to know if I can delete the other app. Hopefully someone will message me with correct information.,
"Closes on its own while attempting to access after opening it!! Unable to use, very frustrating!",
"Awful, kick you off when you're trying to do things without saving you progress. If I could rate this app negative stars I would!",
"This is such a great resource. Almost all interactions and medical information is provided at my fingertips and if not it is only a click away to request anything. It's so easy to contact my medical providers for comments or questions. I can update my personal medical file or update my provider specifically. It also integrates and 'speaks' to other software, pharmacies, and so forth. All in all, highly suggested.",
"Payment methods broken, enter all your data then it only offers Back and Cancel. Back does the same as cancel so I can no longer pay the balance owed... This is in the process where you add a payment method. I cannot screen shot as that is blocked by security.",
Only giving four stars as my doctor doesn't always get any direct messages that are sent to her. Not sure if it's a glitch...,
"Mychart has proven to be one of the best apps bar none! I have all of the info I need right at my fingertips whenever I need it. Access to the doctors is great because I can often get answers to questions, pay co-pays and other bills, request prescription refills, etc. Whoever came up with MyChart is a genius!",
"Good concept, but I constantly get an ""error on the server fault"" when I click on my test results or those buttons. Then it kicks back out frustrating when your watching and waiting for results, but otherwise, so far so good.",
"It helps me keep things in line and also it's very convenient I can schedule appt, ask questions and veiw my medical past with out talking on the phone or going from one dept. to another",
"I love this app. It allows you to be absolutely fluid in your management of contact with your physician & pharmacy and it also reminds you of your upcoming appointments, vibes with calendar and gives amazing patient hx in the event you need to see a new physician or somehow become incapacitated and can't relay all the info yourself! I never leave reviews for apps really... But this one is somewhat exceptional",
"I'm always disappointed by the fact that this MyChart app does NOT give me the option to send a message to my Doctor without the restricted categories provided by the app. I may have a question or need to give an update to my Doctor, but can't, because this app will NOT allow it. The app is good for a lot of things, but NOT for my specific needs! I guess they are limiting what you can or cannot message your Doctor about. Very frustrating and disappointing!",
"Good app, especially helpful for communicating with medical staff. Access to after visit information is appreciated as well. Still needs tweaking in areas such as medication and shots updates or addressing issues not listed in drop-downs. But a huge improvement over where this app was a few years ago!",
"There is a really big issue with the MyChart app. There is a error message that keeps popping up the ""An error has occurred on the server, please try again later"". Then bombs out. Cleared cashed, uninstalled reinstalled, tried using the browser, same thing. Any idea why this is happening and what is the fix for it. All the best Debbie Dvorin",
"MyChart is the go-to app for all things medical related. The information it carries is easy to understand & complete. Schedule appointments, get real-time test results that are fast, with inclusion by the time you get home from your appointment & get recommendations for screenings to help keep you right on top of your health concerns. There is also a message capability to get you answers to questions relating to your health situations. It just makes sense to take advantage of this app.",
"Back to a 5* rating! This is a great app for me. I've also been to multiple hospitals, and this keeps everything under one umbrella. I also love being able to set appointments, ask for refills, see test results, or even ask a doctor questions. Thankfully, they fixed any issues from the last update. A definite must-have!",
"This app. Sucks. All of the payments that I've made to my drs, hospitals etc are no longer visible. I had a dispute over a couple of bills & the record of the payments I'd made are no longer visible. Not just that, I've had test results & Drs notes dissappear. How is it possible that my info is disappearing? I've compared my review with many others & most are having the same trouble as I am. I don't want the same generic reply that they are getting. I'm not sending an E-mail. Just FIX IT🤬",
"The app has been a great help for me to keep up to date with my busy schedule of healthcare appointments, tests and treatments. It's a real benefit for me to be able to do check-in ""paperwork"" before appointments and to be able to communicate easily with providers as needed. Excellent app!",
"Am very discouraged. EVERY time I try to get into this app., I have to reset my Password. Am very tired of having to reset, unable to get into my account. Is time consuming & takes about a half hour just to get it all figured out I try to save my newest Password, & I am never able to. Not Satisfied at All.",
"Simple and very friendly UI with all of your information in a convenient location. You can schedule and reschedule appointments, see the medications you are taking, and even communicate with your doctor directly via message, and you can refill prescriptions. It also connects directly with my ""Quartz"" insurance (MyChart) app making the UI even more friendly and, yet again, more convenient.",
"Having major issues with my chart. Unable to connect to my doctors office to input my weekly INR data. I keep getting an ""error on the server"" message. Not having a problem with multicare side, but the providence connection is flawed. Is there an update, or should I reload, hate to go through all the info reload if I don't have to.",
It is very convenient. It keeps track of all my appointments for me. I can ask my doctor questions anytime. It records every test result so I don't have to remember. I can get doctor notes through it. I have a list of my medications. It reminds me of upcoming appointments I need to set. I can leave myself notesto remind me of things later. I can even monitor my children's health care. I love it!,
"It's great tool and makes it so easy to communicate with providers, track appointments and test results, make appointments, ask questions about prescriptions or follow-up on care instructions. Things that could take numerous phone calls are clicks away. And having access to my data anytime I need it is awesome. Absolutely a game changing application.",
"Why in the world starting about 7 days before an appointment, I get numerous text and emails basically all the same. The App is also very slow opening and moving through the menu. Ok app. But what happened to the records before switching to my chart?",
"Some areas of the MyChat app are an improvement over older patient portal apps. Over all it's a fail. For chronically I'll patients that need multiple appointments with several different physicians on a care team it is a total waste. After a certain number of appointments it only allows E-visits, vaccinations or testing to be scheduled. None of my prescription information transferred to the system. I can only hope the kinks in the system are removed and it becomes more scalable for patients.",
Scheduling and tracking doctor visits is so easy with MyChart. Plus I really like the ability to view my doctor's notes and my test results in case I have follow up questions. Detailed information on meds and vaccinations as well as reference information supplied is also first rate. This is a great app for anyone who needs or wants to keep close tabs on their health care.,
"My password manager won't often work in an internet browser for MyChart, and it won't work in the app, which is especially frustrating because I can only do biometric verification with certain log ins, depending on the medical provider. Every time I need to log in, I basically have to reset my password every time, if I want to use the app for my current medical provider. I have talked to customer service and all they do is apologize for their incompetence. Not great for morale.",
"Best App. Ever... easy to use, you can view your test results, openlinenof messaging between you and your providers. You don't have to worry about paper print outs. You can share your info across-the-board. Requesting refills have never been so easy.",
"Love the ease and user friendliness of the app. Being able to E-Checkin is the greatest!!! No standing/waiting in lines, walk in and sit down. Only thing I'd like to see changed is the ability to update/change things in medical history.",
I do like seeing my appointments and test results as soon as available. However it requests updates and won't allow it. Such as telephone numbers. And I always have the message up showing the lack of coordination between different facilities. This needs to be fixed.,
"App has suddenly stopped showing all my appointments or tests needed from both health systems on main log in page like it use to do. Now I have to switch organizations to see all my appointments I have coming up that week. So now I have to write everything down from both health systems prior to appointments for scheduling new appointments. Also, even though I'm signed in with my password or code, the system doesn't allow screenshots, which holds up the line when I'm scheduling new appointments.",
Extremely hard to schedule visits for any vaccines or to schedule appointments with doctors. If your doctor places the appointment in the system it works fine. There is absolutely no way to schedule my immunizations at all which is SO frustrating as an immuno-comprimised person. They really should see if that can be fixed. Otherwise i would rate it 4 or 5 stars.,
"Clear and concise. It is very easy to use, but we really appreciate being able to see post-appointment notes & lab results quickly. Online check-in for appointments and being able to update meds, allergies, etc. has been invaluable.",
Don't really care for it. Every time I try to log in it says my password is incorrect. Especially when I save it in my phone and it saves it in my password management in Google. It does it automatically. So it can't be user error. So it is very inconvenient and time consuming. Not users friendly. Also not helpful when your sick.,
"Yes I like it, and yes it has issues. A lot of the information doesn't update. ie: vaccinations. Shows test results but doesn't show summary for the layman to understand. It shows my Dr.s in 3 different medical establishments. But can't access them. Confusing!!!",
"At one point we used to go to see the graph of past results in the app directly from the most current lab test. I thought it was gone but now we have to go to a different section and then that takes us to a web-based portal that shows it. Unless I'm missing something that should be linked in my current test results near, ask a question",
"Except for not having access to the images of my x-rays, it is an awesome app. It clears up the need for storing slot of paperwork. But if I do need a hard copy I can send it or copy it to someone else. It keeps up with everything from prescriptions , billing, doctor's notes and so much more. Thank You for making this available.",
"This app is phenomenal. From scheduling, to test results, to hospital stays and preregistration paperwork this app makes every process in my healthcare easier, more accessible, and more efficient. The only hospital I have trouble with is Christ,a genuinely uncaring institution that I have no intention of dealing with anyway. I can even send questions about my nonemergency care, issues, and medications and actually here back in a timely manner. This is a must-have application.",
"Easy way for me to keep up with my schedule of appointments, still hard to actually reach a provider so you may as well just sit on hold forever and call them. It's easier that way. But the app is useful for other things like scheduling, medication list, etc.",
Very confusing and inconsistent. It is easily confused with other Methodist Hospital programs and services. Could not find adequate help through customer service. It seems to be yet another way to prevent the patient from speaking to or getting help from a live person.,
"My chart has not worked on my Samsung android phone for several months. Every time I try to get information, it shows me Error on server and will not access my account. I called My Chart and was instructed to Uninstall the playstore app and reinstall it. Then I went through all the steps to reset my password. I still get the same Error on server. I cannot use My My Chart at all and am very disappointed with them and their technical support.",
"I gave this app a 5 when i first used itand I still believe it is outstanding. However, it no longer allows you to view messages. I have emailed local health provider and Epic. Reading the similar ratings I notice Epic defers to local provider. So I assume all of us are either attached to Monument Health or Mayo. All of us have basically the same issue. I too, must revert to my PC to get messages. Please help solve this issue.",
"Wellstar's App is on par with the rest of wellstar's services, which is simply atrocious. It seems a torrent of messages to my email box. It shows a three month old appointment as upcoming.... They grant themselves 48 hours to respond to messages, and can't even stick to such a generous deadline. And if they do respond, it is with nonsense.",
"It has made a world of difference to me. I have stage four nsclc (with brain metastasis), hypothyroidism, diabetes and failing kidneys, so bloodwork, CT, MRI, and other test results are very important to me. As my oncologist explained, most specialists focus on their area of expertise. I rely on my ability to understand. I read the test results and doctor's notes so that I get a clear picture. I only wish that all doctors would or could use this app in the same fashion.",
"MyChart is very easy to use. Excellent way to communicate with doctors and staff. Also, prescription ordering is so easy to use. And love viewing test results after proceedures. I'd be lost without this app. I check MyChart before emails or texts, as it's the most important communication tool that I have. Information provided is always current and so beneficial to my ongoing good health and care. Jack Monday",
"I have never had any issues with MyChart. If there is any downside, it's that I get results before my doctor's and that can sometimes cause me a bit of anxiety. Results can be outside ""normal range"" and still be normal for you! Everyone is different of course. I am grateful beyond measure with my health conditions that I can just message my doctor's and make appts as needed. THANK YOU for this app!",
"Works fine on my computer, but the phone app is unuseable. It hasn't updated my info and thinks it's still 2021. (Update: I couldn't get the app to work on my phone so I deleted it and logged onto the web site & it works like it's supposed to. Not sure why.)",
"This app is ridiculous. Can't access anything after the log in. Tech support didn't help. I have deleted the app and then installed again and this didn't help. Seeing as this is basically the only way the provider will interact with you anymore and you can't get access is very frustrating! My app is up to date and tech support is not helpful or knowledgeable as he said ""his app works fine on I phone"" I am Android..does it matter? . Fix it!",
"The app is relatively easy to navigate. As long as your provider uses ""MyChart"" in their facility, you can message them through the app, view upcoming (and past) appointments, after appointment documentation, test results, imaging reports (& the corresponding orders), refill prescriptions, and a variety of other tasks. You are able to create multiple accounts on the app; for mom/dad and the kids.",
"Some of the components are not linked so when I do an update on my profile in one place, it doesn't update the data everywhere else.",
This is a good way to keep track of information. I also know that its not being updated in a timely manner. They have doctors shown as my care team that were my care provider while in a hospital. No aftercare flow up. And too easy for misinformation to be placed on my record without any checks and balances. An application is useful but only as accurate as the person entering the information. And accuracy is crucial for continuity of care.,
"Very convenient to have on my phone to check appointments, request med refills, as someone with a lot of allergies having access to a list do I don't forget any is an amazing feature. I also love being able to view test results and documents.",
Very hard to access and get messages. Most messages are cryptic requiring clarification. Some messages/responses not received in a timely manner. Some messages incorrect. Does not communicate with EE Health. Often locks you out and requires password change when using correct information. I would prefer a text or phone call.,
"Great when it works. Frequently won't let me log in. Gives error: ""Network connection required Verify your cellular data or Wi-Fi connection is enabled. If you're still unable to connect, try restarting your device."" When I clearly have network connectivity and my internet is working fine.",
"Medical records are not up to date as compared to the website. Unable to message primary provider. Hard to navigate. Frequently Hard to get back to home page or menu. Sometimes, while trying to do so I found myself back at the log-in screen.",
"A pain to add one of two providers, can't log in via fingerprint, have to type password everytime/ auto fill not compatible. And certain links don't work. Used a redundant path and it worked once. Tried the next Time and redundant path didn't work either.",
"Appreciate access to health information,and app could be more user friendly & helpful: -have app & website remember filters and place in list of visits when user opens one. Or give user option to continue in list or go back to full list. Having to start over each time looking for a particular visit after each time I read a summary or a note is tedious. - Make it easier to filter visits by more parameters such as date range or specialty",
"Doesn't load notes and other results. Slow all the time. I typically use the Internet version to see what I can't see with the app, but now there's a message that the Internet version will go away and I'll only have the app. Fix the app!",
"I use this chart all the time, I refuse paper print outs of anything. I also like being able to message a Doctor for clarification about something after a visit. The only problem is not with the app, but that not all doctors use it to make appointments, renew scripts or answer their messages.",
"Very useful, and all test and medications are listed, so it is easier to have on hand when talking to medical personnel. Wish all drs. were a part of the Lee Health System. Easy to navigate and find information. Just wished there was a way to copy information on paper. Easy to make an appointment and talk to medical staff.",
"It's a good app, has almost everything I need. My biggest complaint is I can't schedule appointments with a Dr I've already seen before. In fact, the only Dr i can schedule with doesn't even work in the system anymore (no actual dates to schedule on, but she's the only option given). I understand if I haven't seen the Dr before, but one where I'm an established patient should be available.",
"I really enjoy this app. As a clumsy person and someone who is almost always sick, it is nice to know that I can look back on whatever charts to make sure they are correct or if I need to show someone something. I also get my results quicker because I don't have to wait for the hospital or doctor to call me. I enjoy this app a lot and it is very easy to use!",
I like having my healthcare at my fingertips. I think one little improvement might be to flag what I'm looking for in my Chart. Many times you're notified that something is in there. Yet you have to search different options to find out what you're being notified of.,
"I love this app! It keeps track of my appointments and prescriptions, plus it gives me ready access to any test results (including normal ranges). Plus, requesting prescription refills is a breeze. I've never had this easy access to my medical records before.",
I love the MyChart app because you can schedule appointment get refills.. Read the summary from your last visit's..ask questions you get nervous and forget to ask about.. I'm shy😂Do your paperwork before the appt..The past and future appts are mixed together and it can be confusing at times with past appointments included. Other than that I love the app because you can do so many things with it instead of using the telephone being on hold and then reaching a grouchy person at the other end LOL,
I would be lost without this app. I can easily communicate directly with my Doctors bt message. I am notified when new test results are available and view them. I can see the notes of the Doctor after visits. All my appointments are listed both past and present. Just does it all!,
"I don't know how or why all of a sudden my emergency contact is texted my appointment reminder, why? Also, I am hearing impaired and one would think a TTY number would be easily found on the menu, but nothing. This is a medical facility where TTY is not an option. Downgrading from 5 stars to 2 stars!!!",
"Keeps track of appointments well, although, Even if you do the check-in process, you'll still have to do it on paper when you get to the doctor's office. Which seems a little redundant, I thought it was supposed to speed the process. But you just do it twice. Otherwise, the app keeps good track of pertinent information. And keeps you up to date on all of your appointments. I like the texting feature, I can ask questions that are on my mind and get a response within a day from a physician.",
"I am very happy with this app! I am so glad that all of my healthcare providers use it. I get my test results through My Chart quicker than my doctors get them. I can ask questions about test results, and it also allows me to message my different doctors with questions or send them information, including pictures. It is so handy. I've had to go to urgent care, and we use this app to bring up my medications, as well as they can look at my previous test results. I highly recommend it!",
Can't add images or files to message unless I am in the desktop version. Home screen constantly annoys you with preventive screening that you cannot update as being completed with another platform. I wish there was a way to merge all 3 of them.,
"I think the app is great. I like being able to send messages to my doctors and not having to worry about waiting on hold forever to speak to someone or, my personal favorite, being told the message will be relayed, and then you never get a response. This app makes getting things done with the medical side of things much easier.",
"I find the MyChart app very beneficial and easy to use. I have access to all necessary medical information, upcoming appointments, and medications to review & refill. If needed, I am also able to submit questions to my medical team. It's like having a direct line to the medical office!",
"I like it; and I don't. I like that it's all Handy in one place, but it's just wordy EVERYWHERE. I THINK LESS WOULD BE MORE. But who am I? I couldn't write an app! One big thing that isn't good at all is its very glitch prone. Every time I come on I get a message that says we have trouble getting this information... 🤔Why? Obvious technical. Please fix it. Another is they tell you if you send a note to one of ur team they will bill you as a visit. That's just charming isn't it?",
The idea is great but the interface is horrible. Two step verification doesn't work half of the time. Takes forever to send the code and then only accepts it on the third time it resends a code. Not good at all.,
"Starting to really hate this app.. it used to work well. But as of late any time I try to view anything like my messages or upcoming appointments, etc, I get a system error message. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and it made no difference. I have to use the website to view messages, test results, etc. What's the point of having the app if I can't use it?",
"The ""trust this device"" for my mobile doesn't seem to work so I always have to wait for the emailed security code to log in. I really value the charts you can get on the web version. These don't seem available on the app, which is a shame.",
Easy to make/cancel appointments. Get lab results quickly. Can update medication list. Appropriate notifications of upcoming appointments. I can check in online without stress. I love this app. Easy for me to use and I am a senior.,
"This is getting annoying. App will work fine for a few months and then sucks. I can login fine but can not access Messages, Test Results or E Check In. Have reset password like suggested an still same error message "" An error has occurred on the server. Please try again later"". Also tried on and off wifi connection and restaring my phone 👎🏾",
The update on this app needs improvement. I get a notification that I have a message and I log in on the app to read the message and nothing. This app is more of a pain than helpful. I have a hospital by the name of Bonners? and it has nothing to do with me. It lists tests that needs to be done but I click on them and they are from last year. Fix this already. It's a waste of time using it,
"Easy to use except for an error in the way one question/answer is worded. In regards to privacy while in the facility, the original question is basically worded ""lf someone inquires about you or comes to visit, *do you want us to let them know that you are here and let them visit you?*"" The answer options are ""total privacy"", ""limited privacy"", and ""no"". It explains that ""no"" means you are willing to have mail, flowers, phone calls, and visitors, but then the choice should be ""yes"", not ""no"".",
My Chart is a great source of information and help with management of my health care. It makes getting appointments and advice easier. It also works well when I get an appointment It syncs with my calendar to help me remember them. Thanks for a great resource.,
It is so convenient to have both my doctors of two different organizations in one app. I can see all my test results from blood samples done by quest diagnostics posted on MyChart and get a quick report from my doctor prior to an appointment. I could even reach out to both organizations by email and get replies back through the app. Excellent app,
"Many functions don't work. Bill payment will not allow entry of payment information. Records access information doesn't include the hospital staff. Messages are so limited you can't explain issues before the limit hits. In my case it's also backed up by medical doctors that don't respond, records are inaccurate and nobody wants to take responsibility to fix, and long expired appointments are still listed as upcoming. I don't trust any of the information I see in the app.",
"I love MyChart. It has everything related to your health. Medication history, lab tests results and flags. It reminds you of upcoming appointments and you can even send/ receive secure messages to your health care team. Its a really great app. Thank you for making this app.",
"For the most part, I love Epic/MyChart, and wish all hospitals/clinics were interconnected on a system such as this one (like in most of the rest of the developed world). I find it a huge help being able to access my and my senior parents' test results and after visit summaries and to pre-check in for appointments. To me a weak area is messaging, restricted to specific categories. If one's question or issue (i.e. Rx error) is outside of those categories, the only option is to call the clinic.",
I really like have my medical information with me whenever I need or want it. There has been one downside to this app and I've had to change my password several times bc if not used for a little while when I've gone to sign in it tells me wrong password. Then it won't let me change my password when I've tried forgot y password. I've actually had to call my Dr's office to have somebody reset it for me.,
I'm a Norton patient. I want to share that I don't benefit by leaving a review. This app is the only reason I keep up with anything. This is easy to navigate and reminds me of everything. It makes super stressful medical junk a bit less stressful and that's really all I can hope for with a great app like this. I love how I can even use this to send a quick question so I don't have to call and wait on hold forever. I honestly love it and I wouldn't change a thing. Please don't. Seriously.,
Does what it was designed to do. Well laid out. Excellent way to contact any registered care provider. For chronic issues and repeat visits it would be nice to see appointments scheduled past 30 days. A drop down date range selector would be appreciated.,
Dr. Nur and Brandy was amazing. They made me feel like they truly care about my health. The two Ladies who was in the front of the office was very professional and there customer service was on point. If anyone looking for a new MCP come to Dr. Nur! The MyChart app is great. Easy way to confirm appointments and to look at all your personal information. Great App!,
Not user friendly. If you go into one of the options such as great results it doesn't allow you to go back to the home screen. You have to choose it out and resign back in. It also didn't give you the option to download or print.,
"It's alright and it's not. Setting up some appointments can be annoying as since there's no option, or setting up appointments with multiple different reasons as you want to make sure your doctor has the full reason for your visit. The pneumonia for example pops up if you have asthma. To be honest it needs to take into consideration the patients age when sending the notification as you want to wait for at least 65 before getting the vaccine.",
"I use this app for many of my different doctors and it makes things 100x easier. I can look at test results as soon as they are ready, it's easy to show my other doctors and you can link you accounts with all of them. I often get my results before my doctor does. Definitely a must have app.",
"Excellent way to keep in touch with my care team and get initial test results. Mychart saves time, mostly prevents ""phone tag"" issues, and provides a way to confirm details of important information. The ""add to my calendar"" option is also extremely helpful.",
"So far, as of 7 May 2023, I am satisfied with the information I get on my testing and visits, including detailed after visit reports. The only problem I have experienced is after receiving an email to precheck-in whenever I try to accomplish this task, every time, I get the message that something went wrong and to try again later. This happens whether it is two days before on minutes before from the parking lot outside the door.",
"THE BEST APP EVER!No annoying ads and it's never shut down on me. I literally have all of my doctors on this app, including nurses and therapists and it just makes my nerves go away with having to be on the phone calling everyone. it even tracks my pregnancy! I highly recommend this app to anyone who sees doctors and specialists on a daily basis!",
Like that I can get test results quickly. Find precheck-in process very frustrating. Not at all intuitive. Usually they make you go over the same info once you get there.,
Many of the functions fail to perform. Medical history is abbreviated. Information about tests are incomplete. Only medical information from some providers is available. It's difficult to navigate without a fixed banner on all pages.,
"I use this app all the time. It is easy to navigate and helps you keep track of all your medical appts, test results, communication with your Drs. Office, etc. Love it! Makes life a bit easier.",
"This app is super helpful. I can get appointments, test results, electronic letters, notes from visits made, etc. Everything family Dr's have a really difficult time sharing. I love this app. It's very convenient!!",
!!! I have never seen so many 1 star reviews!!!! Not happy with the type and amount of personal information this company asks. Then asking myself who MyChart is sharing this info with. This app is just unnecessary and hasn't improved my healthcare in any way. Now I have to figure out how to get all my information deleted from their records and hope it's actually deleted.,
This app is great to see my medical info and to be able to communicate with my medical staff without being on hold on the phone. Love it.,
The devil is in the details! This software gives me visibility that I did not have before. I generally forget about the details once I leave the office. Great job!,
Super helpful with all you need to your health care needs to speed up the process and access .Like it .Recommend .,
"Everything you need to know, easy to message doctors . It's just very convenient . I like it a lot. God knows with all the medical issues I have ,it's really a godsend.",
"Starting in the last few weeks, opening any appointment causes the app to logout of the organization and app crashes after a few times.",
I can't login to my premier health. Why? It's been like that for close to a week. I know of others having same issue. Please fix now!. Thanks for responding. I will contact them.,
I appreciate being able to read the test results and the doctors response. The system is easy to use & is a good record of all medical information. Thanks.,
I really enjoy MyChart and it's so easy to use. I'm reminded upcoming appointments in case I forget and my test results comes back fast for me to see. It's easy to refill my prescriptions and so easy to text my care provider. I love this app.,
"I have a little difficulty scheduling appointments, but getting my test results and notes for work or school for my kids is fantastic.",
"Lame app, it doesn't download the results in PDF format. Instead, I got a picture like icon, and it's not the file that I downloaded. I've tried different ways to download it to no avail. If you guys could fix that. Also, I want to share such info with my spouse, and it doesn't have the option. That should be fixed as well.",
S L O W... The app takes a long time to log on and being up the data. Otherwise it's nice to have all the providers on one app.,
"This is the 1st time I've ever had to write anything negative about. I went to the ER due to extreme pain in my colon I had this 1x before and they found a bacteria that they said if I hadn't come to the ER I would have died in my sleep. I was put in the hallway waiting for a room. There were 3 other bed waiting as well. After the initial things like they put the IV in my hand and used it once. When the Dr. came to me she was going to inject some in the same IV, so I thought but she did a 2nd 1.",
"This app has actually made my life easier when dealing with my medical stuff. Prescription refills, making appointments, test results, contacting my primary, letting my doctor know in advance of my appointment about any medical issues that I need to discuss, so he has the information beforehand, accessing referrals, updating insurance info, and more. Never had any issues with the app. No ads and my personal information is secure. Highly recommended!",
"This app is great. It's very easy to use and convenient. You're able to get your lab results very quickly without having to wait on the doctor to call you. Can send message or ask a question, view history, balances, and make appointments.",
I love the convenience of the app. But I can't ever get or send my messages. It's always down or something. Very annoying.,
"Very easy to navigate, read and understand your test results, and has a list of all your medicine,",
App works well. Have been using for years without any glitches. Best of all is the biometric login option.,
"MyChart is rated excellent so far. I like the convenience of having records of my health profile, labs, and appointment reminders.",
I really enjoy using the MyChart app. They thought of everything. There's nothing I can't find or resolve in the app. I really love it 💗😍,
"Pretty good app. Has all my records, scheduled appointments (and reminders), and ability to message my HCPs all in one place.",
"Easy to use, can schedule appointments, request refills, look at test results and much more. Also able to connect to certain other facilities and view records from them.",
"No complaints, it makes contacting my Doctor very convenient. I live an hour away from my DR. And for some things like, lab work, i would have to go see him in person to set it all up, now just a few buttons maybe a message to the DR. Not to mention somtimes you get medical results at the same time as your doctor, so you see them pretty quick. There is a lot more to the app I havent done yet, but with what I have used, it made my Dr visits so much easier.",
"It's seems hard to look around but once you get the hang of it, super easy to navigate from one page to another",
"My Chart is wonderful. It's a great way to contact your doctor with questions, set an appointment, or view your records. Many more options, but I can't list them all here. Highly recommend the app!!!",
"Great application to stay connected to my doctor. I like the enhanced features that allow me to chat with my doctors, request refills, and pay my bill all in one location. Thank you for continuing to make this health application a lot more functional.",
"When I go into your app at the verify page, it is frozen; I clicked the verify tab and nothing happened. However, if I use web browser ( Chrome ), it is fine. Could you tell me what I can do with the app. BTW, I am using motorola one 5G ace with Android 11. Thanks!!",
"Great app! Saves time and is convenient. User friendly app for sure! You can make appointments, E sign documents, update information , personalize your profile ,request medication refills, check into appointments, read the doctor's notes after each visit, send messages to staff or your doctor, get phone numbers,see your labs and get reminders for COVID related information and due dates ext. If you use multiple doctors and pharmacies , you can access this all through the app. 5 stars definitely!!",
"Very helpful and such a great way to avoid paper, Simple and clear easy to understand what the results are and easy make appointments and other information that you may need to look up, it's all right here! Nothing is easier than this!! Thank you.",
"It has been quite exhausting. I had set up an account on MyChart earlier this month but the information I provided said it was invalid. No it wasn't It was the very same info that I entered on my first MyChart acciunt. So, as hard as I tried, MyChart kept telling over 4 to 5 times that my information was invalid. Okay so now what? I started all over again. Different email, new password, more thorough with my name. So now I installed the MyChart app. I'm good to go. It was quite the undertaki",
I get anxious with tests so having the answers to tests so quickly and questions to all my doctors answered so quickly is fantastic! This is a great app.,
Needed it to be Easy to use. Simple for me bc I'm technically challenged! Nice having records/tests/doctor reports available to see!!,
"Super improved and modernized. Highly recommend. Been using over a decade, and now has added a ton of features and made logging in + obtaining disparate records from other places super easy. Many kudos.",
"I can't believe how informative, how quick to keep you up to date on things you need to do, how quickly your appointments are added and where to be. It's just an amazing app when you have multiple appointments during the week! Not to mention the billing info I get for each of my visit makes it 100 percent easy to figure out. Zero complaints! Thank you!",
I can't make ANY kind of appointments and it keeps saying to call. (Update) So it's my Hospital that is making it impossible to make a appointment online... If that's the case then the app works fine for me.,
"Thus far, it has an excellent app in layout, access, and communications. I was initially skeptical of the practicality, but now I'm sold. Great job in providing access to records and doctors!",
"wishing you could change or update your username. also, being able to customize more than just the colors. once updated, i'll give 5 ★'s.",
"Love this app makes for an extremely easy way to view records, check & schedule appointments, chat with providers, and more. Very user friendly I am not tech savvy and have no issues navigating thru out the app. Also no adds!!!",
"I love MyChart! I can see my upcoming appointments as well as, any test or scan results as soon as they're ready. Also, I'm able to obtain an earlier appointment if there is a cancellation just by accepting in a timely matter. (First come, first serve.) I probably would not have had the opportunity before MyChart! It's a lot easier for me to stay on top of being proactive with my health by keeping organizes through this service!",
It is a really good way of communicating with Drs and getting a message to them at any time. Sometimes it takes a phone call but I can always stay in touch with my Drs. Very good idea,
"Integris and me does not work but Acumen Nephrology works great. I have an Android, on my husbands iPhone, Integris works great, so the app doesn't work for android.",
"My Carle is very helpful, it saves phone calls to MD, office. The labs ordered is awesome. I can review them as I need . I love it and would not want lose this resource . O",
"Great app! Provides detailed info about you lab test results, Dr notes, upcoming appointment reminder, health recommendations etc. I love it!",
Very helpful in asking questions after appointments or before even. I can schedule my own appointments which is nice. I can automatically add appointments to my calendar. Is medication refill Request is also easy without having to see or talk to the doctor. It is made managing my health care a lot easier,
It's a great app. Just need to be patient to learn how it operates. 09/13/23 The app is great! I wish there was a way that I could print the notes from my visit.,
"I am retired. My career did not require typing & I prefer ""speaking with people."" I do not care to need and have my cellphone filled with assorted passwords and medical apps.

"I love using My Chart. I can schedule appts., send questions to my doctors, see my appt. reminders, and get test results to review.",
MyChart does a great job of providing important information in an easy-to-use format. It's always accessible for reference and evaluation.,
Very helpful to have assorted medical information easily accessible online. Also convenient for simple communication with doctors and nurses.,
It's a great way to keep track of your medical info all in one place at least in Hellinois. In my case it's a way to show or transfer medical info to new doctors when you move and have to find new one's.,
It's better than calling. Calling talk forever for them to answer them if your waiting for over 30 minutes it hangs up.,
Love having access to everything in real time. Easy appointment reminders and access to everything. Great job!!,
It doesn't let me sign in it keeps giving me an error . The app I was previously using told me I had to switch to this one because the old one was not going to work starting June 1 . It keeps saying my password or username is wrong when I know it's not and when I try to change it gives me an error message after waiting a long time to load to change the password . It says error has happened in server .,
Cant log in what wrong with the app. Trying many times but it failed. So frustrating.,
"I accidentally deleted my chart. I redownloaded it but I don't have my username. I've tried several times to get some kind of help but, nothing is working.",
Its not a great app. It has reminders but u cant make an appt with it. And the prescription page doesn't offer a delivery method.,
I like being able to have access to my records before I have to get a return appointment for a review. It saves stress of waiting.,
My favorite appointment app ever. I can't find anything wrong with this app and I've been looking and utilizing MyChart for 4 years now. It's awesome!!!,
The app is good. Too bad some doctors don't do follow-ups with this app. Some tell you to use it because it's your best way to be in contact but if you have to wait for months and still no kind of contact after tests it's almost useless .,
When I am communicating with my doctor and try to send a picture I get a message telling me the file is too big. I've tried to reduce the size to no avail.,
Not at all clear or user friendly when seeking out where to find the new actions the app shows have newly emerged.,
"It is very nice to be able to look at your own blood work, x-rays, MRI, etc results yourself instead of relying on doctors or nurses to explain it to you. It's also nice that the app allows you to chat with all of your doctors, nurses, and specialists. You can also look up any doctors near you and can request referrals all on the app.",
"I have unlimited access to my medications,appointments, billing estimates, x-rays, lab results, and direct messaging with my care team. App works perfectly recommend it highly",
I loved having this app during my recent hospital stay. I got all my test results and details of my procedures. Great useful app!,
"MyChart is the best medical app. I used MyChart since its beginning as a web portal to my med records. MyChart connects my PCP to my many specialists so they can share my records and reports. Importantly, my labs are shared, which keeps me from repeating them. It allows text conversations with your doctors, replies are usually same or next day. I have several apps since I care for several grandchildren, MyChart is the most popular. It is the easiest to use & clear instructions. AND NO ADS!",
"Excellent app, user friendly. Could improve by turning/updating functionality to include adding vaccinations completed outside/elsewhere, update health insurance and correct current address to reflect changes in realtime. (I.e changing am address today, and printing a form from last month, will not reflect the current address.",
"Great app to communicate with your doctor But the negative is that they only give you 350 letters to a message which for me is usually not enough because I'm always having to cut back my messages. Also, it keeps saying that I have a balance due when I don't and I messaged the billing dept at least 6 times. They final got back to me stating I don't owe anything and yet when I log onto My Chart, it still says I owe them money. All in all it is a great place to communicate with my doctors.",
Keeps me up-to-date on test results. Great app. I really appreciate being able to look up my results anytime.,
I like my chart app. Being able to see my test results within 24 hours or less eases my mind considerably.,
"I love having one place to find my information. They could improve the date when entering dates a calendar comes down and you have to click your way through the calendar, make it possible to simply enter the date.",
Easy to maneuver within the app. I like this app. It offers easy communication w MD office and staff of non-time-sensitive communiques.,
"I love MyChart! It's great for making appointments, messaging your Dr. and seeing test results...whether you want to or not! 😉 I appreciate this option.",
"Since the update yesterday, my e-check in won't work. It just freezes up in the app. 😬🤔",
I like getting info and not having to contact providers by phone all the time. I like being able to just send messages,
"I absolutely looove MyChart & use it all the time. Not only is it a good source to keep up with my appointment date/time, but I also think the staff do a terrific job of replying back (pretty fast!!) to any of my messages sent via MyChart. A great tool to use!!",
I tried using this app for a virtual appointment and the appointment was missed because of the app not working. I was penalized! I got an email saying that if it happened again they would drop me!! Such Bull!! So now I can't chance doing a virtual appointment for fear of being dropped. A big ole middle finger and thanks a lot. If I didn't need to use this stupid app I absolutely would not. #witchdoctor #thanksfornothing,
"MyChart is an awesome app. It makes the medical experience easy, making appts and getting in touch a breeze.",
Almost perfect! Everything I need to know and do regarding medical issues can be accessed through this app. Information is kept current. Having issues with the bill pay option this morning. Have contacted customer service. Will update later.,
Real time test results and quick responses to messages. This has been a great stress reliever,
"I really like the app it helps keep up with appointments,get fast test results and there is alot of other things that I haven't had a chance to look at .",
"Access to records, making or canceling appointments, checking test results, and after care notes all at your fingertips. This app is awesome.",
"Makes my life easier, I don't like filling out paper work at office. Test results faster. I love everything about it!",
"This MyChart app is a WONDERFUL tool. Using it is so easy and truly convenient when it comes to referrals, appointments & medication refills.",
I'd like the app a lot better if I was actually able to message my provider. That's an issue with U of L Physicians... Not the app.,
"I added My Chart app 2 yrs. ago. I get all my test results and summaries from all of my doctors fairly quick. When I have to speak to a nurse or do zoom with my doctor, the results come in pretty fast. Sometimes before I leave the hospital or doctors office. It has my personal information including any medications I presently take. I also receive all of my upcoming visits with date and time and what doctors office I have to be at. Lots more things on the menu to choose from. Try it.",
"Physician/hospital moved over to MyChart from Follow My Health app. Personally, I think FMH was more intuitive and easier to use.",
"Can no longer login on my pixel 7 pro, can only login via my desktop. My password works on mychart just won't login on the app it states it is not available.",
Michart is the best app I have ever uses for health care purposes. You can even share all your medical records with all the providers you see so that everyone who cares for you knows what is going on. I have an aggressive form of chronic leukemia and this has made cancer a little bit easier for me. Thanks mychart!!!,
Will not let you make a mri appointment as site said to use my chart site to due this . Am now on the phone trying to make a appointment and have been on hold 35 minutes and no one as of yet has answered. Had no problems when it was tower radiology.,
"EXCELLENT! Finally a repository for all my medical information: Visits, medications, health history, etc. No need to fill out those 7-page same-old information sheets every visit. Thank you.",
"In the past, I hated these apps for their lack of security and risk to my privacy, but now that I have found the MyChart app, I am thrilled to know the power of knowing my own information. This app works seamlessly and integrates not just one clinic or one doctor's office in the information that is offered. But as many as subscribe their clinics to the my chart app service. It has allowed me to see what doctors know but aren't telling me.",
"It's a great thing to be able to have access to your medical info, whenever you want/need, and this app does it, and more. Allows direct communication with your care team, review of all of your test results and more. Totally worth it to download/use this app.",
"This is the best Medical experience I've ever had, everything is in one place and I have access 24-7, And it's Easy to Understand.",
"I really enjoy using this app because it gives me all the information the doctor and I discussed and if I forgot something I can go back and read everything that was discussed and done at that visit. I like that I can send my PCP messages for refills or any health questions that I may have, the doctor answers very promptly and determines whether we can have a secure zoom call, or make an appointment for me to go in for an office visit.",
"I love my chart, you can get results the very same day you had your test! Dr notes, every thing in one chart.",
The app is fine but there are issues with how organizations use it. I have accounts with 2 organizations. I won't go into details for privacy reasons but hospitals in one organization don't use it for billing and most of the staff in the other organization don't seem to know how to use it (probably due to insufficient training).,
Easy to use. Great to have all medical info including appointments past and future in one place.,
I am enjoying having access to my medical info so fast. I also love the appointment reminders. It keeps me organized.,
Love this app. Easy to get messages to dr...refill scripts... ask questions...make appointments...see test results. Best app I've downloaded!,
"Absolutely love this APP!!! I have never felt so included or informed of my own medical care before! I was even able to use this APP in the Hospital! It keeps me updated on all my care, vaccinations, and appointments, and makes it possible to communicate with my Doctors at any time! If you are not sure about trying it, use it for just a couple of months and you'll be hooked!",
I like this app a lot and it keeps track of all of my messages and appointments and the use of it is very easy and understandable!!,
I love my chart. Very informative. Keeps me updated. Answers a ton of questions. Great communication over all.,
"Erratically works unable to get test data results. It cycles for a time and then states ""unable to connect to server"". Other information is available ex.""meds, appt. etc."" When it works it's great, unfortunately thats not often.",
Easy app to use. I like that you can cancel or change an appointment right on the app. E-check in is so much easier at home than on a clipboard at the office.,
This App helps me keep up with my appointment and times. Like getting all my labs at my finger tips. Thank You for all your help.,
I really like using MyChart for my child. Thankfully an employee at the front desk of the doctor's office set it up for me and it's been very easy to use. It helps me to remember when appointments are coming up. It gives me easy to read test results such as when he had to get tested for COVID-19 and u can get the results after the doctors office has closed.,
"Too often, after logging in, I get 404 - File or directory not found. When trying to view various items.",
"Great. however not all recent (2023) visits were posted ie cardiac cath lab (030123) and gasterol digestive center (03__23) procedures for endoscopy & colonascopy, latter two reflected as overdue in app while being current. Still the app and services all deserve FIVE STAR ratings for outstanding perfomance and functionality, simplicity yet thoroughness, user friendliness, patient convenience and instant availability of information. Ga Eye plus others all should use instead of separate apps.",
"I like the chart app I can keep on top of all my appointments, meds, test results, schedule appointments all in one location",
I have had such a hard time with this app. Everything I try to open a message or do a precheck in the app will give a error message. I have tried closing the app multiple times and reopening. It is frustrating. Please fix this problem.,
"Easy to use, informative, and biometric sign in! That stated I do not have the updated app.",
"Everyone should be using my chart. IT makes everything much easier yo do. Appts, sending e-mails to your doctors, etc... sign up!",
"It doesn't update your information properly, so you can get your meds sent to the wrong pharmacy despite having updated your information. Also, it is not linked to your provider's network, so if you change your information there, it will not update this... Again, potentially resulting in your meds going to the wrong place.",
"Can't imagine managing my Healthcare without the MyChart app; easy, user friendly, all my information in one place. Thank you!",
"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Results are fast, easy to get. Reminders and what happened are great to have. One negative, upcoming tests and procedures also show stuff from a couple of years ago.",
"The MyChart app is very easy to use, it has many options available for us. This application allows me to get information about my Healthcare. I'm able to refill medications, schedule appointments, communicate with my care team Dr.s, get test results, copies of records, research medical information, referrel's as well as reference materials and other useful information. I can not say enough about how vital this application is for continued healthcare support for myself. Awesome application!! 👍💯",
I am able to see my test results quickly and get in touch and leave messages any time day or night. I love having 24/7 access.,
I'm super happy with this app. I'm able to email my doctor and get test results as soon as they get in. It's very convenient,
I use this for all my medical appointments. Talk to my physician. Check test results. Ask any questions I might have with any of my physicians at St. V's. So much easier to handle all my needs in one place. Love it!,
"The MyChart accounts from Optum, Swedish, Everett Clinic etc. don't seem capable of talking to each other even though some physicians work for both Swedish and the Polycinic. Other than that the Epic App is OK. It is not intuitive. ""Letters"" for instance is obscure..what would I expect to find there? Its lacks an accessible overview of tasks..where can I go to learn about linking accounts? From the left menu what does ""Questionnaires"" contain? When would I use it?",
"This app is a very good way for me to not miss an appointment and to schedule everything I need to do before going to my appointment. I can see what the status of my situation, doctors evaluation and summary of all visits to share with my pcp, family and friends. A very easy app to carry with you and have the information right at hand.",
"Great app! Easy to navigate. Keep the information you need and want up to date. Allows sharing between different facilities. Updates are real time. If you see something you don't understand, you can question you physician.",
Had my annual blood tests this morning. This evening was able to see the results in the app. Such an approvement over waiting a week a week or more. Like the way the results are shown compared with the normal range. Updated to 5*. Had a screening blood test this morning. Saw the result in the app this evening. Normal as I expected. Being one of life's worriers it saved me days of anxiety,
There are some places where you have to log out to go back to the main menu. I will still use it put it is not always the easiest to navigate.,
I'm having trouble with the app wanting to go to the play store for me to open it. I switched to a new phone and this is when it started.,
"This app makes remembering my appointments and refilling my prescriptions so much easier and I love that I can talk to my doctor or a nurse any time, 5*",
"Love the app, it makes a hectic appointment schedule easier to keep trake of. Two suggestions to make it even better... 1) make it to where an EMS can open a QR code that contains pertinent information on the lock screen. 2) a pill reminder. There are apps out there for that but they all stink.",
Once I learned to use it and get my passcode in system . it was easy. Very informative thank you.,
"This app is the best creation since sliced bread! It's easy to sign up, navigate, contact your providers, and share Medical notes 💜",
"This app is great, one place to keep track of appointments, test results, messages. Easy to use and secure.",
"I can stay in touch with any of my doctors, I have never had a problem...I can see when my medicine needs to be refilled. I use this application at least once in a two weeks. It really saves me money because I can update my doctors about anything going on with my health, and they can update me of needed procedure they need before my appointment.",
"Great app for keeping me up-to-date on appointments and tracking medical records. It's user-friendly, too.",
"I can only log into the app. When I log into the app, my primary care physician does not come up on my care team. Then, I try to log in on my browser. When I try logging in on a browser, my username and password NEVER work. It is THE most frustrating thing!",
"4-12-23: Love the latest update , works perfect and the team was very helpful with my last issue. Thanks for the Help guys (Epic Systems Co. ) . (8-24-20)Doesn't Work On My Galaxy Note, It Always Gives Me An Error ( There Was A Problem Communicating With The Server. Please Try Again Later. ) My phone is conected to the 4g network, works perfect with all other apps and its been like this for months. I have to use the MD Anderson Website to check my chart.",
I wanted to add a comment at this time about a suggestion that I have that I believe may enhance the user going forward. I was trying to schedule an appointment today for a eye exam. I think that we should have the capability of searching for speciality departments with Dr. That are not listed in the care team list. Therefore enabling an option to make appts. With depts. that we have not yet received care from.,
The app is awesome but when provider offices do not respond it seems pointless to communicate thru the app. Having all information as long as you only go to one healthcare system. It would be nice for all to be able to populate app of choice!,
"Perfect means of keeping up with medical history. Each health care professional connected to the program has access to see needed information. Great way to communicate with your health system. Liked that move from GA to FL info, I was able to transfer health care info at a touch of a button.",
Very convenient and always get a response from someone in a very efficient time frame. Love this app.,
"This app is not user-friendly. Hard to get to needed apps. Like menu,' visit and meds. I feel with a few tweaks, It can always get better. For the most part. It's alright.",
Good system and good way of organizing scheduled appointments. Respects freedom of expression that is legitimate. Healthcare information is well guarded.,
"I love this app. The doctors and nurses are extremely fast with response times, and I've never had any issues with it. I love it, I would certainly recommend using it if you can.",
It is a good useful app and I can talk to my doctor on there about my prescriptions and refill them from there and do a whole lot more on the app,
This app makes staying in touch with your health team so easy.. I would highly recommend it to all those who use Healthy U!!?,
"Used to follow all my Dr appointments. And in the hospital I was able to follow my meds and test results. Also letters from my Doctors help a lot. It's also great to manage my prescriptions with my pharmacy,Doctors, and Health provider. Use it every day. Love mychart.",
Great idea but horrible implementation. Screenshot of medical records are intentionally blocked. You can't schedule an appointment with a new doctor. Search by physician's name isn't working. Can't send a message or request appointment with new provider either. My wife has the same issues with a different Android phone.,
It's so easy to get my results or leave messages for my caregivers directly. Having mychart makes it easy to show providers out of the network my results.,
"Easy to use and covers everything for medical. Appts, making appts, medication refills and questions, tests and the results. Messages to your provider with answers in a timely manner. Even e-check-ins! My Chart takes away stress for medical appointments.",
"I love this app.. everything about my medical issues, appointments, meds list and surgeries are listed and I can access it from anywhere. I don't have a bunch of mail coming into the house to be misplaced and it is a good thing for our environment.",
"Med list is inaccurate, message section only allows vaccine appointment. Very limited functionality, previous app was better",
Amazing app that lets me take responsibility for my own medical information and even provides me with hopeful videos and reminders to keep myself healthy.,
"Tou dont have ro wait long for Test results and it makes a real easy to keep in touch with your doctor I wish to had this when I was young, it's amazing.",
"Love having the my chart app, it's a game changer. I've seen a doctor via video visit two different times now when I had minor unexpected medical issues come up, I put in a request and was talking to a doctor less than 15mins later and never had to leave my bed, I got the antibiotics I needed and it was so much faster and easier than going to the e.r. or walk in clinic. I also do all my paperwork on the app so I don't have to do it when I have a visit, just show up and see the doc.",
"Biometrics are a joke. Works for a while and then stops. NOT A PROBLEM with other apps on the same device. I have 3 linked organizations. I fix Biometrics for 1, it breaks for the previously working organization. Painfully frustrated.",
"This app was a wonderful way of keeping in touch with my provider, especially when I am out of state and need something. Unfortunately, I have not been able to log on with either my phone or my tablet. To make matters worse, I can't even log on using my laptop. It's totally useless!",
Getting to almost perfect. I'm glad you added Print option I'm sick of taking pictures of my screen with another camera,
"Since I have no other app to compare it to, I have to say that I have really enjoyed the ease of obtaining my medical information on MyChart.",
"I am not retracting my statement. This app has made nothing easier. It's just a big run around to get something actually accomplished is ridiculous. I spend half the time just trying to figure out how to use it, what terms are, so I can figure out where I need to be or look to get simple answers to simple questions, not having to use an app to get medical help? Just not humane.",
"The app is good for the most part, the UI is alot to get used to and sucks but once you get used to it its not terrible",
There was nothing wrong with the old app...if it's not broken don't fix it...updating and changing stuff is when there are problems,
"Excellent tool and resource for managing appointments, medications, and other medical needs all in one place.",
"Very easy and convenient for everyone. No calling and sometimes you will ha to wait to schedule an appointment due to checking availability. Awesome app, highly recommended!",
"This is easy to use, uses biometric login, and easy to schedule appointments as well as reach out to your doc to ask questions.",
Great app. Convenient when your on the go. If you need refills or just a appointment it's at the palm of your hand. They also can have a doctor available through video if need be. Great app all around.,
The culture at YNHH is all over this app and it is not for patients' convenience or well being. The required information when not inputted as expected which is unclear makes the app a very poor design.,
"This is BY FAR the most ""user friendly"" medical app out there! I see other physicians on different apps and the can't compare with My Chart! I have two that use the same app and I can't even switch back and forth! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ❤️ MY CHART!!! EASY TO USE! EASY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR DOCTORS. EASY TO GET TEST RESULTS! IT'S GREAT 👍",
"I very much enjoy the use of this app. It's easy to navigate, the items come up quickly, and I get to be more involved with my health. I'm actually seeing the test results and can be better prepared when I go in for the results to be discussed with my doctor. I can ask more relevant questions so I understand what and why things are being done. Wish we had this sooner but, technology, has to be invented first, right!?",
Server Error Non stop!!! Everytime I try to check my test results that it tells me I have it says server error! I repeatedly get the same message over and over even after I check them! How are you supposed to keep up on your health if you can't even access it.,
1. NO BACK BUTTON!!! Must log out and back in each time to view another page - VERY ANNOYING 2.Takes way too long to load! 3. Cannot reschedule an appointment - must cancel appt. Then log out only to discord that you cannot reschedule online/within the app - again VERY ANNOYING May I suggest that the developers use the app too - so they actually experience how the app performs,
I can not log into nor change my password or anything. I have been trying for a week straight and I can not get help from anyone as to why it is causing me issues.,
"I LOVE MyChart! It makes it so easy to review my appointment notes, send messages to my Doctor's, and check-in. Thank you very much! 😊😁🤗🥰",
This is so much worse than the app integrity used to use. Slow slow slow. Email never loads....it's horrible.,
"As long as you have computer sense, all your health needs can be accomplished on the MyChart app. Scheduling appointments, refilling prescriptions, checking lab results, look up drug or medical information., it's all here. The biggest complaint that I have is when requesting a medicine refill, I don't always get an acknowledgement in a timely fashion. I feel that it's important to know that the doctor has been sent the request immediately after putting in the request.",
I really like being able to go to My Chart for information on past and future appointments. And also to be able to communicate about concerns that may come up.,
"Very convenient but sometimes hard to use when it comes. Tools signing in, but other than that if you remember everything, it's a really great out to use to keep track of paying bills and knowing when appointments are.",
Love it! It's great for keeping appointments fore and my kids. I can see every note transcript and prescription.,
"Awful every time I try to look at anything (letters, notes, etc) it's says error occurred. I can't never look at anything",
"Love being able to communicate with my providers, check in for appointments, and check my labs without additional phone calls or sitting on hold.",
"Great app!!! Easy to use and I'm able to keep up with my entire family's appointments. Some same day test results show up. This is a really good app, haven't had no problems or gliches since installing.",
Great experience with MyChart. Keeps all my info secure to everyone else but accessible by me. Easy to use.,
I have repeated messages from you my email my text messages I mean it's to the point of ridiculous when I do read a message... It's still hits all my boxes and then all my lab results and stuff like that half of them I can find and then the other half I got 1500 time saying that their are new results and they're not! There the exact same results that I have to go over and over and over and over because I keep getting the same messages 4 to 5 times a day... My appointments not right ever!!!!!!,
"This app is all over the place, very hard to understand. If you need to leave a message you have to pick a provider,"" provider""? Provider is either a doctor or medical professional?? How do I know which Medical Professional I need if I have a question? Now, I keep getting sent emails that say do not reply, wants me to keep updating my chart which it's been updated, I can update it everyday and still get these annoying emails. Constantly saying I have messages, and no messages exist",
It's a pain I can't use app. I put in Tennessee instead of Michigan. Miss my dr appt 2x. I hate this stupid app. I had to reload 3x before I could even get in.,
It's great to see lab results as they happen and consult with doctors on the fly. Sharing results with non-Montage doctors is so much easier than alternatives. It's also easy to understand the reasons for each test and interpret the results.,
I don't check this daily and have missed things. I prefer a call and the ability to actually talk to a person,
Charged six times for a video visit that never happened. Called billing only to transferred and hung up on multiple times.,
"Great way for docs to share info. However, I keep getting a message saying we are unable to link your linked accounts. I have no idea what that means.",
All of your health information in one spot. My favorite feature is being able to change personal info without having to talk to someone. Syncs easily with Google calendar.,
It's really very good that they have this app. We use it all the time. It's a great way to get things done really fast. The doctors are fast about getting back to you. Me and my family love this app.,
"This app is great, they keep track of all my meds, I get my blood test results that day which is important because I have Leukemia. Kees track of my doctor appointments and gives me a report of the doctors notes and reports. Can text my doctors office directly for med refills, also keeps my immunizations and when I need to update, and more, this might be the most important app you should have",
Easy access to personal information. Share with my daughter so she is kept up to date on my medical issues. Great app.,
Easy to use! Wish all organizations with Epic would use the standard MyChart app and not try to rebrand theirs as something special (Trinity),
"Seemed a great App. However, just when I needed to show someone a letter, it kept telling me there was a server error, try again later. Most frustrating.",
I had trouble logging on initially but after that I live this app. I can find most of the information needed quickly and easily.,
"MyChart portal helps me keep abreast of my current health related appointments, reminders, test results, diagnosis, health history, etc.",
"Simple to use and great to be able to access test results virtually as they are reported instead of having to call the hospital or consultant for them, biometric login adds an additional layer of security. Charts in isolation for repeat tests do however make it difficult to to determine trends over time. Hopefully they will eventually add a graphical representations of test results vs time for each measurement.",
I love that all the providers have access to the same info so you don't have to drag records around or worry about someone not being up to speed,
I love it thst I can communicate with my Dr's through the app. I can also pay my bills and request medication refills. I love My Chart.,
"Couldn't get to any mesages, summaries or any information I needed. I dispize the app. Never had much luck using it.",
"I am 70 years old and not a techy, but I find My Chart to be user-friendly. I'm so glad I finally started using it.",
This is a really great app. Being chronically ill I depend on it to keep track of meds and test results. To stay in contact with all my Drs. and make appts and much needed video visits. I recommend highly.,
"Really good as get info much quicker, than waiting for a letter, which is great for results.",
It's a great way to communicate but unfortunately you can never get anyone to get back to you if you have a question with test results or meds. You're better off calling the office and waiting 3 or 4 days for a answer. I was personally told by the doctors office that no one monitors the MyChart At St Mary's. But if you want to get a look at your test results your golden on this app.,
I love this app. I have no problems sending my Dr's messages or getting refills. This is the best app. I don't like the fact that it has been giving me problems linking with the other agencies but that's not the end of the world still a great app.,
"The only thing that opens on my chart is my visits. My messages, prescriptions, tests, health problems, etc. will not open. It has turned out to be just a headache.",
"Great, I love the ability to view all of my test results and the availability to interact with my doctors and nurses directly.",
"it a good app, but it could use some updating. Tracking your next appointments should have its own folder so you can click on up coming appointments, to keep track of your appointments.",
"I received a letter that I wanted to print or download, but could not do either. I admire the privacy protection but where is the line drawn.",
"MyChart is s really helpful app. It really makes communication and info sharing functional and relatively easy. Some navigation could be smoother, but it's all there. Thank you.",
Appointments cannot be booked because you can't enter text in the last prompt. Problem on android and apple.,
I've been using this app for awhile and have been very satisfied with it. It reminds me of most visits and I can look back after the visit to see details they entered. It also reminds or suggests medical things I may want to check with my Dr about. I can also look up older tests to see what the results were.,
"Things are good. I do like in person talks and phone calls also. Don't forget to encourage face to face, and phone calls to talk about issues. Personal touch in Healthcare, needs to still be a focus. Please.",
"MyChart presents a clear picture of what we have going on, right in front of us. Reading results must help our doctors explain what is happening and what we are dealing with in our health. Our physicians have this info as a tool for them. Every bit of data can be read and surmised accordingly.",
"Very easy to read, understand, navigate and stay on top of things. I love that you can see everything in one place AND electronically keeps my medical records organized.",
The app doesn't no longer sink between other places like hospitals and it is making things a lot harder then it has to be can you please fix it thank you,
I like any patient portal that works. I find the problem with the fact that the docs and their Fellows don't seem to monitor it. Portal is great for getting scripts refilled. I'm unable to print documents off of this account too!,
"It would be nice if the information was updated occasionally, and people would reply to emails promptly.",
Didn't like it when it first came out wouldn't let me talk to my Dr.directly . But as time moved on I have come to rely on it .good information Dr. notes/ summary appt. dates (I was always losing paper dates),
"This dr's office has always been very professional, timely, and clean through out their main lobby, x-ray, & exam room. They've always answered all questions to my satisfaction.",
For the most part I love it. It has made life so much easier when trying to make apps or talking with your care team.,
Very easy and convenient to use. Formatting is nice and my experience thus far has been extremely positive.,
"I LOVE this new APP. WHERE has it been? Easy access to refills without calling doc or pharmacy. Message doctor, ask question just like instant messages. View results and what the doctor thinks and changes. It tracks your appointment and future appointments. I'm a person who forgets dates very often, this app has made me more responsible in keeping track of my health. Thank you EPIC!",
I genuinely love this app. Makes it very easy to contact my Drs and read all my test results. But because I can see all my tests (I'm guessing) the Drs now do not explain to me what the test results were or what's wrong with me. I only found out that I have slippage in my spine and degeration in my neck cause I read the reports myself... I just the Dr just didn't think it was important enough to tell me about 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️,
"All around such a helpful tool. Love getting my test results as soon as they are available. I dont have to wait until I see my Doctor, it eliminates some anxiety. This ap keeps all my medical appointments recorded and im reminded when i have an appointment coming up. So helpful!",
"Love this. I can get test results right away and schedule a follow up appointment if needed instead of having to wait for the doctor to see them and call me. Time is essential when you've got an infection or are in pain. Also, I can send a message to someone on my care team instead of playing phone tag. This app has many great features.",
Reminds me when things are coming up and when I'm going to need to refill. I love this new app! I definitely needed this.,
I really enjoy the app. I can go to it and see everything from past present and future appointments medicine I take and Dr's note.,
"This is a must have app. (Especially for seniors or those with multiple health issues, doctors & nurses). I don't know how I ever got along without it. With this app I am better informed & more likely to keep appointments. Test results are generally available within 1 day. These are just a few of the many benefits of using My Chart.",
"This is a good app for keeping up with dr appts, scheduling just about any kind of appt and getting tests results quickly and accurately.",
"This app is nice, but I would like to see pending results for the first 3 days before getting actual results. Other than that, it is very user-friendly. 😉",
"As a care giver, this app helps me and my client coordinate all of our appointments, seamlessly! Very thorough, easy to navigate, and easy to share information with doctors outside of the AHN network! Real time updates, we can ask questions, cancel appointments if need be. If you are in the AHN network, I highly recommend this app!!!",
Excellent way to communicate to who you need. And to have Test records at your fingertips tips is essential. See appointments and other features available are excellent. Best app Ever.,
This app is easy to use and convenient. What could become days of back and forth via the telephone is reliably answered within a day or two . I just wish that all of my providers used MyChart. My life would be far easier if they did.,
"I love using the MyChart application. The test results for my labs pop up before I usually even make it home! When I suddenly realize that I hae only 1 week of medication left and its a mail order, 90 day prescription, I can send a message through the Patient Portal, and this really get things rolling quickly that way. I can also send copies of my medical info to friends or family. I love MyChart!!",
Really like this app- easy to navigate. Only concern is when the app gets hacked all my medical info will be out there.,
"This makes my hectic life with various specialists so much easier. Especially since I have been hospitalized so much since November. Thanks for creating something simple for patients like me that are confined quite often! I love being able to combine various health organizations for easier access to my records. Also, love only using a pin # for sign in!",
Has some nice features but lousy function. Does not allow you to back out or reach other pages.,
"Can't save my user generated password to Google,... bummer! Sorry, for my delayed response, but I need to understand why a four digit number is more secure than my 25 digit “Password Generator” code that contains digits from every one of the four groups. What I can’t figure out is; “Are you serious or just being condescending?”.",
"Love this app. And being able see test results anytime. It's easy to be able to refill prescriptions, make or reschedule apps. And being able to send and receive messages from my Dr.",
So easy to use and saves holds on the phone. Test results are almost immediate,
I wish the MyChart app was a little bit more integrated with the phone due to the fact that I'm always missing appointments because I put them on my calendar but I never get reminders I never hear reminders walk out on your alarms going off and I have it set for a day before I just wish to Notifications at the upcoming appointments were more loud attention getting,
My chart is the best thing that Lincoln Hospital has done for the patient. Yes Please keep me posted of all the progress or details that are needed for me.,
This is a handy app to have. Keeps track of your Dr visits both prior and the future visits. Also several other handy needs all in one app.,
I really like using this app. You can see all your previous and upcoming appointments. All your post surgical notes and All test results at the touch of your finger. It's actually one of my Favourite apps.,
This is a real handy dandy app... You sometimes get your test results faster than the DR does... lol ... I love this app a real game changer for me!!!,
"It's difficult, if not impossible, to find what the message is! Nothing has a ""dot"" or other indicator. And when it says it's sending me a code, it never does. Frustrating system!",
"it's really convenient for both you and your Primary Physicians and Specialists, (if they have MyChart abilities) to be on the same page. User friendly also...I really am grateful for it. I am hearing impaired, so the ability to connect with my health officials is paramount. :)",
"What happened to your application?! I used it just last week, and all was great. Now, everything on my account is totally blank... even my mug shot.",
"All important information at your fingertips. Upcoming visits, tests, and medical reminders.",
"Dont usually do the app thing but this one makes keeping up witb medical stuff so much easier. Instead of calling waiting for a response that may not come just message and wait a little bit. Prescriptions, appointments, test results and instructions all right here. Just havnt figured out how to delete old messages yet.",
Good app but new change to app made calendar entries with app as person scheduling meeting and I am not able to edit the meeting.,
"Very easy to navigate, and very easy to check in prior to appointments.",
"It's okay, but not great. It won't let me schedule an appointment via the app except for my primary doctor. For example I can't schedule an appointment with the podiatrist I've seen 4 times.",
"My Chart, for myself, is the best thing to happen. It is very ""patient usable!""",
Love getting my lab results and scans even before my doctor does. Love the message feature where I can ask my care team questions and get answers without having to play phone tag with them.,
"Easy to use, very helpful with appointments. Medical records and contacting providers.",
So far it's easy and great. I no longer have to carry a huge file folder with all my paperwork. Great job. I'm 48 yrs old and took a while to finally transition to new technology. Lol. It's more convenient though. Thanks. Lalo Vasquez,
"Easy to use, and fast response from offices. Thank you for creating such a reliable liaison.",
I can see my test results fast. Easy to use. Easy to get refills when my prescription run low.,
"The doctors or nurses don't respond, I had an emergency and my primary doctor still hasn't contacted me and I reached out to them via MyChart 5 times with no response. This app is a joke because no one in clinic responds to emergencies.",
"Great time saving app with a multitude of much needed personal medical information from your providers and hospitals and a fast way to send messages to clinics and providers, make appointments, handle billing and insurance information and claims, see lab and test results most times even before your provider does. You can also link multiple providers and hospitals in the same app. One of the greats apps I've ever used.",
I love this app so much. It's so easy to see every test result & appointment. I love being able to message each team from each department. I go out of my way to only go to hospitals that use this app.,
"The app is so in informative, and easy to use. I enjoy the fact that I don't have to call the lab for my test results. Another plus the app has, is the abbilily you have to message your doctor, as well as, request an appointment. I really like this app.",
"I enjoy being able to keep up with my medical content, as I've learned over the years, you have to be Your Own ADVOCATE! Check the notes logged by the Nurses and CALL the doctor's office at that time to have Corrections made. Interpretations are Different for ALL! Great App other than THAT.",
"No ads , can link all of your providers for them to have easy access, can see your test results, appointment times get reminders, and message your providers easily the only thing I do not like it not all providers as in different companies are not in MyChart. I have 3 of the 4 offices/companies I go to the 4th one I have to use their portal that is not like MyChart nor offers everything",
"I love my chart. It's easy to use. My only complaint, the response time lags when I need a phone call back. That's all.",
"I believe I have been using MyChart ever since 2015 if I am recalling accurately. It has enabled me to keep up with my doctor's appointments and to be able to communicate with all Medical Staff Members across the board. I find using MyChart has been more than quite helpful in many areas and would be very much at a total disadvantage if it were ever taken away from the patients use. Anjelica Precious Brandi, aka Joseph Wallace",
Great way to have access to health info from any location to ensure accurate and relevant treatments as needed.,
"I agreed to pay 50 dollars a month,then it said it would be taking 379 dollars a month out. Not doable at all. We are on social security and can't afford more than 50 monthly.",
"Absolutely AWEFULL! I can't get past the my information page, always saying, invalid information. I finally called the provided number only to be told to leave a message and someone would contact me within 24 hours. Not acceptable, I'm here now and I know the information I'm providing is indeed correct.",
"All I ever get, if I manage to get though is""sever error not able process. So my chart is useless David Marsden",
I get a lot of messages saying I have a new message on MyChart but when I go there I can't find any new messages.,
Love this app so much. Everything is at your fingertips. Easy to use and easy to navigate through it. I thank God for given you all the skills and intelligence to come up with this app for us to use. Thank you again.,
"Both their app and website work like trash. Can't even sign in 99% of the time. Has no problem telling me I have statements from my doctor in my email but my login info never works. So I try to reset password. It says my username is wrong. I try to get my username, but it will not send me the email. I have scoured my Inbox, Spam, and Trash folders while waiting HOURS. I am currently on hold waiting for a representative to talk to. Absolute worst trash possible. Would rather die slowly over this.",
"My Chart has been an amazing tool for me to ask questions that I normally wouldn't do to my specialists. They answer within 24 hours, which I find amazing. I can take charge of my own health by reviewing my tests and blood work. When you see several specialists, things sometimes get missed. I believe it's our responsibility to take charge of our own health, and with My Charts, I can easily do that. You can even. Invite a Proxy to join.",
"Since this app was introduced to me by my physician, it's been very easy-to-use, easy to navigate, and easy to make readily available test results and communication with my physician's, a one stop shop, for all my health issues. Thanks My Chart.",
"On point for the most part. I have a few diagnoses, found about three errors that need too be updated, but other than that it's just good too be able too follow my medical life and history in general. I'll see if I can get my primary, who I think a lot of, too correctly rectify.",
Great service. Easy to use. I see docs get results for tests quickly; ca neave and receive messages to/from doc and others as sell as pay Bill's and keep up with upcoming schedules events etc. Truly great service Great app,
"Love this app , makes it so convenient to set up appointment s, ordering med's and being in contact with my doctor. I highly recommend it.",
"I find this app very helpful and convenient when I have a question, easy check in before the appointment and for prescription renewal requests.",
This app is VERY user friendly! It's my favorite app. It's my favorite way to communicate with my doctors. Very nicely done Kootenai Health!,
"I love the ease of using the app, scheduling, seeing results and documentation. Being able to access my entire recent medical history is invaluable.",
My chart makes it so easy from any device. Integrates well with any phone or device. Can manage many health providers for your family,
Best. I love the way it shows test results. It plots it in an easy to read range. It doesn't do this as nicely from a PC.,
"Really liking it so far, I can see what the Dr. Has put in the notes and helps me to remember when my appointments are coming up.",
Amazing app which gives personal access to all your medical records and tests. This is long overdue and gives patients the chance to compare previous checks and identify changes. At a time when the NHS and GP surgeries are under huge pressure this app allows every patient to take better responsibility for their health and care.,
I find using MyChart very helpful in keeping track of my medical care. I recently was traveling and had to use a series of urgent care facilities that did not use MyChart. It was much more challenging to track the appointments and care for follow-up.,
"I was in the hospital at Duke for two months and was tested extensively daily. My test results were available to me almost immediately. And if you need to get in touch with your doctor or nurse, they answer your messages, sent on the app, in a very timely manner. I also use the app to pay my bill. Your statement is always available. I reccomend this app if you use Duke healthcare.",
"makes it easy to see test results and message my doctors! also, the UI is intuitive and divided up smartly. push notifications so I never miss an appointment.",
I like the ease of use but wish you could remove automated reminders for things you don't need.,
"At first the app was overwhelming but after getting the hang out it, it became easier. I still struggle from time to time but it's way better than dealing with these hospitals call centers.",
Having MyChart is very handy. It helps with the stress levels of waiting for results.,
I love being able to see all of my medical information in one place. I also like seeing detailed test results usually before I get home. It gives me great versatility and allows me to be in charge of my own health care. It also saves me time at the doctors office or hospital when I can fill out most of my documents before I leave my home.,
I appreciate my medical info being available to me. I like being to cancel and/or schedule appointments online and I like being able to message my providers.,
I have very complicated and fragile health. This is great for appointments and test results.,
"I love it!!!! Test results back and the answers before I go to an appointment. It reminds me of appointments I have and gets me there on time. With life being so busy and children I am lucky to remember my name, Thanks to My Chart it does it all for me.",
Great way to prepare for upcoming visits and follow up. Very informative. Easy to contact doctors and staff.,
"I absolutely love this app!!!! It is so informative, and it is amazing to have all of my records in 1 location!!",
I really like using My Chart. It's pretty easy to manipulate and I can see future apps and plan accordingly. The after care reports are good to review and print out if necessary. Pretty good system.,
Works great. Get test results fast. Easy to schedule appointments and get ahold of my care team.,
"A very helpful and capable Health Service system. Plenty of personal information at your finger tips, securely safe, I can even see types, and how many screws the surgeon's used in my fracture arms and hip after my RTA. Very impressed with App thus far, and I've had it for nearly a year now.",
"An excellent communication tool that also gives you your test results, letters and so much more.",
"The portal makes it very convenient to communicate with my doctors and his nurses, see test results, refill prescriptions and more, I love it.",
"Suggested ""upgrades"" : *Ability to export lab results (excel, table, chart) *Ability to communicate with a current or previous provider/physician. All healthcare professionals should be listed as a provider if they are able to go into a patients chart and add notes about the patients admission/visit. *Visit Notes: Make new and/or updated notes added through an addendum stand out from the rest of the text (highlight, bold, different font-text/color)",
"You can do virtually everything from this my chart app. You can see doctors notes and recommendations that wasn't mentioned , pharmacy refills, they're awesome. I suggest you down load this app tf you go to St. Vincent hospital. It could save you a whole lot of time, plus it expedites the processing of intake to free up to take care of important duties. My opinion but schedule appointment immediately with tella health video visits. My Doctor, Dr. Kevyn Jacklyn Stroebe has actually no kidding",
Up to date information & time saving. Questions & inquiries always answered in a timely manner.,
"It is nice to have scheduling ,all of your results from testing as well as your records in one place.",
"Was working great, and I was able to access multiple orgsnizations. Then I had trouble logging in to my PCM. Once that was resolved, I tried to log in to my Paarkinson's Neurologist, a different organization, and that organization logged into my PCM.",
"There are many things that I like about this app, but it would be helpful to add directions to the office where your appointment is. Not just the address, but ""go to Outpatient and check in at the Registration Desk"" or ""Your doctor is located on the 1st Floor of the Doctor's Center to the right.""",
This app is an awesome view of your life as the Drs see it and a great way to keep up with your history.,
"Can't live without, get all the help and everything else medical on this platform. Highly recommend.",
The new my chart is very good...very easy to navigate through all the information.,
"This app has helped me stay on top of my health TREMENDOUSLY. If this is comparable with the doctors you usually use, I HIGHLY recommend. I get lab results immediately and see my upcoming appointments along with the notes from previous appointments!!! I love this so much and it's sooooo useful.",
"I Believe MyChart Is Really Good Since There Updates To The Whole App. However I Feel Like They Could Improve A Lil More. I Have My Notifications On & They Have Phone # But It Doesn't Always Let Me No & Send Me A Text When I Have New Test Results. I Feel Like Somehow They Can Change The Amount Of Time To Be Faster Between The Time The App Gets It, Til A Text Is Sent Because I Have Gone On MyChart Before & Had New Test Results, Or Messages Etc. But I Didn't Receive A Text About It.",
Highly Recommend! It makes my medical stuff so easy. It's like having a medical info office in your pocket.,
great app. I love how test results are sent straight to me as soon as the doctors get them. if I have a question about the results I can easily ask a question in the app. you can schedule appointments or have medications refilled. you can even send your doc a direct message. I love it. ★★★★,
"It's great, I love MyChart it works perfectly and anything I need I don't have to wait its right there when I need it .",
Doesn't show cancelations in my ap when I can't get in for 6 months and am on waitlist. The ap support people couldn't fix it.,
System crashes often can't connect with servers. Need the ability to print or email lab or notes. It's easier for outside providers to view my records when needed.,
"I love this app it has everything in one convenient place, and the reminders a greatly appreciated 👍🙂.",
Love that you get to see your results faster then having to wait to go see you OB...also that it tells you when your medication is ready for pick up and more i just love this app,
"It is indescribable & magnificent, generous 2 whom dedicatetheir time 2 this application, perform and be aware of every step in our health, have the ability, the benefit and the power to edit oneself changes necessary to update even the smallest detail for the benefit of oneself and at the same time update, facilitate and let know the staff of our health care any necessary changes is fantastic in my way of seeing how technology is not always for bad and this time did a good positive help.",
"I enjoy having all my medical in one place, and the scheduling abilities of this app are very helpful!",
Love. OSF St. Luke's Hospital. They get you right in for your testing. Scheduling is fast and easy. Very nice finding a date that worked for me. And they are so caring,
Very easy to use and makes things so much better to just be able to see all ur results or message ur provider if u have questions,
"I got my test results really fast! This is very convenient, and super helpful.",
I love this feature. So nice to be able to see all my appointments and results and talk to staff through it.,
"I love this app! The creators and office do a great job at keeping you informed about your upcoming visits, your healthcare, and lab results. I've never had an app like this to where you can ask a question and have it answered that same day usually within the hour. It's an amazing way to in touch with your health.",
I enjoy being able to see my test results and being able to get a message to my doctor the best. Great app and easy to use.,
It is a life saver. I forget my appointment times so often so it's great that I can look them up on MyChart,
"Hello. I think the app. Is very useful no need to wait for letters in the post, but its stressful, find your user name, then your password then a code is sent which you must enter quickly, not intuitive at all. Thanks",
"So easy to use. Results, messages and appointments are easy to navigate",
Can't sign up without a code. The app glitches when the option is chosen. Almost like it was deliberately designed to. The code was supposed to be in the after visit paperwork. It is not. This is medical gaslighting. (for any lawyers who can who recognize it.),
"This is not a good thing for some seniors. It is difficult hard to understand. There is nothing better then to speak with a live person, to make you feel like a human, talking to machines is making me feel like a number someone's pay check, nothing personal nor do I feel cared for. Just a number .!",
I can not access all my doctors or make an appointment with a doctor unless listed. It's very frustrating.,
"I forgot to respond....I was able to access everything in MyChart from 4G (I do not have 5G, yet), and so everything is GREAT!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MyChart- I use it ALL the time!! It pangs me that not every healthcare facility doesn't use MyChart- in fact so many have their own making it nuts to be downloading many different individual portals!!",
"NOT reliable. Cancelled appointment and was charged $50 for a missed appointment. I know I canceled because I did not get many, many emails and app notifications for the upcoming appointment including e check-in. I will never use this app again",
"Easy to use, always up to date, VERY informative for our health needs and concerns!",
"I really like this app...It makes scheduling, getting results and messaging my care team very convenient...😘",
Very through. Always up to date. Helps with medical appointments and visit summaries.,
Overall it works reasonably well. It's just crazy that there's no ability to print documents off directly from the app. That's pretty important and should be made a priority.,
"I have several different doctors at two hospitals. This app is easy to use and allows me to see everything that I need to know in one place. I can see doctors' notes, send providers messages, schedule appointments, and pay my bills all at the tip of my fingers.",
I love this app. It helps make my life a bit easier. Thank you to my whole care team and the maker of my chart.,
"Very easy to use. Can see visits and notes the Dr. Leaves, test results, etc.",
This app has made managing my chronic illness so much easier. From listing upcoming doctor appointments to seeing lab results right away to reading your doctor's notes in their after visit summary. I strongly recommend this app to anyone who is dealing with a life changing health condition.,
It has made communication with primary care team faster. Easy to maneuver even for old schoolers.,
Organizations that I've never visited before are showing up in my chart. I tried to delete them but can't find a way.,
"Sooo much easier than playing phone-tag with a whole array of teams of doctors, and test results show up as soon as they're entered into your charts so you can get the info to research & have questions ready before your followup.",
"Easy to use, very useful for message and updates on tests and meds. I'm liking this.",
Connecting with providers is easier through my chart. They message back within 24 hours. Loving it.,
My Chart makes my health check ups easier. Also I'm more on track with my health and appointments remiders and also get to ask questions or view test results in a way more easier way. Well thats my opinion. I just love using MyChart app for my health needs info.............,
Love it ....can always check test results.. consult with doctor and or team ..set appointment...it's easy convenient and fast,
I Love to be able to find results and to talk about my health care needs almost immediately or within a few days. Being able to make appointments. Quickly.,
"Uses pretty easily, but still a little complex... at least it keeps up for as complicated as it gets",
"Works the way intended, wouldn't mind some ui tweaks and more customization options would be cool.",
If it wasn't for convenience of MyChart app I would miss a lot of information and appointments. Thanx 😁,
Easy to use app with real time data from my PCP. Great app to view your medical history and schedule appointments.,
"It only works on our desktop pc. You cannot log in on my Samsung phone and tablet, and my wife's Samsung phone or ipad. A bit rubbish in todays tech world",
"Makes things easier if you want to make an appointment, ask for med refills, see lab results, etc.",
"While traveling, it was great to pull up mycarle and provide info for doctor. The doctor really liked it too.",
Sure makes accessing medical records and history easier. I've enjoyed using the app.,
"I would like to be able to make appointments for other providers than primary, especially when they are cutting back hours, and appointments are 3 months out. Would also like to understand how to find info easier, trying to find visit notes, messages, or information provided by Dr during visit.",
"Things aren't interconnected that should be. For example, I get a message that it's time for me to schedule my annual physical. There should be a way inside that message to simply press a button and schedule a physical. I should not have to telephone my doctor when it's already in MyChart.",
"I have enjoyed using this app as much as I enjoy games and streaming services offered in the play store! My health took a bad turn, and while the Dr's and nurses did a WONDERFUL job explaining my condition and the plans for recovery, the ability to sit on my own time to read about things that I never understood about my body, how to treat ME, and the seemingly ENDLESS resources JAM packed into the app has made my experience one of learning and GROWTH! I check MyChart app more than my socials!!",
"I find out about my doctor visits, test results, letters and messages from my doctor. It's a very good app.",
Absolutely the best. Enjoy having all health info in one place. Wish all my Healthcare providers used it.,
They keep bothering me with a notification at 4:30 in the morning or whenever they want all night long trying to sleep this app will not let me,
"I love using this app. especially for non-urgent issues, refills, test results.",
I love having all of my health information at my fingertips. Doctor's appointments and test results are right there.,
This is great.... all my medical records etc. in one place! easy to navigate and helps if you have several Drs.,
"Easy to use. I can easily pull up my charts, ask questions by messaging my doctor/nurse practitioner, set up appointments, and update my doctor/nurse practitioner about changes/symptoms/improvements.",
"This is by far the best medical app...I have used several different systems from differentedical systems...none and I do mean none...compare to this one. Easy to use, easy to understand. Great tool to communicate with your provider(s)",
Would be better if one could more easily toggle between provider entities. (I.E. Unity Point and U of Iowa),
"Absolutely love my chart it's helped manage my health care and communicate w my doctor so much it's really helpful and convenient. You can see your records and visit notes, submit refills, set up appts you can almost do anything you need!!!",
Once you sign in. When you try to do. Things it times out/freezes. Been this way for couple months for me.,
Could not get by without it. Convenient and time saving. A good way for medical team to communicate with patients.,
"Excellent health care app, easy to use and keeps comprehensive records.",
"I cannot praise the nurse specialists who do microsuction at the RD&E highly enough. They are very understanding and careful but also very thorough. My only caveat is that we are in a shared room, which is unpleasant if one of the patients is having a difficult time.",
Very easy to navigate and overall Functionality. One thing i'd like to see improved is A clear and direct way to get with a healthcare provider Within the same Business style,
"I love being able to have access to my medical records, coming appointments and test results. Great app!",
"Great app! Very Convenient! A one stop shop for just about everything you need or have concerns with your health. It puts you in touch with your doctors thru messages. Refills, your health chart, reminders, info on your doc's visit and more. What a great app!",
My chart is a great way to stay in touch with all ur doctors and pharmacy and keep an eye on ur own medical some times those doctors don't tell u everything.. like my thyroid issue.,
It's easy to use. I'm able to set up appointments with doctors or specialists without having to make any phone calls. I'm able to leave messages with my doctors and nurses and they respond pretty quickly. Good app to just have on hand.,
"Very helpful for keeping track of Medical Visits, information and Prescriptions. Easy to access anywhere I am.",
So useful and convenient. Very reassuring I can look up my test results at anytime and make and cancel appointments without having to call an get put on hold and talk to someone. I absolutely recommend everyone should download this app.,
"MyChart app is a Great way to keep up with appointments, test results & instructions before & after leaving the office.....I Really Enjoy it👍🏾",
"so far 10 stars in the best healthcare platform for both staff doctors, and patients ts can both communicate, schedule. check rx test results before they're in your doctor's hands at best !!!!!!",
"OK for emailing Dr ofc, making appt, and pre registering/paying. However no good in finding Dr's of certain specialty. It wants a name of the Dr. I want to find Dr's in a specific specialty, but can't find.",
"I like that I can get ahold of my doctors & check on medications, etc, through this app. I do have a hard time linking accounts. That's why I'm not giving 5 stars",
"Very easy to use, one the best so far as, easy to understand, learn what to do no stress trying to figure it out. Thank you. Senior here, so much appreciate.",
Very informative. Makes visits so simple with pre-registration. Doctors have access to medical history across disciplines. Pay bills. Schedule appointments. It's great.,
It is a great App to keep in touch with your Doctors and keep up-to-date on appointments and refills!,
Very useful app to remind me with so many events Thank you very much and keep the good work.,
"Great Communication Service! Easy to use, very helpful to keep my health on track.",
"Excellent computerized system. All my visits, meds and test results in one place.",
I would give the app a 5 but it only seems to work correctly during business hours. Weird? It might be me.,
Love it! Easy to check in and manover through the app. Everything at ur finger tips.,
"This is an extremely easy portal to use and has many, many avenues to help with your health care.",
"My hospital installed this software recently. The software is good I've used at another hospital. But this hospital,s implimtation sucks. They obviously didn't do the the training they should have. Using it to make changes to my prescriptions paying bills has been a nightmare.",
MyChart is not only user friendly but has so many features that you would want that you don't even realize until you need them. I have an outstanding team of medical professionals and now they are at my fingertips. Thank you MyChart!,
I love it. It beats waiting on hold or playing phone tag with my doctor if I need something that doesn't require an appointment. It also makes getting appointments scheduled and meds refilled way easier.,
It's great to have my health information at my fingertips. I appreciate that biometric security was reactivated.,
It states you can cancel an appointment and make a new one on the same page. Most of the time I am unable to make a new appointment. It says to call the office to cancel and reschedule. Other than that I enjoy using the My Chart app.,
"Absolutely the best way to follow your health, medical appointments etc.. I'm very pleased with this app.",
This stupid app has messed up to the point that I was without meds for a week straight and is refusing to load documents I need so I can get the assistance animal I need.,
"Multiple appointment times and in person/phone visit for the same day and the Dr did NOT call. A specialist called me to make me aware of a test that was scheduled for me! The follow up notes can't be viewed, it's just a list of appointments.",
"I'm pleasantly surprised at the ease of use of this app. Feels very professional & gives me instant access to all my medical information. Like every app in the world, there could be and will be improvements, but it's already a very well built app.",
I use the app almost daily it's very handy as multiple health care providers have access and update info regularly.,
This app is very easy to use! Agonistic for many years now and it is served me very well. I highly recommend it.,
"Since the last few mychart updates, I have been having problems getting into the massages area to read any replies from my providers. I checked for updates there was none. I uninstalled the app and reloaded it and same problems persisted.",
"Everyone is so understanding and kind. And with my chart I can talk directly with my doctor, set ,or cancel appointments. And to be able to see my test results in detail is also wonderful. I LOVE IT!",
This app is horrid. There is no back button so I have to constantly kill and restart the app.,
MyChart is an excellent app. All of my health data in one place is very convenient.,
Excellent tool to access and communicate with your Doctor’s and nurses. Very helpful!,
Sometimes refuses to connect saying g check cellular data. This happens when I have excellent connection.,
"Has been very handy for me especially during covid could see results, book appointments, everything all in one place",
"CONFUSION with a log in for every clinic. Mychart won't send code to verify email. Tried numerous times. No option to correct errors in MD notes from appointments. 5.2.2023 Its great to log in makes it easy. My complaint is Mychart should have one login for all facilities, and not a separate logins for each MD. Its time consuming.",
Best thing my hospital and doctors ever came up with. Easy to use and all your information is in one place.,
Very easy to use. It's great that I can see all of my appointments and talk to all of my Doctors in one app.,
"I love being able to reread the information that the doctor told me while at the appointment, as well as see any historical information.",
Love this app easy to use and great way to be able to message nurses or doctor. Never had a problem with anything on it,
It's a great app!!! I get my results faster! I can make an appointment without having to call which makes it so much easier not being out on hold. I can get letters for work even check the Dr's notes!!! I love love the app!!!,
"Must have. I can't keep up with next steps, appointments and results without this app. I see multiple physicians and auto-reminders save time and assist me. Easy to use. 5+++",
"😃 I love it... anything I need to know is right at my finger tips, including doctors notes & test results. & quit often just being able to communicate with your doctor this way saves on costly office visits that weren't necessary. So easy 😌",
I love My Chart. It is convenient to send and receive messages from my doctor and the clinical pharmacy. Helps me keep track of and prepare for appointments. The Customer service has been great whenever I have needed help. Definitely 5 stars!,
"I like how easy it is to navigate. I can find what I need just by opening up my MyChart. Lab results, messages, comments, concerns, being able to ask questions are just some of the features I have on here. I am glad I have this to get my medical information needed.",
"From the phone call to when we leave the appt, entire staff is so sweet, kind, and caring. The app is super easy to use. I love being proactive and helps be in n out of the appt faster.",
I love MyChart! It's easy to read test results and get a message to your doctor.,
"Instead of going into an appointment in person, this app allows you to talk with a doctor and connect with them digitally. If they prescribe medication, it will be sent to the pharmacy of your choice. Their help team is very friendly and there whenever you need assistance.",
Very easy to use and blessed to be able to keep communication flowing with my primary physician/staff after appointments.,
Very easy to use the app and very helpful and mind relief being able to see all results I highly recommend this app,
"Since Thursday I have been trying to upload a document to my doctor. It refuses to upload. I tried a smaller file, it did not work. I tried through the website on my phone, still did not work. And now I've tried through my laptop and it is still coming up with the same error.",
The mychart app is easy to navigate through and help with keeping up with doctors appointment .,
Works great! I like how I can get messages to my Dr and she replies back quickly And I can schedule appointments with having to call and sit on hold till someone finally answers,
The app has been very helpful. I'm able to review the information and results that were given to me at the visit. I receive the receipts for the visits when the payments go through and also notifications only of any updates\changes to your benefits.,
Freezes. Doesn’t download test results easily. What good is this if doctors don't look at messages and reply?,
Very great! Sometimes give me problem lack website get stuck. Pass word just some time 2 or 3 days i try hard time logging In finally it's working now.,
The app used to work great. Now when I go on I can do everything except check test results. When I click on it it loads for 5 minutes and then says an error has occurred.,
"This app has revolutionized my interactions and participation in my own healthcare. It's empowering to have an easy, user-friendly way to communicate with my doctor(s) and coordinate prescriptions. Highly recommend!",
"I absolutely love this app its self explanable, I can't talk to any of my doctor's and care team anytime I need to. I can also get refills on all my medications through the app. Find out all my test results which make it easier for me to advocate for myself.",
"Not happy with the lack of communication on their end. Response is whenever, but the billing is immediate.",
"When calling Radys for assistance or questions, most employees do not know the answers to my questions or cannot assist, then I am rerouted to someone else. It also seems hard to get in touch with someone related to the computer side of things.",
"Love this app. Can check out my chart to see list of my meds and to ask for refills,send messages to my doctors.make appointment.ect",
"Not the same as Providence My chart. Peace Health always having errors when looking up notes etc etc etc. Also it does not have a very good ""send a message"" feature. It has ""ask a question"" Please have Peace Health computer people look at Providences App""My Chart""",
Great way to keep on top of important appointments quickly as in immediately I get a notification quickly even better than by email.,
So far in the past 6 yrs of using MyChart for communication. I have no complaints. Someone has always gotten back to me in a timely manner.,
I like my chart it's very easy to use once I figure it out and I can access my records my visits my medication everything I enjoy using I think anybody that has this app will be very happy with it it doesn't take very long to learn it and you can check everything out do you need you can leave messages for multiple doctors I have no problem using the my chart app and I rate it five and I would recommend it to,
"This is the best medical app I've used. It's easy to navigate through, and it has great informationto read through. It also has appointment, test and prep reminders that are extremely easy to follow. I love this app.",
I love that I get test results immediately however not enclosed detailed info is not accessible. Being able to leave/receive Dr. Messages are good.,
"lag issues, sometimes is fine and others it will not pull up messages, results or schedule. it just spins and spins. have good signal and connection. frustrating",
"Efficient, quick results can be viewed promptly after visits. Easy to communicate with doctors, all info in one place, easily accessible. User friendly. Love the app.",
"Very good, though I wish it had a graph to visually show you trends in values like the other app",
The only thing I would change is to bring back the messaging where you can write a message without choosing from a list as to what about.,
Very limited App and doesn't show my blood test results anymore for some odd reason. Almost non existent support.,
"Great app and a good way to keep track of your tests, including blood work xrays etc.",
For the most part I like the app. But I don't think it's good that patients can see test results before seeing doctor. Leads to way too much stress and anxiety.,
I like being able to get results from tests and viewing them soon as possible. Nice app.,
This app is perfect!! Order your prescription and message your doctor with ease. Don't have to sit on hold and wait. Access all the notes from each visit. Easy to use and easy to navigate.,
"Low quality app. When navigating away from the login page to get my password, the username resets this is very frustrating. I hate apps that do this. Also could not log into some of my healthcare providers",
"I just realized that this app was a thing after seeing my current doctor for 2 years and using the website to check my test results, upcoming visits, messages, medications, etc 😂 it has everything I need and a little more! It's very convenient!",
"All I wanted to do is order my meal while in the hospital. Followed the instructions, installed the app, signed up, logged in, and I'm stuck on step one ""log in and click dining"" There is no dining option. The word dining is nowhere in the app. Unusable and frustrating",
Can't get into the app. Claims my info is invalid. I can't hear so I can't call. Lousy app,
"Notifucations, reminders, and test results are all helpful.",
"I love using MyChart. It's so easy to schedule appointments and discuss my medical needs with the Dr. And clinical staff. I also like that I get reminders of upcoming appointments and can check in prior to appt. I find the test results shortly afterwards, which is very nice.",
I love being able to see all of my medical information in one place. It is also nice to be able to use the app to export all my appointments into Google Calendar. Makes it very nice to be able to see what the notes are from the doctor as well.,
"Its wonderful! You can get test results immediately, you can ask for refills, and ask doctor questions. Love this app",
Very helpful to review your medical records all in one place and also be able to pull up the records for other physicians,
"Unless you grew up with a smart phone 🤳 in your hand , I find this extremely difficult and aggravating.",
Still love using my chart to send messages to my son doctors and my doctor too. It's easy to keep up with any appointments that we have.,
I am enjoying MyChart. I get to see all my information sometimes before I hear from the doctor. I would recommend this app to everyone.,
"I actually love this app, except it would be so much better if there were a folder where I could record things like my daily weight, daily blood pressure, and whatever else my doctor wants me to pay attention to. When that happens... I'll give 5-stars!!",
I love that it is so easy to use. I like the fact that you can get your results in real time. Makes it easier to contact your care team as well,
Brilliant app! I had a blood test done at 10am and already received 5 results on the app by 11pm! It's so organised and very user friendly. Highly recommended using and it shows all of the notes the doctor adds during appointments.,
"Blacked out screen shots get an automatic 1 star. I want to send important information to my wife but your trash app won't let me. Now, I have to take a picture of a message from my doctor with my work phone making my information less safe. Garbage app. I'll be using the website.",
It takes 5 days to get results from the app. Not sure why they can't or won't follow the same protocol as UHN.,
"Efficient accurate and easy to use. Love it, especially in case of emergencies.",
"I have been using my chart for over 2 years. I view test results, track appointment and other useful app options. Great way to communicate with medical providers.",
Great app. Easy to navigate doesn't crash or has any bugs or glitches the information is accurate and given infromation in real time. good job 👍,
"l love using MyChart, awesome being able to see my medical testing results, most of the time before the doctor sees them!!!!",
An excellent way to communicate with my doctors and staff! Use it regularly with no problem.,
Quite a handy and useful app. No need to log in on computer anymore. Thumbs up to mychart!,
I have always loved my Dr and this app makes it easy to talk with them and schedule appts. Thank you,
"I love this app. I can make my appointment,refill my medication as well as leave a message for my doctor and often get a quick response. Valley health plan is the best. My Doctor Anita Gaddipati has to be one of the best Doctors I am not good with keeping up on my medical issues but my doctor makes sure I get the best treatment available. Her nurses are always reminding me of up coming appointments medications blood testing all on my chart or by phone. I will be a patient at valley healthcare.",
"I love using My Chart. I can send my doctor's team a question and get an answer back usually within 48 hours. I can see test results as they come in. I can view billing. I love it because everything is in one place, and I do not have to deal with people for every little thing I need to do.",
"I love how I always get updates on everything & I love how ""My Chart"" has all my visits including reminders.",
"This is the best way to stay on top of your healthcare, meds, appointments, labs and tests by far!",
"Great idea, really good to have, convenient and easy to get information.",
"My chart makes checking my test results, messaging my doctors and e appointments easy and fast. I think the app is user friendly and all the updates have been simple and easy to navigate",
"I schedule appointments, receive test results and read my provider's notes. I am able to send follow up questions and get responses within a timely manner. Great app, make life easier if providers and facilities know how to maximize on its features.",
"This was a great tool for being able to see what test results are and accessing your med list. Now, it is frustrating because I have to set a new password every time I go into it.",
Such a helpful tool with your health care! I love using this app. And recommend every patient to use it!,
Easy to communicate with Dr's and nurses. I love being able to just email with any questions I have.,
"I absolutely love MyChart, It makes it so easy for me to keep up with my health care history. I love how it reminds me of my Dr. appointments, let's me know when my prescriptions are ready for pickup, keeps me up to date on my vaccines, and I can leave messages to my Dr. It just goes on and on. It's great! Thank you MyChart!",
"This app is easy to use and extremely efficient. Routine appt, vaccination, medication and historical info is easily accessed and immediately updated. Appt reminders and e-check in are invaluable time savers. I love it!",
Nothing ever loads! Anything I select just shows a blank screen!! Sooooo frustrating!!!,
"It has alot of great tools & Info, but sometimes it has too much info that has already been read. It would be nice to Gray out after it has been read & be able to move this info into a past data file.",
"It is so convenient to get on my chart to notify your Dr about any concerns. It is a lot easier than trying to make a call. I just go to messages, type in message and they will respond back pretty quickly. You'll love it!!!",
"Very good app comes in handy. I would rather it 7 stars if I could. Have used this app. Really, Really good !! 💯",
"I am very satisfied with the app. I just have 1 suggestion: it will be very helpful if you can add a search button in the test results section or any possibility to do a filter on a specific result since if I need to see for example all my CT scan results, I need to go through all the results to see where is the CT scans and it's taking too much time. Thank you.",
"I am really disappointed with this latest update. They have put so much effort into a new layout of the main menu, adding a 'feed' for latest updates, BUT paid no attention to the rest of the app! All I asked for was a simple search or sort function for my test results. But no, they added a pointless search to the main menu items! What a complete waste of time. Please update this otherwise great app with some basic sort or search functionality, in the test results section.",
"Every page is extremely slow to open up, about a minute, and I have a fast internet service. Pages are empty when they do open up. The main page set up looks childish and unorganized. Also, icons are too large. Remember me checkbox is barely visible in light grey, which is not accessible format. I also would like a choice to be able to screenshot my information on this app for my future reference. I will continue logging in through desktop, I won't be using this app. Was a great idea though.",
I love this app!! I am forgetful so it reminds me of appointments! I'm also all over the place so it's hard to keep track of past diagnosis' and test results but everything is kept on record. The interface is super easy and user friendly and it's nice to have my medical history at the tip of my fingers! I understand that they had an unfortunate update issue last year but it seems to be fixed now (I have never had a problem).,
"Test results are the star component. If it's in the green it's good. Either side, in the yellow, there may be a question to be asked. The app doesn't have all the features of the desktop version, e.g. graphs showing past results, but as a portable method of showing other medical professionals your results and key medical history, it's pretty good.",
"Convenient, paperless and interface is easy to use.",
"Love being able to communicate with my doc, seeing my lab results, and paying statements from this app!",
"My Chart, Is easy to use once you practice at it. I'm 56, and I love that I can link accounts from other Drs. I've seen especially a specialist. I still need approval from my pcp, however This way, all of my information can be accessed for myself or my primary care Provider.",
I like this app. It makes keeping records and appointments straight. It's easy to read and understand.,
This app is easy to use. I am able to see all my medical history which is great. Only issue I have is scheduling appointments for a new doctor. You have no way to search his/her name so you can schedule.,
I Love having My Chart...My Doctor is so quick to respond to my messages and prescription refills...She is just great with My Chart...My husband loves it also it's so easy for him and me and I got my mom on it so she can keep up with her appointments and medications...,
The app is very good because when you enter the doctors office you don't need to do any paperwork.,
"Easy, convenient, Im able to send a message to my Drs and get a quick reply. Usually 24 hrs or less.",
"Good app, but they said I can schedule an appointment but I cannot seem to find where to do this, will call instead.",
Very convenient for my healthcare management. I can view test results and message my physician.,
I can never get corispondance from Dr.s or billing letters and messages are broken and unreadable. Or wont open citing errors with servers no matter where I am with different servers at my locations. It's a great idea but obviously still needs lots of work.,
"Very easy to use. Its great to have all your appointments, correspondence and results accessible in one place whenever you want.",
"This app is not only convenient to get refills for my prescriptions but also very convenient when I have a question or need to contact any of my Doctors. A great app! I would recommend, and have to anyone.",
Frequent log in problems. Password works on the desktop/online login but not the app.,
My chart is a terrible tool to use for patients. Very unfriendly and confusing. Needs to totally change. Please get a competent programmer to do it.,
Loads rather fast. Easy to use. Only real downfall is the double notifications that come thru. But in all its very easy and friendly to use.,
"Rarely works; called the ""tech support"" number listed for when you have issues with the app. He said, ""The app sometimes doesn't work."" Not helpful. Thankfully, my pcp is not geisinger.",
Very easy to locatical record and test results. It's a wonderful app,
MyChart is a very informative app. I really like all the information it provides.,
This is the best way to communicate with your doctors! I have been using my chart for years & it's the best.,
I love being able to see test results and visit notes immediately. So helpful in making my life changes for living healthier. ❤️,
"I've been coming here since 2006 or maybe 2007! Lol. Dr Bledsoe is my primary, I've also seen here Practitioners. This is a great team of health care providers!! From the front desk back to seeing the Doctor, its always been smooth sailing! I wouldn't want to see any other Doctor. I would absolutely recommend this office, you won't regret it.",
"The app allows me to see past visit notes by my doctor, make/change/cancel appointments, check in remotely, and allows for video visits.",
"I'm not good with technology, so it took some time to figure this app out. It made me 30 mins late for an appointment.",
It's quite useful to verify appointments and to communicate with the doctor. I use it often.,
Reminders are great when you have a hectic daily schedule easy to work with and let's you know teat results,
Easy to use! Makes scheduling an appointment or canceling appointment rather than calling the office is easy. You can check in for your appointment which I love.,
"So far I love the app, it keeps you updated and also gives you information on all test and visits.",
Very convenient means to stay in touch with all involved and latest information.,
MyChart is a very worth while tool that can be used to look up your medical records past and present.,
Love being able to have access to info and contact my doctors. Great app!!!!!,
"I like being able to see test results, make doctors appointments, and ask for doctors notes if you need one.",
3* I cannot schedule an appointment in my MyChart app with a different speciality like seeing a different doctor for a checkup. I have to call to make an appointment with someone other than the current doctor I have. Otherwise I find this app useful.,
"Works great, staff (Docs, Nurses etc) typically respond in a timely fashion. Simplifies and keeps everything in one place so pulling up a physical or your last tetanus shot and next apt is as simple as punching in a pin.",
"Fantastic app, sends reminders and updates. All information required stored in one place",
"MyChart app provide some good information, however a lot of functionality is quirky or inoperative. I would appreciate if it was an undo/recovery feature for accidentally deleting a message since It's Not Unusual to be jostled or bumped while trying to do something in a mobile app. The appointments feature also has limited use, as many links to' a schedul an appointment here for AHN, often don't work. An ability to set a custom aural alert would be extremely helpful.",
"Easy to message providers, can schedule appointments, ease of paying bill, able to check in for appointments before going",
Takes well over 24hours to get lab results since the beginning of August. I need these results right away like I use to get since I've had a doctor almost kill me in er by discharging me.,
"Either MyChart messages are not getting to my doctor or the doctor is not reading or responding to the messages, medication refill requests, or questions.",
"Great system to keep track of all your medical information, testing, records, etc. You can have multiple providers here, see appointments, and communicate with your doctors. It makes life SOOO much easier!!",
Appreciate being well informed and having access to lab results and hospital letters. Great service although new is being used effectively. Phone ap won't let you save pdf letters & test results but able to download from laptop.,
Love this app it is so easy to use and I can text my doctor anytime and always get a response.,
Love it! So much easier to communicate than wasting time on hold. I had no idea that I had access to this information.,
"This tool is fantastic for remembering appointments, medications, asking quick question to your physician and other things I may not have mentioned. It keeps you up to date on everything medical needed for you. I definitely love the 3 day ahead reminder of Dr. visits. Awesome app.!",
Recently for no reason my password did not work and I was required to change it today my chart would not open even though there was a message waiting for me. Without these above problems I have liked the services.Also when I had to change my password the tech that helped me was great.,
I'm not liking the fact that everybody and their aunt and uncle can reply to messages that I'm sending to my doctors. It would really be nice to have the doctor reply back to me instead of many different people. It gets too confusing not only for me but the person who replies back that doesn't know what's going on or doesn't understand my question(s).,
"I love this app. Its perfect. Very easy to navigate. Ease right at your finger tips. Everything you need to know about your health, doctors,, and wellness an more, is right there.",
"Easy to use, would give a 5 star if there was a like an ad or separate file for my minor kids. Trying to remember separate logins and passwords for each child is kinda a pain. Otherwise I like this app.",
"This site is very user friendly, and easy to navigate. I would have given it 5 stars if they hadn't removed the ability to see the history of test results and the charting and graphs under the test results tab.. It's so so important for us to be able to track if we are improving or not, for me as I'm anemic, I NEED to see the graph history of my iron numbers. Please bring that back. Everything else is terrific.",
Easy to navigate. An awesome tool for managing health care!,
"I work with several organizations. I am continually reminded of procedures, such as cancer screening, that was done at another orginization. Would be nice to be able to mark complete, and provide date and orginization. All orginizations in question use mychart.",
"The app is straightforward to know, and he helps with details of information and results as well.",
App is great for access to your medical records. I wish all providers used this.,
"I would give a 5 l, but I have to send a code to my email everyday. It makes the app annoying.",
"I don't think is the app, but I normally get two or three ""visits"" when I go in, lab, Dr, procedure. I have to fill out the insurance and medicare with identical responses for each one. Since all 3 visits are the same building, Dr and disease, why can't I fill it out once and be done with it?",
"Love it, makes EVERYTHING so much easier. & I have all my test results and chart notes, I can ask questions, refill medical, and schedule appts. I really do love it!",
Great app. Nice to have access to all your information and easy access to medical team.,
"So easy to make appointments and check test results, not to mention getting details for insurance claims - love the convenience",
I really like this app. All of my records are in here from my Dr visit and even urgent care. The medication are also listed. The best part is I have access to it all. Only bad thing I can think of is you can't download into the app by sending your Dr paperwork.,
"It's nice to be able to see appointments and the doctors notes after the visit. App also helps keep up with medications, past and present. Provides a link between patient and physical.",
Terrible. It loses relevant information. Deletes medication lists. Changes information. Unfortunately it seems to be the way easiest for clinical use.,
My chart makes it easy for me to communicate with my doctor and see my test results without having to deal with waiting on the phone for several long minutes. I recommend my chart to everyone,
"Excellent job putting all the work together for patients to view there results. Absolutely love this app. The doctors and nurses are very knowledgeable about their job. I must say They are consistent, caring, companionate, kind staff. ❤️ 💜",
Excellent way to stay connected with your care team. Nice to have everything consolidated in one location. Easy to track things.,
This app is very convenient no matter where I go I can get all my information and communicate/message my doctor on the go 24/7,
"I don't like it 😕 I receive too many emails about my appointments. I'm 67 years old and don't need a reminder of them twice a day, or sometimes more. Not only that, even though I have removed the app several times, I still get the email appointment reminders.",
"Convenient to use! I can read my lab and radiology reports , message my providers with questions and/or concerns, request refills, schedule, reschedule, or cancel my appointments and much more! This app continues to grow & evolve! Great job!",
Great app that connects me to my care team and provides great info for staying on top of my health.,
"I have had trouble with My Chart. I once missed an online appointment because it asked me a question about my insurance at the last minute and I couldn't get it to accept the picture of my card. I could hear people talking in the background waiting for me to get on board, but my chart simply would not allow me to do it. I know my chart can be helful to patients. To me, though, it has been problematic. Rather than facilitate communication between me and my provider(s), it has impeded it.",
This has made my health care so much more accessible and flow of communication more consistent.,
MyChart is a very useful tool for keep track of appointments getting meds refilled or even being able to ask you doctor questions I'm definitely a fan,
"Amazing, easy to schedule appointments and get refills on medication. Plus test results are listed after 48hrs of lab work.",
This app sucks. This is twice now that the times of my appointments got screwed up. I wonder if there's another app out there that's better than this one?,
"I am extremely fortunate that the majority of my doctors are on My Chart. I recently had an incident away from home that necessitated a visit to the ER. That hospital was also on My Chart, so I could mesh those records with the others. Now, my home doctors can see everything that was done there. It's almost like a universal health record.",
"I would give MyChart five stars IF when I received a notification (for e.g., ""You have a new message"" from MyChart"") and I click on said notification, it would take me directly to the message. There have been numerous times I received a notification of some sort and give up trying to find what the notification was for.",
MyChart is simple to use. It is very convenient to access with app. Appointments history and exam results are very useful and can be easily shared with other physicians & specialists.,
"MyChart has made it much easier to ask questions, see medication list, check in for appointments. I also love that I can look up lab test results, care providers notes, and other info that is right at my fingertips. Thanks!",
"This app not only details every conversation with your drs but also lets you know whats next and whqt to do. This app is amazing and def helps our family, all while upholding laws by great security protocols where u cant even screen shot the app due to hippa. I love it its amazing a great tool for parents and patients to use for further education.",
Keeping all my medical information organized and in one location is so helpful and convenient. Thank you,

"I love having and using mychart. Having all my medical things, I need inone app has made things easier for me.",
"Have trouble getting any info ,on test results ,and medications,sometimes is hard opening the app",
"I love using this. It's more convenient and easy to gain access to my medical records, schedule an appointment, and talk with my health care provider. It's hassle free, and everything is at your fingertips. I'm glad the day I enrolled in this app.",
"The app is overall a great way to view your health records, make appointments, see all your medications.",
"MyChart has been extremely helpful in helping me stay on top of my current medical information, i.e., lab results, ex-rays, and appointment summaries; without me having to call each of my doctor's offices. It is helpful to have one place coordinating and sharing this important information where I can view it.",
"Ok app, but ability to ask questions about test results appears to have been removed with latest update. :(",
"I really appreciate this app! It keeps me involved in my health care, and that is important to me. And it keeps it simple, and that is necessary for me!!",
I have used MyChart may times. It helps me to keep up with all my Healthcare information. Thank you so much.,
"The app is great. I really had a difficult time in the beginning using Mychart, but that was my own insecurity. It's totally fine now. The app is better than calling in.",
"This is the greatest thing ever. Now able to have everything in one place, get in touch with my providers, have my info shared among them. So far, no problem using app.",
"I get to view my after visits,labs, upcoming appointments and pre-registration for my upcoming appointments. Very helpful app.",
"Amazing! I just hit an age where I need to have several visits with different doctors. This app keeps a record of that and more. I can see the results of my visits within days. No ads, I highly recommend downloading this app.",
"I have been with Dr. Cooper for several years. She is phenomenal! Always caring, polite, and listens.",
Very easy to use app I would recommend downloading The app easy to communicate with The medical personnel,
This is a really nice for communicating with your medical team quickly. Kudos!,
App is great! I just wish I could change the old profile picture.,
BEST MEDICAL APP Very easy to use and UNDERSTAND how to use it. Very convenient.. make apps. Ect....,
I like the app. I wish we had the option to email doctors notes to work.,
"LOVE IT... 😍😍😍 😍😍😍 I RECENTLY HAD TO DELETE AND RE - DOWNLOAD THE APP DEAR MYCHART EPIC PEOPLE; I'M UNABLE TO READ MINE MESSAGES AND HAVE CALLED THE SUPPORT TEAM SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY... CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS???... THE APP STILL NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND IT'S BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS NOW... 😨 I'M YET, HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS APP AND MAYBE DELETING IT SOON; I TRULY DON'T WANT TO BUT, I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE AND EVEN THE WEBSITE IS MESSING UP... 😨",
It's agree that in the sense that you can have access to your blood work and radiology report before your doctor calls you to let you know the results. The only thing I dislike is returning to a previous page there is no back button.,
I don't like all the appointment reminders. I'm bombed with check in filling out the same data each visit the same questionaires. Every morning at 8:03 my phone dings about a earlier appointment. I picked my time I don't need changing it.,
Easy to use and good to be always aware of what the midwife says and to show the baby father/husband in case he couldn't go to the appointment,
Exceptional app. Everything I need to know at my fingertips. Very easy and convenient to use.,
Easy to enrol and easy to navigate. Recd my 1st lot of blood test results within 3 hrs which was great. They also show you the expected range and if your result is outside there is a little info button you can press that gives you a brief outline around the test which can be quite useful but still doesnt replace talking to a professional. I think the app is quite new and still being tested as I signed in on the app to let them know I was there for my appt but still had to check in at recpt.,
"I'm fairly new to My Chart, less than 6 months. My experience has been very positive. The app is extremely helpful and easy to use. It provides the user with everything you need to know about your medical care. I highly recommend this app!!",
"Outstanding, user friendly! Interface is easy to use, innovative idea for patient to take charge of their healthcare! I am grateful & blessed each day.",
Love using my chart. Not sure how to update things like need dental or shots when I'm current with everything,
"More than half the time the app is unable to be opened, so virtually useless.",
Everything is amazing!!! You check your appointment dates and after see what all was done and what was found,
"This app is very easy to use, and the information you can access is great. Make checking upcoming appointments much easier.",
I find this app extremely useful and easy to use. I highly recommend it to all patients of any medical professionals.,
"Best patient experience, very understanding and communication with staff is always appreciated",
"I love using MyvChart and its features. Very helpful and useful. For those who wish to keep up with their health in real time, My Chart is the place to go. Thanks to the people who created the website.",
"I love using this app, it just makes life so much easier having your appointments come straight through and then getting your messages and test results in one place, best app ever.",
Love it. The app is super easy to use. I just wish I could get all my health care providers on the app.,
"This app sucks it won't let you make appointments at all, sometimes will not work properly.",
I really love this app... It does help make things alittle easier and all my stuff is in one place..I love the way it lets me know when to call and make an appt. Or to let me know it is time to update shots and other...❤❤ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,
Excellent tool. Really like being able to review test results long after tests taken.,
Overall a great app..gets glitches at times. Perhaps it could use a reset. Information is kept safe and I always know where to find it. I have no problem recommending this app.,
Great app! All the reports I want in one place. Easy to read. I'm not wasting a Doctor's valuable time. I can reread the information as many times as I need and look up information on reputable websites.,
"It's great except for the constant errors preventing me from seeing all my upcoming medical procedures. When I get an error message with the first two, I don't even bother looking at the rest of them.",
Excellent service for my health and wellness. Helps me rely on myself and be aware of my own care.,
I love how you can check most of your visit and notes. I hate the fact you don't get to read all of your test results they should be available to the patient as soon as there read. I like keeping track of my health,
"I love using MyChart! I receive test results etc. even before I receive calls from Nurse/Doctor if need be! Helps me keep up with appts, prescriptions and so much more! Not only is the app easy to use, it's free as well! Kudos to the entire team ❤️",
"Using the MyChart patient portal has been a very effective way of communicating with my medical professionals - much better than leaving phone messages, as ive had to do for so many years. MyChart allows all my doctors to see all my messages & info, making my life easier - no need for me to translate my medical condition multiple times.",
It often will not lead messages or anything like to request medications or appointments. Super frustrating,
"I have problems getting on line.i have tried to change my password ,put I don't why I can't use the one I have always used ..",
"I wish there was a way to see your images on here.I understand I can get a copy on a disk, but i nothing to play it on..",
This is the best app ever come up with for people to get the care they need and the information that gets put in our health file. I am really grateful for it.,
I really like the new look and ease of getting around on this site but what's keeping me from giving it a 5star rating is it doesn't have enough information about up coming appointment or appointment made,
Hard to navigate . Old app was much better.Thank you for fixing new app works much better thank you very much easy to navigate now.,
"This app helps me to make appointments much easier, refills on my meds,it's great.",
MyChart has been an invaluable resource for me. I don't know what I would do without it! Wish I had had it years ago!,
"Keeps sending notifications, but won't let me open anything. Gives me an error and says to try again later. There is no way to resolve this issue, I can't get anything to load.",
"Incredible tool that gives the patient and doctor a direct line of communication, allowing for a great patient experience. Great job to everyone who was involved coding this program. You are geniuses.",
"Very glad this app exists. It is an invaluable tool for keeping up with appointments, reading test results, and communicating with my doctors.",
Super easy to use and the ability to quickly get a hold of my provider is Amazing,
"I love being able to access my health information at my fingertips. I also love that you can link different health organizations. I have my Innova, Valley Health and WVU accounts all paid nkwd to one simple app. I have a lot of Dr appointments, it keeps all my appts straight.",
I love the app because it let's me see my test results and appointment dates. However every time I log in I have to change my password and my password in order to log in. This is getting really frustrating to me.,
Don't understand the scientific language about test results. I don't know results and no reply.,
Great app that not only provides accurate information but empowers u mentally as well keep trying to improve,
"I really like using the MyChart app, especially since my FNP is so conscientious about using it, too. It's great!",
Very hard to get to messages. I use it for 2 clinics and it takes forever.,
Its easy and beneficial to be able to check for results and problem areas thank you.,
"Hands down the best way to keep up with your health, but having access to your Dr. Is the best.",
I can easily add appts to my calendar. This include my husband to the appointment. I've needed to go back years for records and I have them with me all the time. The nurses respond to messages I've sent. I can pre-chech in a couple of days before my appointment.,
Very informative and convenient. Everything is accessible and in one place.,
This is a very good app shows all Dr and hospital info at a glance. Easy to use. Thank you for this app.,
"Saves time, easy to use, keep you updated with appointments and doctor notes",
Easy to use has all info I need can do a lot concerning my appointments and see test results. No ads,

Love the app! Keeps me locked in to all my medical reports and allows me to connect with my doctors.,
"Very convenient, keeps things organized, and easy access to my lab Wk, and can see Doctors notes ,",
Keeps your medical info from whatever you have ever Ben seen!!! So updating or sharing your info makes it super easy!!!,
"I didn't know that MyChart even existed until about a month ago, I was having some health issues and I had to go to a different hospital then the one that's here by my house because of reasons I'm not going into but I went to this new hospital and they asked me if I had MyChart? I said no, I've never heard of it, then this lady set me up, and after that I have so happy to have MyChart because I can see everything and I know everything now at the tip of my fingers. Thanks MyChart! 💖",
"It's so convenient in every sense of the word. You have records of everything, appts, procedures, your medications, all the medical Drs, so many benefits. Definitely worth checking out.",
"Very poor layout. Letters don't come up properly. Navigation of the app is poor. Not at all impressed, missed an appt due to letter not making sense due to the abysmal layout.",
"Love this app! Easy to use. Easy to see my upcoming appts, lab results and things I need to have done. My doctors put their notes there about my visits so I can look at them. I highly recommend this app.",
Easy access to my provider. Responses are usually very quick. Enjoy access to my chart for review of provider's notes. Staff always professional and courteous . Great addition to overall care. Thanks much!,
"I've been on MyChart for a while now. I find it very easy to navigate to whatever I'm looking for. The menu is easy to read and understand, the prompts take you to where you need to go.",

"This app has definitely made my medical life a whole lot less painful. With all that I have going on, the MyChart app makes it so easy to keep up with important dates and all the different medications and physicians that I see.",
I find the app very useful. I have to get blood work done fairly frequently and it's great to be able to see my results when I want and compare to previous tests.,
"This app is the best thing that has happened to anyone on Medicare. Now they can read there doc's notes after ur done ur appointment, & c ur labs, right down to everything. U just can't get any better then this. Anywhere u go updates ur file. It's a great thing to have.......",
I love the app. It's easy and I don't need to call to make appts all I got to do is schedule it right here. I can send messages before I schedule a appt rather than call and ask questions. It's easy,
Integris and me allowed you to highlight words and direct you to the definition. This app does not. Please add this feature. It was very helpful.,
"Mychart is so easy to use and saves me phone calls. I can make appointments, check in, message my providers. It's easy to use.",
UPDATE.. still having issues with linking to other hospitals .... but also having a long term issue with correct /updating medical information..... Link to other hostipal is incomplete .. tranfer of information never seems to work very well .. only 1 of my children load .. even after connecting my chart help desk.,
Extremely easy to navigate and communicate with the doctor. Managing meds. list is very easy as well.,
"Very good app allows me to track all my medications and test results as soon as they come in only downside for me is making an appointment it won't let me and I have to send a message and wait for a response, but other than that great!",
I love my chart. However the new version does not allow me to track a by graph what red blood cells have been historically for my lab work or my GFR or a1c's or kidneys or blood etc. I really would like that function put back so I can see how my health has progressed or de-progressed!,
"Notifications don't have enough info to be useful or helpful. In general, works as designed, just poorly designed.",
"I enjoy using MyChart. However I can see how the messaging center between doc/patient, upcoming appt's and post-visits is a tad confusing and hard to manage if not computer literate.",
"Love the MyChart app! I can see all my test results, leave messages for my doctor, and refill prescriptions all in the app! I can see all upcoming appointments, too! Don't know how anyone gets by without it! ❤️",
"I love using my chart app. I can visit with Dr and Nurse without calling. They are busy and it's a fast way to communicate. Vew test results easy, don't understand results, option to ask questions. Dr visit reminders great love it...",
"What a great app! I love having all my family’s and my records so easy to access. Plus, when I need to contact a doctor or nurse, they reply right away. You can even change your appointment without having to call and wait on hold. Love it.",
"Both Chelsea and Sutton Hospitals are Brilliant. The care I'm getting is excellent. The APP is amazing and gives all information, letters and results. We'll done to whoever designed it !",
"The app itself is very good. But there is always a but, likes everything appointment results letters all at your fingertips, but it seems only North Manchester hospital that uses it, why no other hospitals use it I don't know 😕 I have this app the N.H.S app for Fairfield hospital, my doctor doctor app 😉 three apps giving me different information but all are N.H.S it would be extremely beneficial if they could make up there minds and settle for one app either Mychart N.H.S or doctor doctor,",
"its an ok app where you can kinda do most of the things you need to do.. but i have never been able to successfully schedule an appointment unless it was a covid19 vaccine appointment, then i could schedule those with no problem.",
"It very nice to look at. Easy to explore, the different ways to look for your information. I like to use biometrics, so I don't have to use my password every time. Thank you.",
This app makes it very convenient to be able to communicate with your health providers. Also able to check after visit summary notes by the doctor. And a great way to stay in communication with your healthcare provider,

"Very easy to use, useful to find my lab results even before that my doctor appointment. That helps me to do changes especially with my diabetes.",
"This app is so efficient. Much better than calling in and leaving a voice mail. I use it ALL the time to sched appts., request refills, review lab reports, and ask questions.",
So incredibly helpful and easy to use. I have access to all of my health information. Upcoming appointments. I can even speak back and forth with the front office staff if I'd like. Love it 😀,
"Constantly have log in problems. I hate this app! Also, you don't get information results like the "" follow my health"" app. It makes me mad that I am forced to use this app from providers!!!",
I love this app. I can view test results rt away and even text back & forth with my doc anytime with any of my concerns.. I'd be lost without it!,
I really don't like it I got Howard Brown and Erie health mix on the same page. I send a medicine request to Howard Brown and Erie health answer me back that that's not their medicine to refill. It's to much a frustrating. I have sending messages to everyone who can help but nothing is done. Thank you for nothing. Almost a year like this come on. And you ask me to rate your app there you have it 👎🏾,
"Easy access to my Drs. When I live 2 hours away from them. I can review my records, test results and upcoming appointments. Very thankful this app is available.",
It's straight forward and have different programs you can sign up for. I love that you can message your Dr through the app. It has a lot of features.,
"I use My Chart for everything my messages, test results, tracking my appointments. I would be lost without it.",
The MyChart app is truly a one stop shop for monitoring your healthcare. It makes everything very convenient. Bottom line: this a great app on a world of useless apps.,
"All my appointments, medications, and test results at my fingertips. Doctors seem to reply faster to messages left on this app, than on the phone. Thanks!",
"This app is better organized, and therefore easier to navigate, than other patient portals that I use. Is also had decent Sharing features, which some others lack.",
It has helped get tests results faster along with communication is much faster. And double checking appointments.,
It's a great app when it works. It has a lot of server issues that prevents me from utilizing all the apps features.,
Super helpful to keep up with all my appointments!! Also great to be able to easily communicate with doctors or support staff 😃,
"> Waaay too many glitches for such a widely-used app. Example: message telling me I have to manually log in, but I CAN'T log in, because the admonition BLOCKS my keyboard. THEN they harass you with orders to LEAVE A GOOD REVIEW!!!! SERIOUSLY??",
I love this app. It can keep me updated from my Doctor. It also tells me when my appointments are due. I think I have the best Physician Matthew Portz MD. He's very thorough and takes time to listen to me. Dr Portz explains in detail what I have to do. 5 stars 🌟 🌟 ⭐ 🌟 🌟 for him!,
I love this app so much. It helps me to remember my upcoming Dr visits & it also simplifies scheduling my Dr visits as well. I love the fact that I can get my test results on here instead of having to go into the office.,
This makes it very easy to make appointments and also see results from having an appointment Also great for asking questions about any ailments or treatments you could be receiving Doctor offices are pretty quick with responses.,
I love mychart its the next best thing to eating watermelon on a hot summer day! My new doctor David Stevener was the doctor ive been looking for my entire life it feels like. Took the time to listen to everything i had to say and i had a lot to say. Made me feel like he truly cared and was compassionate professional and explained everything to me where i was left with no unanswered questions. Today was the greatest doctor visit ive had in a very long time. Thank you Jesus for him!,
"No ads in my 4 years experience. It does have repetitious notifications, but in the health biz, I'd rather know too much than play their games that some hlth co's do. This app is the beez kneez!!!",
"This app makes keeping track of appointments so easy. Also, having the results of any testing done at my fingertips is awesome.",
"Love everything it offers,Making appointments quick and easy viewing medical results or speaking with someone in office has never been easier.",
"MyChart, and in particular the doctor's notes and visit notes led me to see in more detail the extent of my chronic kidney disease. This was a wake up call to me and led to a radical change in my diet and behavior. I'm in the process of ""reversing diabetes"" off of insulin and I've lost 80 lb. It all started with me being able to see the honest notes for my doctor in my chart. Sometimes the doctors are more candid in their notes than they are face to face",
This app has been a life saver for me personally.I am sure if I didn't have this app. I would have forgotten alot or missed appointment's or couldn't have had the actual Diagnosis & Blood work results. Thank you for the help this app has been during my time of absolute hell from Pancreatic Cancer.,
Easy to use. This app make communicating with my doctors and pharmacy so easy. It also allows me to check back on what has occurred in the past.,
"I like having access to my medical information in one spot. Plus, it's easy to have multiple health providers linked to my account. Useful app.",
This app has been GREAT! Especially good for me due to not having a lot of time to sit in the office! Great response times on questions. Very easy to use and efficient.,
"WHY NO DARK MODE ??? Not everyone has great vision for gray lettering on an overly white background 🙄 STILL WAITING Aug 15, 2023 🤪 And, your canned answer of '' Hey, e mail us at xxxxx '' doesn't get anything done... You've read it here... FIX the Problem and push an update so EVERYONE can have that choice of the Visibly Enhanced System, at Promedica... P.S. I know Epic has the capabilities as I already have it for one of your competitors 😎",
This app has really been a good working application. I get to see all my test results and keep them in case another Doctor ask for blood and helps me keep track of my levels.,
"Fantastic, easy to use, a great way to communicate with my doctors, make appointments, and actually see test results that I can understand and learn more about.",
"I love this app. You can keep up with your appointments or reschedule without waiting for hours on the phone, ask your doctor questions, see test results, etc. all in the palm of your hands. Thank you for making it so much easier.",
It's absolutely horrible. Difficult for both patients & staff to use this new system. We were better off with the old portal.,
"Makes patients active participants in their own medical care, as it should be. As a medical professional, I believe that all patients should be using this app. This helps the medical team as well",
Very user-friendly and allows me to review my complex clinical history as well as lab tests results. As soon as they become available. It is a great tool to have.,
Absolutely love the convenance of the app and all the information. It allows me to stay in touch with my medical team without having to call.,
easy to use. Email reminders are great. Ability to leave questions for my docs is wonderful. Can compare new lab results with past tests.,
Everything is pretty good and convenient. The only thing that's lacking is the time frame in which messages are answered. Some do not get answered at all.,
"I like it as I can results,up coming appointments. I like being able to look back and seeing when the last time I had something done.",
This app Hospital and system sucks not get on the app for a video conference I cannot get to my doctor the system that the doctor has in place with this company does not allow any Communications between doctor and patients change hospitals right now before it's too late,
Love how everything is at the touch of ur finger tips .... Very convenient an always those test results u wait on no longer see them before they call u ... Great app..,
"The results of blood tests are displayed clearly. The results of other tests, especially radiology and CT scans seem elusive and without disgnosis.",
"Love having all my medical stuff in 1 place where all my providers can see my history. Plus, fast test results & Dr responses, make or cancel appts, pre-check in, reminders, pay bills, etc.",
Wish there was more information on how to connect my 9month old sons MyChart with mine. Other then that I love having access to this and being able to message my doctor and then get back to me right away is awesome.,
This app is very helpful with keeping up with your appointments and getting test results. Makes life a little easier.,
My only wish is that I could give this app a negative rating. It is non functional and is not user friendly and is very creative is finding ways to $crew over customers.,
"Fast easy access to your Doctors, Nurses, test results and medication dosage info, refills, etc. Stores past records/tests while plotting trends in those results. Intuitive UI.",
"Brilliant, perfect if you want to keep tabs on your medical appointments and tests, medications, its a great little app, impressed",
Love this portal! Every test and doc visits and notes in one place. It's the best patient portal in the area and we have several. Good job!,
Great way to keep track of appointments & medication needs. Scheduling is smooth as is messaging providers & requesting medicine. A very user-friendly site.,
Excellent & easy way to add appointments to calender ! Easy way to keep track of what you are supposed to do before next appointment .,
"I absolutely love keeping up with all my doctors, bloodwork results, updating personal info withoutbcallibg and being on hold forever. This is such a great app!",
It's great! Very convenient and easy to use. I can get and check my results and message my doctors when needed.,
Not very user-friendly! Everytime I swipe on what I want to see I can't go on. I have to close the app and sign back in. Horrible,
This app has been wonderful! It has aided me and my family with so many things..from being able to talk/email medical staff with questions to being able to schedule appointments.,
I think it is a little overwhelming at first but after u set up your shortcuts it isn't bad. All the information you need in 1 site.,
"Excellent app! Would you consider adding doctor reviews by patients? Also, search a doctor feature, where you could type doctors name or specific specialty like dermatology and their profile comes up with a user rating?! That would be Epic! See what I did there!",
I love this app. It is so helpful and my OB Dr. Addy is amazing. All of your medical information can be found here. You can do so much fast and easy. Highly recommend!,
All info is two weeks out of date. What good is that. The letters come a week before app is updated. I can't see the point.,
"I love this app. I can double check my appointments, leave messages for my health care team and even see my blood work results...plus much more.",
You need to make it easier for yourself and not have to call the facility to change em or phone number to re-set password I've been trying to reset my password And I still can't get into my chart I did and they tell me that they already changed my email and they don't!!!?,
"I enjoy my records visible to me. I do not enjoy seeing reports, lab results and such, and not understanding what is going on with myself, until a doctor calls. Could be soon. Could be days. The thing is, if you see something alarming, or don't understand. You have to wait..and sweat it out till someone let's you know..no big deal..or..yes big deal. I'm not a doctor. I could spend hours researching the words, terms etc....but, I pay someone to do that...right? Like I said, great but, torture!",
"One consolidated site for all of my medical needs. Makes it easy to keep up with multiple doctors, past and future visits.",
When I look at different areas nothing shows up.. Need to go back to the old system,
Very convenient and easy to use. Never really had any problems with this app. Helps a lot with medical things for sure.:),
Brilliant app easy to use very informative and only downside doesn't show results prior to download,
Does not capture all letters sent to patient. Does not capture all encounters. Does not capture all test results.,
I can get a hold of nurses and my Doctors a lot easier than to call them. And wait for my phone to ring.,
"If you are going to keep up with your records,drugs,appointments you have to have it. It is easy too use",
"Makes it very easy to see after visit summary, receive lab results very quickly, and communicate with doctors.",
Love this app. So nice to have all my medical info easily accessible. Works great.,
"Easy access, easy navigation. But non responsive to appointment requests and Rx refill requests.",
"It's great, however using plain English instead of Medical jargon would be helpful.",
Not very useful. Doesn't really help besides telling you and only you what you already know or what you should know.,
"Very quick to learn and use, clean presentation.",
Love my chart. I'm able to communicate with my drs. I can do telehealth appointments through it and much more. I love this app.,
This app has been an amazing way for quick communications between me and all my health teams. Real-time communication.,
Absolutely love being able to see my information and test results all in one place. Results can be seen quicker than the time it takea the doctor to see you and review them,
"Pretty nice. Good layout, organized, helpful, informative.",
Sends multiple messages regarding same appointment up to six a day with questionnaire which is almost never visible to the office you are going to. Very poorly done,
The app times out when I try looking at future appointments. Very frustrating.,
The app is user friendly and helps to avoid the frustration of calling and holding.,
"Great app for tracking appointments, and meds. Way to invasive. Daily e-mails of messages is excessive. Need more control over notifications. I dont want to be reminded constantly about upcoming appointments when I already go into the app and check frequently and have seen them. However would like to be told if something new is added. Gotta be some type of balance.",
This app has been very helpful with getting myself organized with all of my doctors appointments. This app also keeps me in touch with all of my care staff. That is a good way to keep myself abreast on all of my new meds and new appointments,
Trying to log in and it always comes back not working at this time try again later very aggravating,
It's super easy to reach my provider. And they respond very quickly.,
"Easiest way to access your medical records, appointment reminders, medication list and more... Easy to use and navigate...",
It's so easy to message any of my Doctors. It shows my medications and upcoming appointments. It's a wonderful app.,

I'm having some issues with trying to access some information on my phone and an error message pops up,

This app makes everything so easy to understand and use. I love that I can see what's going on with all my medical in one app.,

Easy to use. Fast access to test results and appointments,
"that app is awesome you can message any of your drs and check your appointments, makes life a little easier",
Good working app I enjoy how easy it is and receive my documents through the application.,
I love the fast lab & test results. I truly appreciate the Dr. visit summaries. I also like that information is still there after time passes so I can review again.,
"Excellent user interface, quick run times, fun to explore 😇",

I love it...especially since I am using 24 hour pharmacy...it is great...trying to get my friend to switch from Walgreens to Wilson Place,
"Garbage, when I first got this I loved it. It made it so easy to cancel appointments with my dr, to find instant access to a list of my drugs or test results, and best yet, it reminded me of my appointments as I'm very forgetful. The last month all I get is the white screen of death. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, I've tried using my husband's phone, and I've tried to use the contact us option but it won't even open to that. The only way I can get to my chart is on my lap top. 😡",

"This is not a great app. But it serves my needs well enough that I would recommend it. What I mean is. I've been using the app for a couple of years. Good to see and prepare for upcoming appointments. It is good to schedule appointments with doctors I've seen before. And an ok app at finding out what I am due for (vaccinations, etc). Not good-its not good at scheduling some appointments( too hard to explain). Drives you nuts a week ahead of appointments, getting documents ready and such. 4/5",
I love this app. It's easy to use & I can check it at any time day or night.,
This makes appointments and messages easily available,

Being able to message questions/comments to my providers and get replies in fairly short order is exceptional. Overall, I am very happy with the MyChart app.",
Best medical app I have ever used it is easy-to-use and helps in making your care easier,
"There used be a long wait time to schedule appointments, and while it saddens me someone or several people are out of a job given the app, I am grateful for it - always available when I am.",

"This app is mostly easy, but the results of tests aren't explained",
"Easy to make appointments with my Provider. Easy to Edit/Add any important information. Results of Tests also easy to understand & you can have any questions ready to discuss with your Provider. (Every now & then, the App appears to have glitches of some kind & your Provider is NOT notified within 48 hours for presciption refills. So as back-up, I call in Prescriptions by phone.) But because everything else works properly at all times, I still give a 5 Star Rating. Be Blessef everyone.",
"This app has been a signicant help all around. I am amazed how much you can do with it, from making appointments, to checking in, filling put paperwork before getting to the doctors (which we all know how much we hate doing that), to even paying your bill and seeing all results and comments.

Update- issues fixed. App is working great. I love having access to my results. This app was amazing but now all I get is a white screen. Thought it was my phone but I've read that others are experiencing it as well. Very frustrating. I've reinstalled it a few times and nothing works. Too bad. I loved it,

University hosp had a fantastic app. Unfortunately they went to My chart, bad decision.. Their app was so easy to understand and to maneuver. My chart needs to review their app and start over, try hiring whoever (IT) designed the Follow my health app. The app is confusing, not clear, and doesn't even come close to expectations and only some of the offices use it . ??",
It's a wonderful efficient way of communicating and staying up to date with each visit and lab works.,
"Won't let me make an appointment, won't let me see any of the medication I was prescribed, doesn't let me do most of the things that is supposed to make the app great. Extremely unfortunate!",

Can't see how to change pharmacy on prescriptions. Can't see how to cancel referrals which are no longer relevant. Having trouble simply sending a message to my PCP.,

"Doesn't work, I don't get all test results just the odd one.",
"So easy to use, and view all your information test results and so much more.",
"This App allows your information to be shared, sold. It violates the Hippa LAW. Sending messages to providers are first read by non medical personnel ie..Receptionist then Nurses and eventually Doctor. This includes your most personal Medical conditions and concerns. Not Private, not safe. No one knows who or where your Medical information may end up. Google offers too much misinformation without fact checking.",

Easy to use. Fast updates ontest results. 10/10,
"If I need to submit some info to my doctor, I can do it now. I leave a message, my Doctor usually reviews it the same day. If he has a message for me based on the info I sent him, he posts that on MyChart and then on on MyChart tells me (the app tells me I have a new message) Works really well for me.",
Always good way to communicate regarding medical appointments and results,
This app is very useful. All the information from my doctors are readily available.,
One of my favorite apps. It makes it so much easier to stay in contact with my medical team.,
"I really love this app, very user friendly, & easy to navigate",
Decent app but the billing office does not respond. What's the value of an app when the medical provider doesn't respond.,

"MyChart keeps you up to date on EVERYTHING concerning your health and appointment, you are no longer feeling in the dark.",
It would be nice if when I sign into one of my health care providers I actually went to that provider! Can't get into it to leave my Dr. a message!,

Not worth the hassle of setting up. Doesn't work. Haven't gotten any info on my medical stuff. No bills or anything.,
Very easy to get access to make appointments and see my tests results thanks,
Easy to use and communicate with my health care providers.,
Convenient...easy to navigate...like having access to my info at my fingertips,
Updated the app on 7/11/23 and it just keeps telling me sorry we can't log you in right now when I try to use my pass code,
"Mychart is the best thing ever. I love my Care Team, they are the best and smartest Doctors I have ever seen. They list everything in your MyChart, labs, x-rays, CT scans, plus Visit Summary's You can send your Care Team staff messages and they respond same day or next.

Perfection! I love this app so much. Best my chart ever!,

I love this MyChart I can access all of my medical records and needs I can also scheduled appointments and leave my Dr messages.,
I have changed my email a long time ago. And this app will not let me change email,
This app is super helpful i use it all the time and never have any trouble.,
"Would have given 5 stars, but I have a problem with notifications not deleting once messages are read",
"November 7, 2022. There was a car accident with me and my adult daughter. The records got screwed up and put all my daughters information/records on my records. All the stuff added to my records that day are not mine.",
"Easy to use, and keep track of appointments as well as test results.",
Excellent app! I've been using it for over a year now and never had any issues. Well done!,
"Flusterating, unable to log on after numerous attempts",
Good interface. Works great on my Note 20 Ultra,
Helps me keep up with my progress and doctors information.I love it.,
MyChart is an excellent app for combining details regarding your Healthcare from multiple sources.,
Many great options.. and easy to find all information 👍,
Absolutely wonderful app for managing medical appts & much more.,
App frequently very slow to open or not at all...,
I hate this app. I am a mom and the health advocate for several elderly families members. You know what makes that even harder? This horrible app!,
Great place for all my medical records and information. Love it.,
"Works great to keep up with appointments, medications, and to stay in touch with your healthcare team.",
Easy to set up and use. I love being able to do everything from my phone!,
It is a great app. I love it. You get your results before the doctor does.,
"Pretty intuitive and easy to use, BUT, why can't I (the User) Add/Del the Dr's in My Care Tm???",
Have been getting a server error everytime I try to view anything in app.,
I like it. I can send messages to Dr or nurse and get information quick not have to call the office.,
Love being able to see my results and Dr notes. So helpful.,

Not user friendly. I am having àlot of difficulty getting it to function.,
Very helpful and extremely fast viewing of recent activities,
Easy to use. Have found many new features. Better now that others are using the app.,
Incredible benefit to patient.results are posted so quickly.,
MyChart helps me stay up on myself and all my tests that I take and my results that I can review on my own so this is a great asset for my life and I'm glad I signed up for my chart,
Easy and simple to use and navigate,
Makes contacting my doctors office so easy making appointments and medications. And the urgent care on demand is a game changer,
Best app to communicate with my doctor it's so easy and I have teck knowledge.,
I love it. It's easy to use. It great to be able to talk with a doctor faster. The doctor's get back to you so much faster when you in a question answered.,
Easy to stay up to date with any procedures or appointments. Easy to communicate with doctors. Easy Bill pay.,
Excellent app 👌🏿 keeps me up to date with all my appointments.,
"Very good, slow at times loading but great other than that.",
Very helpful app. Lots of helpful information.,
Good app just needs a section to cancel appointment if needed after hours.,
This app is really helpful to me as a patient. It is easy to navigate and provides the opportunity to communicate with my providers.,
Does not work half the time. Phone number provided forctech support but they are rude and useless. I abhor it.,
"Best thing ever. You can do it all from the app and see everything your doctor sees and any other medical providers if you want to show it to them or print them. Everything you need to know and more. It""s just fabulous. I hope all hospitals have an app like this one. This is all at your fingertips. Also, it is easy to make and add appointments to your calendar 📅, by 🖥 or 📱talk to all of your doctors by messaging. And teledoc drop the mike. This app is very well thought out. Great job!!!",
Great for personal 1 on 1 with my physical provider I can be in comforts of my own home while taking to my physician. 5 star I love this app,
"It's very slow. After logging in, it takes minutes to display the screen. Same thing when I click on My Results. It takes several minutes to display the landing page with the results. Sometimes, it takes a long time to display the individual results, and at other times, it behaves normally.",
"a 4.5 star app when it works, but when you can't log in because it doesn't email you a verify code, you can't use it or get any support. a dead end. also, layout makes drastic changes and sick people can't adapt quickly to that.",
Simple place to keep track of appointments and other important information.,
The virtual e-care is useless! Told me to stop taking meds I haven't taken in over a year or that I'm not even on. Then give me new meds that I've been on before and didn't help.,
The blood results are not updated and get updated randomly. Pkb gjve all blood results the next day.,
It's great to be able to communicate with my dr. and get advice much sooner.,
Excellent user interface.....very user friendly,
Now I actually sat down and learned the app it's easy. I think the entire layout needs to be redone though,
love love love this app. so easy and convenient.,
Privacy is respected and it's nice to have access to medical staff.,
This app is terrible. It never loads with any kind of speed.,
"The App is very good, but the logging process is very unstable. The passcode and fingerprint logging had worked for many months, but now I'm unable to set them up to work. I just get an error logging in message, asking me to login with my password and reset the passcode or biometric. Which does fix the problems. I've also reinstalled the app with no success. Any help welcome.",
App is allowjng login but there are error codes whenever anything is clicked on. This update broke the app and nearly cost me my damn life 0/5 stars if possible,
Very transparent and easy to use .. highly recommend,
I love this app it helps me keep up with my appointments and my health issues,
"All staff from transport, clinic and hospital are kind, caring, attentive & respectful",
I have a great experience every time I visit my doctor him and his staff are all good at what they do awesome people thank you,
Easy to keep track of all my medical history and needs.,
I wish it had pictures and videos in a live person explaining it making it easy to understand,
I like using MyChart. I usually get a quick response to my questions.,
So easy to use and communicate through! ❤️,
Great Health App.... easy to use and navigate!,
Very effective App to stay in the know with your health.,
Great app! Easy to track all medical instances.,
Love mychat is simple easy to use and very convenient,
Excellent Ap. Much easier to use than the web site!,
Very good app. You can check your appointments and test results all on this app. You can even set up appointments and check in when you get to the appointment.,
It works very well. It is easy to find the info you want.,
"Useless! For a couple of years now, you can't read any messages sent to you, and most of the other functions, including Echeck-ins etc, just show you a spinning arrow and take you right back to where you started. I emailed the mychartsupport developer contact over a year ago and there is NO response whatsoever. YOU CAN'T EVEN READ MESSAGES FROM YOUR DOCTOR!",
Absolutely brilliant. Can't manage without it.,
"Love this. I even get results before my doctors see them. Everything is explained, and easy to access. I can set appointments, get prescriptions filled, and even ask questions to each doctor, and they reply quickly.",
Love that my medications and test results are in one place. Makes it easier when having questions for my Doctors concerning medications and testing.,
So far it's been a great app. I wished there was a spot so to input in the information of the pharmacy I use that way I don't have to tell each time when I need meds get sent to it by doctors/clinics that are outside my primary care Dr office. Update: found the section and added my pharmacy to it. Thanks for the instructions.,
This app allows quick and easy conversion with health care providers as well as prescription reordering and review of lab work and scheduling appointments. No more wasted time calling and waiting on hold followed by waiting as information is looked up. Very useful.,
"Messages and filling out forms is clumsy and limited to very few characters. Dates for due activities are presented as scheduled dates, not due dates. Very confusing.",
I love this app. It makes it so much easier to manage my health care. I can see my test results as soon as they are available. All my appointments are in there with addresses. I can request appointments or send a message if I just have a question.,
"I like the app, though have no basis for comparison; both my local medical system and my preferred pharmacy use it. The messaging system is great for the providers who check their messages, lousy for others who never do.",
"I was not very good at keeping my medical info from doctor visits in one place. Appointment reminders even appear where I can find them. Review office visits, tests, blood work results, and health care results.",
Easy access for patient information. Sometimes a little difficult to move around in the records. I especially like the prescription part of the app.,
The app is very easy to use. It's a great tool and schedule assistant. I love being able to easily access my medical information and not have to have frequent calls from doctors,
The app won't load half the time. It freeze up and time I try to talk to the doctor or get a message it never wants to show.... too many bugs and problems with this app,
"Love and appreciate the option of using My Chart. It's easy to use and responses to questions, ect. are timely and informative.",
"Get test results and other information before the doctor! All your medical information, easy refills at your fingertips/ convenience! Message your doctor/doctor's for appointments or questions you might have! This app will benefit you more than them! Countless information this app provides that I didn't list you would definitely benefit from. Also I really recommend if you have parents or love ones you take care of! You will know all the medications that take or use to take, appointments etc",
Really Good. You often see test results before anyone else. Appointments come through on the app which is much quicker than the post. A really good paperless app. Highly recommended,
"The app is pathetic. I use it because there's no other choice. For at least one to two years now, I have contacted everyone possible multiple times, about multiple issues, and NOT ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN REMEDIED. I pass the complaint baton on to others. Farewell.",
This app needs lots of work gave it a 2 star as it works 40 percent of the time. example push medication button searches an searches.... Then logs off. This causes you play phone tag with wasting everyone time....,
"MyChart is literally a life saver. Reminds me of appointments, shows dr notes and images. My meds and test results. Now i can combine other hospital visits. I love it and cant be without it.",
Worst app out there. You can never connect when looking up information. It always takes a minimum of 3 tries to get though. Try and send a message to your doctor. Won't happen,
I love being able to communicate with all my doctors and having all my medical records in one place. I no longer have to relay information from one specialist to another. I also love being able to do virtual appointments during inclement weather. I am very happy with my team if doctors,
"Tried 25 times to establish a password. It kept returning ""Password does not meet requirements"". So unfortunate to get annoyed with these small technical problems.",
"Great app until a few weeks ago. I can get the app to open but now, that's all it will do. The app home page is all that opens, I just receive a server error message.",
"This app helps my doctor's connect with me, notifications of appointments, reminder for medicine Refills. It's very convenient, a person can automatically put the information on their calendar.",
Anything that you have a question about is in my chart. This is the best app ever. Anything you need to know is in there. Your labs and test are available to look at. I personally like the note so I can read the doctor's notes and you are fully aware of your condition.,
I can't log in it won't send my phone number a code..did it several times.and no code sent by text I can't log into my account help What happens if you have multiple different entities on it..and it happens for all of them do I contact all of them? Pretty stupid if you ask me ! Pretty stupid response..aren't you guys the creator ? Shouldn't the creator work out the freaking bugs ? Pretty poor response I talked to someone from ohsu and they couldn't help me.,
Very easy to use ... I like being able to keep track of what's happening when the Drs don't inform me well ... MyChart will help you... With definitions of the difficult terms I'm not able to decipher immediately... I can keep track of my appts it's always right there in a row date first to last ... It's amazing if your interested in your medical history and what not medically MyChart has you covered.,
"Love being able to access all of my drs,appts,meds,medical conditions,and leave messages and make apps all in one app. Super convenient, easy to use and never any glitches.",
"This is a great app for tracking medical information such as appointments, medications, pending tests, etc. It allows me to communicate with our various medical providers more easily than by phone.",
My charting gives me a chance to watch my numbers with more of an input rather than looking and not having any way of participation in how these number are being looked at. Glad to be more interactive with my results. I smile when I see more that I can do rather then wait and see how my doctor feels or think about that 🤔,
"Frequent notifications about new test results, but no actual new test results posted. Disappearing charts. Saw blood gas tests once, then disappeared.",
I do not like the new version at all. I'm not going to spend the unnecessary amount of time needed to go through visit notes and signing for appointments that happened as far back as 2 years ago. It's ridiculous,
"I love my chart because I am able to contact my doctors within 30-60 minutes. I also get very quick answers to any questions I may have. I also appreciate the way appointments can be scheduled and just as easily canceled. The doctors visit notes, and the summarize section is wonderful. If you didn't get exactly what the doctor said; you can read it for yourself in My Chart.",
"This app. is very useful. I can keep up on my records and appts. I am so glad they have this app. for their patients. It gives me all my tests info. before next visit, so no need to wait. Also gives me the visits remarks from physician. What could be any better?",
So easy to use. Saves me time and my doctor's time with e-check ins before arriving for my appointments. I love having all my information readily available for me to access through this app. It's wonderful.,
"Use this app rather than phone calls. Find it very helpful. I share results with family. Also, with other medical staff not able to access my lab results and other medical procedures.",
This app is amazing! I can message my Dr. When I just have a question or something to talk to him about that doesn't require scheduling a visit in person! This app let's you know when your due for certain things. It's just super vɓ y 6 y use ⁷,
The app was priceless during inpatient admit for husband. He like control over dietary needs. As an RN I liked seeing lab/test results as soon as posted. Easy to use. I did have problem with being notified of unread test results after discharge. Tried calling support @hosp. NG answer.,
What an incredibly bad UI. This looks like an app built for Android 1 in 2008. Extremely difficult to navigate.,
Love the app. Can view other organizations easily. Love share everywhere feature. Need to be able to record vitals easily in Epic to share with pcp.,
"It keeps stating I owe money even after calling and confirming I don't owe any money, and in fact, paid double. Sheesh! It's your app. I'd think you'd want to ensure your customers were satisfied.",
Well when I use the app it doesn't show my up coming appts or test results so I have to go to the web page and sign in with username and password in order to see my record. I updated the app and still not showing my future appointments.,
"I've been using MyChart for a few years, I love how I can correspond with my Doctors regarding any questions or concerns I may have. It's also easy to schedule and reschedule any appointments. I like the fact I have access to my medical records, and I'm able to view my medications and labs.",
"Problems with app all the time! Won't load, loads slow, can't find info, Dumps out of app. Tech support unable to fix problems.",
"The app makes scheduling appointments and reviewing them very easy. However, updating the information is lacking and needs to be addressed.",
Really like being able to see my test results and it makes it easier for me to be a partner in my own health care. It also helps keep my appointment straight and keeps me from forgetting appointments. I don't like the idea of how difficult it is to get a message to my doctor,
I love my chart. Everything you need to know about past and future appointments. You can preregister on the app and save time when you get to your Drs visit. I wish Amazon tablet had this available.,
"I love this app. St Lukes Plaza correspondence is easy, and very timely. I LOVE this facility's providers; and support teams. 5/7/23 Extremely difficult to reset PW, it keeps telling me there is a problem.",
It would be great if MyChart would send a NOTIFICATION message when something is posted,
"This app never works worth a hoot, it just took me over an hour to get into my chart to read alleged message, there were none, this app is all hot air and no substance, in other words, useless.",
"It was hard to find someone to help me set up the portal. You need someone assigned to teach patients how to use it. It was probably six months before I got on, and when I did, the program worked good.",
"The e-check in option is so helpful in expediting things upon arrival. Also, being able to see your appointments and post visit reviews is awesome. This app is perfect for staying informed about your health care.",
I have to have a code now to log on even though I always use the same device. That would be fine if I were actually sent a code. If you want people to use the app then send the code!!! So irritating.,
"Missing link to save information on patient profile page. Says you will loses info if you leave without saving, but has no save button. It didn't lose the info, but I lost hours of my life looking for a save info button.",
My husband See's all of his doctors here and they all are great physicians and it's great to have all your docs in one place. I actually have an appointment soon with a doctor at the same location and I will be seeing more than one doc at this location and it's very convenient.,
"Recently, the app hasn't been working properly. Where it comes to the two-step verification, it's jumbled up, and there is no place to put the code. Kindly fix",
"This is a very nice and convenient app. You can check in prior to your appointment, request medication refills and pay your bill right from the palm of your hand! Also, you can see test results and the notes from your visit.",
"Once the initial kinks were worked out, I do refer to this all the time for appointments, medication Refills, and communication to health care providers. It helps me to see results of tests & to keep track of appointments.",
"Absolutely love it! Very easy to use and so convenient you can check yourself in, you get test results before your doctor, I got mine this Memorial Day weekend?! you wouldn't have gotten that anywhere else.",
"Not left wondering what's happening can see results as they come in. Everything in one place letters, appointments. Just wish it was all on one system, drin, Drdoctor, ask my GP, armid, etc... all good but mad the NHS doesn't have one for all making it easier for all to see what's happening and if you are under several hospitals and clinics you have to access multiple different aps. Madness.",
A very useful well designed app. The desktop version is particularly good as it provides past results and a great visual comparison chart,
"This is the absolute best app for communication. I love that I can get an answer to my question within hours. I also get test results as soon as they're reviewed, often with the doctors opinion. Great app!",
"MyChart is the best because you can send your Doctor a message, and you can also pay your deduction as well. I also like that you can check your test results, medications that you are on or have been on. MyChart is a really good app so far.",
MyChart is such a helpful tool for keeping my health records and my son's health records all in one place. It is easy to share information with the organizations that need it. It keeps me up to date on vaccines and appointments.,
"Best medical app for a patient seeing multiple specialist and so many options for calender reminding app confirms med list history for multiple specialist to view update and exchange info Sometimes I get my results before the doctor even gives me up dates, there r a few other organizations it like to see on here but they prefer to maintain there own portal Remember tho your still have to give permissions for eath practice to confer and see your profile but there is a pretty big List of practices",
It's so great how easily I can message my doctor and get a response back fairly quick. See test results fast. Schedule appointments when it works for me. Fabulous app.,
"I use this for my mom as well as myself. We can always log in but when you click on whatever it is that you need it always says ERROR LOADING, TRY BACK AGAIN LATER. Sometimes I can get on whatever we need but for the most part we can't.",
"This app is the deal really smooth and easy to use and follow, has doctor contact info, and lets you view health test results. Keep up the fantastic work.",
"This app is really good, because everything you need it's right there in the palm of your hand, you can be in touch with Drs, and wherever information you need from your records are just there waiting for you whenever you need it, that you can call progress. The future in your hands",
"this app is smooth and clear/user friendly. game changer in health care services. information and communication at fingertips makes it easy to be involved/on top of, and advocate for your best care.",
"I enjoy using this app. It helps me to remember my Doctor's appointments. I had wished that there was an application for the purpose of keeping an eye on my appointments, and test results and finally try to learn more about my health Thank you so much.",
So far ok except for when they ask you if you want paperless billing and you don't sign up for it yet they still send it paperless while trying to get you to sign up. Smdh that's why they not getting paid...because they not sending the bill,
Ui is poorly laid out and actively tries to be in the way. Over half the buttons take you outside the app. Would prefer a simple web portal than this mess.,
"I can no longer take a screenshot to share results with another doctor for a second opinion. I now have to use my laptop for that purpose, so the phone app became a lot less useful.",
The MyChart app is terrific for getting informative information and test results very quickly. Takes some getting used to but worth every bit of effort.,
"Love using app for all hospital issues. From appointments to paying bill. Not sure what I would do without it, As I use to keep up to date and check- in process is nice too. Thanks!",
"My chart is very helpful all of my information is there. I am able to make my doctor's appointment. See my lab results, get my referrals everything. it's absolutely beautiful. I really appreciate my doctor's office. Making this available for us",
Horrible.. since new update. Unable to access my account. CSHS and Altamed are unable to resolve issue. Just have to call every time that I need new information regarding my health and medical chart! Poor service too!,
Poor login functionality. It takes several minutes to send the 2 factor authentication through text. It also will not offer the itemized billing you need for HSA.,
"I get a text for everything. I make a follow up appointment, and get a text before I get to my car. I have an appointment, get a reminder text ( that I don't have an issue with) but then have a multi page questionnaire to complete.",
This is the best app for me. Living fifty miles away it is so much easier to just leave a message for my doctor. Saves many miles on my car too. Highly recommend My Chart.,
This has been a super great app and they are fast to get you your results and your appointments emailed to you or sent through my chart. I would recommend to anyone to use the app for convenience,
"Violates consumer choice. consumers cannot view providers who access and place data into their medical record. Consumers cannot request transcripts to see all activities related to data input. Personally, there's several inaccuries I've noticed in my chart and I cannot restrict this user's access, which I feel all consumers should have the right to do with their personal information if a provider messes up. the app should ask patients permission before allowing any provider to access and edit.",
The GUI is functional but it is rather clunky and can be hard to navigate however this is a step change for patient access for the hospitals signed up to the EPIC system.,
"This app sux. There are so many holes in it, it's less like a sieve and more like bottomless pot. There's like no excuse. I'm not looking for stuff from the '80's. There's major gaps in the last 10 years. Absolutely no excuse. I'm sure it's not Epic's fault. GIGO. Health care systems are never going to do the right thing, only what they get paid to do.",
not a bad app. I trust that it is by design to make contact between patients and practitioners better and more transparent. let's see what happens next.,
"So I really like this app. As always, theirs a however. The however is that I couldn't find where to upload documents as I looked everywhere. Otherwise, I love this My Chart app.",
I'd rate it higher except that you can't send a direct message to someone as a response to an older message. Is very frustrating.,
This app is amazing for keeping track of your appointments as well as getting your test results. The digital after care reports are helpful to allow you to look back at a later date what was said or what was done.,
"App is detailed yet easy to navigate. I can easily schedule appointments for myself and my children, as well as look at past appointments and medical records",
"This is a very wonderful app, best thing that happened in Healthcare. This app works well, no problem. Especially working out of town, when you can't get to the doctor",
"I really like how easy it is to check-in online, talk to my doctors, refills scripts and see test results. This is so much better than having to try and call my doctor's office while I'm working during the day. Love it!",
"Hi, I think this app is fantastic, everything you need is at your fingertips, you can directly communicate with your provider, request refills, make appointments etc. Thanks for this app 😊 LaDonna Crawford",
This app Is convenient for keeping up with appointments and medications. It gives easy access to review past diagnosis and visit summaries. It is also easy to reach out to my physicians with any questions.,
It's awesome to be able to see notes from my doc visits or lab results easily. I also like that i can send messages to my doctor and staff. It's easy to use and helps me keep on top of my health.,
The app keeps having internal server errors causing difficulties with sending and receiving messages and scheduling appointments for orders. This needs to be fixed!,
"I hate this stupid app but my providers make me use it and forget to talk to me about big treatment changes. It is not user friendly. It cannot be used by patients to do much beyond check their test results. Not being a doctor, I have no idea what to do with them.",
"I really like this app, because I can read my results for my monthly mouth swab. And also you can get right on here and make an appointment, it's so easy and convenient.",
"Amazing and simple. I can request meds, contact my Dr., Make appointments, etc. It keeps my appointments organized and alerts me to them. Super easy to use",
"MyChart keeps me and my family connected to all of our doctors. I use my app daily. Very easy to request refills! Access to my med list. Also, I can keep track of appointments!!!",
Very effective and easy way to communicate with my medical team. I always get a quick response. Great way to see rest results and recommendations from medical team.,

It's great having my medical records all in one place and easily accessible to all my physicians. I get test results promptly. I can easily see what bills I owe. I can't say enough good things about this app.,
Good with the excption when I log in with my credentials I see past due bills and other personal information for my daughters acct. I have access to it but I don't need to see this in my information.,
"Easy to learn, easy to use, a great way to avoid anxiety driving phone calls, and still get the medical info you need.",
"Results are not showing for some reasone, can't get any help with this useless app. Waste of time which would be better used with a phone call to your doctor!",
"I use and depend on ""My Chart"" all the time. It cuts down the time between having to call and come in to see a doctor. My Chart gives invaluable information day or night.",
"Love the appointment reminder. Dont love the, after the appointment reminder. Everything in one place is great. ( providers, results, appointments, messages, bill pay)",
"This apps makes it super easy to make and find appointments, send messages to my providers and check for messages back. Bloodwork orders, prescriptions, dates for important exams/tests, MyChart has everything I need.",
"So far I love having all my medical info in one place. Seing the doctor's info and notes, viewing and scheduling appointments, along with communicating with the team... Is really convenient. TY",
The app is a good idea but the Dental office doesn't updated information needed. I have a not seen the day the Dr Nolan gave him a work up with cost involved. Then I had the implant surgery and it shows up as cancelled.,
"So much easier than spending part of my life on hold waiting for someone to pick up a phone or take a message at a doctor's office, those people are busy, and if they can quickly look at what I need without me having to wait on the phone, I'm happy, they're happy, we're all happy!!! this app is a wonderful !!!",
Very convenient to have. Makes going to the Dr much less stressful and easier. You can make and cancel appts. Ask your nurse or Dr questions. You can have video Dr appts. You can check in through this app so it's quicker at your appt.,
"Best app ever! Having my medical information at my fingertips is amazing!! MyChart is quick, easy to use and always up to date in a hurry. Huge thank you to the creators!",
I now live by my chart. Overall it is pretty easy to navigate. Syncing multiple physicians offices does seem to be a minor issue though.,
MyChart makes doctor appointments and communicating with my doctors so much easier. They even had pictures of my ultrasounds and surgery on there. Pretty cool I wish all medical offices used it.,
The app is not annoying but provides prompts when new information is enter. It is a great interactive tool monitoring and managing your health.,
I love this app it very convenient. Is you need to know your past due shots it's on there. If you need your doc note for work it's on there. It's very helpful. 😉😉 A+,
"Love using this app, easy to access my medical, contact my doc refill my prescriptions, schedule appointments so on. Although I'm sure it may very with each organization that uses this app.",
I truly love and appreciate my chart. It is comprehensive and helpful. Only difficulty for me I couldn't figure out how to reschedule.,
"Love this app. I schedule appts, see test results, communicate with doctors, and pay bills. I can also shared my medical information with other doctors. Very intuitive to use.",
It a great app to have but also when they put me on a weight restriction it went away right after I open it disappeared so I couldn't show my job it other then that I like the app just still haven't been able to show my job the weight restriction I'm on,
Very helpful. I love having all my info in one place. It also helps being able to read what all was said since I forget pretty easily.,
Easy to use! So very helpful. I love the access I have with this app. Once I downloaded the app registration was completely easy. Fast response to my questions. Love it.,
"Since the update in May, 2023 I have to login twice, once for the old system & again, for the new. I end up having to reset my password every time. ANNOYING.",
"It's a very good way to communicate with your Drs, nurses, etc for your healthcare needs. No waiting on HOLD, no call drops. Just message who you need to, and they get back super fast. GREAT APP 👍",
"While the app allows you to schedule appt online, not all providers are listed. A Dr I saw once is on the list but a Dr whom I've been seeing over 11 years is not. Doesn't make sense.",
"My chart is a very good app. Keeps me informed immediately about test results, visits and my care provider Nurse Charity is very caring and knows what she's doing. All of the provider's are caring.",
I can see the results from tests as soon as the doctors. It has great appointment reminders and information. Very useful app.,
"Easy to use, lots of info, if it's entered into the system. Wish there was more customization options.",
"I am extreemly forgetful. It gives me peice of mind to know all I have to do to find my appointments, labs and the ability to message my pcp is look at my app. on the phone!",
"I love MyChart because it helps me to get quick responses from my doctor, especially when I am in a lot of pain and think I should go to the ER, although I prefer not to. I can also keep up with appointments and easily check in for them.",
I like that I can have the ability to reach out to my doctor and other medical professionals if needed and make appointments as well. I can see everything me and the doctors went over doing my visit,
Messaging is wonky and still not fully integrated to testing services. But love the convenience of scheduling appointments and having followup reminders.,
This app makes looking I to my health easy. I don't have to call the doctor's office for every question. I can check the app first. 👍 Helps save time when checking in as well,
"MyChart is convenient and a great reminder of appointments. Plus, it is so helpful to get test results in a timely manner.",
I like the accuracy and that I have my results with me at all times. It is quick and easy. No paperwork because it is In my my chart automatically.,
"Very useful and informative... Very thorough on notes,to and from provider on messages,test results,and recommendations.... Keeps you informed on upcoming care and appointments needed....as well as the notes on calls to and from provider/clinic",
My only issue is responding to messages. You can't scroll up to the message sent when responding. So questions asked can't be seen when you are trying to answer.,
Took me several days to find and install this app but once I figured it out it works great ( at least for now). I still do not know how to install mychart on computer??? Will try calling the listed number today.,
"It's nice to be able to see results, and talk w8th provider via messages. I really enjoy the simplicity of the app.",
"I really want to like this app, but it does not perform well. Spend a lot of time looking at the spinning wheel while it tries to load information. Thinking of deleting it entirely.",
"Several pages have no way to return to the main page without restarting the app, dose well in most other areas, just poor navigation capacity.",
"Mostly good. No way to add your new Drs' or remove retired ones. Confusing the way testing pops up with expiration dates a year off, when the test has already been done.",
This app made my recent hospital visit manageable. It kept me informed on all the test results and what was going on. It was even able to be used to order meals. I highly recommend it.,
"A bit plain, but very easy to navigate for any generation. Functionality is tip top. Good job.",
"A must-have if you are going through any form of treatment and need blood/lab work and or scans. all your results go right into my chart plus all your appointments. unfortunately, I use it every day",
"I have 2 life long, manageable health issues. This app helps me communicate with all of my doctor's much more efficiently than phones and personal visits.",
Great App. Allows access to your test results and doctors notes. Can ask questions to your provider through the app. You can view upcoming appointments and pre register for your telemedicine appointments. The QR code feature is great when you do the pre registration then enter the clinic and you just scan the QR code on the app and you're done.,
I Love MyChart it is very easy to navigate and I can see all my visits as well as appointments I need to make. you can schedule appointments though the app too which I like.,
This is an amazing app. Where I get not just my appointment reminders but test results as well. And helps keep me on track with my health.,
"I like the app, but I have to log in and out to see multiple test results or messages. A back button would be helpful.",
MyChart is very easy to use and gives me access to my appointments as well as the ability to do pre check ins. Great app. Love using it,
"Good app, easy to use, quick results and answers and an easy way to reach out to your health care providers and schedule appointments.",
"I wish that you could access other family members medical files on this same app. Because my special needs 26yrs old daughter I'm her caregiver, guardian conservator and mother. And I need to have access to her medical reports and appointments for easy reach at any time.",
"This has been the best app! Can make & cancel appts., see test results, see history & communicate with care providers. This has brought a whole new level of ease to healthcare!",
"Great in theory! Too bad there are real life people on the other end. Seems like every other month I submit a refill for medicine, I'm either completely ignored or there are too many middle men to actually get a medication approved and submitted to a pharmacy. Hopefully this is doctor and staff specific. Will switch primary care providers soon enough to see.",
Can't imagine navigating my partners and my health issues without this app. It really truly is a life saver for us. 10 stars ✨ is closer to what it deserves.,
"Not at all user friendly, & I'm a computer pro. Estimates for procedures are provided, but dates for them are not. Impossible to know what is current or past.",
"This just makes life easy. From appointments, reminders, to making co-pays. No more little cards to lose. You even have access to your meds and notes.",
"It's a great tool for managing your health care. From messaging providers, canceling appointments, and submitting refill requests, it saves time otherwise spent on the phone.",
Absolutely couldn't do this without it. I have so many appointments and doctors that it's overwhelming but the My Chart application really helps a lot.,
I have been using MyChart for a few years now and have found it to be simple to utilize in order reach physicians' offices quickly and access medical records. Highly recommended!,
"This app is so stupid, I get notifications about appointments and test results but as far as billing ya'll constantly send estimates from 3 yrs ago that have been paid but can't give estimates from recent plus no one ever answers calls when calling billing department",
Mychart by Epic has an excellent user interface. It lets you navigate between all the hospitals you go to that use the Epic chart. Kind of all in one. Great piece of work.,
"For the most works good can keep in touch with my Dr but one big downside it limits the size of messages that I can type in and has no link to upload my documents to him like other portals do but is user friendly and has a lot of other good points pay my copays ,refill prescriptions, view appointments, Thank you.",
I like being able to sometimes getting faster responses and appointments with doctors without having to be in hold on my phone or leave messages hoping for a return call when I am available and not driving.,
Need to be able to take screen shoots and copy info from the page. It's an inconvenience in the guise of privacy.,
It's great except unless you have Wi-Fi on can you get all the messages. Problem seeing a lot of important information..,
It's great to see my test results as soon as they are available but better than that I love being able to communicate with my Doctor via the messaging feature. It's a great app!,
"I use the MyChart app all the time to review my upcoming appointments, communicating with my doctors' offices when necessary and paying invoices. I have also used for video visits.",
"One of the better patient portals I have used. Always up to date. Easy way to communicate with doctors, make appts, ask questions, get results & script refills.",
Modern medicine. What did we do before this exists. Traveling and getting care is so much easier when the providers can all have the same view of My Chart. 😊,
"I love being able to communicate with my doctors, check my test results, look at my appointments, ask for prescription refills and look at the after visit summaries. I also use the financial summaries to check that my payments are made. It's a pretty patient-friendly app.",
Love this App!!.. So easy to view understand and read Great for easy access and communication between All Healthcare providers... I highly recommend..,
"So far I've had no problems with My Charts, it was very easy to setup and get into and review notes and health issues.",

Love how easy it is to send messages to doctor. Make appointments e check in. Order refills of medications if needed. See your balance as well as make payments all without calling the office. It's just that easy.,
"My chart keeps me informed on all my test results, my next appointment date, time and location. I can also communicate with my care team quickly and efficiently. My chart is the best!",
"This is the best idea ever. Perfect for overseeing your health portfolio, past and future appointments, test and lab results, etc.",
"Great app, both on phone and tablet/computer, alsi sync perfectly with connections to providers with messages, results and appointments is excellent.",
"I couldn't be happier with my doctor and the overall service, attention and care I get every single time. Always uneventful (smooth!) and that's a good thing. These five stars can mostly be attributed to my doctor. I don't even want to give you his name because I know he has a lot of patients and he gives 100% with each one. He's the best. He goes out of his way to understand all walks of life, and handles those efforts seamlessly. His initials are JW. And that's all you're going to get.",
I would really like the option of printing out receipts for payments without having to request them from the workers. I think this is something that hopefully would be easy to implement and time saving.,
Good med app. A bit difficult to use. UI could use an overhaul (I'm a software development professional).,
"Excellent app! Able to contact your providers and receive quick response, make appointments or ask questions about test results. Easy to access! All health info in one place!",
"This app is all encompassing. You can look up anything and everything. From appointments to surgical details, to billing and payment right on the app.",
How in the world is a 93 year old supposed to navigate this process? Is self-diagnosis going to be available with the next update? And BTW there is no selection for a cardiac stent or where it is located.,
"The app is atrocious, locks up, and freezes. You can never get to messages. Hate it.",
I really love this app. However the only down fall I have is that I no access to my 14 year old son appointments reminders/ upcoming. Even though he's on my account it's just pointless.,
I love using my chart. It gives me the ability to keep up with my health information. I'm able to keep in contact with my doctors and nursing staff. It is a fantastic app.,
Damn app won't load the messages page so I can't see the messages from my doctor even after the update. I was hoping the update would fix it but of course not.,
Can't read messages in the new app. They are blank when you click on them. I'm having to use the old hospital app still to see messages.,
Trying to add a family member to the list of people able to view my chart. Will not allow me to do this. Don't understand the problem. Very aggravating. Please fix the problem or quit offering the service. Thank you,
This is one app that has changed my life. Making an appointment or messaging my Doctor is painless and med refills a breeze. If I need my med records or test results..... All there.<,
"Limited. Can't type more than 500 characters so not valuable for a detailed message. Doesn't allow access to message all providers. No images of xrays, ECGs,etc.",
"I love this app it's really helpful and convenient for my needs. It's easy to use and you can do a lot on it, without having to call and wait awhile until you resolve your issue. I would recommend using it. Thanks for this app. Ms. Matias",
"This app is soo good that I almost want to get injured and go back to the hospital to add more to my profile lol. Well designed, simple and informative.",
I can easily log in to the website version of My Chart. But for whatever reason I can't access My Chart on this app at all. Useless.,
They say it's quicker to get an answer by using this app and it is not. They take their good old time getting back to you. It is much quicker to call on the phone. This app is a waist of time,
"This a very resourceful tool. You can look up appointments, check test results, look at medical records, send messages to your doctors and even schedule appointments.",
Great app until.... my pic is on profile and there's no way to get it off. I didn't put it there and no one asked if they could. Because of this I'll be Uninstalling.,
Awesome app! I love the feature of checking my doctor's notes for every visit. Very cool that you can make appointments from your phone. A must have!,
"My experience with mychart has been wonderful it's easy to navigate, to understand, and easy access to your providers.",
I love this app being able to see the info of my doctor visit right it is over. It's a god send I've never felt more at easy with results from a doctor. Also the fact you can ask questions to your PCP and get a response usually within 48 hours without having to go in.,
I use Mychart all the time. I love getting my test results or appointment notes same day as the test or appt. Saves me lots of time and I can look-up the information now or later. It's my personal clouds. Ed Done,
I worked managing several databases for my employer and I now use several MyChart type apps from various providers and I have found this one to be the most user friendly and intuitive. Very easy to use.,
"This app is a life saver! I'm able to keep track of my appointments, my prescriptions, and message my doctor when needed. I also love how fast I get my test results!",
Very easy to use. Love having what I need on my fingertips/ smartphone. The team has very timely responses.,
Love this app. Fast. Nice to be able to have the doctors share your info when needed. Great to be able to read your own info for reference. Highly recommend it.,
"I'm able to schedule appointments, pay bills, renew prescriptions & email my doctors. It is timesaving & record keeping. I wish all of my doctors had similar apps.",
Everytime I try to use this app it rejects me it's supposed to be easier with face recognition or finger recognition but it does not I am sick and tired of flooding with this app someone need to go in and fix this problem for all of their patients it is ridiculous,
A great app which is clear and concise. Excellent interface with easy access to info your looking for.,
"It's a great way to talk to your Drs., And get your text, and lab results, And not having to wait for an appointment. I love my chart. U can text in the comfort of your home.",
"Excellent App, takes a bit of getting used to. Sadly, it does not include your local GP information or test results, which I think would be more helpful.",
I've been using mychart it's so easy to access & read labs you can contact your physician's office to leave a note refill prescriptions or find outost anything one needs they even have a medical library one can look up on medications all is needed at your fingertips tips great idea mychart,

"The app is easy to use and provides all necessary and pertinent information about my tests, applications, appointments, medications, medical history, etc. The app is up-to-date and can be used to share information. It's a great app.",
"This app is wonderful, it keeps you up to date with your health history, Dr visits, medications, all testing, and reminders for upcoming visits. You can ask questions and send messages. If you have a question or a request, they are prompt to get in touch with you. Any billing for co pay can be done before your Dr visit, no more standing at a desk or wait period, its all done before your visit. If you may be on vacation or need to visit a clinic out of town, your records are only 1 touch away.",
My Chart is a big help when you want test results ect and getting a message to care provider quickly and they get back to you soon as possible it's better than calling and waiting to hear back I highly recommend using My Chart,

"This is one of the best apps I have ever used regarding medical information. From your shots due or test results or surgery notes summarized, it's all there so you can see!",
They kept telling me they were having problems with my user name. So I got frustrated 😤 frustrated 😤 😤 I gave up on getting they Advance chart!!! Really 🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮 sick of trying!!!!,
App is very slow and does not load test results. Most tines i have to keep logging out to view new screens,
"efficient..no discomfort experienced. Light sedation was sufficient and I was able to watch the procedure Everyone was professional, kind and considerate which was aooreciated.",
The privatization of healthcare is monstrous. The app works alright but it's not an integrated system and doesn't give a full picture of someone's file.,
Excellent physicians! They are what makes this app. I never have any issues communicating with any of the practitioners and they always get back to me. I'm very satisfied.,
"This app is great, I can keep in touch with my Doctor's and appointments without long telephone waits. Also, read and keep my test results and Doctors notes on this app.",
The MyChart app is really good! It keeps up with my records. Reminds me of appointments. Easy to navigate,
It's probably one of the most useful apps to schedule appointments and to begin video visits. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is part of the M Health Fairview system.,
I love being able to see and revisit my test results sometimes before my doctor even tells me. I like being able to send an email question to my doctor and get a response within 24 hours. I wish all my doctors couuld access it.,
"Easy to navigate through. Reassuring that I able to text a message to any of my care team and receive a response within 24 hrs. Getting refills is easy. Looking at results once they are posted is amazing, not left in the dark like before mychart. Amazing that I can also follow my family members 'mychart', easy to apply to my own mychart, i.e. if you are the caregiver of a family member.",
Very convenient. Like having a medical secretary in your pocket. This app. was also very easy to learn how to use.,
"Such a handy tool! Meds, ability to message physicians, look back on past procedures. If only more apps were this well thought out and ran so well.",

"The MyChart app is a very important app because it helps me keep track of my future appointments, the medications I take, and most importantly, I send very important messages to my health care providers.",

This is very convenient and super easy. Very relevant when you need to speak to your doctor. Just a message away!!,
"Dursed out in their work environment. 🤔 I always try to treat my Dr's and staffs with the utmost respect!! Working together is going to accomplish so much more on both sides of the fence. I feel if you're messaging your Doctor, someone else reading his messages and then relaying them to him is second hand information when it is supposed to go straight to his eyes. There is someone else's interpretation of what the patient is asking their Doctor. Not assistant or anyone other than Dr.",
"Great tool to see your tests, doctor's notes, or to ask a questionor refill a script. I love having access to all my medications any time. Overall just love the app.",
"I love this app, but i love and appreciate the wonderful Dr Ohri and her staff even more!!!!! The App is very easy to use, and is very helpful.",

This app provides many features, current and past appointment dates with details, test results, messaging for medical info and to prescription refills, ask questions about your medical care and you'll be answered promptly.",
"Very nice to be so informed, and to have such detailed files for reference when needed. This northerner is uber impressed. Keep up the great work 👍",

"I wish I could upload a pic to show, what I am seeing. It's a blank black screen when I do a screen shot because the msg an error occured popped up. So is someone hacking my health infonory phone",
I wasn't having trouble with this app since I had it. Then today I have tried for over a hour to make a appointment for my Dr and it's important... Now this app is not letting me make any appointments. What is wrong with it.,
"Love the app. Just hate the fact that after a year the "" my notes"" disappeared and I use them to see what I went through with covid and what the done to me.",

I prefer using MyChart rather than taking paperwork home from Dr visits..(like after summary notes).. I can also get in touch with my care providers much faster through MyChart & get back a response quicker than calling on the phone..,
"Couldn't describe how convenient and easy to use, very patient/ customer friendly. Strongly recommend",
"It's a very handy app, especially if you are forgetful like myself. Helps me keep track of almost all my medical appointments and information.",
"This is to medical care what Credit Karma is to your finances/credit! You can contact your Healthcare team by secure message, get prescriptions then have them filled and then check if they're ready, to name just a few benefits. You can also have & track more then one team, just set up an account in MyChart for each then link them. Real convenient. UPDATE 05/11/23: Yup, still good!",

The ease of using this app is wonderful. I love it. I also like the idea that my chart is easy to read and usually complete.,
"Very convenient, easy, clear pic clear sound. I don't always have the money to travel. I love it!",
As of late two weeks or so the app fails to load multiple pages and returns to the main page not sure if it's an issue with my android version or what but until that's resolved I won't give a good review,
"Super great app I can make and reschedule appointments. I can email my dr.ynvhary when has all the test I've done, results and all the meds I'm taking Great app I'm glad I downloaded it",
"I do not think its all that good but has potential to be a GREAT application if they allow Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Reiki Allergist and other Hollistic Doctors to utlize this application. Here in Connecticut most use and Utilize Sovita Chiropractic.",
"Easy to navigate! I can keep up with lab results, message physicians/staff, appointment reminders,upload/attach forms/pictures, doctor's notes ALL in one place.",
My Chart is SOO convenient to use; allowing thorough information for myself and to send messages to my providers. I can read everything necessary to know. THANK YOU ALL !,

"MyChart is the best Medical app that anyone could have. Convenient, easy to understand. I love that everything is at my fingertips.",
This has been the easiest app for me to use. Very helpful and easy contact with my physician and staff. And I can see all my test results as soon as they're available.,
So unbelievably handy and reliable. Just flip open the app and every test result is there. I read my own test results before the doc even called!,
First telemedicine application that really works for me. Simple and intuitive unfortunately health provider does not include phone numbers or similar,
Really useful tool as a reference when past dates etc are needed. Also to get test results quicker.,
Was a little skeptical at first but is definitely a time saver. Would recommend 100%. Easy to navigate for all ages.,
Recently this app has been useless in displaying messages and test results. Multiple times when looking for information I have had to go to the website to access the required data,
Inaccurate information in my file that office alleges is due to my chart program. It has been difficult to have changed so that it's accurate.,
Not all that impressed. I've been to my primary 3 times and 2 different referrals but yet when I go to my chart there's no Information. On any of it!,
I wish all medical offices could link to MyChart. It is nice being able to see my chart and the notes. Very convenient and informative.,
"MyChart is the best way to remotely keep up with all your medical requirements all consolidated in one easy to access location, a big hit in my house we love it.",
"I am 66 and it's easy for me to use , I normally don't give 5 stars very often because I have found over my years that people and companies start relaxing if they get a lot of 5 stars, but since this is easy for the elderly to use and it concerns medical, I am giving this App a SOLID 5 STARS",
"Love being able to connect with medical staff, get questions answered, stay informed, review records, be kept up-to-date on appts, and much much more!! Thank you, MyChart!",
"I love my chart, I can keep track of all my health needs can see what my results where from any tests done and can link all my health records together, makes it so easy for my doctors to see all my past medical records... I love this app",
"Very user friendly and is extremely useful in updating me with making appointments, test results and notifications.",
One of the best medical portals I have dealt with. Very user friendly. I am able to utilize the portal for two people. Very satisfied.,
I like it because I can always check on info that I forget plus my info is always there so if I need it or i want to ck test results they are readily available l really enjoy the fact it is always available if and when I need it!!,
"Great resource for current and past visits, tests, and procedures as well as way to capture my medical history and medications. Use it frequently.",
"Very User friendly. It's great app that you can schedule appts, refill prescriptions, see results & etc.",
"Keeps me on the know w my health. Can chat w doctors. It is very easy and very nice to have. Plus, it has all my scheduled appointments. I love it!!",
"Folks who don't like participation trophies sure love giving them to American capitalist health care. ""It's the best, you don't have to wait like those socialist"" while the women on the phone tell me they're booked till November. The problem is we don't have enough funding for more offices to spread the load. We need universal healthcare. Side note: I like the app.",
"Everything is conveniently located on the home screen, no looking for information on upcoming tests or studies.",
This app is very helpful and very easy to use. It makes everything that much easier and faster. Great app I recommend it to everyone who needs it GET IT!!!!!!!,
Makes communicating with your doctor a breeze. Keeps track of appointments and prescriptions. Much easier than a phone call for me.,
"Basically a 1 Stop medical app. It shows test results, past/future doctors appointments and see/pay medical bills. Very friendly and helpful to use",
Love this app. Makes reaching my doctors so easy. I can make appointments or just ask questions and my doctor will answer in the app. So convenient and easy.,
"Like My Chart, if I forget anything discussed with the drs I can go back and read the report. Also so easy to get appts or reschedule. Great app!",
It is a very good app. You can actually communicate with them and if you have any questions they will get back with you pretty quick. You get your results faster. You will know your results before your doctor does before they call. So I will give this more than a five if I could.,
"MyChart has been a valuable app to use… It is an appointment reminder, a way to view test, sends notes to my doctor, view helpful medical videos, contacts doctor prescriptions, view current prescriptions, and a lot more...",
Love being able to ask my doctor a question.anytime I want. And being able to see my medical records and test results anytime. Great app!,
I have a closer relationship with my doctor(s) especially in-between office visits. Very easy to provide updates and communicate with each other.,
Would like it to be easier to understand from people that aren't in the medical field But other than that are great very very good program. I love it,
The app is very easy to navigate. The display is also easy on the eyes. Great tool to communicate with my medical provider.,
Absolutely convenient for me to get ahold of my doctor any time I need too. It allows me to get all my test results and medication information all in one spot. I love it.,
"All of my medical charts in one app!! All of my doctors can compare notes to work better together, if they want. Love it!",
"This app is an awesome way to track appts, make appts, see and request medication, see test results more quickly and usually before your Dr does, and send messages to your Dr and your nurse! I luv it!!",
"Subpar, Cool concept and definitely alot of potential. But at the stage this is in now its not the best, don't fill out your forums on here stick to paper when your in person.",
I love to be able to look back and see what happened at my visits and bring able to email them with questions or refills. I love the app.,
"This is the Best Hospital App ever. Easy to use, easy to communicate with your doctor's. This is service is better than the Hospital and don't doctors itself.",
"For username, i entered something other than email. Now i cant login and have not found a way to change username. Please help. App works great if i can get in.",
This app is a blessing to me it let's me know what's going on after every Dr appointment &reminds me of my Dr appointments and I love this app so much and I love all my doctor's wouldn't trade them for nothing so glad I have all my doctor's and this app to remind me of my appointment's so I don't miss none of them. This app is very useful,
MyChart is a phenomenal tool and for what it does it melds perfectly with so many providers. Thanks for putting so much development into this fine application.,
I Love mychart..this allows me to see all my test results even before my follow-up appointments with my Doctors. My chart also allows me to read the after visit notes. This is helpful for me because sometimes I miss things that are important.,
"This app makes my medical stuff all together. Keeping track of my meds, my appointments and the ability to send Healthcare providers messages.",
"When i first got it, it let me login fine, but now it keeps saying it cant connect with my wifi and my data, so i cannot even get into it now.",
This is a great tool for anyone having medical procedures or health issues. To be able to go here and get the results from any tests or anything that involves your medical history.,
The appointments should be on the home page. It can get too busy and when you are pressed for time you tend just turn it off.,
"That app will not load messages, medication lists or doctor visit notes half of the time. It's extremely frustrating.",
This app.was great in the beginning...now it has issues...not responding to update personal information and messages sent are taking to long to respond!!,
"It has everything, Rxs, Drs., appt. schedules, reasons why I went to the Dr. It's very informative! I couldn't live without it.",
"Makes it so much easier to connect this way, Instead of filling out paperwork every visit. It's all in one places. 👍",
"The app is great for reviewing aftercare notes and Lab test, My problem is that I have all the information sense 2017 this is using the memory of the device How can l delete years past and only keep what is needed?",
"Do not like, can't refill medications from what I see, says u can, but no link to do so...Definitely needs updating to be more user friendly. Hope it improves!!",
"It's so easy to use, and saves time. Dr. Lee, and all Professional Dr.s nurses responses are very quick. I really appreciate that. Aloha to all, and God Bless you all.",
It allows me to have an active role in my health care right along with my medical team. Due to this app I was able to catch and be treated for a UTI/RVE that got overlooked just prior to an an urgent spinal surgery,
Would it be possible to add a print feature?? Or at least download to print visit summaries. Then I would give 5 stars! It's really ridiculous!!,
I love this app and keeping my appointments with all my doctors in one place. Also being able to compare current visits to past visits. Love it! ❤️,
"This App works and enables better communication between Dr and patient. While not perfect, it is better than being stuck in Phone-Tree Hell!",
"This app is wonderful. You can find out your test results, ask questions and not have to wait for the doctor to get in touch with you in person. All your meds and appointments are on it. Very helpful.",
Only works on clear days and doesn't do refills all that well.worked better when a simple phone call did it all and no mistakes happened.,
"I hate this app. Getting into it is terrible, especially if you have minors. There is no help if you can't get in, the payment system sucks.",
Need to download documents gives the option to but fails every time. Trying to reset password and guess what that doesn't work either,
I'm a Sr. Citizen and when it comes down to it. Anytime I have to use all this technology because I'm old school I usually have to ask one of my boys to help me with this but not this app it's so easy to follow. Using MyChart is quite easy to use and it's also very informative go in find out what happened on your last appointment & your medication order. Your able to Leave messages for your Dr & they will either message you back or call. I will continue to use my MyChart I will continue to use.,
"I just love the app, a lot easier for me to get my info from my doctor or ER physician!!!",
Had doctor visit last week. Very clear and sound was very good,
Very easy to use. I like contacting my doctor through messages. Ordering refills so easy. Love the app.,
"MyChart makes working with your health care provider easy. Schedule appointments, pay deductibles in advance, see your test results, and message your provider all within the app. It's very user friendly and very secure.",
I'm not going to play with this app all damn day. As a matter of fact I am not happy with the best of the medical apps because I have had to reset everything and I don't know what to do anymore I have to get into this app and see what I have to do before my next appointment in a few days. Please help me with this. It's all my fault I am just trying to find a little bit of help.,
Love it. Makes everything so much easier than having to keep paper records or trying to remember that thing that was recommended....,
I have high-speed internet but the app just spends a lot of time.,
"Awesome app, sp far I'm loving it. It's very informative and I love the communication and all the information that is available thru the app.",
Very easy to use and understand. I think one of the better ones then any of the others I have to use,
"This application is a great help for all your medical needs. From keeping track of appointments, medications, and test results. To pre-registration for appointments. This is a must-have for anyone seeing a doctor.",
Time saver. Less stressful as back in the day.,
Awful. Never works the first 3 or 4 times I try to log on. I've changed my password 5 times in one year!,
"Easy to schedule an appointment with the primary doctor or the team, see test results, and Easy navigate the app.",
It is a valuable tool to see all of your upcoming appointments and your test results. I also like that you can compare how you are doing to past results.,
Great to have appointments and results available easily,
"Privacy. . . Yada,yada. . . But there is no way to map a doctor's office. Get a pen and paper and write it down. Can I share my doctor's name with my wife, no. The app is simply too restrictive.",
Very easy to use. All the information is in one place.,
Love it except my procedures done at the same office don't show the billing on there. One of mine went to collections but it wasn't on my chat AT ALL!!! Still a little p*ssed.,
The signing up process could be a little bit more user friendly ;),
Easy to operate and free access to my medical files,
"Overall I have been very pleased with this application. They are improving it regularly, which makes it easier to use and are adding more features.",
"This app is awesome! I really like being able to schedule appointments, look at test results and being able to send a message to your doctor!!",
"Never describes what chargers are for. Just got a bill that appears nowhere on my charts, visits, etc, Im-changing back to paper billing!>,",
Very Convenient and Effective To Most of All Your Medical Concerns and Contact With Staff Teams.,
I like this app. Its even and convenient. I wish I could see the past test results chart in the app like the website,
"One the best NHS tools I've used. Neet little tool, Shame the Doctors appointment system isn't as good. Easy to use, Easy to log in, Need to use a few time to get up and running with it",
"Easy to use, no ads in it. Easy to talk to my doctor schedule appointments, view test results and see locations for appointments with various doctors",
"Excellent link between you and your health care provider. Assuming you have a hospital that uses it well. Mine does, UCLH, thank you. The user interface could be slightly better in my opinion but any failings are trivial. It seems to be very stable, I can't remember it ever crashing and I've used it alot over the last 18 months. I can't begin to list all the individual things it does for you, so read the details already provided. Rest assured that what they say the app does, it does well.",
"Great app. Easy to use. Very helpful! *UPDATE* I've now been using this about for several years and I don't know what I'd do with out it! Hands down the best medical, doctor to patient app!",
"Better | edit: does not inform you you need a separate app with a new account elsewhere until right before an urgent telehealth meeting, an app which bugged out and blocked my access Edit2: even less stars, because their review responder is clearly a bot",
Fact to fact. Easy to read. Excellent to reach doctors fast for refills or questions. Great all the way around.,
Easy to use. Notifications that keep you up to date with all correspondence. Very handy app.,
I love it!!!!! It helps so much. Never have a problem getting answers. They answer the questions immediately! I give MyChart A+++++++ infinity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
"I love using this app! I can see all what's going on in my medical charts,test results,etc. Thank you my charts!",
"The idea js great, but it lags a lot and the finger print scanner hasn't been working right. ⁸",
"Love this. Everything is there. You have test results, balances, and doctors notes. Everything is in one spot.",
"So easy to use. Plus, all my medical info is in one place.",
This makes keeping track of apps and media super easy,
Love useing my chart i can checking to keep up with any and all of my Healthcare concern..,
"Time-saver. Forgetful? Use this app. The ladies who helped me at the help desk, Gala and Renee were pleasant and completely helpful . Thank you!!",
"Easy to make appointments, get refills and test results easily and quickly. I'm notified right away when a new test result is in.",
"Quite useful this app saves the doctors time, its a pity it takes so long to update the test results, generally 14. days at least, so room for improvement",
"The only problem I have is I can't get into my messages, medicine list, anything.",
"I love this app! It allows me real time test results, easy appointment access, and my doctor is readily available through messaging. ♥️",
Love it I can make appointment on here pay any bill this is the best thing that happens I check my appointment as well,
This is the worst app I've ever had. It has never worked right and it just goes back to the same page no matter what I click. It's completely worthless! I do not recommend this at all. Total waste of time.,
Very informative Fantastic way to stay upto date on interaction with your medical team.,
"My experience using the app is so straightforward, I have no problem with it. I can get in touch with my doctor just like a snap of the fingers. Best thing ever.👍",
"I've been blessed by this app. It's fantastic. Let's me know about test,appt.,referrals and test results and doctors findings.",
Easy to use and quick response back from drs office.,
"This app crashes and lags at the most inconvenient times. There is no easy way for me to share my imaging from one organization to another even though they use mychart. I am on a small break and another ""issue"" with mychart is costing me time snd causing me stress. Why again are we letting private for profut companies control healthcare data?",
"I love this option for pre check-in and easy scheduling, access to Dr by text 24/7, always receive timely replies, all test results available as soon as they get them. There's an e-visit option and an immediate response e-visit on demand option. Very glad I have this app. It simplified my medical needs greatly. Can't recommend highly enough",
I despise My Chart. I get notifications & bubble that I have a message in the app. I open it & can't tell where or what or from whom the message is from. Then I spend inordinate amounts of time going through all the menu items trying to figure out where the message is. Why can't you use the bubble inside the app to direct us to whatever is new?,
I like the app for the most part but it has a couple of annoying quirks. It always says my phone number has not been verified. I have tried deleting and reinstalling it and entered my number again then tried entering it as a new number etc. But it never sends the code it says has been sent! So I can't verify the number. And I had a test done and the results were there the next day but now they have disappeared and I got a message in my email that there were new test results but nothing comes up.,
"App is user friendly and so helpful to be able to leave a detailed message for your physician or ask what teat results mean AND get a timely response. It saves time at the office to be able to complete e-check-in & complete questionnaires on the App prior to your ov (office visit). It is great to view records/test results anytime you want, access healthcare reminders and be able to request medication refills. It is a great App in an most fully paperless, electronic society.",
No problems with this app! I'm able to set appointments what's my doctors. I can order my medications through this app and have them delivered to me. I'm able to look at all of my upcoming and past doc appointments along with their notes about my visit. There's so much more that I have not mentioned in this app. It's just an all-around great tool to have. Everything that's in your medical chart is in this app. You can give access to family members if you'd like. No glitches or freezes.,
"Enables providers to save lots of time and resources. Provides very little benefit for patient, and is not clear and organized. Has lots of errors. Technical support services are non responsive.",
"Terrible security. The password prices goes way too far. Get over yourself. Look at the number of password resets that users have to do, I'm sure it's off the charts. This should tell you that you are substantially and needlessly inconveniencing your clients. I encourage all medical associations to reconsider whether they should be using mychart",
This app is very easy to use. And soo helpful to have. I cant tell you how many times ive forgoten which doctors office to go to or the time and date. And to be able to reach your doctors threw an email threw the app is very helpful ive had to do that a few times. I suggest this app to everyone I come accross that seems to need it as much as i do. Thank you to the one who created it.,
"MyChart has been a lifesaver through messaging with my doctor. I love this app bc it's saved him so much time and was able to move along faster without in-person appts. I have had nothing but great usage, refilling meds, Dr visits, all of my care team in one row so not have to search for one in particular, scheduled new appt dates over msg'ing, just so much this app provides for the patient is unbelievable! I can access almost everything I need. I rate this app a 10/5. 🎯",
MyChart it a great and easy way to stay informed on all your health related questions and test results as well as being able to reach you doctors by messaging and/or to have prescriptions refilled. I highly recommend the use of MyChart!,
Very helpful app for test results and ways to communicate with your doctors. I highly recommend it if your care team uses it :),
"This is a great way to communicate with your Medical team. I like being able to reach out and ask a question. The response is quick, especially on simple questions/concerns you may have.",
Very Convenient to keep up with doctor appointments and procedures,
It's the best way to keep up with your health. It keeps you informed about your test and your test results .,
Although slow in it's functionality the app works well. I suggest others to use biometrics when possible for logging in. ************************************ . NOTE: I am deaf PROFOUND. And cannot make phone calls as prompted on a regular basis which is very frustrating for people with this disability. BMC should have a TEXT-ONLY phone line available for the deaf IMO. Thanks,
"This is the best app ever!! I have all my appointments, test results, visit notes, etc. in one place. And if I need to get in contact with any of my doctors or staff member, I can do it through the app and the answer is super fast, sometimes faster that when I call the office and leave a message!! Great app!!!",
I Absolutely love this application it's so convenient!!!! Thank you for creating this App 🥰,
Extremely easy to use and convenient,
"Very convenient for non urgent care, keep us connected to the care team",
The only reason I gave 3 stars is because there is nowhere to reschedule an appointment. I looked everywhere. Hopefully this could be added. Thank you,
"The app is so easy to use. From seeing my medical information to paying a bill, everything is handy and user-friendly.",
"Wonderful app for managing all health related information including appointments, medications, test results and after visit notes and summaries. It works with almost all providers, labs, hospitals. Even worked while out of state capturing all information from ER visit to share with my primary care provider for follow-up. MyChart improves the accuracy of information between all members of my care team.",
"Terrible app, Locke me out of my health records. Way too many providers to select everything should be automatic. Can't reset passwords link will never go to my email",
"This app allows me to easily see upcoming appointments, see upcoming requests for quarterly blood work, get results for different tests, ask questions & receive answers, all without having to wait days for a return call from the doctors office.",
I love this app. It lets me directly message my doctor with any questions and quickly schedule any appointments I need and remotely check in early.,
Great to know the results. Also nice ti give feedback.,
"I love this App, it's very easy to use. I'm able to see and pay my bill and contact my doctor for questions or appointments.",
My chart is great for me. Although I don't like repetitive notifications. Once will suffice.,
I have really enjoyed this app Over. the past 6 years. It Provides you with everything you need to know about your medical care. Anyone Who is in this network should have this app. Thank you MyChart,
I absolutely love mychart it's all my doctors at my finger tips if you're like me and have several different medical hosts you can switch organizations very easy with 1 tap of the finger I have and will continue to recommend it to others,
I really do appreciate my CHART. I am able to look at my information with the touch of a finger anytime of the day or night once it has posted.,
"Does not work as advertised. Can't select the correct provider, everything is locked down. Not patient centered.",
Great app keeps me in touch with my doctor upcoming appointments past appointment.,
Has taken me quite a while to become used to using this App. I'm still learning after approximately 18 months.,
"This app helps me when I need to look up something, be it a result or a previous message from my provider.",
I've loved MyChart and have used it ALOT but whatever has recently happen to it is horrible. Not able to log on and no support available after hours.,
I love mychart. It easy to converse with my doctor and gives me the freedom to check post visits notes. I love the convenience of my medical information at my fingertips.,
"After you explore the app in depth, it is very useful for scheduling referrals, asking questions of your physician,requesting prescription refills & best of all receiving your medical results.",
I love this app it's so easy and very easy to understand,
Love the access to your health along with reminders of appointments. Also allows you to e check in and correspond with staff,
Perfect for looking at test results and dr visits. Quick feedback from staff when a question is asked.,
This is the most convenient app. It's fantastic to be able to do everything in the same place for all of my doctors. They recently added a compare trend feature for any test results. Finally I can see it all in one place instead of going back and forth. Highly recommend.,
This app has made my life so much easier and keeps me abreast of any and all changes that occur on my behalf. Whomever created mychart deserves a cookie. Thank you.,
I am definitely not a electronic person. It frustrates me. This week I needed eye gets for pink eye and it took 2 days to get it. I finally just called and talked to s person,
Would be a good app if it didn't constantly crash.,
I have a my medical info in one area as I use medical professionals in the same partnership. My personal np responds to direct communication thru My Chart. Reminders are fantastic as well.,
I love my chart i love the convince of the app getting ur results and Dr Burgher-Jones office always keep ne informed on my results progress whatever i need #1 Dr Burgher-Jones 😍🤎🤎🙏🏽,
"I get a lot of use from the portal. I do wish there were only one portal for Columbus, Seymour & North Vernon. Or make it interchangeable easily",
We are very excited to have this app! It is very efficient and helps us navigate through the medication and test results as well as appointments.,
I love this app it shows you all that you need to know. Especially when the doctors don't really tell you the truth about scan's.,
Makes it so much easier to communicate with my doctors keep up with appointments.,

Very helpful in all the ways concerning medical matters...,
"Not that easy to navigate. Providence seems to want to use this App as a vehicle to have less engagement with their patients. So, now the only interaction we are allowed is with the Call Center, who are illequiped to get the assistance we need.",
"I love how this works on my phone, everything is at your fingertips. My problem is that I want to put it on my desk top. Why can't I put this on my desk top this would be easier for me to read and respond to mu notifications.",
"I love it! I can keep track of my appts, make an appt and send messages to any one of my Dr's. I would highly suggest this app to anyone.",
I really love this app except here in the last month or so I can't ever get into messages and I'm not able to click on the Drs notes and see them,
I wish all hospitals and doctors used the one MyChart App. It is so easy to use and a life saver. It's so confusing having so many different Apps,
This has made it so much easier to keep up with my appointments and see my results. Easy to use from what I have used of it. Probably one of the best things that PMC has done in a while,
My chart has been very helpful for me. Easy to send messages to my doctor as well as getting test results.,
"Outstanding app, easy to use, comprehensive!",
Only one thing I would change that would be very useful. If someone needs to have labs done it doesn't tell us if it is fasting or not. Other than that I like it,
Very helpful. This makes life so much easier. I can't live without this app.,
"Easy-to-use, easy to navigate, insightful.",

App is great to use and very organized. It's a great way to keep in touch with the doctors and have control of medical records.,

"Good 💩 guys, ordered my refill straight from the App, delivered the next day dune. 👌",
"Easy and user friendly , I love how it allows you to link all of your accounts together so you can stay organized and communicate between all medical people talking care of you",
Good for confirming appointments but cannot reply to messages sent to me by medical providers. Kind of unhelpful.,
2 step verification is inconvenient. Specifically the text option either not working or taking several hours to go through.,
I truly love the app.! It's so easy to use and find everything you need to keep in touch with your doctor. I think geisinger is the best service I ever had!! Thank you,
Cannot login on my chart and sending codes is just as bad can't get I fo.,
I’ve used My Chart for many years on my Android phone but when I tried using it on my iPhone it hardly ever lets me sign in saying my password or user name is incorrect and I know it’s not. I’m glad a kept it on my android. I’ve tried uninstalling it and installing it again but I still have the same problem. I hope this issue can be resolved soon.,
Not a hundred percent sure about HIPAA compliance I believe this is the wrong account I'm logging into with security it is nowadays I don't know if this is working out this is a valid account just not the right one,

"Incredibly frustrating I have to redo my password every time. Other than that, it's a good app to have.",
I have had this app for 3 years now and I am very happy with it. I have one doctor that doesn't have this app and I just told him his office should switch over.,
Slowest app on the planet.. takes forever for the app to open.. Then it takes forever to open the messages to send a message.. ugh,

I love my chart if u need your test results fast this give u access fast or all information love it,
"I really like this app. It's very easy to use & everything is listed in a timely manner. U can even talk directly to UR Dr, his assistant or anyone that has/had to do with UR case.",
"Super helpful app, it makes scheduling appointments, seeing Dr notes, and getting test results back 100 times easier!",
"I love this app. It's easy to navigate, I can schedule appts, request refills or submit questions. 5 stars across the board!",
"You can't delete old messages. I would have given it 5 stars, but when you have messages sitting in trash and can't delete them, I only could give it 3.",
Love this app! Well organized and intuitive,
It's so awesome to be able to not have to collect those appointment cards. I love getting all my medical info in one secure location! Totally awesome,
App is easy to use & very complete.,
Good convenient way to communicate with your medical team,
I love this app. Easy to use and my doctor can inform me of my test results and other medical procedures and we can discuss medical concerns through the app. I highly recommend it.,
"It needs more work, I wish they considered feedback from the people who use this app, so far I can't even manage my kids' account in only one family account.",
Fantastic application. Very user friendly.,
This app is very helpful to keep in contact with all my physicians. My medication can be renewed easily.,
Makes life easier! I have not had a problem getting the information I need.,
Screens take too long to load.,
Very helpful when needing to look up my stuff and to share with my family doctor and other doctors as needed,
Is a very helpful app..everything I need to know is easy ti find it..Thanks to all of you for care about me.,
Unable to initiate an initial conversation with a doctor unless the doctor you wish to contact reaches out first. The process needs to be refined for the patient to begin a dialogue with their provider,
Very useful and easy to use everything in one place,
Constantly get error messages and told to try again later. Easier to just make a phone call.,
Helps me advocate for myself. Helps me to better communicate with my providers.,
"I love the app, and refer to it often, if not daily. Especially for appointment info etc. What I find that could use a change, is the echeckin, which I've been told is not actually used as part of the appointment ""check in"" to the various depts. I love the access I have to all my information, especially test results which includes scan reports etc. (Not only blood work). I would love to also have access to the actual scan images as well as the written reports. thank you",
Very good for keeping track of my health. Easy to use. Allows me to check on appointments and be on time with information needed for medical team,
Hard to make appointments on app not all providers shown,
Excellent app and easy to use.,
"Love this app. All information is there. After-visit summary, appointment reminders, lab results, etc.",
"It was my best app until 6/27 when I was forced to reset/change my password 😑. Why? But outside of that, I like MyChart 👍🏼.",
"Love this app, so easy to contact my providers.",
"It is very helpful, easy to use, very intuitive",
"Love it when it works! Half the time I can't get into the individual sections. It keeps saying something about server error try again later. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.",
"I'm a completely new user so these are just first impressions. App seems impressively well-designed & I look forward to its overall utility but holy hell, devs... if I'm picking a state/COUNTY then do *not* force me to scroll through 100+ [non-US] options!😵 Some sort of search bar or alphabetical shortcut should be incorporated, albeit idk how that would be achieved as is when they're drop-down menus; best to let them extract from zip or be basic text like city is imo. Also: DARK MODE please😓",
"The Android version of this app is horrible. I realize epic is a giant company, but instead of asking hospitals what should be in the app, have your pm staff spend a few days in the hospital trying to keep track of their care using the app. They will come out with a whole new attitude about how the app should look and feel. I also know that you want to have 1 interface that works for everyone, the result is a disaster. Everyone is saddled with an interface for for a 100 year old senial person.",
It's a one stop shop. Make appointments. Reorder prescriptions. And message the Doctor anytime and have a response within a reasonable time.,
Very informative about appointment scheduling and cancelation.,
Love this App. I can view my Healthcare with just a click.,
I love seeing my results of testing and remindings for appointments!,
Best health service portal and derivery I have ever come across.,
Great customer service. Have great doctors. But your hospital doesn't take Aetna Better health care plans any more so I had to leave,
I really like the my chart it's so convenient and you get your results before you see your doctor and don't have to be worried or in suspense wondering what is wrong with you,
Great place to keep track of everything medical.,
very simple to navigate and easy to use,
"This has been such help for me because I am always on the go. If any of my son's teachers need a result, I am able to show them, and I save Gas ! Thank You Alta-Med !",
"I love how easy it is to organize my family health records and bills. I like how I can jump to another hospital's Mychart, it is very convenient.",
"Easy to understand UI, great for scheduling, Test results, visit notes, visit summary, sending messages and plenty more.",
Mychart provides my medical information no matter where I happen to be. I can just bring up my medical information to any provider. Even if I don't remember the name of the medication that I'm on I can just bring up the app and there it is. It is wonderful,
Love EVERYTHING about it. Specially how it REMINDS YOU of upcoming appointments. And it gives you test results. Absolutely necessary 💯💯💯💯%%% HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,
Keeps freezing when pulling up messages. Haven't been able to send or read any for a while .,
Everything is so simple 😌 2 used n understand iam just learning how 2 use computers mychart great app,
Unable to change answers if you make a mistake. This caused a great deal of confusion and extra paperwork in an already confusing system,
Been using this app for several years to communicate and keep up with my medical stuff. It's easy to use and updates immediately . I highly recommend this application.,
Really helpful and informative very convenient.,
Quick and easy way to contact the office,
"I have been using MyChart for awhile now and it sure makes it easy for me to see all my doctors, appointments and labs needed! Thank you MyChart",
All the information was present for me to view. All the future and past visits were there for me to check anytime I wanted or needed to review my appointments.,
Have MyChart has been a great feature! Being able to message your doctor or look at recent visits or being updated on needed results has been excellent!,
For a person who is impatient this app helps get me my results quicker refills and scheduling piece of cake,
Most of the time works well and provides better doctor patients communication.,
Very user friendly and easy to maneuver.,
"It would be a 5, if I could get some help figuring out why I have been having difficulty reading letters and summaries!",
"I see that others are getting a blank screen after they log-in. I can't even get that far. The app gives me an error when I TRY to log in, so I cannot log-in at all. In a reply it sounded like it was an issue the developers of this app are having with Android. Might wanna prioritize addressing the problem because this is pretty unacceptable.",
"It is a fantabulous app for most of your medical needs, questions, scheduling app'ts and messaging your health care professionals. CCF is always finding ways to improve this app by refining existing formats & adding new features!",
Needs to be updated not showing latest test results.,
"Would be good if it worked. Trying to pay a bill, option doesn't work. Can't find account number info for bill. Put in payment info and app takes me back to first page. Send email for help, they say there are no problems, and send number to pay by phone.??? Why have the app? The ability to schedule appointment works occasionally. Would be great thing to have if it worked like it should. Customer service is no help.",
Easiest way to keep track of appointments and message doctors. Also links to the website so I can also use my computer and it is all the same,
"Awesome, this app helps you make appointments, get medicine refills, read the after appointment notes to keep you informed if you haven't installed it yet do it it's great",
"So convenient! I wish you could access letters and download them from the app, but other than that, I think it's a great app.",
I absolutely love this app! Add had a double transplant of the kidney and pancreas. I have so many doctors appointments that is hard to keep track. MyChart helps me keep track of every appointment. I also get to see my blood work often before the doctor does. The lab results goes into detail for those of us that did not go to college to become a nurse or a doctor. I am not going to lie but I am very dependent upon this app. Lol being a single mom I'm juggling all of our stuff is crazy.,
"Great app for communicating with your care team for planning visits, refilling prescriptions and especially as a repository for your health care history. Why a 4-star review: Since covid I have been getting vaccinations at my local CVS. The CVS vaccinations are not available to my health care provider even though I have both organizations in Mychart. So my healthcare provider keeps recommending vaccines such as for shingles or pneumonia for me even though I have gotten them from CVS.",
"Sometimes, this is a little difficult to work with. May be my misunderstanding of the electronic system. It does, however, give me an avenue to speak with my provider so I can get answers immediately at times. I get the opportunity to place refill of medication order when needed. Gives my provider an opportunity to speak to me and answer questions as well as ask them.",
Easy to view upcoming apps. And pre-register,
"Great, I love seeing all the red flags the doctors don't question! My chart works better than the doctors that put the information into it!",
I love this app it is very convenient to use and contact my PCP via messages and Labs for blood work and easy way to get your test results back also.,
"Since update can no longer view clinical notes and when I try to view images I now get an error message when I click on the link (takes me to a nilread site that doesnt work). Used to be awesome now its basically useless. No one can tell me who to contact or how to fix or what happened and Im extremely frustrated because having the ability to view notes and images was the only way I knew what was actually going on because most of the staff here are new, young, undertrained and clueless.",
Excellent app up to date app.real time services of appts.,
Wonderful and easy to use. Helps me remember things. It's great for making my appointments. I'm very happy that all my doctors belong to The Everett Clinic. I've been with them since moving here to Washington.,
"Well designed, ease of use... Love it.",
It isnt the best when medical staff fail to use the features provided in the app. If you sell an app. the medical team should be required to follow up with patients.,
I like the app. When I lose my papers this app helps with appointments,
"The message center, you should be able to send to any doctor you have, but you can't. Then you only have a few days to Rey or is grayed out. You send a message and no reply.",
Really easy to use and read,
Great app very useful n helps me with all my medical needs.,
Great for contacting medical without a lot of phone tag!!,
Great app if your service provider is useing it they choose wisely. It keeps you updated on your appointments and you can see your blood work test asap and much more. Overall it a great app. It great to have your medical information at your own fingertips. Great way to communicate with your medical staff. If you have a question you can message it to the doctor. My doctor responds fast which is cool. You can also set up appointments without the annoyance of having to call some automated service.,
Great app. Love referring to my results so I can discuss issues or questions with my doctor. The updates have been excellent.,
Great. Makes it so easy to get a hold of my Dr's and their teams.,
Very informative as well as helpful.,
"This is, by far, one of my favorite apps! Getting relevant information and the available opportunity to communicate with questions regarding my health is top notch!",
I truly had the best care in ICU! Everyone who came in from nurses to those doing testing was wonderful.,
I really like that you're not left wondering about your tests...and that you can access so much...,
Itseems thatheres noway to view past msgs/letters (fersumreasin they're 2diff formats but basikly conveying the same communications??) once they're read theyseemto disahpear & cai8nt be retrieved/reviewd later ifone whantsto be reminded of sumthg thatwuz containd inthem????,
"They would like you to go paperless on bills, but after 3 months app still not fixed so you can pay it. Did put out a message about 2 1/2 months after that they know it is not working, but still have not sent a paper bill during the down time. Good at tracking appointments, was easy for seeing test results, just would like them to fix the bugs.",
so easy to keep up with appts records and labs,
This app is good except where you're notified that you need to schedule an upcoming appointment - it doesn't tell you for what! It needs to tell you what it's in reference to.,
Pretty solid all around. And definately works amazingly well... provided the care you're receiving utilizes it. Hit a Home Run with the 'Proxy access' so I can help manage my partners complex medical care. Enabling it was fast and secure. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the ability enter records of my own from non-Epic medical office visits. Bonus points if you can enable any kind of basic document reading / rendering. The UI could stand to be a bit more modern too.,
Very informative & easy to use. I highly recommend it.,
Very easy to use and really convenient.,
Love love love this app! It makes it so easy in every aspect to know and get my medical history. The only small issue is that when you receive new notifications they seem to change location within the app. For example I received a new message from my Dr attached to a pathology report and after reading it it was moved from the front screen to appointme to and test results. Just a little confusing but all in all great app!,
"this app is pure Spyware...it actually tracks patients' movement everywhere. It has ability to automatically check you in when you walk into Dr office/clinic/group. The only way that happens is using tracking. Perhaps it's the phone pinging the location which is, again, Spyware tracking. What other uses will this ability be used for? This was bound to be used despite denial at release... bullcrap.",
"There are several convenient features to this app, however the annoyances overshadow those conveniences. I am continually asked to review my personal information. I do the review, nothing has changed, but the app keeps asking. Very annoying. Also I have successfully linked my My Chart account with CVSHealth, but every couple of months it unlinks and I have to re-link again.",
"It's a good app when it functions right, but I've been locked out of my account because of a bad password no less than 3 times now and I've had to change it (even though I was 100% positive I was entering the correct one) every time, and my account was not compromised. Further, I've had past issues that inexplicably KEPT me locked out of MyChart for upwards of 2 weeks at a time for reasons unknown, and said reasons were never made privy to me. I was simply ""able to login again"" one random day.",
"This app is riddled with bugs. I can no longer sign in with biometrics, it always gives a password error. I am also no longer able to modify a payment plan or pay for services through the app. I once found the app somewhat useful but it is buggy and broken now. I'm not confident that such a bug-ridden app should be trusted with personal health information.",
"This app has been invaluable to me. Recent health issues have resulted in many many hospital & office visits in the past year. MyChart has made every aspect of my associations with Providence accessible to me around the clock. Appointments entered directly into my calendar at the push of a button, test results, medical history, medications, and visit notes available for review, plus the ability to message my provider - MyChart provides all of this in a user-friendly, well designed format. Kudos!",
"This app has been great in handling all my family medical appointments and billing. Wish dentist, pathologist and smaller medical providers would use this.",
Easy app to look up your medical history records orders that is secure⚕️,
"Am happy I'm able to see all my test results, after summary notes etc on this app. Only bad thing is the Dr's that don't use it",
Have had great experience with the MyChart it great to have communication with my doctor and staff,
"I love the convenience of this App to manage my healthcare. The only complaint I have is; I'm not sure which it is, When my computer updates, or they do updates to the app my UN and PW isn't recognized. Not sure which it is. I do put a slip in with IT. My computer updated 2 days ago. But I could get on the app yesterday. Last night I could no longer access my information. I find it frustrating because it always seems to occur when there are results and/or a message from my PCP.",
The staff here is awesome!! Dr. Keller is my favorite. He always pays attention to you when your explaining what is wrong with you and ask all the right questions. The staff is great with keeping you informed about what's going on. The ladies in the Catscan room were very helpful with explaining the process and letting me know what to expect during my procedure. I will always come to this hospital for my medical care. Keep up the good work 👏,
My star rating reflects the fact that the MyChart app doesn't save FORMS that are completed during e-check-in. It takes about 30 mins to complete the check-in with forms. When I arrive at my appt. I'm checked in manually (another 10 min) The paper version of the form that I completed on line is then handed to me for completion. I've advised the staff of this issue several times and nothing has changed. I decided to enter a review after the same thing occurred for an upcoming appointment.,
"The app itself is ok I suppose. What I oppose to is when your appt. that you've been looking forward to gets canceled at the last minuet for no real obvious reason. I waited a good while for the appt. that's of extreme importance to me. Trying to get hold of an actual human being over the phone is almost unheard of these days. No one wants to interact with a man made machine. Pick up the phone ladies, there are actual people who really NEED the service.",
"Overall, a medium ranking...seems more convenient, but until every care provider adopts it, I find it dysfunctional. I have missed appts because My Chart only has partial info, and oftentimes, unhelpful because of lack of input. WHy can't my counseling appts be included? I have some unknown amt of loss of cognitive function...I don't need an array of specialized apps to do this, My Chart was built for this, I believe. Very dissappointed in it's overall performance. I just missed an appt, and thi",
"I'm very disappointed with how things have went with the app lately. There was recently a breach, preventing me from logging in. I had to start a completely new account, put in the verification code emailed to me only to have the app tell me it couldn't verify my information and a code would be sent by mail. This is ridiculous...",
"I like being able to see my health care plan along with medical record notes from each appointments. It is really convenient for making appointments or changing them as well. Very easy to manage and refill my prescriptions, sending and receiving messages back with easy access to my health care provider and team without having to call them. I can access my test results with detailed information. I also can pay my medical bills through this app with the option of making automatic monthly payment",
"Very good ... I Appreciate my info being organized and all in one place . The doctors have my info and now so do I and can refer back to it any time. My only complaint is the test results. I can't effectively read them nor do I understand the symbols along the margin of some of the results - especially the ! - in a circle that leads you to believe it needs immediate attention ,causing upset. There should be a page or call center for a quick explanation of how to interpret the symbols etc.on app.",
"This app is great, simple to navigate and receive my results fast. I receive notifications by email and text, which is great. I can access most of records. Only problem... wish you can see all past testing (not just the past year) to make comparisons to most current/recent test records.",
"Love this app. Appts, lab and test results, doctors visit comments which is nice as sometimes I forget some of what was discussed in the appointment.",
I love this app!!! I am in control of my medical appointments records and I can also review and message my doctor it's GREAT!!!!,
Works well to make appointments and get test results back really fast. Haven't had any issues.,
"Worst app on my phone. Difficult to use & navigate. I work in tech & have owned cell phone and internet companies. I do internet cabling and tech for international airports. I use apps, phones etc all day. This is the worst app I've been forced to use. Maybe the developers are looking to give a child-like experience? Idk, but the bubbles and transitions suck. This is medical. We need straightforward & concise. This app is anything but!!! Clean it up. Make it simple.",
The app provides useful and timely information to my health condition,
Very easy to use and informative,
This app is very convenient. It allows me to look at my doctor's notes and any other Dr office can see it too.,
"Great app that allows easy access to my past medical information, future appointments, and communication with my medical team.",
Having too much trouble con nnecting to umc for e-check in,
"This app makes it easy it easy to see up coming appts, refill rxs, schedul appts and check your test results.... When it's working. I've been having a lot of trouble with accessing my medication and checking my messages on the app for a few weeks now. Prior to this trouble the app was working perfectly and took a lot of the anxiety out of dealing with all of my drs, scheduling appts and refilling my rxs. I'm not sure what's changed... Maybe the latest update? Idk",
Very helpful tool to look at and manage my Healthcare,
It's a wonderful app You can do everything on you can cancel appointments on there you can do E-Check ins they let you know when your appointments are it's just a great app to have on your phone and you get your test results on here too which is really nice,
"It's nice to have access to your children's records all in one place, no papers to clutter at home. I really enjoy MyChart for my girls!",
"Why can't the items that need attention show up on the main screen so that if you have say two messages a number 2 would show on the main screen on the message icon, etc. I had two letters that I was not aware of them until just recently. For prescriptions and appointments my chart works great but it could stand some major changes to be easier to use.",
"Since the latest update receiving multiple ""server error"" messages. Have made several attempts to send refill requests to my doctor's office. All unsuccessful even though I receive a confirmation page. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Can not currently trust this app for anything. Update: April. No improvement, app or website. App uninstall. Back to the 90's and the telephone. Also, brand new phone in recent days. Android 11. Not the issue, or shouldn't be.",
"They bill you, but never say what the bill us for. they say you owe money, but never give a visit summary or treatment code for the bill. My bill came in nearly 6 months after my last visit with no explanation as to why I was getting billed. Also, paperless billing was turned on for my account. I never turned it on. I liked it better when they gave bill summaries, but this seems to have went away when U of M took over.",
My Chart is a great communication tool and is accessible for all my needs. Very consistent.,
"My chart keeps me up to date with all of my appointments and test results, scheduling and canceling if need be!! It's ALL here!!",
"Love everything about the app but the last few days we have been unable to log into both my and my husband's MyChart. Keep getting an error message that says ""we couldn't log you in right now, please try again later"". Our login name and password are correct on both accounts but for some reason the app is NOT working and it is VERY frustrating as we need to see the cancer marker test results!!! We have already sent an email to Epic MyChart Support regarding this issue.",
"It's great to be able to track my health, appointments, and medications.",
Information is there for you quickly. Scheduling is nice and effortless. Nice job!!!,
"I love being able to refill meds, ask my doctors questions and schedule my own basic appointments. As a disabled mother-of-three, MyChart helps me keep everybody's medical issues and medicinal needs at the tip of my fingers. I love how quick I can reach out to our doctors and get a response back. I absolutely hate sitting on the phone, most people have problems understanding me, my mouth spasms a lot and sometimes it's a lot easier for both me and the doctor / nurse with less confusion.",
The app is awesome in general with a lot of information and ability to communicate. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the checkin process. It is excruciatingly long and tedious answering/reviewing all the same info every time. Then walking inside and still needing to read and sign papers with the same info just verified in the app. My insurance and ID are also stored in the app but they still want to see the cards and make copies.,
I like being able to read my chart better than speaking to someone on the phone and I can go back and read past appointments.,
I love this app. Tou can see and do anything you need or want to do here!!! I love having access to my test results and being able to see the notes that the Soctors have written concerning your case.,
"It was an ok health app before, but now even trying to do something as simple as scheduling an appointment with my primary care physician is rediculously overcomplicated. Now, in order to schedule an appointment, I have to go to schedule, find the right location out of all hospitals in the system, pick a category, and then sort through all available appointments with all the professionals that work at that location. And my doctor usually STILL isn't in that list. Review edited due to response.",
"The app is good for looking at test results with the updated way it uses graphics. The app works ok for scripts that are good for an extended time. I do not find the app to align easily with scripts that change. My pharmacy goes out of it's way to help manage costs. It may be my phone, my lack of skill, and changes in gov rules but the app reduces my confidence in communicating with my physician's office. The office is well run. Like here, #of characters is limited. Attachments sometimes work",
Just wonderful ..very quick to update and plus all my information is right here at my fingertips..100%,
This is a good app to have because it lets you see test results and upcoming appointments,
It makes things convenient and easier.,
This is a very useful and well put together app. It is very easy to use. Makes the doctors visit so much easier. 👍👍👍,
"This is one of, if not the best app for medical appointments, test results, and all other aspects of managing my health!!!",
"I am happy with Mychart. Harrison Co. Hospital is affiliated with Norton's but test results, etc. are not showing up on Norton's MyChart page.",
"It has some useful features that aren't available when I access my chart directly thru UCLA online. But it doesn't give me the option of deleting or marking as completed old appointment reminders. Also, redundant lab results aren't available for viewing. But it's useful in that I can do video appointments with my doctor.",
"Love it the best way set appointment, talk to doctors, and not have to spend time talking to automated systems 😁 10/10",
"App is very annoying while trying to sign in. Asks for a PIN. Then asks for verification code sent via email. Doesn't come. You resend code, no code. You do it again. Three emails come with the same verification code. Code doesn't work. When you get to use the app, it's only good for checking on appointments. If you want to MAKE an appointment, they tell you to call. Then why is it an option? They made an app they don't care about apparently. UPDATE: Same thing happened today. Didn't receive a code for 15 minutes, then multiple codes came via email. None worked and now I'm locked out of my account. Worthless. Update: They can't unlock me. Ask your health care provider. They won't help anymore. Beyond worthless.",
"New version looks no better & still missing Dark mode. Many functions fail to load the information requested, instead returning a vague error that it failed. When they do work the app is very slow. Way too many functions still only supported via web browser making the app semi-useless. Don't release it until you've got it all working.",
"To many hoops to access it , should be able to delete after reading something and not have it pop back up",
Mix things a lot easier to get a hold of your doctor and get messages across and interact without making a million phone calls definitely useful for me,
Awesome app. I know test results and appointments before they do most the time. Very useful and efficient.,
Very easy to keep up with appointments,
"It's fine, but a lot of the features don't work. For example, I can enter all of my payment information to pay a bill, but there's no button or way to submit the payment. There's just a ""Back"" and ""Cancel"" button. Very irritating. Not to mention the other features that take you to the website, just to turn around and say that the feature isn't available right now, and to logout and try again. It's honestly just a half-assed app that's been poorly put together.",
Terrible unable to log in and no response,
Extremely glitchy. Signed up and access the application successfully once. Since then it has not worked. Nor does it interface with the applications of other medical networks like it is supposed to. Other networks show that it cannot connect to the server for this app. Really irritating since I need to verify information for an upcoming Hospital procedure.,
"Fairly happy with it; some rough edges: 1. No message drafts and can't see what I'm replying to. 15 min writing reply, pop out to re-read the message or test result, poof! Gone. 2. Getting a reminder for the flu vaccine from one provider after I got the shot at at another. Edit: 3. Stuck in ""500 - Internal Server Error"" on trying to fill out a pre-visit questionnaire. Seems to have cleared itself. 4. The ""logout"" button looks like a ""send message"" button, and dumps the message you were writing.",
"This app is very helpful, especially during hospital stays.",
For several weeks I have been informed that my account is disabled. I have tried resetting my password but without success. I have not changed my user name and password because it was automatically saved on my PC and I am sure it is correct. It has been the same since I joined MyChart. I would greatly appreciate feedback from whoever is responsible for sorting out these glitches. I'm awaiting news of the results of various scans and blood tests as well as news of my next appointment.,
It's a lot easier to get in touch with the my doctor and make appointments,
It is a lot easier to request refills on your medication. You also get a quick response if you have questions for your physician or about your medication. You can also see when your next appointment is and what your test results are.,
"Fair app. It would be much better and much more useful if we could select our insurance companies from a drop-down box. For example, I have two insurance companies and every time I use one, when I go somewhere else that doesn't accept it but they accept the other, it defaults to the last one selected and there is no way to change it. Therefore, this app has become useless because I can no longer check in or pay because it is defaulted to the wrong insurance company. Please fix this ASAP!",
Really enjoy this app even a trip to er shows everything they didn't tell me,
I personally very much so like this app for the fact that it's a for sure way that you can for sure know that your doctors team is getting your messages compared to actually having to call the office or clinic and someone else takes your messages and info but you never hear back from the doctor and they say that they didn't get the message that the person must've got busy and forgot to give it to the team . Although I don't like the part about how the labs or diagnosis are put in here but there',
like the app but has a big problem once something is entered to it you can't get it changed have made numerous calls and inquiries all to no help.,
"Unfortunately, I'm dealing with several health issues that require me to see several physicians. Using MyChart allows me to easily add appointments to my Google calendar. It also gives easy access to records, test results, and a easy way to communicate with my providers. MyChart is probably the most used app on my phone, I would be lost without this truly useful app. Bill Nolan",
"It is very convenient for me to be able to message questions to my Dr rather call and wait for a call back, I believe it saves time for the practitioner also",
"I love this app, all your information from multiple medical facilities in one place. I will say it is 100% the best of all apps.",
"I find this app very useful for checking appointment dates, lab scheduling and results, and for messagjng my physicians with brief questions that do not require a visit.",
"The my chart app is so convenient and easy to use and understand. I can Make my appointments in the app, email the Dr. Get my test results. I can update it anytime I have to. I'm having surgery this month and I already have everything scheduled in my chart. The directions and all. This app is the best thing to have. It also saves me time on everything. I love it",
They are always very kind and always have my medications. They also helped me with my vacation medications. I recommend them to anyone!!,
"Top app for organizing life. No matter if you are healthy and rarely see a physician or if you are getting daily treatments. This will help you stay organized and less stressed. Create appointments, go to video visits and refill meds all from here. My favorite part is it will send appointments over to Google calendar. I just wish it would sync all appointments, instead of me telling it to do each one. Maybe update that....",
I love my chart. Very easy to navigate.,
"Easy, comprehensive & detailed.",
"This is such a great app. It's easy to navigate and track everything! Even my entire family, which is very helpful. I can go back years and clearly see the doctors I saw, what tests I took and the results. I can locate tests results hours after getting my blood drawn. Haven't used a better system really!",
I do not prefer the new dashboard/homepage setup. My brain doesn't want to recognize all the circles and weird design format. I don't want pretty and artistic from my medical provider. I want easy access and lists I can choose dropdowns to get what I need fast. Still grateful for the access and the idea but not a fan of the updated version. Meh.,
The care I received was excellent! Outstanding physician and Dr Cardoza-Kellog was thorough and very professional!,
"This app would be great if only messages were actually accessible consistently. I'm notified of new messages but every time I log in to the app it's always a toss up whether or not the messages center is even visible from the menu. The inconsistency is the strangest part of this bug, and it seemed to have only started when my provider released their own app that supposedly links to my MyChart info, so this may be an issue caused by my provider and not the app itself.",
"Very, very simple to use. All of my Dr's name and info is readily accesible with pictures of each individual. The appointments part is equally helpful. The time, date, location and with cleveland clinic at least the desk location. Making appointments and prescription drug reordering couldn't get much easier. Also, not only upcoming appointments but it's very easy to look at past ones also. This is a very handy and as mentioned easy, convienent, and available anytime that I want to obtain info.",
MyChart is a Great App. to communicate with your medical professionals.,
Modern app for the modern day patient. Just the fact that it's so easy to pull up on my phone and check/send messages to any of my health care providers. Or check where and when that schedule was supposed to be. I get notifications whenever a test result is submitted so I can literally pull up the app anytime. I love it.,
I would like to be able to update my own information such as testing completed instead of receiving numerous texts and emails as reminders,
"I like the app, but I find difficulty with it. There a 4 on my app, I don't know why, and my ent cannot see my results",
"I guess things were going great for a while, so I guess they decided they didnt need to keep the developer on payroll. App takes forever to login, that is when it feels like it, then it either cant connect to the server or loads so slow it times out the connection. Not to mention there's the cancerous method of resetting your password that should be revamped up from the mid 90's method.",
"I absolutely love this app. It's so easy to use and keep up with my all my doctors appointments, my medications, and being able to send messages.",
SIMPLE - EASY - SECURE I saw one guy say he had to completely close the app and restart because he couldn't back out of anything so was forced to restart to go back. Well that really made me hesitant about downloading the app but figured I could always delete. Come to find out that's not the case. Not sure if he has a really old phone or isn't use to using the back button but you can totally go back to previous page without closing the app and starting over. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
"Every time there is a new message or a new lab result, all the lab results are listed as new. Online on my PC, every message which links to a lab result is marked in bold as unread. I open them and read them, then with the next email notification, all the previously read messages are in bold and unread, even though I already looked at them. On the app there is no differentiation between read and unread lab results. The message icon shows a number and I have to open every msg to erase the numbe",
"I can't think of anything that could be more complex than trying to manage patient records, appointments and interactions with my doctor and his staff, since these activities can include documenting so many different bodily processes, maladies, treatment options, tests, etc., etc. The creators of this app have somehow eliminated the complexity of all this and made an intuitive, easy to use, yet detailed and comprehensive tool! That is a stunning achievement! Well done, developers!",
"I love that you can get any information like test results, etc, a lot faster than waiting for the doctor's office to get a hold of you.",
"The app changed and now I am unable to see my upcoming appointments a month ahead. I had to call the doctor's office for dates and times. I can only see 2 weeks ahead which is very unhelpful. I used this app to keep track of all the families appointments, but now I am going to have to go back to inputting the manually into my google calendar app. Also I wish there was an option to export appointments into your preferred calendar app. It would make keeping track of all appointments easier.",
It works for the most part except when using a VPN then it kicks me off at every button press.,
"Excellent service , so simple to use",
There only one thing rong has far as I am concerned with this app you can't stop unwanted items from sowing up like the one tell you you need some shot (shots) I don't get vaccinated for the Corona19 booster's aka(CCP virus) Flu ect.......... other than that I really like this app,
I absolutely love this app! I have a lot of medical issues and this allows me to keep all of my information in one place. Being able to communicate with my doctor's without having to leave messages at the front desk is a godsend! I can pull up anything I need at anytime I want and can add my appointments to my calendar with one click. The convenience is amazing!,
"Love being able to access my medical info so quickly. I also love the after visit summaries, sometimes you can't quite remember what the doctor said or remember the medical term as it was explained. So it's nice to be able to reference that when we need to and the appointments being on my chart. You can also personalize how you want reminders either by text or email. It is the perfect back-up and support system to our busy lives. 5 stars from me!",
"""Your contact information and notification preferences need review..."" This refuses to go away. I've hit update then closed it again multiple times. There is no button to confirm my info, just a close button and a few edit buttons. ------- items that cannot be launched within the app should at least have a description of what they are, rather than simply directing the user to an external browser, for example sharing->Lucy, growth charts, advance directive.",
This app sucks! Worst app ever. Be warned that if you as a parent have an account then there is no way to get access to your kids account. They say its easy it is not!,
It's great having access to your medical records and all of your doctors and prescriptions via this app. I highly recommend.,
Awesome app minus android swip left to right to get back neck page only iPhone has the back space 🔑 Epic please fix the no black space on test results 😀 and couple of other pages.,
Best thing is I get a response from my Dr.'s office so much faster than calling! But quick access to a list of my meds and test results is super nice as well.,
Very helpful sometimes even better than calling to get meds refilled,
My mother is 80 With dementia and I am 48 AND HER SOLE CARE TAKER Can't recommend THIS APP strong enough My chart Has put her care right in the palm of my hand Literally Test results medicine upcoming visits All of it is SUPER EASY TO FIND AND REMEMBER solely due to this app I'D BE LOST WITHOUT IT It's a blessing DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE,
This app is extremely helpful in keeping all your medical info in one location. Easy to navigate.,
"Don't know if it's the app or the technologically incompetent staff at my hospital, but if you're going to implement an option to pay your bill through this app, make it work. Edit: Got a response from the app developer, which is rare and much appreciated. However, if the hospital determines that it doesn't want to allow payment options through your app, then disappear the pay button and any other payment related tabs, etc. Too easy.",
Amazing! Easy to keep up with appointments test results visits what I'm due and more! So easy for me to deal with!,
Looking at test results is horrible. Last telehealth visit was unsuccessful. Never had these issues before. There needs to be an update to correct these issues. The latest issue was log in not accepting my password when it was correct. Had to use PC to fix it. App not working well on my tablet anymore. I mainly use this to speak to my specialist via telehealth. Keeps me from driving all the was to KU.,
"What would really impove your app would be to have an option to see your historical data. Say I want to see my hemoglobin levels from the past year to view trends. I have to go into each and every lab labeled ""Chemistry"" (and most of them are labeled that generically) to find my numbers. Mayo Clinics app provides a clickable link to see a chart of your trends. So much easier and user friendly.",
Cannot see son's invoices. He is 13. I've been calling back and forth with healthcare provider and it seems to be a programming issue with mychart. Keeps asking me to verify phone,
"Love this app. Easy to use and maneuver so you can see all appointments, results and even schedule new apps.",
It's perfect because I can see all my appointments all my test results and even messages from the doctor it's just what we need to keep up with everything.,
"My Dr. Kenny Hawk is the best NP there. Taylor Shahan is a wonderful nursing asset. Both so kind, caring and polite. However, GMG has changed and not for the better since Ruby took over. It's no longer the small home town feel and most are vwey rude. Your just a number to Ruby.",
"Love this app and all of it's features. It's great to keep organized, the appointment reminders are a huge help as well! I can't emphasize enough what a great help it's been having all my doctors appointments, updated list of medications and dosing instructions, blood work, test results(ie. MRI, CT scans, echocardiograms, X-rays etc), as well as any doctors notes, you can read all notes the doctor or nurse may have made in regards to your visit/after visit summery.",
"The app does not provide you with any type of search capability, nor does it allow you to go back to a main menu or to the main screen you're stuck on whatever screen you end up on which is extremely frustrating. This really should be fixed because I at this point am about to delete it from my phone",
"My Chart is Amazing! Highly Recommended This! Makes everything easy to organize and follow up on. I love being able to communicate with my health team at the touch of a button! Scheduling appointments online is so helpful and staying in step with lab results is comforting. Super helpful app, I recommend everyone to use it.",
Extremely useful in documenting and keeping up with my medical care. It is also invaluable in keeping in contact with my providers. Very convenient and looking up results of tests that have been run. These results remain available to consider for review whenever necessary.,
"Downloaded app today. Tried to look at my information. Lots of Tiff files. They disappeared when I went to save them. Multiple times. Did some research. Turns out Tiff files are big picture files used by book publishers. Probably too big for my Android phone's memory. What use is an app that I can't use to look up my information? Disappointed, I uninstalled the app. Will try to use the internet browser to access my information instead of the app.",
My chart is great. It has all my appt doctors and results. You don't have to wait for a phone call from them. You just check your chart. You can leave them messages also. I gave a 4 stars. Nothing is perfect One flaw... when the doctor is messaging you with results of findings blood work etc. They need to explain it In English so we can understand it. I love having my chart..,
"I love being able to see test results as they are posted. Also, the ability to see all my appointments helps me to be to all of my appointments on time. There are other parts of my chart that are very helpful, especially being able to cancel appointments or leave the dr. a message.",
"I love it. I live about 45 minutes away from both Tennessee & Kentucky. So to be able to do most of what I need to, even visits, is a god send. UVA did a Deep Brain Stimulation surgery on me for a neurological disorder I have, so traveling there every 6 months was taxing & I'd always looks worse than I would have otherwise. I could find another doctor, but a good one is hard to find. So when I find a good one, I hold onto them as long as I can. Lol. I've never had any problems with the app.",
Best medical patient portal ! User friendly easy to navigate. Easy to understand.,
"This has been a wonderful app for keeping all my medical records, Dr's, appointments, referrals, and more within just a few clicks away for me to quickly access. I really do use it constantly. It notifies schedules, re-schedules, and cancels appointments in real time, too. 5/5 stars!",
"App generally works well, allows you to access your medical info, and even message your providers. My only complaint is that the bill paying feature never seems to work. I always have to call the clinic's billing dept and pay over the phone.",
"It's incredibly difficult to adhere to, and at times very repetitive and excruciatingly harassing. It's a good idea in theory, but in reality very impractical, especially since it is now a requirement to either use the app or just don't go to the doctor, that's your two options. It would be helpful if you could be allowed to type in more than 500 words on the review, but. Apparently they don't want to know 🙂 how about that.",
"Y'all need to update and fix the delay and delivery issues. I just now got messages. Also, log in issues with second sign in security feature has a major lagging problem. Updates are a constant and need to be resolved immediately, or it rendered your app useless.",
"So easy to use once it is set up. It's a bit difficult to actually get it set up if you have more than one person on the account. But once you have them on there, everything's under one app and it's easy to switch from person to person or just message directly to your provider.",
"This app seems to be filled with bugs and errors. It seems more likely than not that it will fail when I try to use it. At the moment, I received an email telling me that the provider has sent a message in the app. But when I try to check messages, it says there is an error and try again later. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a choice of apps.",
"This app is easy to use. I love sending and receiving messages from my doctors. If I have a question, I can send it at any hour. When they get to the office, it will be waiti g on them. I don't have to worry about missing a phone call. Also, I can view my test results or look up notes from a previous visit. I have never seen an ad in the app.",
Love MyChart! Having access to my medical test results in a quick turnaround time is very useful. Having accèss to the calendar of upcoming medical appointments helps alot as well. The app is intuitive and easy to use. Overall love it.,
"This is a unicorn; competence boardering on mythical. The app works. It gives me access to important information virtually at the same speed it is processed at the hospital. Easy and effective interface, no excessive security, timely with push notifications... honestly it is remarkable. My only comment is the initial screen of selecting health networks was confusing. Frankly I'm shocked this quality of tool is being used in the Ontario Health Care system! :-)",
it works pretty good for test results and some appointment reminders. but I can't seem to get any of the other features to on the app to work. and I can't get the app to sync even with itself,
"Haven't had any issues with the app, it is quite comprehensive in detail as well as user friendliness. Presumably, any issues run into are related to the age of my device, and available connection.",
"The system is very restrictive, making it difficult to move between pages. You can't message a Physician on MC unless you have already been seen by them. That makes setting appointments difficult. The system must not interact with the epic patient system, as you must complete copious redundant questionnaires everytime you set a new appointment.",
"I Like being able to see my test results in real time, even before seeing my doctor. It helps me with learning what they mean by researching on the internet. Doctors don't always have time to go over all my test results. I've learned a lot by researching what certain tests mean. Moreover, it allows me to understand & engage with my doctor in a more proactive, productive, efficient way. It helps me take more control over my total well-being.",
"I was depending on this app to help me keep up with appointments and communication with my medical team. However, the app now will not let me access my information without setting up 2-step verification, which is a terrible idea and NOT secure for someone who is affected by mental illness, economic hardship and tech access instability. I don't have enough characters to explain all the ways I've already been locked out of 2-step verification on other apps unable to access a code every login...",
"This app is so wonderful & helpful in soooo many ways! I love being able to look at the test results as soon as they're in & the Dr's notes make the patient/ doctor relationship a little more personal and easier to understand. The learning library is awesome as it gives you links to definitions and explanations to some of those ""Big Dr. Words"" that only they could pronounce/ comprehend! E-checkin is probably the 2nd best thing I love abt this app! No lines, No hassle! I'd give 6 stars if I could",
"It definitely comes in handy, it would just be nice if every provider used the same app, because I am missing huge gaps with my Neurology, and I don't know how to go about accessing all that information since it's across three states. But it's very nice to connect with your physician and get answers generally the same day you submit them.",
"Excellent for those who frequent OSF Hospitals and have Doctors within OSF. You can do all sorts of things now in the app that used to be a pain to do otherwise. You can message your doctor, request refills, and see all sorts of valuable information. The only thing I wish is that you could take screenshots in the app because that would super handy, but I understand it's a security issue. 5/5 Edit: Actually it turns out you can enable screenshots in the settings",
"Simple and easy to understand. Access all of your needed resources in one place, and you can communicate with your doctor(s) through messaging, or are able to schedule an/your appointments. I highly recommend using this app for your medical needs :)",
"Extremely dependable,I really like how quickly the nurses get back to you with your answers! I'm able to print my doctor excuses and whatever else I have on there. There are so many options on there. I would recommend this in a heartbeat!!! It is very useful if your if your taking care of your family and having permission to go on their my chart to see their medications to determine what to give them. Thanks for making things alot easier and more understandable.",
"This app is very, helpful and resourceful, easy to manage and use. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be able to use this app; and learning the ins and outs of it. Thank you sincerely, Jose Brown",
"Very easy to use, an excellent tool to keep your Heath in check. Ideal quick access.",
Hard to read results every time.,
"The unified experience is awesome! I can now link my portal accounts from multiple hospitals across the country, and see my past appointment and test histories all in one place. Now all it needs is graphing for labs, and a gernic ""health journal"" option for things like migraine and sleep tracking. (Custom flowsheets just don't cut it)",
My Chart works great... Especially when I'm up to speed on using it. It keeps getting better!,
Edited to add: At no point in my review did I say I got a new phone or redownload the app. Nothing has changed on my end. Developer response unhelpful and assumes user error. I have set biometric login back up but that was not the point. -- Went to log in and biometric login no longer available. Why just remove the login I've been using for so long with no warning? Needed information quickly but have to reset everything. Very frustrating.,
I like being able to ask a question and get an answer back without phone calls. Takes a lot less time to receive a response back. I give this app 5 stars,
Easy to use and convenient..,
Outstanding app for all communications.,
"It has NEVER been easier to request refills, see lab results, see or schedule upcoming appointments, message the doctor and actually get a reply within a day (guess that's doctor depending tho.) Interface is easy to use and intuitive; it makes me extremely happy that my main doctor/hospital offer this service. My psychiatrist uses a different app and while it works okay, nothing like MyChart!",
Great Application. You can see all your appointments and test results here. Also their all easy to understand.,
"Not the best, server error is all I get. Not able to read letters sent or even leave a message for my health care provider.",
Great way to view all your medical in one place from site to site! Love it! Easy to use! Perfect for my medical needs!,
Scheduling for med refills is easy; but i can't seem to be able to schedule a routine office visit in person or online.,
It really helps to be able to send your doctors team a message and you can get a lot of answers from a well kept chart. I have logged into a different chart system at another doctors office and struggled to send a message or use the program. I had to call and wait a long time to get a simple answer. This chart system is much easier in functionality.,
Most times doesn't work. Always error message.... it is convenient and good idea but poor execution,
"The app worked for me 2 weeks ago, now I receive a message that a newer version is available, but there is not. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall app, but it made no difference. Cannot access at all. Last update shows as Dec 13, 2016. Also shows as incompatible with my older Samsung tablet when previously it was.",
"How does one switch between provider networks? I have providers in two different systems that both use your backend. The websites allowed me to link the accounts, but the app can't seem to find the other account, and won't access the other system to log in after logging out of the app. Yet, both send me to the exact same Google Play entry. I'm not going to clear data every time I need to check things on both systems. You know my data, show it to me!",
"I have several Doctors and a few different apps for these doctorsn,. My Chart is by far the most informative and easy-to use",
"I feel like there are so many potentially good features and options in the app, but it seems as though most of them don't work! It's great that you can show me all the types of medical appointments I am overdue for, but no way to make said appointments. Seems like a waste. Tons of options, few that are helpful.",
"Love using this app, I communicate with my Dr's and see all my appointments",
"MyChart is super convenient, and you know results before your Dr even gets the chance to call and talk over them. I enjoy this app alot.",
You need to stop changing the app. It is very hard on people who have visual problem is when you no longer marked the area where there is new information. It's hard to find the newest things added to a chart.,
"Simple to use if one takes their time. Easy installation off app helps when going for doctors visits and get medication filled. Keeping track of my health and understanding what is going on with my health is great when using this app. Every doctor I visit, clinic, or hospital has my medical information that I can provide just by logging in and sharing.",
Love this app. Easy to use and communicate with doctor.,
Great reminder and good for receiving info about your health,
MyChart is awesome. It keeps me informed of my appts and gives me results of tests etc. Thank you so much for my access to this app. I check it often. Janice Taft,
"While this app has worked well in the past, now that I have providers at both UW and GHC, many times the app does not sync with the GHC. I count on this information to be available so I can keep in touch with my providers, appointments and meds. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that it often times does not sync up. This happens with the MyChart website as well. I've been told by Devs that GHC has a separate app. No, they do not. It's all in MyChart. Please fix these reoccurring issues.",
Excellent! It makes it very easy to stay up to date with appointments and see test results.,
"Really a zero star for zero Function - won't install. I've checked every setting, security feature, playstore settings, etc. Called for a new patient appointment at 11 a.m. roughly, now nearly 9 pm. app is still NOT installed. Just spins and ""waiting for download"". Completely useless to me. Advise to simply use website. Not as convenient but it is clearly functional and accessible. Wifi makes no difference and a setting adjustment on the device; they've all been applied in attempts. Note 9.",
Always useful. Wouldn't be without it. Very easy to use.,
Wish for a little better explanation on the things but quite happy with the application,
"Sorry, I thought this was a great idea initially. But I've now spent a month trying to get my doctor to respond. I need diabetic supplies and I get zero response here. If I ignore the app and call to the office, they were able to say 'oh I see you put in a message 7 days ago' what good is that to me. (edit) bump up a bit, not sure of the exact break in communication, but wish I had a 'read' option like texts. so I could say if app is failing, or just being ignored on the other end.",
Trouble everytime I switch organizations. Epic says contact hospital and vice versa.,
I think it is great to find all my chart records. I have had no problem finding information I need. For some reason lately it does NOT give notifications anymore when I have a provider message. Maybe an update? I like getting notifications. Hope it gets fixed with next update. Update: thank you for the response. It works great now. Update to 5 stars!,
"I'm trying to sign up, But I can't!!! I'm getting a ""You must answer the CAPCHA"" error message, and I already answer it thousands times!! And there is no support after 4pm to help 🙂",
My chart is awesome. Any of your care team you can get in touch with at any time and all of your appointments are there as well as any information on anything done.,
"This app needs major improvement. They need to fill a few ridiculous gaps that make it occasionally dysfunctional of an app. It can do lots of cool things and make your medical records and whatnot very convenient, but the app just stalls a lot, fails to load things, takes forever to update your test statuses what whatnotconsistently, and overall is just a very rocky experience.",
Some of it works. Sometimes the screen goes blank and you have to back out to get to where you need. Of course we are forced to use it,
Very helpful app and user friendly,
Frankly awful app. Glitches and inconsistent. 1) Have to log in more than once when I should be able to stay in. 2) Switching between organizations requires new log-in for each! Shouldn't I be IN with one log-in? 3) Can't do screenshot or select text to copy. Reason in error code message has to do with privacy. That IS NOT something that is in the HIPAA rules. I should be able to copy using my phone that I'm logged in to for purposes of communicating and keeping my own notes.,
"Constantly get ""unable to connect to server"" error message when trying to complete the ""E/check"" questionaire requested before each drs visit. Very frustrating 1-29-22 still getting ""an error has occurred"" in addition to ""unable to connect to server"" when trying to send a message, schedule an appt or look at test results. The app works sporadically but tech services have no advice other than to login thru my browser instead of the app.",
"I just love this app. It is easy to use and navigate through the site. You can schedule appointments as well as cancel them. You can also use e-check in and answer questionnaire to save time at your appointments. It also keeps all letters of referrals or any letters the doctor has written for you, such as clearance for elective surgeries that a letter is required. You can really do it all on this app, and see all documents in regards to your health-care. I 100% recommend this app.",
I absolutely love this app. It makes communication easy as well as scheduling & canceling my appointments convenient. I have sickle cell disease which is super painful & unpredictable. My hematologist has started using the medication feature. The pharmacy I go to notifies me when my scripts are put in & ready for pick up! I give the app a/an 5!+,
"The new app makes it hard to tell what news & messages are new vs. the read ones. The distinction between email, test results, etc., are bad once you get in the app to check for *only* new mail. You need to make a little envelope to help us focus on the newest mail, etc and an ""x"" or something once read. The bright colors and huge font makes it worse to get to the info we need right away. It really needs some QC & feedback all the time b/c each visit i find more problems",
"This app is very useful. I can see my test results and get reminders of yearly appointments I need to make without having to get on a computer. the best part used to be being able to make appointments from the phone. But lately, every time I try, an error occurs. The big pull seems to be broken.",
My chart is in my opinion next to my banking app one of the greatest app ever created it's one click information about all your latest test results request medication refills send your health team request etc etc .awesome app,
"I love this app, my Dr. gets back to me very quickly. I can order my medicine with ease, I can contact my Dr. with ease, absolutely love it.",
After newest update keeps crashing. S23 Ultra,
"It's super easy to use this app to schedule any appointments for my kids at both their primary doctor and with the texas children's hospital. It also keeps tract of when their appointments are so that I know when they are. Super easy to add a second child. It's also super easy to change your information (phone number, address, ect.)",
"Easy and convenient! I can send pictures of minor rashes and things I have questions about without having to make an appointment or go to urgent care. Having quick access to my kids' records for things like weight, height, and immunizations without having to sit on hold or driving by to pick up a hard copy has been a life saver! Also having all of information in one portal and being able to make appointments for all of us without holding on the phone forever is amazing! Will use this forever!",
"Can't return to previous screen or to main menu. Is this a problem in all android devices or just Pixel? Ok, update to prior comments. There is no navigation button at the bottom of the device on any screen in the app to return to the main men. And the gesture navigation works about 1 out of 5 swipes, only if you touch it close enough to the hidden arrow. So I guess it works, just not really well. I'm extremely grateful my hospital system has something like this nonetheless. 4 stars, not 3",
Nice way to keep track with medical needs!,
Everytime I try to login it gives me a hard time so I don't use it but I keep getting annoying notifications on my email 📨 😞 clutters up my email,
"Amazing, very helpful, and easy to use",
It's very limited in what it can do. I get messages from my doc telling me to log into the website to do to whatever it is they want. Messages has an attachment button but no one sees/receives them. Ifyou want to check lab values or appointments then it's okay. I can make an appointment but still need to talk to the office anyway. May as well call.,
"Very informative, easy to use app.",
Love being able to contact my providers at any time of the day or week and then they get back to me in a timely manner.,
Great app! Easy to use and very convenient,
"This rating is for the Android app, so I'll limit the comments to just the Android specific points. The web portal is well integrated. The Android app is one of a few apps which never concern me about security. I have never seen it do anything I recognized as insecure. It provides me with everything I need, plus a bit more. Even when using only cellular data, the app stays responsive.",
Great app helps track medical appointments and alot more,
"MyChart App works amazing well, especially if you already have some tech savvy to you. I could see were it might be a little difficult for someone who is new to the tech world though, as going from one page to another is not always a smooth process. But on the Pro side I have seen worse & I think MyChart does a really good job at giving you all the info you need, plus all the ability to interface with your medical people. It just takes a little getting use to, then you're off & running with.",
On a phone the print is extremely small. Entering your password is frustrating. I have had to re-enter mine at times 4 or 5 times. I have had to reset it a time or 2. The app is very useful. I wish results could be printed. After visit reports are not on MyChart. Would be nice to have that.,
Extremely easy way to get & share medical info!,
I really like having all of my information in one place. Having the ability to message my provider is so convenient. Most of the features are great but I tried to verify my phone number for a new provider and even though they had the correct number the text didn't come through with the verification number. I tried several times and still didn't work. The only reason I'm a bit concerned is because I have a video appointment on Monday and it's Friday so there's no way to get in touch with them,
"Paste is disabled on password fields, which negates my password manager. This means the app promotes weak passwords that I can easily manually type in.",
Simple and straight forward to use,
So helpful and truly easy to use.,
It's great getting test results so easily.,
"overall pretty good app except for bugs with logging in that never have been resolved. will randomly log u out then tell u your password is wrong even when it is right. then when u make a new one it gives errors like ""must be 8 to 20 characters"" when the one I put in was 10 characters. pretty sure that's in their range",
Excellent ap. Gives patient access to all of their personal medical information quickly and easily.,
"While there are elements of this app that are ok the UI is extremely cumbersome to use if you have many appointments and messages and you waste a lot of time. You should be able to swipe messages left or right to delete and archive. Too many taps to manage messages, appointments and the like. Needs to be simpler.",
"The 2 step verification is Awful. While my husband is in the hospital, I check my chart often. The two step is a real pain.",
I enjoy using it has everything I need to see and use right at my finger tips,
way too much useless repetative verbage. Nag notifications never stop even after clearing message. most messages won't clear. l,
Mychart is usually amazing however Mount Sinai is now pushing their own version which is not compatible with other organizations. There was nothing wrong with mychart that called for a change. And also the layout change now does not have the visits tab on the front page. Future/past visits should not be hidden in the drop down menu. It should be on the opening page or at least allow customization on the main menu.,
"Love the app easy to use, and it is very helpful.",
"Makes me feel like I have my medical care providers available 24 hrs per day. It is very reliable, and allows me to see everything for myself. I am able to see my progress over the time I needed care.",
"Very helpful. Useful for keeping track of appointments and viewing lab results. Helpful to be able to email my doctor to request medication refills and any other questions or concerns. Overall, very easy to use the app. I like the fact that I can call the help desk if I have any questions about the app. They actually answer the phone and are available to help if you're having problems with the app.",
"I like the app for keeping in touch with my doctor. But Under the to do tab, I wanted to use that feature to help track health issues such as pain. I also wanted to set medication reminders. I was able to set reminders but would have liked to put it under the medication tab in the to do list. There was no mechanism to do so. I was unable to track health issues. I feel like this area needs work on the app.",
"Wow. I really have to compliment the EPIC Corporation for this app! Smooth, intuitive, informative, and friendly UI. Has the many functionalities I need to review my health history with the clinic. What really impressed was the display of lab values which visually shows the normal range for each test. Keep up the good work App Team!",
As someone with severe social anxiety this helps me a ton everything with it has went smooth as butter and I've only ever even had to use the phone to call my Dr 1x when I was learning to use the app,
I'm so glad this app was made. I can check my appointments and see my tests results. I have no complaints at all. Thank you again.,
"Frequent user for family & appts. *Prior to this I would have always given this App 4 star. Not so much anymore. last 4 months anytime I try to send a message/request appointments from the doctors in app, the message disappears. They're not getting to the doctor's offices system & it's not showing in app. once you send it it disappears never to be seen again and nobody knows anything about it. Extremely frustrating. * A few other minor glitches but overall I like working with the app.",
It keeps me on track with things and allows me to connect my providers without calling the office. Its like a direct line to your doctor,
"Multiple crashes! I can check messages, but if I try to check my billing, eCheck in, almost everything else, the app crashes and closes. Luckily, I can sign into MyChart online. Of course, I thought the point of an app is that you don't have to go to the website. Please patch or update the app. It is currently not functioning on my Galaxy s10e.",
Great. I get my results and not have yo wait the old school way for the phone call. Very convenient.,
It is helpful for keeping up with what is going on. It is a pain to navigate when it constantly has server errors and has to be restarted to move from one area of the app to another. It happens on more than one device and not just on one wifi/ provider.,
"Absolutely Horrible app!!!!! Terrible Organization, information disappers, No way to Stop unwanted options that pop up ! Extremely slow loading on Android 11/Motorola platform. Unable to access history with previously linked provider. App is just JUNK in a clumsy stylized dashboard!!! I would give it a Negative 10⭐rating if there was an option for it !!!!!!!!!!",
"Since I am a current and past patient of multiple medical centers in different states, MyChart has become an invaluable tool for keeping everything in order, staying in touch with my providers and the peace of mind to be able to access my medical information 24/7 from anywhere.",
I have found this app to be very easy to use. I love having everything at my fingertips as opposed to tracking down which calendar I was near when the appointment was made. Having my meds listed in the same place as the rest of what I need is so time-saving.,
Hi I'm Monie Fuaau (Mose) I like Zagaberge Hospital. Everytime I'm scheduled for an appointment I'm always on time because i love all the Employees that are working there. They always help me and take good care of me. They also have good Doctors and Nurses. And they make sure you are been taking care of. They also have good customer service. Thank you all for your help 😊,
"My Chart is only as good as your provider, this is a great way to stay on top of your care as long as your provider will enter notes on why you should perform a task. And for the developer to respond so guickly, a 5",
"I wish I could consolidate all of my bills that use this app together on the app. Other than that, this app has been awesome.",
"I have used this app for years and loved the functionality until recently. Now I get errors constantly. There are notifications of appoimtments or test results but if you try to view in the app you enounter an error. I am signed into several organizations across multiple states and get errors from all of them now, so I can confirm this is not specific to the organization. I hope to see an update soon, especially since this issue had been documented for months in reviews.",
Very easy to link various facilities together.,
3/10/21 I will try again and hope for a better result. 3/5/21///I'm not going to update. I sent you the use my chart any longer you forgot my password you changed it I'm not going to keep changing passwords You only let me log in for myself and not anybody else in my house You guys suck and I'm going to remove this app pretty soon You messed it up Now I have to call the doctor every single time I wish her app was better but you suck,
"This app has made keeping track of all of my medical information so much easier and more convenient. The ability to access any records I need on my phone is great. Also, the messaging feature has made the communication with my medical team so much more efficient. Often, I can get answers that I would've had to schedule a visit for in the past.",
Excellent Services and follow-up,
All my medical information is available to me. MyChart is very helpful.,
My chart is excellent for to keep up with the patient and communication and keep the patient updated with their medical reminders inportant dates and a good way to drop a message to your doctor.,
I love how this app usually makes it easy to stay in contact with my health care providers. It was having a bit of trouble for a little while but I found out their had actually been a problem with our local internet provider! This app is used by my local PCP and one of my specialists and it easy to use for communication and setting up appointments. It shows test results here and you can edit personal information for your health care providers as needed!!,
"I have used MyChart for many years, it's become my go to for my health care. It not only shows past health and visits, it graphs and tracks them over time, getting easy access to information it's important to know. There are many times when I receive test results back in MyChart before I actually receive a phone call from my providers. I also find the messaging, and video visits incredibly convenient.",
"This app is fantastic. At first I had a little bit of trouble getting how to do it but now I can see test results, appointments, and the doctors notes even. I can also request an appointment or a refill on a medication. My chart can combine with other organizations like signature health and others also. This app is a very smart thing to have and learn.",
It is so great to be able to see my results and health status in one place. Easy to navigate and understand.,
"It is a little confusing at times. Also, I have a up to date newer model phone and sometimes stuff doesn't load. It's a very useful and helpful app for understanding my health and healthy options and for communicating with my Dr and her team. ❤️ thank you 😊",
"Easy to view all profiles, my own, and my kids. Easy to make appointments and communicate with my providers. I like the new feature of checking in online when I've arrived for an appointment. Less headache for me when I'm towing around 4 littles. ;) Good app overall",
MyChart allows fast and easy access to my healthcare records and test results. I am a big fan!,
"Great way to connect with your health care providers, receive results , text your physician and look at all your medical records. Awesome app",
"Love this app. Functionality does depend on the healthcare system. I moved to a new state and my former healthcare network didn't allow for bill payment via the app. I'd hafta call the billing dept and pay by phone. OMG, so tedious. Now in my new state and new healthcare network the bill pay feature is available via the app. It's so much simpler now. I can see what I owe and pay the invoice then and there, rather than wait. That's great! 👍🏾",
"I absolutely love having everything in one place, doctors' notes past visits. It's my medicine's . It's really nice and easy",
I like having this app on my phone to check for my kids visits and blood work. I also like how I can see the visits and the doctor's notes. It definitely is useful to ask questions and makeand cancel appointments on the app as well. It's definitely helpful for your medical needs and you can have your family members on one account instead of separate one's which helps too. Definitely worth trying out and if you need help one of the receptionist's at the office would help you.,
"This app used to allow screen captures which I was able to attach to messaging for a reference point when communicating with my providers about tests, letters, etc. Which brings me to my next point: I cannot print any of my personal information. None of it. It's supposed to be ""MyChart"". It's not if I can't print my information and keep it in my purse for first responders when they need my history, etc. Please fix the app so that my information is actually mine again. Thank you.",
"This app and (web access) is horrific. There's no in app help (nor any help on how to use the features of the app/icons in the web app - except for a sparsely populated FAQ). There is no mechanism to submit feedback (either in the app or in webapp). Especially egregious and thoughtless icon choice for inaccessible files is a ""frowny face"" --- which, is especially upsetting seeing that for your new Pathology results. It is barely functional.",
Frequently crashes. Requests unnecessary permissions,
"Previously the app worked flawlessly. Currently, when signing in, the app locks up on the ""verify"" page.",
"Please fix the ""could not load terms and conditions"" 🐛. Also, maybe consider an automatic biometric authentication method with the option to use username and password or pin instead? For me, it's annoying to have to click continue initially, then choose fingerprint, then authenticate. Most apps just pop it up and all I do is ""finger""! 😂 Otherwise, MyChart is 💣 ! I really appreciate the detailed yet simplistic layout of the platform. Plus multi-patient?! Ssweeet! 🤩 Oh love the new look btw!",
"I do enjoy this very much it works extremely well. However when you do pre check-ins you click on a word , it needs to be lit up or it needs to have a color or something to show that you actually have selected it. Currently it is extremely hard to see when something is selected or not. Other than that wonderful app so far.",
The best saying that ever happened for patients to communicate with their medical providers and keep track of all of their conditions medications procedures it's just wonderful!,
My chart is not updated. I have vaccines that are not charted a bone density test done that's not on there. Dr. Visits not on there plus my well visits.,
"I like that it lets me know everything that is going on, and what goes on when being seen.",
I think it is a must-have cuz I've found information on my chart that the doctors failed to mention at time of visit,
Dr's rely TOO MUCH on this app. So much that they can't even make a simple phone call or have a system send a text message to remind a patient of an appointment they booked over a month ago. Everything is check my chart and half the time I can't even access the app. This was supposed to be an easy solution for Dr's and patients to keep track of appointments and charts but has made Dr's lazy and is just frustrating.,
Great app to take care of your health care needs,
Sucks as far as seeing your actual CT scans or x-rays or even verifying your phone number. You can't even do that without a problem. To see appointment notes it shows you the after visit summary instead of notes. Simple stuff like that make the app annoying as hell. Plus god knows the notifications are annoying. I had to basically shut off the app notifications on my android app settings instead of in app settings. I think they could do better with this app.Especially when it's connected to EPIC,
I truly enjoy having MyChart to access anytime I need to. It is very easy to use. It's all so wonderful to be able to send your doctor or healthcare team a message anytime. Even if your out-of-state you're able to contact your physician. I see others complained about connection issues I have never had a problem with connection issues. That is probably an issue with their internet provider.,
Easy to use and very informatve,
"This app is incredibly slow. The manner in which it operates has clearly not been optimized, so it take forever to load messages, etc. Plus, the integration between different medical organizations using MyChart is so horrible, it should be an embarrassment. Epic needs to design a pleasant User Interface, solid APIs for interfacing between organizations, and improve the app's performance markedly. There's no excuse for an app working so slowly and being so clunky.",
Everyone doctor and their staff have been super nice and helpful. No long waits to see the dr and they listen to you.,
"I am not computer illiterate but sometimes I have tried to log in (I have it written down on the My Chart pamphlet) and it locks me out. Two different medical centers, I have had that happen to me. It's frustrating! I also sent a note I thought went to Administration but they informed me it didn't and I would have to call. Otherwise, it's easy to pay my bills and look up my appointments and test results. The only problems I've experienced are the ones previously mentioned.",
"Would like to be able to mark done on some of the suggestions that were given to me. Other than that, I am very thankful for this app.",
"Convenient, reliable, up to date. This makes my life so much easier. Back in the days when I had (sometimes) multiple doctor appointments or tests on any given day, I couldn't have kept it straight without this app. Those were hard times, and the app was just one more thing that took stress AWAY from the situation....in addition to the awesome staff at UofU. ❤️",
Very helpful to have all your medical information in one place.,
"Providing access to data stored in my chart is very helpful to me as a patient. Previously, when doctor visits a patient, it is difficult to retain the info provided when you are in pain. Accessing data later helps clarify what is happening. Thank you all for your excellent work! Providing person's name, date and approximate time when entry is made would also help when contact may be necessary. When accessing My Chart it would be helpful if you highlight area when new data is there Thanks again.",
"This app is a great concept & its helpful having online access to your past/current health issues + office visits, medications etc. However, at times, it can be very difficult to navigate. Changing the existing interface & making it more user friendly would be a huge plus.",
This app is great when it worked but for the past month I keep getting a message that there is a newer version and to install it. When I go to the play store it says I have the lasest version. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling still the same issue. I still get notifications but can't login so it's now useless.,
"App is failing to log me in. All choices: sign up, forgot password, login, all lead to a blank page. Update: Yesterday, I went to University of Iowa Hospital for a doctor appointment and today I tried logging in to the app again. I succeeded! I like the user interface a lot, and I like how soon the update is shown on my account. Looks like there has been a major revamping of the app. I like it, and I am updating my rating.",
"I like that I can review what doctor said from appointments. That I can make payments, e-check in, and so much more from app.",
"Very easy to navigate, I Love that you can link other care sites to one app... very helpful and convenient",
I love it! Communication with providers is very helpful and response time is very quick and most of the time answered the same day! This app is easy to navigate. It's convenient to use e-check in and I always have a list of my appointments so no need to have a paper copy. Managing my care and medical costs all in one place is invaluable.,
"All medical records at your fingertips, and esign-in's for upcoming appointments !! Once signed in I have access to appointments, both past and upcoming, so you can view progress or setbacks. I don't understand the problems other's seem to be having, as I've not once received an error notification. It even worked transferring from St Lukes in K.C to Lee's Summit with no ommissions or glitches. I am more than happy with this app ‼️",
It works great! Love the connections to my specialists and being able to see my records.,
This last update is horrible. It used to have a simple layout and now it is a mess of icons that are very challenging if you are not sighted. You still haven't added ability to send or receive pdf files but instead made my only access to my Doctor a nightmare that can't even be changed in the app.,
"Being a new user i still like the app! Lol But like the other users, i too, proof read before sending my message but only see a few lines without the keyboard on the screen and there seems to be a problem with the payment system. After entering my payment information, there is no option to send payment. Only 2 buttons available: BACK and CANCEL. I had to login to my laptop to make payment. Using Samsung note20 ultra",
"Below average It is not intuitive and does not easily allow the inputting of records, by other medical providers, or the sending of patient records to unaffiliated designees.",
Great App keeps me informed of all my health and labs great,
I love mychart. Think it's a great way to keep in touch with providers. Useful to grt information about labs and multiple other things. There are some glitches with notifications that I have seen. But very rare. It's definitely a useful tool that has been added to the Electronic Health System. I highly recommend this to my patients if they aren't already on it. And just in general recommend for anyone to get.,
I've been using this app for several years and it is constantly improving. It has made communicating with my medical team and keeping track of my meds and interactions a snap. Sending messages is easy. I can check in ahead of appointments and it even contains Zoom so I can have remote appointments. I encourage everyone to give it a try.,
"The app provides helpful and important information. My only issue is that when I receive an email notification that I have a new message on my chart, it is sometimes difficult to find what's new since I don't know the category it is under, and the message numbers don't always clear once you have read them.",
"When trying to view the test results a pop up screen says ""Unable to view this file on your device. Would you like to download instead?"" After clicking through the warning and agreeing the file won't be secure the file is still not available and it says to visit the website. Why bother with this app if you cannot view test results. This is a waste of space and memory on my phone.",
"It's a beautiful thing to have this app. The app is convenient. However, it would be nice to still receive appointment reminders via text.",
Records and visit summaries from all medical organizations in on spot and easy to access. Very convenient.,
"Took 7 different times before it would keep password i chose. Had to get support to get it done . Everytime I would choose password,would except it,and then when you logged out and tried to log back in rejected password. There is nothing on this app that allows you to send or correspond with a physician. Cerner health has this app beat. Upgrades needed to upgrade the app. Probably won't keep very long.",
Easy access and easy to use. It is very convenient.,
It definitely makes a Difference being able to have access to all your information,
"I was able to create an account via this mychart app, but was unable to log in. I reset my password multiple times. After entering my password, a message saying that the username &/or password are incorrect would pop up. Again, I tried numerous times, but to no avail. I eventually went to the official website instead of the app. I entered the latest password that was not accepted by the app. I got in on the 1st try.",
"Great app - improvement needed in intro/registration. I did not know that you could link your medical organizations, thankfully I know someone that works on the app, but if there was a pop-up or more thorough introduction asking if you have other organizations to link, that would be very helpful to know about. I've used the app for 3-4 years and never knew about the feature. Otherwise I like the app thoroughly.",
"This app is one of the best uses of technology that I have experienced! Never have I felt so empowered about my health before! It saves me countless unwelcomed calls to doctors asking for test results, and saves them time in routine communications by phone or letter. There are some improvements to be made and some doctors are a little intimidated by the level of informed inquiry from patients. However, it is the patients health. I challenge them to get onboard; the genie isn't going bottle!",
"My chart is awesome!' The convience of this app is remarkable. It allows Me to make and cancel Dr appts ,check my labs,ask non emergency medical questions, change my Dr appt if needed on my own. Send messages to my doctors. They can send messages back opposed to waiting on the phone to make a appt or talk to your Dr. HAS your records .For me this is perfect! It is a a great app to have the convenience to get ahold of your Dr is great! And it offers so much information . I love this!",
"MyChart is my one and only experience at an application of this nature so my review is sort of limited in that respect. The app is quick to load and easy to understand, it has lots of applicable data concerning my medical condition that was easy to use based on its graphical representation of the data. I'm sure it's not as comprehensive as the chart that's available to the medical professionals in house but for the patient it is a 100% improvement over any paper documentation I've seen",
Horrible response times. Takes an average of 4 weeks to get a response.,
Each and every time I try to log on it kicks me out and says I don't put in the proper entry of passwords Etc. I have these things written down on a list... I have not changed them and each and every time I enter the same information on a RESET.. I can get into my account! Makes no sense to me except very frustrating!!,
"I'd it wasn't for this app, I'd lose track of all my appointments. The add to calendar feature is the best... saves you from having to type every little detail, write things down only to type them into your phone, remember everything...etc. kudos to the team that created this wonderful app. Only thing I wish is that I could change the alarm tones to a sound that I have on my phone or off of Zedge.",
I love it so much easier for me except I've not been able to log into my account for some reason tonight,
"Easy and convenient! So far this app is perfect! If someone has anxiety just talking to someone or someone doesnt feel like talking to anybody, this app will help out 100 percent! Now of course, there will be times you really need to call in. I'm still learning the app considering it's only been a week of knowing about it. As of now, I'm really loving the fact that I can see my test results with ease.",
The biometrics login doesn't work. They shouldn't make this a login option if the functionality always fails.,
"I LOVE MyChart! Results are fast, I can leave a question for my health team without playing phone tag for days. I can't imagine not having MyChart!!!",
It doesn't work half the time. Can't pull up echeck ins. Keeps saying error on server.,
"This app is very user friendly. It has taken the frustration usually associated with trying to communicate with your provider away. I've been able to schedule appointments, look at lab and radiology results, and even send an email directly to my doctor. No more waiting on hold or pressing numbers on the telemenu to try for answers. It has taken out the anxiety associated with contacting your doctor and getting records.",
Cannot verify phone number as the app requests. Have pressed the Send Code again button and nothing comes through my SMS to verify.,
"I love this app. It allows me to communicate with my doctors, & so much more. I wish all my doctors would sign up for this app. Others are on a different app, however it is not as comprehensive as My Chart & lacks things that My Chart has. The only thing that disappoints me, & in no way is it My Chart's fault, some of the physicians staff who enter test results, are either not entering it or doing so overdue, it makes me feel anxious at times, especially when waiting for a specific result.",
"The sign up process is horrid. If you have more than one person in the house using my chart the app gets confused. It doesn't save the password so there is another hurdle to try to get in. The mychart helpdesks at the hospitals have zero ability to help and set you up. I do not recommend this app. I have left providers that require using it with no work around. If you can get in it is buggy. I have tried on multiple phones and types, it is a horrible app. I hate that docs keep adopting it.",
I cancelled my telemed appointment because you required me to wear a mask. You dont miss a beat on collections but you cant update your tele-medicine patient requirements? Rediculious! All about the revenue!,
I love this App because it keeps me in touch with doctors appointments and the meds that I'm taking and if I need to make appointment with my doctor it makes it easier,
"Truly the most amazing. I am now in the hospital and I am seeing the results in real-time as they're being made available. It's practically a miracle ! This is simply the best idea. .... (A few days after I was discharged from the hospital...) After a bit of reflection, I want the developer to know how important this app is to anyone who finds themselves in a life threatening situation. The app gave me the ability to see test results in real-time, including radiological exam results.",
"I ABSOLUTELY L♥️♥️VE THIS APP. I DONT HAVE TO BE LEFT WAITING ON HOLD FOR HOURS A DAY, I CAN TEXT OVER A ? INSTEAD OF GOING THRU CALLING AND WAITING ON A HUMAN TO CALL ME BACK WHICH SOMETIMES NEVER HAPPENED MY MESSAGE SEEMES TO ALWAYS GET LOST. I JUS WISH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING WAS THIS EASY.. BEST THING JANE PAULY HAS CAME UP WITH. HANDS DOWN ♥️♥️♥️♥️",
Very rapid responses from medical professionals!!!,
"The app is actually partially usable now. I can log in, at least, most days. The app is confusing and way too cluttered with junk. Most options don't even work for me. I do Not recommend this ago. I do not like this app. It takes 30 minutes most days just to log on and check for an appointment time. And now you want to start charging us too use this app to send private secure messages to our doctors? No thank you. If zero stars was an option.",
"I. AM. FURIOUS. Got a new phone and tried to log in on it. It wouldn't let me. Tried to recover name and it somehow created a new account with NONE of my info, but the same phone number and email. Currently I have lost access to my original account and can only access the blank account. I need the updates the other account has as I have a lot of important appointments to keep track of or new information to be notified of. And now I Can't. I really can't express how angry I am.",
I'm very frustrated with my chart at this time. There is no after hours phone number to get help. It says to check the FAQ questions FAQ. But the FAQ questions do not address login difficulties. So this my chart app so serves no appreciable use for me. It's proving to be a waste of my time effort and health since it makes my blood pressure go up when it doesn't work. Thanks for nothing,
Easy to navigate through the web!,
Easy and super convenient! Love that i can easily access my appointments and such from my phone.,
"Excellent. No more appt cards, no more apps reviews. Eliminates a bunch of paper I hated. Makes it easier to look at tests for other providers, which eliminates extra blood draws. Also makes sharing of basic health info easier because it centralizes my health care providers to one place. I love this app.",
"Receiving treatment at multiple hospitals which works on the website, but is problematic for how the app is structured. Worse still I can't find any on the app, effectively making the app useless for me. Would be more effective if one could begin by logging in instead of being forced to an incomplete filter for treatment locations. Consider adding an option for ""my hospital not found"", to show you what to fix and prevent users from being unable to use this app.",
"Love that its easier to schedule appointments, HOWEVER its also kinda irritating too. Tbh a heluva lot better than the Cleveland Clinics app.",
"I love this app! The doctors and other staff are really good at posting test results quickly. I can even message my doctor when I have questions. The only thing I wish was on the app is imagery, like ultrasounds, xrays, ext. The results to those kinds of tests are in text form. I want to see the pictures taken as well as the text on what they see in the imagery.",
"Works okay, but can't get a message unless it's logged in...and can't stay logged in. Prompt for password every time is annoying. The update says things ""may become available after provider starts using the latest version of Epic"" like health care uses the latest version of anything. External app required for video visit works just okay, but integration is very clunky.",
This use to be a good app now it doesn't even work. Keep getting a error message about contacting the server. So I have to sign in with a password. Fix the glitch please. The above statement was written in haste. I initially gave it a rating of 2 stars 🌟 After reading the the ENTIRE error I found I was at fault for not updating my pass code and finger print. It work very well as it use to. No complaints 👌 5 stars ✨️ all the way.,
I love this app. I'm able to see my test results and when I send messages to the doctor I get an answer within 24hrs. I can also order my scripts from it and it tells me when they are ready. It's also the easiest med app I've ever been on. I do everything from it including checking into appointments and transferring them to my calendar so I don't forget.,
I love the app because it has all of your test results and it shows when you need to take a vaccine. I don't like the fact that when you submit insurance information it takes months before it's submitted. You can't send a message to make an appointment in which that is an inconvenience to me. I wish they fix that. But over all the app good.,
Very easy to use and can talk to my Dr much faster.,
"It's clumsy and not terribly intuitive - e.g. clicking on the Message icon does not take you to messages, but to a walk thru to send a message, but no way to see past messages. You *can* get to those by using the 3 bar menu, but if you are going to take up dashboard real estate with big buttons, make them useful.",
This app makes my medical life so easy to keep track of. Information is accurate and easy to understand.,
I get to see all my schedule visits future and past . Notifications are convenient. All my test and medical records. I like it pretty convenient and at the palms of your hands . Excellent be app.,
Very useful. Keep updated!,
"I have linked my accounts and get messages stating they are not linked and that there is a problem, with no way to resolve the problem or know what it is. No way to communicate with epic to resolve the problem, and providers don't know what to do. Seems Epic wants to have an app with zero end user support. Additionally I get notification bubbles with no way to know what it's for. I go into the app and look all over, nothing unread, exit and notifications show unread and bubble still appears.",
I use this APP for my medical and billing information with my medical group. It updates in real time with doctors' notes and upcoming appointments and treatments.,
"I love MyChart. It has made health care so much more convenient. Patients can easily access their health records and share them with providers. Lab results, x-rays, scans, etc. are available sometimes before your Dr even sees them. From there, you can push a button to learn what they mean or even email the Dr. with questions/concerns. Reminders and notifications are sent for upcoming appointments, overdue vaccinations/labs and links to your calendar. Highly recommend this.",
"*edit -1 star 5/24/23* still cannot view messages. It's pretty jank that the developers take no responsibility for an important error with the app thats happening no matter where I'm at. It's not local. It NEEDS to be fixed. You made this app, you need to fix it. I cannot view important messages from doctors! Take responsibility and fix it instead of shoving it off on the user and using bogus excuses. It's NOT a local provider issue. I just moved and it persists.",
Easy to make appointments and refill perscriptions,
"Very easy to use, I love the convenience of having access to all my doctor's in one place. I can schedule appointments, change appointments, reorder prescribed prescriptions with a click of a few touches. I ❤️ the freedom to message my doctor about anything that I have going on and he or she can review, ask additional questions and even set up a virtual appt. If necessary all within 24hr.",
"I love this app. Was skeptical about the new design update. But everything is easy to find, I can communicate with my providers and see everything that they see on my records and statements. Only bug is the notifications that won't go away after you've checked them, but that's minor.",
Was easy step by step sign in and set up.,
"It has the UI design of a Trout trying to stand on two legs. They spent more time on getting the ""MyChart by Epic"" logo to spin than actually crafting a workable UI that minimizes the difficulty or confusion when scheduling any routine checkup. The organization is too flat given the breadth of options and for the love of god just have a ""schedule an immunization"" option out front alongside schedule an appointment. You shouldn't avoid scheduling an appointment due to ambiguous options and design",
This app is amazing. It send notifications when you have an up coming appointment and it's easy to handle,
"I love that I can see all my charts in one place. Easy navigation. The one issue is have is it does not seem to work with lastpass I have to go lastpass, copy password and then back to Mychart. Kind if defeats the purpose. I do not see a way to access my account with my finger print although apparently it can be done.",
Very easy to use and navigate through,
This app is awesome! Easy to use and connect with my doctor's and other healthcare professionals.,
"Can't Upload Documents, Can't Send Messages. I got the app because after a COVID test, my ID didn't upload. I spent over an hour trying to find anywhere where you could upload a new document, and there is none. If you Google it, it says to message it to your provider, but if you go to the messenger part of the app there is absolutely NO WAY to send a message. What is the point of this app? Oh and the UI is terrible, but it's a medical app so I don't expect much.",
"In the beginning, it may have been a bit confusing but that problem was quickly overcome. I would have given it five stars if we're not for this one issue.",
The app's limitations are frustrating. Providers are pre-populated and once there on the list there is no way of changing then. The scheduling option randomly picks the provider with whom u will meet with regardless of the reason for the appointment. There is very little the patient is allowed to manage on this app. My husband's name is mispelled and the edit option won't even allow me to change it. Its so stupid!,
I like the MyChart app I have everything I need at my hands..,
Best medical app out there. Shame all hospital groups can't integrate into EPIC with such skill and features. (Not all hospitals use EPIC),
"This app is awesome 👍 it helps me to check all my appointments, look at my status of all my appointments that I went to. I got all my medical stuff all in one App. Love it. Country Bumpkin 🦄 lvrCherry",
It doesn't work 3/4 of the time. It's pretty much better to go online to check your MyChart messages.,
Have been very satisfied with the ease of obtain and understand test results and Doctors instruction,
"Hands down one of the worst application and platform, and it's not just their ancient looking interface. They push updates frequently which changes not only the outlook not any update to their backend messes up existing sensitive information like credentials. As a software developer myself, it is cringe inducing seeing a software this bad. For it's developers, a pro tip, if you have to redesign the way your app looks for a few measly feature.. DON'T. It's never worth reeducating people",
"Privacy issues with this app. It is sending tracking information to Google without consent or notice. I setup network monitoring and MyChart reached out to Google 16 times in the last 26 hours. This is without being used recently and with background data disabled. Of all apps, one for medical information tracking users is most disappointing. To put this in context, most apps do NOT contact Google constantly and in the background.",
Easy to use and very convenient,
"The app is a great tool for test results, consolidating all appointments, and most everything else. However, the app provides an option to pay an account balance but never works. It does not allow to add the correct card number but auto fills the number with the first 4 numbers entered.",
Easy to use & understand - helps with all aspects of my Healthcare throughout multiple facilities. Great app,
"The app has improved quite a bit over time. I like that it syncs all of my information from most of my doctor visits. Also, communication through the app has improved as well. Since the communication is more oriented towards people's responses rather than the functionality of the app - the communication reviews are geared more towards the staff. Keep up the good work!",
"This app is impossible to get on for a ""tele-health"" encounter. I spent close to 40 minutes trying to obtain internet access. I tried my phone and a laptop with no success. It is not user friendly. Go back to zoom!!! It was much easier & connected better. No more my chart ""Tele-Health for me. I've never been so upset. Not to mention, I now have to wait 3 months for another appt. This one in person😖☹️😠.",
I like St. Anthony they have good doctors there. My doctor is the best. He listens to me and he will let me tell how I feel according to my body. He's very friendly courteous and extremely understanding. I believe I got one of the best. Dr. Daneshfar thanks you rock 🥌,
Bad UI for patents! Security sucks! No fingerprint and have to remember super long passwords each time I open the app or even check a message. Doesn't allow screen shots for my own information. So annoying to write down all the info for notes or communication. Messages are super annoying. Doesn't flow like a chat but opens a new window so you can't see your messages to refer to. Very annoying interface. Lastly all the information is on app and doesn't let you save anything easily.,
"This app is ridiculously annoying to use, although I'm not surprised as there are clearly several fake 5 star reviews. I've had multiple issues with it in the past and always just end up using the website instead (which isn't much better). Currently, when attempting to pay a bill, I'm able to enter my payment information but there's no ""next"" button. I only have ""go back"" or ""cancel"" as options.",
"I have been locked out several times, and now I can not print any reports. I can not stand using this app most of the time.",
A real time saver and good idea! I like that I send messages to my doctor or the facility and they respond in a reasonable time. I appreciate that it links with other healthcare systems so all my information is in one place and now I can share access with a family member! The updated UI looks more modern and intuitive.,
"I just love this app, i can request refills , and i love that i can see my results, and i can send and receive messages.",
It would be nice if one had the ability to check off the task that have been completed in the To Do / Health Reminders instead of the app deciding whether or not you've completed tasks as the app is often wrong. Otherwise the app is pretty useful in grouping local hospital networks in the system together so one can see all of their medical records / tests together in one place.,
Very easy to use. Get to see test results faster and have a record.,
Always a challenge logging on. Dunno what the deal is with this ap. Should be convenient but my creds are always an issue. Updates all the time. Changes. Just frustrating more than helpful. The browser interface is where I turn most often now. Faster and easier which is bizarre but true.,
"Functionality is excellent. Helps one be more involved with one's medical care and activities. Having the ability to check notes, after visit summary, and see next steps is very helpful. A Covid shot record is nice when asked for at certain functions- quick to get to it. Also, I like having a list of medications available. All providers have access within the system so less forms to fill out when going to a new provider or when going to a test or procedure.",
Nit very useful i couldnt initiate a message and you gotta put in your password every time you want to axcess it.,
The app is super easy to use and it's a super helpful way to communicate with the healthcare providers.,
"Works well for the most part, but needs a few updates/improvements. Why is email the only option for 2 factor authentication? Why can't we use an authenticator app like Google or Authy? Or at the very least, text message? Also, I don't understand why I have to enable fingerprint login again almost every single time I log in.",
"Having and utilizing my chart is the best, when the world and life jus upsidedown backwards, having instant convenient access of results, recommendations, routine check up notifications, like a digital well-being calendar, 2 things need to be fixed and added and it'll be the most medical care app...",
"Having 5 kids, I have many different appointments and needs for them. This app has been so easy on me and my memory. Every visit has a summary that was discussed during their visits from their doctor, so if I can't remember something I can easily go into the app and look at their profiles to read everything she wrote. This app also helps me to schedule, cancel, and reschedule appointments without waiting on the phone. Each child has their own profile which also shows what is due for each child.",
"App is basically very good and extremely helpful in keeping track of appointments, medications, procedures and doctors. Too bad all my specialists don't use the Epic/ My Chart system. Also, its a waste of time checking in for appointments with this app since the check in terminals still require a complete on site check in and bar code is useless at this time. Hopefully the problems will straighten out. This app has great potential.",
"It is very easy to use. Only problem I see is that the last test (ordered by my doctor) the results aren't all visible. Only the first test result is shown. I know my doctor ordered a full panel of tests, but only one is shown, entered 5 times, exact same verbiage. I can't see the rest of the test results.",
I have been using the app for several years. Excellent way of reviewing and remaining updated with all my blood work and after office visits; as well as paying copay prior to my appointment. Saves time and I am an advocate with the medical staff regarding my personal health care. No problems at all with app. Very user-friendly.,
A little tricking going back & forth between categories.,
"I love my chart cause of my conditions, I have multiple doctors so now they know what happing so the left hand knows who's treating what. All your medications are listed conditions, allergies , emergency contacts and appointments alerts . You have any questions talk to your Doctors leave msg and they will return ur msg .check in is a breeze QR scanners for your mom or dad I suggest you get this",
"Horribly executed idea, everytime I try to log on, the app says there is an error. This is ridiculous, it was the only way I was told I can get my child's Covid test results and the damn app won't open. Its extremely infuriating that I have to shut the app down multiple times just so I can log in and then be told in the app that nothing can load. Get it together! This is a widely used app. Make it work correctly!",
"Overall, I dont mind the app, but almost every time I try to get in to see my billing, even with an excellent wifi connection, it'll close out and say an error has occurred. I guess I have to call the billing department if they want me to make a payment or send it snail mail.",
Every time I get on here I get up to date info test results and communication from my oncology team.. it makes sense to use this for anyone who has to be in contact with medical services constantly.,
The app is not functioning after phone update,
Quick and easy to stay in touch with you Doctors.,
The MyChart allows me to keep up (anywhere) with health info. It allows me to be able to keep in contact with my doctor,
"Very convenient and efficient. Recently, I've used another system in my local area. After using MyChart, I was frustrated with the lack of access to my test results and notes in a timely manner with the other system. MyChart is almost immediate and the other took at least 24 hours to update information.",
"On messages, when I need to edit the text I have written due to typos or fit into character limit it is frustrating. You fix a typo or mispelling in the text and then it scrolls up to the top. Ugh! So to continue editing at the last place you edited ( where you left off) you have to then go look for the last place you edited in your message. How about just letting us go from top to end of messaging for proofreading and fixing errors. Another needed is spell check. It should not be this hard.",
"My information is not on here, I've waited days and days and still no information. Also, it is taking them forever to review my covid vaccine card and update that to my page..... I'm upset that my information is not on here and I don't understand why it hasn't been updated at all.",
"I really like MyChart. It is so easy and convenient. I can log-in anywhere, do pre-check in, and make and cancel appts. There is an option to connect more than one hospital/clinic to my account. It is possible to message your providers, look at lab results, see upcoming appointments, have virtual visits, and many more. I highly recommend MyChart.",
"Truly creates a smooth experience, through linking all my treatments centers together in one spot. Thank you, Schumpert and Oschners.",
For the most part I can never see any test results or letters.,
MyChart is very easy to navigate.,
Cannot open messages or previous appointments to view after visit summary. This has been ongoing for weeks. Have contacted the developer with no results.,
"This app is excellent. It's easy to use, except for one problem, I can't get into one of my Dr to send messages, but, I am able to connect with her if need be. Also, I am having trouble signing in the HFHS (HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEMS). This is probably an issue with the 2 facilities.",
"Something's gone awry. ""Cannot connect to server"" message each time. It used to work fine. Same message for months now. So I uninstalled the app, rebooted my tablet and reinstalled the app. Same results. My wife just now logged in from her iPad, so the system is working. No luck on my Android. Trying to connect with My UF Health.",
"I love using this app to view my medical history and schedule appointments as well as see any future appointments. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the billing part. I get notifications of bills and can see them, but can't pay them from here. If I can't pay them, I don't see any purpose of just seeing them. That code just uses up space and makes the app bigger than it needs to be for a mobile device. It should either be removed, or the payment option added.",
I like having everything of my care and medications in My Chart at my fingertips. I enjoy seeing my Dr report's of my care after an appointment. I really enjoy using g this app!,
It's really complicated to use on some parts. I like that I can message my doctor's a question.,
Love this app.. Very helpful and easy to navigate,
"Love it! So easy to use and it has really helped me out with not only getting test results easily and as i have horrible memory issues and don't always understand what the doctors are saying it is really helping me a lot with remembering what the doctors say, the diagnosises and with when apts, labs and my other stuff is. It also helps with many other things like phone numbers, where each apt is locate and even more. Great app! I absolutely Love it!",
easy to use and very helpful,
"Well I logged in but won't let me check messages, my medicine or anything it keeps saying it an error in the system i don't know what it is but it's making me mad cause I don't like not knowing what's going on with me and what test were run and what the results are and what not I want to know it all. But nothing I can't check anything please fix the issue.,...",
The print results are toolight to read,
Great helpful app to keep up with your current health,
"Easy way to stay updated with doctors, staff, reports, test results, appointments and medications.",
"I've been using MyChart by Epic through Ohio Health and I must say, it's genuinely epic! The app is user-friendly, easy to access, and provides a wealth of comprehensive information that sometimes gets overlooked during doctor visits. Kudos to the team behind this fantastic tool that has transformed my medical experience. Highly recommended!",
"Excellent app....I find this app to be one of the greatest and most helpful advancements in patient/ medical interfaces in decades! I find it very convenient and helpful that I can link different providers to common location for my review. It even makes my doctor visits easier ad smoother with electronic check-in and medication tracking. I would give the app higher then 5 star rating if possible. Well done, MyChart!",
I love being able to communicate with my doctors in a timely manner! This is SOO extremely convenient t and helpful!,
a real usable solution yo health history. I love the ease of access and no silly loss of sign on BS. 5 year user,
"Great App! I love the interactions it allows, and the control and visibility it gives me on my health records & situation! The ease of use and interconnectivity between providers is great!",
This is the worst app in the world. It constantly crashes and made me extremely late for an appointment. And had to do it over phone because the app crashed constantly. On tablets it just hangs in the location screen. It literally can't do anything useful. Crashes aren't useful. Hanging isn't useful.,
great for refills and up to date info,
"This is the best interactive medical app I've ever used. It virtually eliminates the need to make calls, wait on hold, get transferred around, etc. Quick and responsive. Additionally, the ability to get lab results and visit summaries quickly is very helpful. I love it!!",
I don't really like MyChart that much. I feel it is confusing to use. At my clinic (OMG) they call me by my last name in my summary instead of by my first name! They said if I wanted to be called by my first name I needed to answer the gender question. I want to know how gender has anything to do with a name? There are other things also. It's hard to navigate in the OMG system!,
Really impressed! Super happy to be using this app now. It's got everything I need.,
I love this app!! It's very informative on all your vaccines etc that you need and when and where to get them.,
Great to have easy to use. Love being able to see all my results and everything.,
"easy access to my medical information, and access to physicians via email for quick responses.",
My chart Grady is almost as wonderful as their doctors. Hardy has a health care facility that others should take notes from. Thank you Grady!!,
Can't leave messages for my care team. My test results are hard to organize. Janky app,
"Love how easy it is to communicate with my medical team, review tests, and schedule appointments for my family and myself.",
"Thank you for doing a wonderful job. It makes it easier on us to get a hold of our Dr.s so much easier, and we can put it out there when things happen and they will get it in a day or two.",
"Cannot reliably see test results, correct patient information, or schedule appointments. Support team gives bizarre hacky suggestions like trying the app with wifi off, or abandoning their app all together and using Google chrome in a web browser. When these don't work they just ignore users, then they close the message thread and lock you out. One part of the app that works great is the part where they collect payment. Flawless!",
"It's a good App however i wish that once you dismiss some of the pop ups there was an option to not see them again as this is extremely annoying. Like vaccinations, walk in clinic, etc. I have to dismiss every time!",
"At first glance, for myself this app was slow. It's since been fixed. There's more information about medical insurance and other benefits.",
I read it every day and very good info,
"As someone who has received a lot of medical care over the last decade, MyChart has made my life so much easier! I love being able to view my lab results, check in for doctor's appointments online, update my medical history on my own, etc. It's a great way to be more involved in my healthcare! I highly recommend this app!",
"Will not download a pdf statement, despite a message saying a file is being downloaded. *** Response: *** Not trying to print. Your app send a notification that a billing statement has been added to the account. When the statement is selected, the app presents a message that a file is being downloaded. There is no indication where the file is being downloaded to or what the filename is. There is nothing in the downloads folder nor any folder name that is particular to the app.",
"I loved this app and would've given it 5 stars as it has been sooo very helpful with keeping intouch with my Midwife etc. but the last week or so everytime I open the app it has a ""404: File or directiry not found"" message upon opening. I can't login or access ANYTGINGas this is the very first thing that pops up. Very disappointed😭 *UPDATE* Thank you for correcting the problem! MyChart app is working smoothly once more! 😍👍",
"It's an ""okay"" App. It's not the best medical App I've used. The biggest drawback is you don't have access to a calendar and can't schedule any appointments. Other medical Apps give you this ability which I find extremely useful, especially when you have to stay on hold for an hour on the phone just to set up an appointment with your physicians office. This is a major flaw in this program. It's really annoying so I limit my use of this App because of this.",
"It is very frustrating to use the message service in this app because attaching documents is not possible. Also, getting alerts for organizations I haven't used for years and then not being able to login has been a huge waste of time and exceptionally frustrating. Please update the app to allow attachments of documents rather than images!",
"saves time, I dont have to guess when my appointments are. Results are fast and clear.",
Has helped me keep track of appointments and test results as well that I needed for myself. Love this app a lot.,
My BonSecours made changes. I can no longer send a message to any of my doctors. My heart meds are almost out and I cannot message the practice. I can no longer leave a voice mail on a weekend either. This is a big regression and is making Bon Secours be more like their terrible competitor. The patient is far less important than the technology...to our detriment.,
"Lots of room for improvement: Any changes implemented are NOT made until reviewed. Often then the changes are incorrect. When multiple Doctors are involved ie: PCP, in hospital, out patient, specialist, etc, ... the patient knows best what needs to be done or changed and the reviewer should not alter the information without consulting with the patient.",
"I like everything about MyChart except the security check-in. It works pretty well on my phone but not on our desktop computer. Half the time if I ask for an email code it never comes. Then I'll say I don't want the feature any longer and that lasts for a short period of time and then it reverts backs to having to do it. I think I'm safe on our computer, we run all the diagnostics, etc, it should be up to each individual if we use it.",
"Great way for communication,results,scheduling appointments and seeing about your medications.Great app.",
"One of the best medical-office apps I have used - And I've gone through a good number. Was a little tricky to set up at first, but it's easy to fingerprint scan in. I get pop up alerts when tests are completed & can instantly see my results, and my doctors can message me to explain what it means and tell me if they're prescribing me something. Way better than the outdated ""Come back in 2 weeks just for us to read a piece of paper to you"".",
"I really love this app. It helps me care for myself and my child very easily, especially in regards to sending non urgent messages to our doctors and receiving quick responses. I can access my health records quickly and can preemptively update information prior to appointments. Cross connection with Christie Clinic as very handy. Could use a little bit of work with connecting to payment options (I still prefer to call or stop in to finance). Really do love the app.",
The app has become an unusable mess. Very confusing now. Where are my dentist appointments that are scheduled? Not anywhere in the appointment reminders. They send me messages then the links won't let me log in. Why did you change it? It was working fine and easy to use. Now it looks like some desk bound programmer who's never been to a doctor wrote it and you have to be a programmer to use it. This is shameful! It there was an option I'd take it in a second. TALK TO YOU DOCTOR AND COMPLAIN!,
"Great way to keep track of everything! And being able to message the doctors is great! And having the whole family on one app and being able to easily switch between each person, schedule appointments, see lab results. It's just all around a great tool!",
"I really like this app it's easy to use, and has everything I could possibly need to keep up with my appointments, and payments as well.",
"This application is a highly useful tool. Especially for those of us who know enough to rest easy or know or panic at test results. Sometimes I see the results before the doctor. I love this app! No matter what facilty i go to, if they are in the Norton Healthcare group they can see everything ive had done, history, problems, medications etc. No repeating or lengthy paoerwork!",
"It's okay, but I looked for Carolina Kidney Care on my chart and could not find them. They use mychart",
I love it but at times you can't order your medicine it use to not be a problem but now their is. But everything else I love.,
Love this app it keeps up with your doctor's appointment they can leave your messaging app where you don't have to pick up the phone and try to reach,
"Can't save password in 2021? Most people have complicated generated passwords, thats impossible to remember because it's only for that particular app. Considering you ask for the password every time you open the app, please allow us to atleast save the password in Google. You would think this type of thing, would be automatic. The app is great otherwise but the password thing docs 3 stars.",
"Unneccesssrily complex. NEW INFORMATION should be the only heading for new inormation. Currently a patient is sent notice they have a new ""message"". And most of the time the new information is in some other heading than the one labeled MESSAGES. Also when new information has been viewed, it should so indicate that fact. That way the patient does does not have scroll through old information to find the new. The whole program currently indicates a reality disconnect.",
Great way to track medications and appointments! Real-time test results too! Great app!,
MyChart seems incapable of sharing* my medication list among different institutions. So I have to repeat the whole damn thing every time I see a doctor at a different Institution.,
I have no problem connecting with my chart. I am happy to be able to review my visits as well as test results,
"I find this app extremely helpful, keeping me up to date with appointments and results.",
"The MyChart app is absolutely the best app that I could have EVER come across. It helps me so much with keeping up with appts something I wasn't good at. But, now I'm on top of keeping appts or rescheduling if I have to but it works a lot of the times. There are some glitches but not many to speak of and they stay on top of their maintenancing of the updates.",
New update and I love it It allows me to go back 6 months for all of my blood work instead of having to go back and find the other test manually,
Easy to use app to see my test results and contact my doctor by secure message.,
"Its a good concept and a great app when it works. That is just it though, everytime I need the app to work, it doesnt. Sometimes it will have an entire day of downtime when Im trying to schedule appointments or check messages. This is not an app where that is acceptable as people depend on it. Extremely frustrating, developers need to spend more time making sure it works. This isnt some clicker game, it is peoples livelihoods and health.",
"Very useful app. I'm able to communicate with my doctors with ease and get view my test results without any issues. The only tiny issue I have is that I'm constantly having to log in. I'm the only one who uses my phone, yet I still have to insert my password. Other than that, it's a great app.",
"It wouldn't even let me log in - I did have my desktop on, but I made sure I was definitely NOT on my MyChart there. Still, although I carefully typed all the correct sign-in info, I was repeatedly told that my password was incorrect, and that I should reset it...I don't think so! The better choice was to delete the useless app and keep using the desktop (which lets me sign in all the time).",
I have utilized this program for several years now and LOVE IT. It makes getting information and medication a breeze!,
"While it's cool to have all your Doctors and medical info right there. It can also be a pain constantly getting the email reminders and having to see why they're trying to contact you. It becomes a pain, but like anything you have weigh the good with the bad. Just one more to keep you locked into the grid!",
It's good to have even helps keep up with refills but it needs to read the bio login it was a nice feature to have since I messed up my arm,
"Very convenient app, it works really well, especially the SSM Health portal works well.",
"Won't allow Video Apptments to be scheduled. Made a regular appointment online and it did not process, No record found from office. MyChart was updated May 5th 2023.",
The Decade's Best Healthcare Innovation! Saves me time and makes it easier to keep in necessary contact even when I only have wifi to connect with(important when I don't live in an area that's 3g+ service accessible). Going over notes from the appointment and reviewing charts with my spouse is a huge plus as well. It's really awesome 😎 👌,
Great to have all my data in one secure place. Convenient for checking in to appointments.,
"Well laid out. Easy to use and access labs, medications, and to msg your doctor.",
"Pointless app and useless support.  Won't accept password, but it works on the computer. Tech support can't do anything but reset the password, which still fails on the app, and now also won't accept it on the computer, and now I'm locked out.  They have no answer other than resetting the password again.  Did this three times, locked out again.  Waste of time.",
"This app is a great app for keeping track of off all doctor appointments that are connected through the sparrow system. I like being able to keep track of my medical records, and is an easy way to have medications on hand to reference MyChart offers patients to make appointments with your family physician and communicate using emails. This app can also be set up for video conferences through Zoom app which is a convenience to stay at home and not make a special trip to their office.",
"In general it is too hard to use. I get a billing page showing amount due and I am expected to pay but on another page it shows insurance has not responded yet... may confuse ppl into paying something they shouldn't. OVERALL app flow is not very intuitive. Scares me that my health records are easily hacked too... I only use it bc there is a couple things easier, although making a annual physical appointment was hosed... prev one I made it all in app, the most recent one was horrid. More....",
It keeps you up to date with appointments and you get test results,
3 and 1/2 stars because it is not maneuverable you cannot see everything- you click here. Nothing opens. You click there nothing opens. It says it's going to open. It's just click here and the links are dead and the information's incorrect in my mychart. I'm not 5'7. I have tried to correct it numerous times myself to no avail. I have had my colonoscopy. I am not on the same medication with two different prescriptions and two different dosages. It's not a very user friendly app.,
"It has been Fantastic since the first day I have had it, and always there when I need it...",
"Aside from the arguably unecessary and ugly redesign, the app continues to be one of the most helpful, handy tools available. Too many functions in the new layout, however, do not work. In the previous version of the app design, all options and capabilities worked well.",
I love everything about this app. I would give it a 10 star if I could. Oh wait I can....🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,
"This app is very simple, easy to message doctors' offices for non-emergencies at time convenient for me, easily refill meds, can even leave notes & reminders only I can see. Only wish it was easier to cancel appointments same day for that day's appointment then leave a message for call back from office. Today I spent over 30 minutes total waiting for staff to answer. Switchboard op finally answered & routed me back to where I originally was. I pressed another option & got through this way.",
"Great app. Easy to use and understand. You can make appointments, request refills and message your doctor and the response time is fairly quick. You can see everything from the appointment overview to test results even from CT Scans and MRI. If you have an outstanding balance it shows you and how to resolve or pay it. Love this app. I use it quite a bit when I need anything regarding my medical needs!",
"You have to be kidding me! There is no reason an app that is nothing more than a medical chart should have access to parts of my phone that have nothing to do with displaying information. This app is nearly NSA worthy. Impressive from a nerd standpoint, but no. Even if you go into settings and turn off permissions, the app can turn them back on. As impressive as this app is, as well as it works, convenience is not worth that kind of intrusive capability.",
Used to work wonderful and I sure miss it but won't work on new phone. Security is so tight that it doesn't recognize me as the same user as the previous phone owner. Hopefully this update will fix it. Update 10/27/22 don't remember my password and requesting it thru email doesn't work because I get no reply. I remember when it worked and I truly miss this app.,
"It's so amazing what you can do nowadays with your phone. My chart is a wonderful thing, helps to keep track of all your doctors all your appointments. And being able to message your doctors rather than have to come in for everything is a great convenience.",
Always open for you night or day .You are a able get a message to the doctor of your Choice at ARC its great,
"The app does provide convenience over trying to reach the office by phone, BUT it is buggy in places. Things I've noticed that need to be addressed are: UPDATING PERSONAL INFO- having to scroll through a list of counties for the entire country is a bit unprofessional. Once state is entered, algorithm should cull that list to only that state, OR, better yet, zip code should autofill County which could then be modified if needeed. PREVIOUS MESSAGE COUNT INDICATOR - doesn't show unreads only",
I am not at all impressed with your new app. It is not easy to use as the previous app. It is to complicated and confusing.,
"For the most part really like it as providers do respond a lot more quickly than if you try to contact them in office, if not directly someone on their team responds. The downside, issues with privacy. Some people who had access to my My Chart information I feel felt that they had the right to share very private information that they obtained off of My Chart without discussing it with me first and without my consent. My Chart needs to address such matter's. 😞",
"Love this app when it's working. Lately I can't even sign into it, keeps saying error.",
"I love the my chart app. It allows me to have direct communication with my providers and obtain all the information I could possibly need about my health, visits and Doctor notes. I am so impressed with the app and the ability to access all of my health information in one place. I highly recommend everyone sign up for my chart. It is very user friendly and convenient.",
Great way to see results and the meaning.,
"When I first downloaded this app it worked great. Now, every time I try to open the app it says 'server error'. And, please don't respond that it's not your fault, it must be an error on the part of the facility I'm trying to connect to. I've noticed, every complaint, is the same as mine. And, you give everyone the same answer. There can't be that many different facilities with the same problem! Your team needs to figure out what the problem is with the app ASAP!",
"This app is so easy to use. Gets quick response from doctors, I get to check all my tests, know my results as soon as they're posted. Anything you need to know is right at the tip of your fingers it's as if you're one-on-one with the with the lab tech the doctors all of them. Especially with the four digit or fingerprint option logon so easy so so easy.",
I love how I can easily select this app and know my schedules.,
This app has helped me so much. I can get my appts and results and so much more. I do recommend it to anyone who needs help in their lives.,
It has all the information a patient could need without calling the clinic to request it.,
"For the past few weeks to a month I have not been able to use the app for appointments. My doctor can see me via video but not able to hear me, I do the mic test everytime. When he logs in I can see him but the audio coming from his side comes across more like a whisper it's that hard to hear and I have my volume up to 11, sadly we end up having a phone call instead.",
Whoever wrote the code left off important information and links as in when I tried to sign into VCU for the first time it said password didn't match. After an hour on the phone turned out issue was changed password criteria between VCU portal and MyChart. Instructional video can't be replayed except thru YouTube & one would never guess search criteria. And no ADA accommodations for hearing impaired. CC scrolls way too fast to read and learn from.,
I love the app and being able to do so much. I gave it a 4 star because it can be clunky. Not user friendly a little.,
"It wants me to verify my email after 10 minutes of them sending a code. Code doesn't come in until 6:00 or 8 minutes and then to put the code in, the only way to put the code into the app is to hit a button that says send code verification which then sends another code and then won't accept the code previously sent. Very frustrating. It appears as though this code verification to the email must be done prior to being able to receive any emails from positions.",
"It's clunky and not user friendly at all, it doesn't interface with the other hospitals as it claims too, and the security is a joke, it works most of the time, but the constant changes to the landing page make it more difficult than it needs to be, stop worrying about window dressing and make the functionality more stable.",
I really like being able to review my health information all in one place. I like being able to schedule my appointments online. I also like being able to send a message to my health care provider.,
"This app is a lifesaver (literally speaking). I tend to forget my password alot but when I remember or change it, I swear I feel like the Pearlie Gate has opened lol. Thank you to the smart, brilliant, talented individual who came up with this idea. It can't get any better nor easier than keeping up with my health and appointments so again THANK YOU.",
Every time you release an update this app gets worse and worse. It simply does not work. I've been trying to retrieve documents for more than 6 months that are extremely important medical records. The app completely fails every single time I have tried. I have requested support at least 7 times. Not one single time have I been contacted buy a support rep. I use Parkland Hospital in Dallas every single installation I try to file just disappears. Absolutely no support from EPIC! I HATE IT!,
"AMAZING & SIMPLE TO USE APP!! ONE OF THE BEST APPS!! Well put together & super easy to use & view information with its layout & functions. A whole lot easier to communicate w/med team. Wish other apps worked like this one or that many other programs/companies would use an app like this. ONLY 1 ISSUE- the scheduling function does not work. I cannot schedule appointments on the app. I have to call, which usually goes to Voicemail. So the function needs to be fixed or removed from the app.",
"Helpful, but not smooth to use. Overall, nicer than having multiple apps for MyChart from each provider, each with their own feature levels, development schedule, and slightly different UX. However, switching between accounts leaves much to be desired as it will kick you out to your browser half the time.",
I really like that I can look at my son's n my medical appointments n test results that I can't loose ( I terrible with keeping up with papers n remembering appointments.,
"Can send notes directly to doctors between appts, request refills, & receive alerts for upcoming appointments/tests! An amazingly handy app!",
"Love Emory sometimes changing docs soon. Love doctors, tara-pa, etc can't think of ever ones name's 😕",
A lot easier than standing on the phone and waiting for 30 minutes to receive an appointment. Clear to use unfortunately for the older folks they're still used to picking up the phone and calling and being on hold🤔 I was able to teach a couple of my older relatives to use this particular app that's how easy it is.,
trouble signing in and not much help from the customer service number,
Great way to improve communication with the medical team,
I enjoy the Beaumont chart except it does not offer you a chance to put in a change if task is already completed or scheduled. Like for instance my mammogram was completed in Jan but there is no way to add the comment so I stop getting messages that I need it done. My colonoscopy is scheduled for May 30 th and there is no way to let it be known,
Great app. Up to date medical charts. Love this app. Easy to schedule appointments.,
Update: I tried again this morning and so far so good. I'll reach out if it happens again. Having difficulty logging in and even getting into things like reading messages with this app for over a month. Thought it was my phone but just got a new phone Samsung S22 and still issues. Have to repeatedly click in and out. Very frustrating.,
"The damned system Keeps sending me a code to enter, but each time I have tried to enter it, it says it's not correct. The system needs to be worked on if you are wanting a verification code entered. The way it's set up will not work because each time you try to put the code in, it sends you another one. Plus I don't care to have a flu shot or a Chinese Covid-19 Flu Bug Pandemic Virus shot. So please stop putting it on my chart.",
I believe this app was the best app that anybody could have came up with it is so helpful with appointments and cancellations and messaging your doctor thanks MyChart.,
"Love this app but since your recent update on March 15, 2021 I cannot access the app. It says; can not communicate with the server. Same with my husband's app on his phone. We have to go online and do a search for MyChart and sign in from there. We have uninstalled and reinstalled and made sure everything was updated. This is the only app that is not working properly.",
"Each time My Chart is updated it knocks out my address replacing it with Chilrens Hospital Columbus, OH? Fine but it stops me from being able to set appointments and be verified for test results and other crucial information. You cannot easily change address on my chart as it loxks in a specific set of counties from bad addreses. You must go in person to prove who you are. Ut cannot set up aopt and do it at appt. Needless travel and time. In panemic era too!",
Easy to use and very convenient. I love this app because it gives you test results and you are able to view after visit summaries. I love being able to message my doctor with questions or concerns. Definitely is a life saver especially when I donr have time to be on hold waiting to speak to someone about a simple question.,
"Love the app...except for the ""error 404"" that I often get when going to different areas of the app. Not always but at times I'm unable to send a message to my docs or request refills etc. I've Uninstalled and re-installed but no change with the errors. Great app otherwise!! Extremely convenient!",
Works great for me to keep All my health information in one easy to access location and accessable to who ever I choose.,
"I love the website for "" My Chart"". The test results using the ""bar"" measurements for lows, highs, and normal ranges is a genius idea. Its very easy to see results (scan) quickly. It is relative easy to find information, and to set up video calls. Thanks for the new, improved, website.",
"I'm like to keep up with all my doctors and visits with MyChart. We've been able to have video checkups during the pandemic, which is great. My PCP is quite prompt answering messages on the app, much more reliable than having to relay messages through a switchboard. I also appreciate that I can see test results much quicker, as well.",
Great tool to help with health care,
"My Chart saves a lot of time for me and the Doc's staff. Especially, quick questions, medicine renewal, appointment requests and resceduling. It also improves accuracy. Today we failed to update the password, becuse they sent an email, with code #. I was allready in email and lost my place when attempting to retrive the code#. They should offer to send it via text.",
Is the easiest way to get info from and to office. Keep track of refiled on meds with out having to bother busy staff with call. I can manage the whole family in on shot.,
"Best app! Without problems,runs smooth been using for years. Nice to have an app that actually runs smooth",
Getting into this app has been a pain for me with low vision for years now. Ease of access is not even on the table. Great idea but the implementation is horrible! I have to fight to just login. The phone version is the most trouble. The tablet version is easier to use with the pin login but i have not been able to set it up on the phone. Please be understand that the app is very useful to a resident....but to an older person with less that 20/15 vision it is deplorable. Sorry for this post,
"I tried opening a support case but they told me to contact the health providers tech support myself. The issue is with the app development. When trying to add a bank account there is no submit button, I even sent screen shots to their support. I was able to do it on the website but I thought I would be nice and help get it fixed for other ppl.",
Great app! Super easy to use. Requesting prescription refills is really quick and easy. It's so nice to have my medical records at my finger tips. I can keep track of all my labs. And all my upcoming appointments are also right there. I can even keep track of my mom's medical information from my phone.,
I am unable to see my up coming appointment with my Oncologist.Also my recent test results are not showing up .I can't send a message to my oncologist.Disappointed with this app,
"Ok, but can't understand why I have to go to HEALOW to leave messages, because my Doctor's name doesn't come up, under messages, despite her telling me, that this is the system to exclusively use ❓ Thanks for responding, but where did ""Scheduling"" come up, in my initial comment ❓",
Awesome idea and technolog! It's so useful to have one place that you can do everything you need to that involves your health. Plus all your medical records are stored here also so no need to go digging through files or trying to remember your old doctors last name. Overall 5/5 because of it's simplicity and productivity ..not to mention it's user-friendly Interface.,
App is slow to load sometimes doesn't load at all and have to use desktop version.,
"This app is usually very very nice but yesterday the app reset and it's like I never set it up with all my information... now it doesn't have my ""organizations"" available in my state to select. I don't know what happened, it was fine a week and a half ago. I would really like to see this up and running again. Update on 1.5.21. I logged in on the website, then uninstalled & reinstalled and saw that my health care organizations were again available. Now it works! It's all good again!",
"This application is terrible! It keeps freezing up and/or my screen goes black.IF the option comes up to send a report, when I try to go there it tells me I have no internet connection(when clearly I DO)This is a new record keeping service set up by my physician's office so I was required to enter and update much of my medical history, fine, but when I went back to it today it was not there. Don't use this app!",
It is a smart and fast way to communicate with your health provider.,
Now that I've regained access to the app it seems to be working flawlessly,
"This app works well, an could be useful if all of my health care providers used it, or at least entered appointments & test results, etc. into the appropriate database. The linking accounts feature doesn't seem to work, although I can switch to my old health care account to view that information separately.",
"For the most part, I love this, but in the information about upcoming appointments, it would be helpful to put the unit to check in. It would help if it is a new or specialty Dr. I like it when I can just come in and head straight to where I need to go. Oftentimes, the volunteers have to figure it out themself.",
Good way to keep up on your health and appointments,
"Really like using My Chart app. It's nice to see all test results, letters, meds etc all in. One place. Best thing is being able to communicate with your provider via email and to make appointments online. Much easier to have questions answered without having to take time away from front desk staff.",
"This is a great app for keeping track of past and present doc appt, Labs and doc notes. I enjoy this app very much.",
"MyChart is an easy way to keep my information updated and accurate. If I'm not sure about what procedures the doctor ordered, I can contact a nurse to clarify or explain what had me confused. All my appointments are kept track of with the doctor's notes; same with medications. Simple way to stay up to date with all your healthcare needs.",
"Screenshots Disabled - really annoying that I got my Covid test results back and I can't even screenshot it to share with people. But overall the app has served the function of providing me with results well, so I can't say I have an issue with how it works for that intention. Just doesn't make a lot of sense.",
Love app except when entering dates. Very difficult to use when entering dates from prior years.,
"Great app with great results, There are so many great things about the app, one of the features that's wonderful is it's ease in use and the ability go through the charts and find everything that you need. The ability to make appointments, speak with your physician and ask general questions makes the app a success thanks for the time put in and the great work to make the app user friendly..",
"Convenient app to see results messages and appts for all your doctors in who participate, but I find the notification alert (the number you find next to the app icon) confusing and frustrating. When I see a number I know to check how many new messages, appts., or lab results, but it doesn't say from which dr or organization. The new message is not highlighted. I open every message, lab result etc. Yet the number still shows, letting me know I still didnt open a message. Where is it??",
"Underwhelmed. I've had it about a month, it still hasn't updated all of my PCP info and keeps telling me there's issues with linking my charts from other networks, after it tells me they're linked. The old system my PCP had works way better and I was told by an old network that using this is actually behind the times. But this is all my PCP offers now.",
"I think this is a very handy app and I love it. The only problem is, is that I can only message my provider and see my medications. I can't see my statements or anything else. I try to click on them and it immediately exits out of that page and says ""Authentication error"" but I can see messages just fine. Please fix!",
"Although this app is proving to be useful on my phone, it simply refuses to download on more than one device. I have been trying for the past 3 hours to download the app to my laptop for a video appointment, to no avail. This is extremely frustrating! I was hoping to have a hands free way of communicating with my provider...",
"So, what's the purpose of the app's pre check-in? You still have to use the kiosk to check-in with no recognition that you're pre checked. Also, the app keeps asking me to update my information. After reviewing it, everything is correct and hadn't changed literally for years, there's no ""Confirm"" buttons, only edit buttons. Even reviewing information in the edit mode doesn't offer a ""Confirm"" option. It just keeps asking for an update every time I open the app. How about adding a confirm button?",
"It's a pain to navigate this app. I get emails regarding a bill, check app and it loads a log in page wanting the medical report number, which I'm not privy to as I'm unaware what bill you're talking about. The app is set up in such a way that I'm able to use biometrics to log in, perfect as I'm epileptic and cannot remember every password or user name. So taking me out of the app to log in AGAIN to see any bills is futile. If in the app there shouldn't be redirecting for additional login info.",
"I have been using this app for about 10 years now and I love it. It's a Safe and convenient way to take your medical records with You, Especially if you have doctors in different hospital systems it makes it easy to share records with them. It also makes it easy for you to access your records, view test results, call in medication refills, Schedule appointments with your doctor and specialist. And so much more. It's just a great app all around!",
Horrible! Never works for me! Always says error!,
MyChart is excellent and easy to use,
This is the greatest idea ever! Seeing results of lab tests and checking on future appointments is fantastic.,
"Epic fail is more accurate. You took a perfectly good and useful app and turned it into garbage. Completely useless since the last upgrade. Uninstall/Re-install did nothing. Gives a blank screen after logging in. Revert the app to it's previous version. This one is total junk. Would like to give zero stars but can't. There should be a negative star rating, meaning you owe me stars for putting up with this garbage.",
It's so easy to communicate with some type of provider,
Great way to keep up and communicate with Doctors and nurses and any testing done. I see results before they do!,
"The app was fine a year ago; now, they keep changing it and overcomplicating it. You can't go in there and easily click a button to view messages or upcoming appointments. Even end of visit summaries are difficult to locate. Don't think they realize the all age groups use the app.",
"My Chart is a wonderful way to coordinate your health care and leave messages for your doctors. Phone calls aren't always necessary. You can keep track of appointments, schedule appointments, and change appointments. Your doctors can see where each other is headed with your health care. You can also see the doctor's notes after a visit. You are able to have your health care information on you 24/7. This is great in emergencies or anytime really. You are able to handle prescription needs also.",
"Best u got....it's great,an actually it has to much info an comments you wouldn't expect...depressing mostly ...but medical files are always negatives that way .",
I think the app could be alot easier for people 🤔,
"I sometimes have trouble finding certain things that I need, but after messing around with the app, I can usually find it.",
This is an excellent app and has been improved a great deal over older versions. It is possible to contact doctors and Healthcare providers and directly ask them questions. Plus before an appointments it is possible to log in and pre-register avoiding filling out forms in the waiting room. I like this app because it is so easy to use. RLS,
"Every time I try to log into the app it says ""We are unable to log you in right now. Please try again later."" I can log in on the web browser just fine. This has been going on since November 2022 for me. I tried clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, using Wi-Fi, using phone data. Same error message every time.",
E checkin has stopped working. Constant server error message appears. Nothing is wrong with my Wi-Fi nothing is wrong with my phone everything else is working perfectly well on my phone but I cannot get into messages or anything on that app and it doesn't matter which institution I'm logged into I've contacted them several times even with screenshots and I've not heard anything back,
"It's the best. From almost instant feedback from Dr.s, labs, prescription data and communication.",
My chart app has been definitely a wonderful thing and experience to be able to use and have. With Tampa Generals help it was easy to set up and keep informed about my records and tests that had been done. I again think that this is an excellent app and nothing is more important than your health and having access to your records.,
"Handy application for accessing health information. I would be so impressed if there was an update with a biometric option to login. Additionally, the ability to be ""kept logged in"" would be advantageous for patients/ family members receiving multiple messages and tests results in a day where it is necessary to navigate away from the app.",
It's wonderful to find the information about you and your health with your Dr. and Raquel Danko. I love it.,
"Super easy to use I love that the app has everything from your COVID vax status to being able to contact your doctor directly through a messaging portion of the app. It makes it easy to get refills when you need them and you can get the information for your doctor's office right from the app. You can even schedule appointments through the app. Overall, it's an amazing app. It's definitely made my life easier.",
Doesn't save my password. I have had to reset my password everytime I login. This is bullsh!t.,
This is a great app. I can reach all of my sons doctors and see the results of his tests etc.,
The app has been really helpful to see everything in one place. And I've used the feature where you can message the doctor and I got a response several hours later. I was really impressed. You can never get a response that quick from a doctors office usually. I like that I can see all my that results and doctors notes.,
"I love having the use of Mychart! It's very convenient because it reminds me of my appointment times, dates, and with what department I'm visiting. I also can view test results and contact my PCP and other specialty drs. I need these reminders, and visuals because otherwise, I would miss many appointments. Thank you so much for this app!!",
"Great app especially with all of my different appointments with specialist and tests. Also a much more efficient way to communicate with your care team. The ability to review my scripts, and if I need to furnish my manager with a return to work or excused documentation utilizing this app saves valuable time and energy. The updates recently are top notch🏥⚕💊💉🚑",
"Update: Was in the middle of typing up the email to epic, tried one more time to login & voila! The app let me in. Thank you. Unable to login. When I tap on get help it gives me an 800 number to call. This app has become completely useless. I can login just fine on the web just not on the app, whether Android or iOS version.",
"Overall pretty good. Took off stars due to the app often being slow, and the fact that I cannot edit my dashboard to only see the topics and notifications that I want to see. Please give the ability to delete ""notification cards"" the feed is way too loud, it needs to be cleaned up to only include important information. Example I don't want to see two reminders to sign up for paperless billing when clearly I don't want paperless billing.",
"Many of the little messages are too cryptic to have much value. The ability to communicate with my doctor in a low key, non-urgent manner is really nice. I think many of the shortcomings may be choices made by healthcare providers, e.g. today I received two notices, one telling me I had a ""new message"" and another telling me I had a ""new letter"". Where does the menu system support letters? Epic can't fix utilization issues but little things like ambiguity and inconsistency in word usage hurt.",
There are zero options for expanding font size for low vision and vision impaired. Accessibility ADA complaint.,
"So far so good, been able to keep in touch with my primary care physician and have my questions answered very fast, MyChart has allowed me to view my information and keep up with important appointments.",
This works so well for me. I verify my appointments both date and time. I really like this program!,
Horrible it doesn't work to submit prescription refills. Your supposed to click on the refill button & it has never worked in 4 months since Drs office started using the software. I have complained about it & nothing gets done. Your app has a lot of flaws.,
"Love it!! Easycand fast to set up appointments, check lab results , ecc.",
"Very tedious and annoying but I am stuck with it in terms of communicating with my healthcare providers. One of the worst features is the inability to attach a PDF in a message to a provider. I end up having to take a photograph of the PDF, save the photo to my desktop and then attach it to the message I wish to send. Very unprofessional program",
The app works well most of the time there has been times where it doesn't let you in and says technical difficulty or it signs you out if your linked to multiple places ex: lifespan and south coast. Other than that it's a great app easy to navigate and find what you need to.,
"Very confusing information and some info is inaccurate. Such as, MyChart says that I visited my doctor today which I did not. Plus. Even though I have entered my personal information and answered all the questions, when an appointment is added, I am asked to complete the same information again. Very annoying. There are too many text and email reminders and confirmations requested. Also annoying. How does a person make appointments and speak to someone if the don't use a cell phone?",
"As with most of my experience at KU Med, My Chart is user friendly and very helpful.",
Recently the app has been giving myself and others issues when logging in to e-check in or if I have more that one patient on there it will randomly remove all and keep one child. It is really frustrating that this app is meant to ease the process and be convenient for both patients and staff but it constantly glitches and causing frustration on both sides.,
"I tried to schedule an appointment and couldn't find an option for a general one. It said to click the stethoscope for more options but there is none. All the options required a referral and were specific but non for what I needed, a follow up. Everything else is great.",
Good gui (graphic user interface). Nice flow.,
This site is easy to navigate and very informative.,
I can't get into the my chart it won't open for many days I've tried it keeps saying Server Down. I need to get into my chart and I can't.,
You get alot of information from it. I like it!!,
"[UPDATE] THE PROBLEM HAS RESOLVED ITSELF. The app has recently stopped working on my Android phone. Attempts to login result with ""There was a problem connecting to the server"". This error pops up instantly, as if no attempt was even made to connect. I have confirmed that I can still login on the website, as well as on an iPad, but this app does not even attempt to connect. This is regardless of whether I am using cell service or WiFi. I was previously using it just fine. What happened? Even removed and reinstalled the app. No change.",
"I would give 5 stars if there was an option to dismiss the overdue flu shot/wellness info. Overall, i love the app, the customization is awesome as well as merging all health records from neighboring offices/networks. I think there should be some sort of widgets that are related to your doctor's, upcoming appointments, covid-19 vaccination record, etc. Thanks for easy management and construction!",
"It is great being able to get real time updates on tests, and send messages to providers. Also, having access to change appointments and update payment preferences all in one app. It also changes to show a different version if you are hospitalized woth needed information.",
Very helpful and helps remember all my appointments easy access to all my doctors without even having to call.,
Thankful for this app! My son was in NICU for 121 days and this helped me feel like I was able to know everything!,
"It does a lot, so I won't go below three stars. But one huge thing that makes it difficult to use is that you can't request refills in the app from pharmacies other than your provider's. Maybe that's a setting thing on the provider's side, but my doctor says it's a glitch that infuriates him too. It leaves patients like me relying on messaging doctors for refills, which can take quite a while - doctors don't have a lot of time to check messages like this, obviously.",
"The basic premise of the app is fine. However, the video conferencing aspect is horrible!! In an hour long visit, we've lost sound multiple times, then had trouble logging back on. That's assuming it let you log on to begin with. I'm not impressed. I'm stressed, because this app is unstable... At best.",
"It's okay, it would be nice if both android and iPhone users can switch their photos on the account currently only iPhone can. I would like to be given option to mark the question I send over as urgent or give more options as to why I am reaching out. Also when you clear something it just pops back up. Please work on these things.",
"It won't save your login information so the app will want you to enter your username and password twice. The first time ALWAYS fails. I have a proper password management system going on and this app is forcing me to actually write down a password so I don't have to constantly go into my password manager, copy the password and move back to the app. This alone means it's nearly unusable considering I can just click on the email link and automatically login on the webpage losing no functionality.",
"The app keeps getting better. I like that it has quick access to covid-19 vaccination records for events that require it, and it makes it easy to communicate with my doctor and see visit notes and things I need to do to follow-up. One improvement I would like to see is the ability to use 2-factor authentication apps like Google authenticator or Authy instead of the multi-step authentication that users a message sent to your phone which is much less secure.",
I like that I have full control of my health records. My only issue is test result that appear on the main thread. When I go back to reopen to research my pregnancy results or show my husband they disappear and I cannot find them again. I'll download them if given the option to make sure I have access to them again. The results are blacked out and can't see them when downloaded. The reason I put three stars. The results will reappear somewhere else or in the main thread. Please fix this,
"Easy and intuitive to use across different providers' sites, with steady improvements over the years.",
"I love the idea of this app. However, it has a bit of a confusing interface, and it can be hard to contact my providers directly. I also miss being able to use my biometrics when I log in. That made it much more user friendly, and I'd love it back.",
MyChart makes it so much easier to keep track of all my medical needs exspecially if you use Goggle calender in conjuction with MyChart. Just wish I could get more of my doctors to join.,
"I like the convenience of MyChart. The majority of my kiddo's doctors are not local so it helps so much for communication and scheduling, however it is very glitchy lately on my Samsung s20 note. I keep getting an error pop up (An error has occurred on the server. Please try again later.) when trying to read messages or do e check in. Would love to give 5 stars but I can't use the features I need the most.",
Always works for me...great app. Shows results from tests as soon as they pop up.,
"This app has been excellent and easy to use so far. It has made viewings and sharing my medical history and treatment, across multiple doctors and Hospitals& Clinics, just that much easier than having to lug around a knapsack full of medical records. And show all pertinent info, including x-rays, MRI'S & other exam results at my fingertips. 😁👍",
Not happy the password will not work can't get in to it. I write them down and it will take .,
My chart is great. Gives you instant info about your visits and lab results fast. Need your doctor to talk to; just send a message thru My Chart and they respond within 24 hours. Thank you.,
"It's great if it would work properly. For the one Dr office that I can see it's great. I can't connect to any of the other multiple Drs I have though. It's been like this since I started using it. Also wished there would have been a family portion for your children/& spouse to connect and be able to manage. Now I don't really need it because kids are grown. Please fix connection issues. I can only connect to Mercy Health. So unsure what to do. I've done the usual uninstall reinstall, restart.",
Easy access for appointments medication refills,
That is the hardest app I have ever ever tried to use especially when you're older and you need to try to get your information it is very confusing,
"Login is very difficult. Making changes to passwords is a joke. For the most part, you can't get there from here. Once in, the info you want is there, but navigation is not intuitive. This app, and the desk top version needs a major cleanup to make it user friendly.",
"Be careful everyone. This app is embedded in the Privacy Practice form you sign. You are giving away your Rights. Once you sign, MyChart can share your information without your consent. READ. They do it Without Your Consent! I have made contact with the developer as requested. Though they take privacy very seriously, they don't actually administer their product and it's being used without consent. The guardrails are set by the hospital administration that purchased it.",
"The app is pretty easy to use. It's annoying though when I don't have access to results in real time. For example, my doctor leaves a message saying to make an appt to discuss results and I can't see my own results. Very frustrating!",
"Worthless! Every time I exit the app, it dumps. Next time I try to login, it gives me a ""Server is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later"" message. I then have to go through the password reset song and dance to access the app. Good concept. Useless execution.",
I love this app. It is a great tool and I use it all the time to communicate with my doctor and to keep up with my medical appointments.,
"Ok app but you cannot print from it, so if you are sent a report you need to give out, you cannot send it or print so have to screenshot then print",
Understand way more information reading than listening.,
"I love this app! It lets me know about appointments and I can communicate to my children's doctors through the app. My favorite thing about the app though, is that it lets me know when my son's lab/test results are in, and I can view them right from the app instead of waiting for his Dr's office to call me with the results. I also like how I can access all of my kids medical info within the same app.",
"This app is ad free and simple to use. Whether I go to quick care, the hospital, or my primary care I can easily look up doctors notes and visit summary for each visit. Schedule appointments, order refills. Even my test results from labs or x rays are here in one convenient place. Integrates with my Google calendar to remind me of upcoming appointments. It's perfect",
Great way to know your Health and Medical progress.,
My chart is easy to use as well as very convenient. I would recommend using My Chart.,
Like this alot . Keeps you updated. You can link.more than one hosp. On this acct. Saves me a lot of time. The only thing I wish somewhere on the app. It would explain better,
Very eady to use and shows all reports love,
"MyChart has been totally unusable for me, and is causing me constant problems getting and sending medical info that I desperately need. I cannot view or send messages, on my android tablet or phone. I constantly get a message saying a server error has occurred, try again later. PLEASE contact me to resolve this problem, there are refills I urgently need",
I absolutely love this app. It makes everything so much easier from checking in to appointments to checking lab results but I think the biggest thing is that I can communicate with my doctors through the ability to send a message to the doctors office and they can see what I actually said in my message. You don't have to worry about information getting lost or miscommunicated. You also have the ability to see and print notes and After Visit Summaries. This app is fantastic!,
Always works perfectly. The Federal and state governments should use this developer.,
Great website especially for appointments and communications with doctor.,
"I love my chart. It's a great way to have all your medical history/ medications in one place. I love that you can message your doctor, set up appointments and ask questions right from your phone. Its very convenient and easy to use. Whoever had the idea to make this app is a genius and thank you. Also you can link most of your providers as long as the care organization is compatible, which most are with the exception of some specialty offices.",
I love the app because my medical records are all in one place MyChart is so easy to use and I really like it a lot,
"Can't find anything, messaging sucks!",
"My only problem is when I go in to review test, I have to log out to be able to see other test results. Need a go back bottom so I don't have to log out to go back in to review other tests.",
"Hello, tech team! When I get referrals, I cannot read it, the pictures in my referral all broken small icons. Can it be fixed?",
"Great communication with my provider. Quick response. Makes me feel comfortable that I can get in contact whenever I am having an issue and get a response in a timely fashion. I dont like when someone in my care circle puts a note in the chart stating ""spoke with patient"" when I havent been contacted but that is not an app error that would be an institution issue.",
This is an easy way to keep track of your medical records and appointment s and things you need to do for wellness..,
App has been down and unusable for 2 days .. A message keeps Popping up saying we are unable to log you in right now please try again.,
"I don't know if it's the app or it's the clinics fault. I cannot make appointments or message anyone, it tells me, on messages options, to call 911 if it's an emergency. And the only appointment available is for a booster, but that's all. It's been happening since I downloaded years ago.",
This is trash. I'm so tired of useless apps that can just send the same info in a text or a email. Instead send a email saying I have a message that I have to log into a third party just to get the info that could have already been sent. Stupid,
"Very frustrated that notifications don't reset after reading. Printed test results & Dr. reports do not look official, & are missing important info. (patient name, when/where performed, ref. ranges, full Dr. report, ...) They are spread across excessive pages. I do love being able to msg. Dr. (ph. calls are too hard on me due to chronic illnesses) & see test results as soon as avail.",
I can't read my messages. It says there's an error in the server.,
"I've been using this for years now. Great to be able to see the results of scans, tests, and visits. I highly recommend using it.",
A really useful app to manage your health,
"The app basically works but misses a few features that still require a call to the doc target than app reliance. But most annoyingly it keeps forgetting that I set it to Touch ID (fingerprint) and it constantly turns that off, forcing me to rifle through my emails for the password. The point of Touch ID is to end the use of passwords.",
Sometimes slow to load but overall a great ap that keeps me on top of my appointments and makes communicating with my doctors easy,
"It's... Ok. The app feels like it was designed by people that don't actually use it. It asks me to update my information every single time I login, despite my info not having changed for years. It's obtuse to navigate. I can't decide if it was too much graphic designer and not enough engineering, or vice versa. Clearly I'm not the target demographic (I'm a tech savvy ~40yo). It's not like I have a choice in the app. I either use this, or not. :shrug:",
I can truly say that I love how my chart is set up. It's easy to use. The nurses and doctors are so nice respectful helpful and they really care about their patients.,
"The app works well but I could do without the same message it gives every single time I open it. Also, I forgot my password and my account was disabled after three failed attempts. I did not receive any warning that I only had three chances, or even one last chance to enter the correct password before my account would be disabled. Now I have to wait until tomorrow so I can ""contact my healthcare provider"" to resolve the issue.",
"In setting up routine appointments, this app is a true godsend! Previously used landlines to contact/schedule all my medical appointments; this eliminates all the long holds, automated selection times and documents the complete transaction. I use lots of applications in Apple & Android..and this one is, by far, the most helpful of all.",
The whole reason I downloaded this app was for the easier check in. That part doesn't seem to work. Even with GPS permissions and everything else. It still just tells me to go to the desk when I get there. So that's frustrating. Otherwise it's what it says on the box.,
"The information is nice to have without having to contact my doctor, I do really appreciate that... but having updated my preferences/notification/personal data three times now and still the notification won't go away is really annoying. There is nothing more to update, everything else is accurate.",
"I installed this app since my Physical Therapist suggested it and because they are severely limiting physical access to the facility because of the Coronavirus. Souns like a gread idea! I installed the app and answered YES to the access questions - My location, to my camera, and to my microphone... until it asked if it could have access (read/write/delete) to my photos and documents on my device.... Wait a minute! NO. I can see asking for access to my camera and microphone, obviously, and maybe my location, but WHY does it need to have the ability to look at my personal photos and to copy or DELETE them??? Unfortunately if you don't allow it access, you also can't access your appointment with your doctor or therapist. Please explain!!!",
"The app is great, but can use some additions like removing an office from the list, i.e., I have a company on my main page that I can not remove. I am also receiving an error message after signing in. Not all of my providers are shown for messaging and appts. Hence the reason for only 3 stars",
"Love love love this app. It's a great way to communicate with my care providers & to quickly access test results, notes & visit summaries. I like being able to pay my bills & check visit histories in the app as well. The organization of the app, to me, is intuitive & very user-friendly. It is SO refreshing to have an app actually do what it is supposed to & do it well!",
I love that l get the results of my test and appointments all in my portal and that it easy access to get into it .l give this app 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ recommendit to anyone that has this company,
Has potential but the interface feels wierd screen looks organized but lacks the positive flow of good app. I feel it would be easier to click on the part of the body that you need help with that way all options and doctors would be perfectly clear. Somebody with multiple doctors may find this app difficult.,
"Love this one stop shop. I am an employee and I am constantly telling patients about the benefits of having everything in one place for reminders, reviews, questions, and suggestions.",
"Everything is in one place. Everything I need is right in my chart. Easy to navigate. I can see the medical notes of my doctors and compare them to what was told to me on my day of visit. If I don't understand some medical terms or words, I can look them up in my heart. No tech problems or interferences so far. A great experience always.",
"This app is amazing! It keeps my healthcare team and myself up to date so easily. I can refill medications, schedule appointments, send messages to my providers, access my eyeglass prescription, view test results (new and old), add my appointments to my calendar with the click of a button, pay my copays and do pre visit questionnaires to cut down on check in times, it even tells my provider when I've arrived for my appointment via GPS capability. This app saves my life!",
It's clear and easy to use. If used correctly by Dr staff. The input of scans staff to my chart..is the most frustrating. Often report is scanned in correctly by the diagnosi center.. I do enjoy reading my reports and getting test results fast. All in all it's a great idea of service.,
Excellent experience. Great way to ask questions and communicate with my Healthcare advisors.,
"Always an alert to update my contact info, no matter how many times i try to save them. Messages that i have read and deleted, reappear the next time i open the app. If i leave the app while viewing a message, i start in the message with only reply and delete actions to leave it. Seriously, has anyone developing this actually used it, done any UX testing at all? Or is this another case of ""software company contracted to provide capabilities delivers minimum results for maximum billing""?",
"The app is not well integrated with the MyChart web browser program. All of my messages cannot be seen on the app. And in a like manner, tasks for worksheet input cannot be seen in a browser and only in the app. The programmers are not users and refuse to talk to actual users. They are used to programming cat videos and shiny objects, but don't know how to program a useful interface for the patients.",
"Nice to get information quickly, but it needs to highlight what the new lab results are if they are updated or changed. Many times I get notified of new results, but nothing new is listed so I guess something was added to a previous result. There is no way to tell what changed since nothing is highlighted afterwards.",
"Love the convenience of this app, but it constantly errors out and crashes which is really frustrating. Wont allow me to access certain features provided. Update: they seemed to have fixed some of the bugs as this app preforms alot better for me now.",
Great App that is easy to use and safe. I like that I can see an upcoming appointment and then add it to my calendar it makes everything easier for me. Also the check-in feature saves a lot of time. Still have to do the COVID questions but it is so nice to see all my information in one place.,
I love using my chart app to not only schedule appointments with my Dr's but also communicate any thoughts or concerns I have on what's going on in my life.,
I use this app a lot. It's so reassuring to get my lab results on my phone instead of waiting for a call. I like that I can message my doctor's and they respond so quick. Also helps me remember when I have upcoming appointments. So many helpful tools right in one app and never had any issues with the app.,
"So far it's okay, I'm sure it will only get better with time. I just wish I could link all of my medical information from more than just a select few offices. Having a centralized billing section for lab tests from covered lab locations, office visits, special services, etc., would be massively helpful!",
"I very much like the app when it works. When I try to set up bill payments, it errors every time, any card. Will not save information and says incorrect when it indeed has been entered over and over again correctly. Was hoping to not have to call to set up, but I guess I have to. Fix please!",
"I've been using MyChart shortly after it was introduced. I ❤ IT! It makes things easy & accessible..especially test results. Also, the fact that you look at your medical history with a few clicks. Being able to mesaage my Dr/team is great. I have always highly recommended this app to friends/family. It has never failed me..😊",
"App runs well. UI is clunky though, with poor organization. Many sections under the menu (i didn't count but maybe ~30-40) have zero content. Why so many? & especially unused sections? I ask my care team and they don't know. Most are not intuitively named either. Aside from the time i seem to waste opening & closing sections to find what I'm looking for, the parts I use often (med refill, messages) work fine. Glad Epic asks for feedback, though wish they weren't so slow to make updates.",
"I am unable to see itemized statements without formally requesting. I cannot access any paid or old accounts. I cannot click on a balance due and evaluate what the bill is, I can only pull up payment options Navigation of this app is not easy or user friendly. Meaningful use of your own data in healthcare should ensure that you can add or edit information, but I cannot. I also can't easily or readily access my full health history. Reports for lab trends suck I would give zero stars if i could",
"It won't let me even sign up! It told me my activation code was invalid, so I clicked on the link to get an activation code/sign up online, filled out all the necessary information, clicked Next, then the screen freezes with the Loading heart and doesn't do anything. I've tried 3 times now. I'd like to use this instead of the desktop version, but I can't even get passed signing up...",
I love that no adds within MyChart and no pop-ups. MyChart will notify you if it links you to information on a different site. Some applets my not give access or pass messaging to care providers unless you've been astablished as a patient. This protects care team from excess messaging. Drawback/negative is that the team has the ability not allow replies. The app is constantly evolving usually improving this does sometimes make it difficult to navigate.,
"I've had MyChart for months- finally got password changed due to new phone NIGHTMARE but no icon. I've tried everything I can think of, but I've lost the direct connection via icon. Getting this phone in and out of case is horrific,so I guess I'll have to go thru app settings to access MyChart-which contains my info & my dad's. O stars!!",
"I love the MyChart app. It is so very easy to use and extremely beneficial. It is very up to date with information on past, present and future appointments. It is very easy to access, convenient, on point and accurate when notifying you with any information that needs to be provided or relayed to you and in a very timely manner. MyChart app offers several conveniences that I myself find extremely useful as I assure anyone else who chooses to use MyChart will as well. Thank you for the app!!!",
"Previous app automatically displayed test results and Dr.'s notes. This app can't even seem to assimilate the data from the previous app and others, such as Sutter. I have been trying without success just to get it to display my COVID-19 vaccination status. Very frustrating.",
"Happy with the app since the update. Very helpful to have all information in one place. However, I am no longer able to make my co-pays thru mychart. I'm going to try Uninstall & reinstall the app to see if that fixes the issue. Since Covid-19, I prefer to do what I can digitally including checking in & paying co-pays. So this is kind of frustrating.",
"Besides a few hiccups with app timing out and being unable to view some imaging files, this app is fantastic. It's basically having access to your entire medical history, medical therapies, and treatment plans at your fingertips. It's been very helpful.",
"The app is cute and easy to use, but the messages tab shows only inbox. Patients cannot see what messages they have sent. Prior to this review, it was possible to see one's health issues under health summary tab. But now it's not possible. Having said the above, it is also imperative to mention that the response to messages comes too slow - it takes about four to five months to get a response. If I see improvement in the areas mentioned, I might do another review.",
Love this app. Small suggestion: automatic Google calendar integration. Although it currently does offer you the Option to add appointments one by one. This can be a real hassle😒 for somebody who taking care of family member and has multiple appointments in one month.,
"I love using MyChart. I feel it's an easy way to access my test results. Years ago you'd have to wait to follow up with a Doctor to get results. It does make easier for me, especially with having anxiety. That waiting period can be tedious!! Its a great app in my opinion.",
So far so good! My doctors have replied promptly to my inquiries and my test results are available to me as soon as they are completed! I like being able to communicate with my care team whenever I need to .,
"I have used this app for years with no problems. Now I get server error message and cannot access app. Sent email for help that said sorry send a screen shot or maybe it's your phone. Not happy with either of those responses. Seeing the reviews, I am not the only one. Will this be fixed soon? I hope so.",
It just works. That's the best I can say. I haven't had any issues where something didn't work as designed. Appointments are easy to schedule and see upcoming. Easy to precheck in for appointments and to see past notes. Easy to see prescriptions and dosages. Just a well designed app.,
"Wonderful, for the most part. Only I feel there is an important item missing, a journal to keep our medical, medicine effects, for the doctors ep see and monitor easier. I'd love to keep her updated this way on my meds. Especially when she is such a driver away. Other than this missing little tool, this app is very helpful in getting your results from tests and visits quickly.",
Awesome app but I have one question. My doctor now requires telehealth visits using this app. I just finished my first one and everything went great except for sound. I could barely hear him. He didn't seem to have the issue on his end and both of us had our volumes as high as they can go. What can I do to improve this? He did tell me some patients say the volume is really loud and I was straining to hear. 😕,
"MyChart app is constantly updating, which is a problem since it NEVER tells me it needs an update. Just says it's having problems connecting to the server. It can't give me all my medical information because it can't communicate with other medical institutions, yet says it does/can... And it keeps booting me out of it with no reason given. Update: Now this app isn't working at all. I try to send messages to my Doctor, and they never get them. This app is truly disappointing.",
"Good view of tests and appointments, but no ability to remove automatic copies of email sent to an authorized user. No block actions on messages, e.g. delete a block of email. Nor contact information for Support! No way to control notifications. I don't want reminders for my appointments, not email, not phone calls. Often the visit summary is not available on my tablet. Surprising in 2019 for an app of a major medical group.",
"Worst app ever. It NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED MY E MAIL ADDRESS. Continually read that it didn't match, even though I used the new password that was sent to me. Tried MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET MY INFORMATION, BUT WAS ALWAYS DENIED!!!!!! TOTALLY USELESS. Will request all lab results to be printed on paper and sent to me.",
"I am totally pleased with the information provided, test results, previsit checking, messages. The one thing that really irritates me is that when I get a notification, there is no way to know who sent it or what it's related to or who it refers to (myself or my husband). When I log on and search the site, it is still a mystery why I got a notification. Please fix that, otherwise stop sending notifications that can't be identified.",
"First of all, NO ads, YAY!! My Chart is super easy to use and very convenient for my son's health care. I really appreciate that all of his medical info, i.e. upcoming appointments, letters from Dr's, medications, etc. is easy to access from the app. The best thing about MyChart though, is that I can reach his care team quickly by sending messages--much easier than having to call them all the time!",
"Dumb errors, can't view TIF files",
"Great app. I have a suggestion for consideration..... It would be helpful if patients could also place reminders. For example, I need to have certain tests done in about five months before my next appointment. It would be great if I could have a reminder so I don't forget. Great app! Thanks :)",
"Easy to use. The only thing I was disappointed in was the payment portion to make steady monthly payments for my bill was not completed so now my Bill's went into collections. Only took 3 monthly payments then stopped. There was no warning, text alert or email... disappointed.",
"My Dr. just started using this system a few months ago...I can't believe how wonderful it is!! How in the world did I live without it so long?? I especially LOVE being able to see all my test results, plus get reminders of appts, etc, etc...it alerts me when anything has been added to it..best thing ever!",
"I've used MyChart/MyGeisinger for years and was thrilled when I got the email about the new app. I've tried repeatedly to log in and it keeps giving me the same error messages ""Username and/or password not recognized"". I quit. It's getting ridiculous. You can let me know when you finally get it right.",
"Great way to stay in touch with your docs and to keep track of appointments. Was a great tool for me as I navigated my cancer journey. One goofy thing - it keeps sending me notifications that I have a ""new test result"" and when I go in, it is notifying me of a test result from weeks ago!",
MyChart worked quite well for a while but then after a few weeks it had host server errors. I emailed them already with the problem they have not fixed it yet it's been over a month. I like the app when it works but it needs to be fixed and the website for MyChart works fine on the computer.,
I love using Epic. Such an easy way to keep track of my medical appointments and test results.,
This review is for this version and the spectrum health my chart. Both are good apps independently but when one health system is using both one at one location and the other at another location. Even though there is a way to link the 2 and essentially they are the same app I still can only do cirtian things in one app but not in the other. You need to make it all one app so it shuldn't matter what spectrum health you go to or where you go; if the hospital or network uses mychart. Fix this please,
"Being able to message my doctors directly from my phones and other devices, with the option of virtual visits is wonderful. Having my records easily shared with other doctors and family is a really great feature. I'm glad they are doing continuous upgrading and updating of this app to keep up with the growing technology of the world.",
"Great app, love it! Very informational, helpful, detailed, and also easy to use.",
"The problem with this app is you can't go back to look at the next chart. One is fused with Epic, that one you can go back and forth. The other, you have to log in every time you want to look at a different test result. For a phone app, it is not very user friendly. Just found out that this app blends with another MyChart. One seems to work fine, but the other you have to sign in everytime you want to go back to your home page. Kind of confusing.",
"TERRIBLE NAVIGATION! getting in the app is easy with biometric sign-in. once you leave the HOME (or any other) page to another page there is no way to navigate back. you have to sign out or close app, sign-in again. surely y'all can do better. add a BACK button on each page like the iOS app has...",
No question hands down it is 1 0f the best apps i have seen in a long time. I am Able to leave messages and get a response faster on my chart than I would have over the phone. There is absolutely no ads. The app i very easy just open the menu and everything you can know about you or their programs should you choose to even sign up for notices for the apps. This is good technology good team of ppl putting it together for us. Use it!,
It's really nice to have all connected network appointments and medications and conversations with doctors in one place! Only thing is some offices want you to call to reschedule but it would be nice for all of them to provide a way to do that through the app. One place we go to does but not all. Thanks!,
"MyChart is a very convenient and generally quick way to keep updated on medications, visits and test results. Very nice to have all in one place. But, getting the extra load Covid has put on health care workers, the response to inquiries from me to my providers is generally not very timely. One of my appts was cancelled, inadvertently by one of us, but no follow up response making sure was forthcoming. So now I have to wait 2 months for the same appt. That seems like a simple fix. Thank you.",
Love it helps me keep up with my appts and in contact with my doctor and my prescriptions are called in with no problem,
"FINALLY!! A SECURE AND RELIABLE ""ALL ACCESS"" APP FOR MANAGING HEALTHCARE!! Having medical records readily accessible via the app is fantastic. Linking accounts from different healthcare systems and providers in one place makes keeping updated a lot easier. My partner and I like the Friends and Family Access feature, because we can manage both of our accounts from the same screen. Managing medical care just got easier. Thank goodness.",
"Absolutely love this app. It is easy to use, way convienient, quick reponse times from care team , and the layout is attractive. It is always easy to find what you are looking for. Also, whenever i end up in the ER or go in for routine testing, I alsways know the test results WAY BEFORE the doctor informs me.",
"This the best medical records app ever! I use it for both my husband and I. We have all of the access necessary to keep up with NOT ONLY our medical records but also our past and future appointments. We can also set, cancel AND reschedule appointments. Not only that but I LOVE that I have access to my lab work results or X-rays before the doctors. It also reminds you of any medication refills. There is also access to past summaries of your visits and the doctors notes as well.",
"Very easy to use. Good for scheduling appointments canceling appointments and rescheduling. I've also done video calls with the doctor's office if you have certain symptoms related to covid. You can also review test results, medications, and review your visits with the doctor. Very nice app!",
"I want to rate this higher for functionality and cleanliness of the interface, but the integration of the App and the clinic system I use for my primary care leaves a *lot* to be desired. I've had too many cancelled appointments or delayed tests because either the staff don't read notes you add to your appointment requests or there isn't a simple ""Nurse Visit"" selection for ordered follow-ups that do not require a provider. It makes it so very difficult to recommend using this app as is.",
Nice to be able to see all results.,
I use to love using this app but ever since the last update or two it won't let me log in. Says some kind of system error. I have deleted it and tried to redownload it with no success. I have to take the long route and log in through the website. This is a huge bummer for those of us with medical conditions that require continuous communication with our doctors,
"I love having access to all my medical information, contacting my doctors by messaging, and getting to see my past and future appointments. However, on the app you can't navigate your appointments or test results like you can on the webpage. I want to be able to select past appointments only or only view for a specific doctor. As for test results, I want to see my history and be able to search/choose the criteria for test results shown. It's hard to compare current results with past b/c of this.",
"Normally would have given 5 stars but in the last year they redesigned the website and it's just not as easy to navigate to find what I'm looking for. I keep thinking, ""Oh, I can figure it all out later"" but never did. Months ago when I'd get a notification from MyChart & sign in on my phone app & there'd be no indication as to what or why they had notified me & I'd have to search all around the website to see why they'd notified me. But now they finally put those messages right up front.",
"Terrible service, I used it for covid test travel requirements and result page had NO useful information on it, it doesn't even have something as simple as first name and last name, DO NOT USE THIS if you need to get tested for travel EDIT: I found the page that I needed but it was hidden under print, I never even planed to print that page so I never clicked on print, I think it should be displayed as soon as you click on test result.",
"Update is pretty bad. I went to message my doctor and the space to type in and follow is ridiculous, now hard to use very tiny area. Had to scroll back to see what I wrote. Hit send then check the messages it doesn't even show I sent it . I hope you improve some of the info and not gone backwards like you did with the messages. Thank you for finally getting the doctors in alphabetical order at least, I wondered what took you so long.",
Great app probably the best one I have used. Very easy to use and love all the perks it has.,
"This app is so convenient and easy to use. Navigating through the message portal, billing, appointments (present and past), and medication information is easy and all readily available. It sends notifications anytime information changes, messages are sent or billing is available. We've used the feature to schedule appointments and ask questions to the doctor and both have been done seamlessly.",
"Really clear and easy to use. Makes medical easy, which is no small feat",
"Needs a ""home"" button or link on every page. Also, not a fan of the enormous icons that then shrink and move when you scroll down on the home page. On a positive note, it was very easy to confirm COVID-19 vax data and bring in additional history.",
Great app for all medical needs and questions on past care,
Notices for non-existent visits and test. Limited response options. Easier to ignore the survey then to try and submit it.,
All pertinent info is easily accessible,
"Works great, love how easy it is to use and the quick responses from providers! The greatest thing they could have made! Especially right now during the pandemic, I've found this app extremely helpful in so many ways. To refilling a prescription, to making an appointment, to an actual video visit appointment w your doctor, MyChart does it all!",
"No, I do not enjoy using this unnecessarily complex and clunky site. It is the antithesis of ""user friendly."" There is too much information on it, and the information you need is too hard to find. If you don't use the site regularly, the information and the means of navigating it will have changed. I'm sure there is a technology expert somewhere sitting down at their computer, and chuckling to themselves and feeling superior about how they are confusing the poor dupes who don't know about tech..",
"At first, I thought this was just another app nobody updated then when I explored it I was impressed. It's very easy to use & everything is with you at all times! Keeps me in constant contact with all my doctors, all the information from previous appts is available to you, & reminders of upcoming appt + tests I need to get. Can't forget that all my test results are found on there too! Also, whenever you have a question or concern it gets sent to your team & someone always gets back to you!",
"This is a great app. I am able to access my appts, schedule them, correspond to my care team, visits, health records, tests, on & on. Very easy to use & so much easier to use a 4 digit pin to log in than website. Notifies me immediately if I have new test results, messages, etc. Time saver!",
Excellent app that keeps your health records and progress at your fingertips.,
"Clunky, not generally user friendly. However, implementation and usefulness does vary with the Epic user institution. This app promises to replace the dreaded fax & phone, but fails to meet the crying need for better doctor-patient communication. And maybe too much to ask, but some level of interoperability with other (competitive) systems would help. Try connecting 2 doctors one of whom has Mychart, the other a different system. LOL as they say.",
"It works for me. I send mags to my doctor and read msgs from my doctor. Look at my meds, test results and refills. As for logging in I chose the pin option and it works great. No more messing around with ID and password just enter a 4 digit pin code and your in. ( you can also save your ID & password to your device). So if you're having problems logging the app, my advice is to chose the pin code option, it's faster and easier!!😎",
"Totally worthless. Keeps prompting you to set up a 4 digit PIN to login, then will not remember it for even 24 hours. Have to login using username and full password every time. Limited options even when it works, doesn't save test results for more than a day or two. Easier to just call my doctor! Uninstalled. Don't waste your time. My other family members have similar apps for their Healthcare providers that work fine. Wish my providers hadn't trusted EPIC....",
"The mychart app is pretty good once you spend some time with it. I feel connected to my practitioners and informed of my health status. I haven't used the on demand ""Zoom"" visit feature, but it's nice to know it exists. Overall, user-friendly app.",
"Easy to use, everything in one app, never had issues with app, never had glitch problems, easy to make or reschedule appointments, easy to get test results, can message with doctors directly, reminds you of upcoming appointments, easy to pay co-pay and bills, can do an EZ arrival 2 days before appointment so i don't need to do paperwork when i show up just check in, can check in from the app, ect. 👍👍👍👍👍",
"Long time user of the website. The ads for the app indicated it could do everything the web does. However, i cannot find how to filter test results for a particular test, nor can i see past results for a test. Significant gaps found within the first few minutes of use. Going back to the website....",
"Easy to use. Great to have access to your entire medical team, appointments, appointment scheduling, test results, and medical history at the tip of your fingers. Even more convenient if your medical team is part of the same medical network and you can't ask for better than Penn Medicine through University of Pennsylvania.",
"This app worked great to communicate with my doctors for the last 3 years, up until a couple of months ago. When I try to send a message to my doctor, the words are backwards, as I'm typing them, & extra letters are added in. I contacted my doctor's office via phone, & they said they have been receiving many complaints about this same issue from their patients, mostly Android users. The app is totally unusable to me, until it is resolved.",
"I was super worried about the app being too complicated. To my suprise, there's so many more features than I thought, AND it's super easy to navigate! not to mention I can talk to my doctor, see my lab results (even with no understanding of what they mean), and so much more. this app is a lifesaver.",
"Update: A year later, I'm still unable to add doctors to care team so I cant message them... This really should be a prioritized issue to fix. Does your PO even read these? The new UI is great, but having the app work is far more important than making it look pretty. Frequently has incorrect locations. Slow, doesn't show all your doctors (or have a way to add them). Also need to fix billing flow issues. Have a notification/how to navigate new flow since changed would be nice too. Get a new",
I find the app confusing. It said you have a new message but then i can not find it. I don't use my chart for every appointment and wish i could select more messages to delete at once instead only one at a time. It would be also nice to be able to open documents without downloading them.,
Unfortunately I use this all the time. Very functional and allows patient/provider interactions that is above expectations. Also acts as an archive for provider recommendations removing the margin for patient neglect or error. Somewhat lacking in intuitive layout but all in all a solid app.,
Very fast response to messages. Better and more thorough than waiting on the phone.,
"cvs insisted i had to have this app on my phone for covid test results. The exact opposite is true. No matter how hard i tried, which phone i used, browser or app, i could not download my results, only look at them. I had to use my computer to get a pdf i could use. Crapware & useless, except for possibly scaping data so cvs can spy on you.",
"This app seems broken. Just had to call my clinic to reset my password, then reinstalled the app, and still cannot log in. It tells me that it ""cannot connect to the server,"" and to try again later. I've been getting that message for 3 days now, so it seems like this is an issue the app team has very little interest in rectifying. No worries, it's just the only way my doctors communicate with me, I'm sure it's not important.",
"Having all my medical information in one app is convenient but the app itself is difficult to use effectively. My experiences: Logging on via email or web browser doesn't automatically open MyChart in the app. Depending on the day, the app logs me out or gives me an error message when ever I try to login using my pin or password. Attempts to open lab information often leads to an error message or getting logged off the app. I'm unable to make appointments or message a new provider.",
"I get a top bar and an empty white screen below. Updated the app and same problem. Still getting ""you have a new message"" notifications. Either the app is broken or the connection to the server is broken and it doesn't notify me of a problem. In either case, app is useless until fixed.",
"Easy to use, expedites issues and faster than phone (I hate talking on the phone). My providers and their staff are easy to reach and address issues in an organized manner. I look forward to future updates when more doctors and offices/organizations will be added.",
"I love this app. MyChart is the umbrella I need to keep me updated and all my information, appointments and anything that needs addressed under this one umbrella. I would have a hard time keeping what needs to be done and from who by when all organized if it wasn't for MyChart. It's also very easy to use and find my appointments and documents. Thank you",
"MyChart, the best, fast, and easiest way to schedule an appointment and communicate with the doctor/doctor's office staff.",
"It's buggy. It asks for my personal info to be reviewed and updated every time I open it. Since it's correct, it doesn't need changing. But it says an update is needed. The syncing between provider organizations is never correct either. The app acts like I exist to serve it. I can't add my own medical information, like a vaccine I got outside of the providers I use, which they couldn't provide me. It is ok as a messaging app with my doctors.",
"This is one of my favorite apps. All of my medical information is available anytime from prescriptions to test results (even historical graphs) to doctor's visit notes. I frequently communicate with my doctor using the messaging feature. It's very easy to navigate. Also, before mom passed away, I was able to log on to her MyChart to assist her with her healthcare. Great app.",
"I enjoy the app. saves some time. one thing is the summary after a visit never loads. So, I can't answer the questions. If I pay my bill a day early it doesn't go towards the month its supposed to... therefore putting me in a bad position. I guess I must specifically state it. I can't make to 2 payments a month on a fixed income. It wasn't till I looked at the app...that I realized what you all had been doing. I make my accts. on time. This one needs fixing.",
Best communication that the state of our medical development has come up with ever. Absolutely love this!,
"Wasn't working. When I opened the app, I got a screen that said No results found. I couldn't get past this screen no matter what I entered, zip code or St. Anthony East. Nothing worked. Update: Developer fixed problem so now I can finally log in. Increasing rating to 5 stars for now.",
Changes to this app since I started using it make the app more difficult to use. Finding ways to correspond to my physician and medical team is much more confusing. Finding info I am looking for in my chart is also more confusing. Instead of making it user friendly for patients it is a mass of confusion!,
I love this app. It gives me the closest thing to real time results as I have ever experienced. Whoever created this app is a God sent,
"A good interface, text easy to read for those with poor eyesight (such as myself). Adding inurance and information on appointments is easy, requesting refills for medication is quick and helpful. Receiving alerts and reminders is also helpful, especially if you have many appointments scheduled.",
Amazing!!! You easily access your appointments and see detailed summary of what was seen and discussed. Sometimes you are so nervous on your appointment that you may get a selective memory which then once calm you can check the notes. Also you get the results of your exams immediately on the app as well as your appointments history. I just love it.,
"I am completely new to this technology, though it does help in so many ways for everyone. Love how much access you have now to everything you want to find out. Back in the day it was a little harder to get your information if you couldn't afford a land line or if you didn't have a vehicle ya either hitch or hiked it no matter the weather if you couldn't get a ride from someone, as well I like the telehealth option as you don't infect other's.",
"Love the app. It reminds me of all my appointments, keeps track of all my medications so I always know names and doses, has all my lab results instantly! Well as soon as available. I can edit and add personal information and emergency contact information. Super easy to use. No adds or paying to use the app at all",
"I would gladly rate it 5 stars for simply existing! The convenience of keeping track of records and appointments is priceless. My reservation is about some hurdles navigating it. My main and huge problem is with the messaging: there is no Draft option. If you're writing to your doctor and need to leave the ""desk"" to go, for say,,double check a test result, u can't go back. There's several more issues I'd be willing to discuss in order to help fine-tuning yr app. Oops 500 only, call me!",
I really like it. It's great that I can set my own appointment. I love being able to contact my doctor with a message. I like everything about it!,
"Whatever you did to the last update, reverse it. I can't find half of my providers, I can't even send messages. This is making getting ahold of my doctors way harder than it used to be since everything is done virtually now. Please release a better update fixing this soon. It's been a month. Update: I emailed MCharts right after I left this review. They still haven't responded to my email.",
"I wish every medical establishment would participate in MyChart. It has been an absolute savior! I love being able to communicate with my doctor's office. From making an appointment to leaving a message for my doctor, the nurses, or assistants. I would absolutely recommend this app.",
"It works great for the most part, but still no way to send an attached picture in a message? My husband has MyChart through multi-care and he is able to do that. Also, I am not able to change the picture on my profile, that's disappointing. Also, 100% of the time I open MyChart, I get this message pop up: ""We are having difficulties getting data from your linked account"". I have no idea why.",
"The app is adequate. I would like to see appointment location information remaim visible for ""Past Vists"" in case i'm running late or need to reference it later. Better In-App feature support should be a priority instead of pushing a browser popup. If finger print fails to read due to network timeout i shouldn't need to kill/reopen the app to try again.",
This app makes everything to do with your health much easier. It is a lifesaver. You must use this app. It is the best tool I have for my medical conditions!!,
"Optional huh, very wise uh MyChart. The app is useful but limited and very much so.. I don't like the limited amount of characters (letters available to explain) when it comes to discussing my health. I'd like to document real life problems and also every ailment and I cannot. However, I can always schedule appointments and request my medicines. That's much due to pain that I run out. I'd like for MyChart to update and add an unlimited amount of characters (input) for the description of ailments",
"I love this app. I'm able to email my dr's with questions, request refills, make appointments, check the calendar for appointments, pull up my account balances and make payments. It sends you reminders for vaccines. It even has my updated covid vaccine records. The best part of it is there's no advertising from third parties. It's very organized. Rush Hospital is absolutely on top of technology along with other institutions who have this app.",
The customer service does not explain how it works or help you set it up or give you the proper access code. They repeatedly only send the link which you already have and when you click on it it makes you start over every time. There is no save progress area so even when you click there link it makes you enter everything all over until you get to the activation page which they have no idea how to do.,
Updates fast and let's u see everything on app,
"Worst app I have ever used. I've wasted nearly an hour trying to get a new password. It send me a code to my email, but then I can't recover the page in which to enter the code. Doesn't even give me an option to receive the code by text. This is a complete time waster. All I wanted to do was reschedule my MD appointment. Was WAY EASIER TO CALL!!!",
"I can't stand using this application. I can have full signal and also be connected to wifi, and it still will continue to load and then display a message to either try again later or to check my internet connection. Really frustrating when you receive emails for test results and can't even access them. I would much rather use FollowMyHealth. I never encountered a problem with there.",
"I've given up registering on the app, doesn't allow me to copy and paste the code from the activation email as it's split into 3 boxes. Then wouldn't let me paste a password in from my password manager. The website is unoptimised on mobile and all in all a pretty bad experience so far. I'll register on my computer and try to use it from there",
"I would give this app a thousand stars if I could, because this has been a GODSEND for me! With leaving voicemails on the phone system, it's usually at the very least, the next day for a reply, sometimes longer. With this app,I normally get a reply,at the latest, within a few hours! It's perfect the way it is, so don't change anything! 😊😊👍👍",
"Horrible app, avoid using if at all possible. El Rio SE Tucson medical trys to communicate with it. Sometimes it opens, sometimes not. You will receive notice to open MyChart because you have a message. If you can actually access the app, message or test result not there. May show up in a few days. History of meds, notices, test results sporadically available and often just disappear. Currently can not use the app to make an appointment since app lists my last appointment wrong.",
"App forces login every time, and will not allow LastPass to fill password, only username. App times out as you are thoughtfully composing messages to doctors, and closes without warning--and you lose everything. Test results show only one test at a time (website in browser shows current test snd option to see values alongside past tests.) A year later this is still true, except LastPass cannot fill in credentials at all",
At first I had no issues with this App but recently over the past 2 weeks it keeps telling me I have to update. Yet everytime I try to update an error occurs. I even deleted and re-download the app with no success. I'm hoping whatever glitch is happening it get fixed soon because it did make checking in for my college Covid-Test easier.,
"Sincle last update I can't do anything in app without error. I also can't get into web based portal in any browser. Chrome, Firefox, nothing works. So, during a pandemic, we can't communicate with our healthcare providers. Awesome. Not.",
"This app is being administered in a confusing way, it doesn't show any charges take have been sent to collections,as a rep said. Makes it very easy to to lose track of of any actual outstanding debt. It should show any charges that have been sent to collections, in addition to any current charges.",
"Can no longer use the virtual visit feature and misdeeds out on an extremely important doctor visit that needed to be rescheduled putting 2 weeks of delay in treatment and recovery. It was working just fine until I updated to the latest version. It will no longer allow connection through home wifi, only cellular data which I do not have.",
"This app is great- paperless, super quick with results and letters and everything stored in one place where you're not going to lose it. Highly recommend! The only downside is sometimes you'll get test results in before the Dr has communicated what the results mean, so avoid googling your results- it's always better to wait, especially if you're pregnant:)",
"Since the big update, it's been one big glitch and I have to use the browser anyway just to get to my different accounts. I always get error messages on every page. I missed an appointment the other day due to these errors. MyChart used to be what I wished all my providers used, but not anymore.",
"Nothing will load with newest update. I have tried to load appointments and it just spins. Tried to view upcoming orders, it just spins. If I try to even view my doctors, it just spins. I don't know why you would release an update without testing to ensure it actually works. Especially on a healthcare app. Please fix ASAP. Update 8/6: recent update made it worse! Emailed support with info about phone, OS, etc. It got worse, not better. Please go back to the version that works.",
I love the app and my chart website. However the recent change you made on messages is annoying. You made the sent messages part of a conversation thread. Before you could see the sent messages as individual messages. I prefer to see them that way. Do not like conversation thread. Thanks,
I love how easy it is to keep up with my care team!!!!,
"I would rate it 0, but can't. No integrations exist between app and calendar, so all steps are manual transferring information across two apps. In making an appt, it lists Dr names with no bio info, links to bio, or link to retrieve bio. Emails also require many steps and multiple apps to read. Obviously I'm most irritated having to jump to multiple apps to schedule an appt and then to confirm appt through email and then to put on my caledar. Developer should lose pay for anytime you have to cro",
"I love being able to look at my appointments, it schedule something if I need too using the app. To me it's quicker then doing it on the phone. Same goes for requesting refills, checking results and making a payment. It's an overall really easy to use app and I absolutely love it :)",
"I like this app for the overall functionality it provides in regards to obtaining chart information, vaccine/treatment results, chat with nurses/doctors, & it's ability to coordinate with other medical institutions in order to compile a complete overview of care up to date. Dislikes: the scheduling tool. It's nearly impossible to book an appointment at ANY location & does not remain up to date with - or integrate with - other clinic/hospital calendars & scheduling systems.",
"Clunky primitive app intended for the primary care doctor to use with the patient as a useless bystander. It's intentionally devoid of essential aspects for a patient to manage their own health; such as adding specialists, amending their own recorded history that is in error, or even ask the office a general question. This is a glorified texting app. Pretty much useless to truly track your health EXCEPT for the ability to see test results from physicals and nothing else.",
"It not always easy to navigate, especially from one provider to another. Password management is extremely frustrating because it seems inconsistent. It is TOO EASY to lose messages while typing them. VERY FRUSTRATING.",
Difficult to use especially when working between multiple providers. Contains absolutely no way for me to put in or communicate to provider covid booster information and so ends up getting redundant booster reminders on every provider page. This is 2022 I should be able to do this by clicking a box and not by making a phone call.,
"Meh. Integrations with clinics are kinda raw. Many are glorified web page lookups. The worst link to PDF's. Important bits like provider phone numbers are entirely missing. Imaging is completely missing. Doesn't have any way to dismiss in-app notifications or alerts. Even when I've actioned on them. Biometric login is clunky, should be an option to prompt. It's the PeopleSoft of healthcare; so generic it's meh at everything at best. Yay Epic.",
I love being able to see my results as soon as they are available instead of waiting for a Dr to get back to me. My charts make it simple and easy.,
"Updating my 1 star review because thankfully this app now appropriately allows me to message my providers in different systems, although still from different logins. That would be worth 4 states for sure. Unfortunately the notifications are still broken. For instance the app still reminds me to get a flu shot every time I log in despite me verifying my flu shot.",
"Pretty good app, it makes scheduling, seeing the test results and communicating with my health providers much easier. Some functions are not obvious, but it general it's user friendly. Have been using it for a year.",
"Very good application for your health needs, has many options and has a nice layout. You can Schedule an appointment right from the app, see your recent test results, renew medications and more. Pretty Simple to use and straightforward. Helps patients keep up to date with all their Healthcare needs.",
"MyChart makes life easier for me to keep up with my meds, tests, flu shots, etc...It gets better with every revision. I am glad that I can take screen shots of test results now. I have a traumatic brain injury and that helps me refer back to a picture of results. Thank you!",
"I love the application. It is easy to maneuver around and is always updated. I would like to see my vaccines included in My Chart. I have many shots (flu, teknus, ammonia, shingles) that were given by Walmart and only see the COVID shot. I love the reminders and immediate update of results. Application has been put together nicely.",
"I've had this app for 8months now, when a serious health issue came about causing me to accumulate many hospital stays and more doctor appointments than i can count,and i absolutely love it. I can honestly say that I would be lost without it and never would have been able to keep up, or keep track of, everything i have/had to do since my accident. Gave 5 stars but would have given more if given the option and would recommend to anyone with or without the serious need for health reasons.",
"MyChart is very helpful and simple to use. I have so much going on in my daily life that it's easy to forget appointments. Having MyChart right on my phone's home screen is a lifesaver for reminding me of appointments. Plus, any questionnaires that I need to fill out or other paperwork can be done with the app along with quick check-ins! I love this app!",
"Love the availability of my providers. Sadly it still has some deficits. Provider interoperability is still hit or miss. I find I have to constantly give medication updates regardless of what I do in my chart as they seem to never appear when I'm in the actual Drs office. I would love to have all my providers use one tool. Drs, dentist, therapist etc and be able to control who sees what",
"One bad day, otherwise flawless. Had an issue at the worst possible time, but devs worked to fix the issue within the day. Very satisfied in the response (I was quite irate given critical timing, they were more than polite) and the app in general, allows what medicine has been missing for a long time -- a platform to communicate with doctors and access to ones records, along with much more. Definitely recommended if you have any long-term condition.",
This app was great before update. Now I can't complete video visits with my physicians!! I have had to reschedule two appointments in the last 2 weeks!! Continues to read that there is no permission for camera and microphone Have checked the app permissions repeatedly and permissions are all listed. Very disappointed!! This is a major issue since I'm high risk for Covid-19!!,
"This app is user friendly and easy to navigate. Clear n precise. Easy to refill meds, make appts, chat with my doc, see lab results, get appt reminders and more. You can review after visit summary n pay fees in this app. Love it. It's all in one without the hassle of calling n being on hold waiting to schedule for an appt or to talk to a doc. Love the Biometric login so i dont have to necessarily remember my ps or username if i didnt want to. No ads also makes it ever better! :-)",
"Great way to connect with my healthcare providers and have access to all my information in one place. I would say the prescription refill/list system needs some updating, but other than that, all is pretty good. Oh, it also disconnects from apple health pretty often, in case you use that.",
"The app is helpful and I can quickly access information and leave a message for providers. One major problem though...I get notifications and when I go into the app to see what it is there is no way to determine what the notification is attached to, very frustrating.",
My health care organization disappeared from the My Chart app I installed. The last update made my chart not useable so I uninstalled & downloaded again. App worked fine for a day & then all my doctors disappeared. Updste: Thanks to the App developer for getting back to me with an answer that worked. The response time from My Chart was fast & professional.,
"NEW layout and format is TERRIBLE! Everything used to be accessible on the Home page and I could see at a glance if I had new messages, appts, letters, etc. Now some items require 3 or 4 clicks to find the same info that used to only need 1 or even no click at all. Example, Letters. Now I have to click Menu, scroll down to find Letters in the stack of items all jammed on top of each other, then click Letters. The new GUI design has taken many steps backwards. App was 4.5 stars, now is 0.5 star.",
"I love this app. Pretty simple to use, especially after the remodeling. I can navigate my way through it to find most anything I need. It's nice to have the links to reputable and reliable infortmation right there in the app. I can get info. on, why a test was ordered, whether my results were good or bad and learn a little about what I might expect next. Great app!",
"Always have problems with 'My Chart' App. Freezes up constantly. Must get completely out several times. Most of the time, I give up. Too frustrating! Not worth the Stress! Whatever happened to ""One-On-One""? Paper Medical Records? Computers & printers keep the records? Why not print it out? EASY!",
Simplicity in design and the information for the entire household is all right together!,
"Great way to stay in touch with doctors, see test results and schedule appointments. However keep having issues with MyChart getting data from linked accounts with other hospitals. No trouble switching over to that hospital to see their data, just trouble seeing their data while on other hospital site I am linked with. Overall a great app.",
"I keep getting ""donotreply"" emails pertaining to this app. The app, the emails and the entire ""health team"" are a one way, brick wall communication impediment. They're all too effective at reaching me but non existent when I need to reach ANY of them. Phone calls? Forget it. I called during business hours, followed the prompts, was told (by a machine) that no operator was available and promptly hung up on. This app is all about blocking, not communicating.",
"Very impressed with how well it aggregates accounts and data for all members of our family. Needs better support for various image types within test results. Some items can open on the web but not in the app. Other than that, great app.",
"It used to be much easier to see what's going on and upcoming. This last update changed all that. Messages can't be marked read. It notifies you that last week's visit is coming up soon. It still prompts you to set up flu and C-19 vaccines, even though I've had both and my boosters. This new setup is very annoying!",
This app worked fine until a few days ago when I started getting an error stating that it could not communicate with the server. I can still get in directly via the web interface but not through the app. Was a great app until this. I'm trying to access the Everett Clinic.,
"Couldn't imagine not having this app to manage my son's healthcare! I especially like how you can read detailed office notes from your doctor's appointments. Very useful for me as he has special needs and requires specialized care. The ability to message doctors directly is also very helpful. For me at least, this is a must-have app!",
The app is so perfect I can always ask none emergency questions and get an answer within a day or say. If I have a problem with my prescription I can easily send a message to my doctor and get the meds filled the very next day. Setting up an appointment is only a few clicks and the appointment reminder in the app is especially important. There is no other app quite like this one at all.,
"Liike how I can set communication preferences. Letters often go astray in the post, so pleased I could select the email/telephone option for communication. I had hoped that I could link all services together - this hasn't worked so 3 stars and not 5. A referral to GOSH resulted in need for 5 yearly scans. Had hoped I could link this info within the app for the UCLH who doesn't has this info, but that hasn't worked? Not sure why. Easy to use for most recent appointments though.",
I love this app. It makes it easy for me to keep all my doctors' appointments straight and easily adds them to my calendar so I don't have to check multiple places to see if I have plans. Then it also makes it easy to communicate with everyone taking care of ya!! I highly recommend this app for everyone!!,
"As a senior, I found it very difficult to figure out how to use this app. I waited one hour on the phone to receive help on how to be successful with this method of communicating with my doctor to no avail. I will just call my doctor at the appointed time and will forget the video conferencing call. I thought that I could use my computer which I cannot for this program. Much easier to use zoom! Very frustrating and immediate help not there for me.",
"This app really works well. I'm able to communicate with my Doctor, review medical records. 👍",
"The new update is not at all disability friendly. It's cluttered. The icons/colors are indistinguishable. The icons are placed in random layouts instead of grids or lists. It's visually overwhelming, it's difficult to navigate and it looks terrible.",
"Frustrating. The app will not connect if you are using a VPN for security. Once logged in you can reconnect your VPN and continue with the app. There is no help/support available within the app. It's fine for basic things, but lacking in some fundamentals.",
"Love this app but I got a new phone and can't log in to my account on new phone! It says send an email or text for code confirmation, I tried both since I still have my old phone at the moment, and no email or text will come so that I can log in, even though the password is correct. Very frustrating! I won't have my old phone forever and it's important to me to be able to see test results and communicate with doctors office.",
"App not allowing me to choose a provider. Cant get back into my account. App keeps sending me to the choose a location page. it keeps asking me for access to my location and gives me the GLOBE. I cant even put in the correct city, state and zip code. App won't even search after I enter info requested. I have uninstalled twice. There is no change. Please respond. I need to access my healthcare information. I don't feel comfortable going to a browser.",
"My Chart is user-friendly, keeps you up-to-date on appointments, test results and you can ask for prescription refills by sending a message to your PCP. Provides easy access to past and upcoming visits with access to visit summary/discharge instructions for each visit! Notifications pop up too!!! An excellent feature is that it synchronizes visits from other providers and hospitals you may visit, even out of state!!! Great app! Definitely recommending to everyone whose medical service uses it!",
"MyChart is a vital utility for communication between doctors and patients. It attempts to facilitate discussion by making test results available. It fails miserably because messages and results are not displayed in any observable order, and time stamps on them are entirely missing. There is no search function for results,and no eat to forward results to email or download in a useful format. It is an unfinished, and unpolished product affecting healthcare quality nationwide.",
"I like this app very much, except it continues to remind me of tests, appts to schedule, etc that I've already completed. It's confusing and annoying. You'd think once the test result was posted or the apor made that the reminder would go away, having been completed. The list of items ia tremendously long and I can't make any of it go away.",
Convenient.... when it works. Half the time you can't reach the server. That's not very helpful when you need to quickly access important information or respond to messages. Needs work. Even the new overhaul hasn't addressed old bugs.,
Convenient way to communicate with my care team.,
"This is a very helpful app, it gives me ALL the information concerning my health and medicine, as well as appointments. It also gives me the status of my appointment review with my doctor's, even if it was a phone interview, you're asked to answer a survey, concerning appointment, reminders of appointments . Scheduled testing, even if you're scheduled for a yearly appointment or to complete certain tests you have started. It's very helpful.",
"Love it get results early,can make appointments,and ask for refills so much easier thanks it's a great app.",
Love the convenience of this app. I can schedule an appointment while playing with my toddler. Best of all you can schedule at anytime and can view your medical records from anywhere. This is the reason I change back from another provider ..after trying their system for a few months I had to switch back to Mychart.,
"Love this app. Being older with plenty of medical needs, I find it simple to monitor my test results, medications, and appointments. It's especially handy for contacting my Dr with questions I have. Easy to use and visually uncomplicated. During the lockdown I have been using the app for vaccine updates, injection scheduling and information, general Covid news and updates. Most of all it has been helpful to communicate to the nurse/ medical assistant about prescription refills and other items instead of making and appointment and drivingin to the doctor. I have Three docs and Mychart has all my info in one place. I can't imaginenot having it now.",
"Despite the app being reworked and somewhat more organized, it is still slow and cumbersome. Old test results continually pop up as new, as do old read messages. Regardless of utilizing WiFi 5G, I'm reminded of speeds associated with the old dial-up modems... Needs improvement.",
Extremely difficult to log in on mobile device. Great app when you can get logged in.,
"The developers have done a great job creating this app - unfortunately the medical entities suck at asking for specific functionality. Epic provides no, repeat no interest in talking to patients, and don't listen to their paying customers as they have a large monopoly. As a patient I have no ability to ask for assistance using, or pointing out incorrect information as the only recourse it to talk to a doctors office (no help) or a hospitals billing office (no help). The first thing they say is they can't see MyChart, have no training, interest, or experience. Poor or no customer service. I go to three medical organizations, all with linked MyChart, and none synch data...so multiple confusion. Only thing that works is sending messages to individual physicians.",
Overall that the developers have been doing some updates like the chat feature which works pretty well. I believe that they need to look at other other programs out there and adapt them To this one to be a little more friendly usfriendly user as as an older younger 51 year old person I know that anyone above 60 or 70 would have problems with this particular application.,
"This might be the best app I have on my phone. It does everything I need it to do: tracks my healthcare, allows me to make appointments and put those appointments on my calendars, and allows me to message my doctors. New features are being added in ways that make sense, without making us relearn the app.",
"I'd give it 5 stars if I was able to clean up my home screen a little better since you can't dismiss most notifications on there. Otherwise, it's simple viewing style is appealing to the eyes and easy to navigate and stay in touch with my provider. I haven't come across ads, either (and I didn't pay for anything).",
"What an excellent app! I watch how so many struggle with their doctors and insurance about scheduling and so much more, but thankfully this app helps me to do it all! The appointment notifications and the patient provider messaging system are my two favorite features. How many of you have so many doctors and cannot remember their names? Well this app has a section devoted to you care team. Primary and specialist. Great Job! Oh and the app runs very smoothly. I've never experienced a glitch.",
"I find the scheduling, communications ability, and immediate test results, coordination of records super efficient.",
I love it. It tells me everything I need to know. It has all my lab results and my upcoming appointment and messages to.,
"Good app. I actually use it. More integration with the rest of the OS would be cool, for example, making the messages go directly into the SMS app and the option of automatically adding appointments to calendars. I particularly like being able to add multiple hospital systems.",
"Consistently difficult to login. Do I really need to try logging in 20 times every time I open the app? I wish I'm using hyperbole but I am not. It's always ""problem communicating with the server"". When I do manage to login it tells me some functions are limited and ask me to log out and back in. And opening each part of the app it tells me ""An error has occurred on the server. Please try again later"". It is painful every step of the way. I am using MyChart with Overlake.",
"on my PC this app is well behaved and useful. on my phone, it is not well behaved. cannot move from one routine to another. also, there are tons of appointment reminders, and these are cumbersome to delete. due to frustrating functionality, I am rating average, at best.",
"This app was GREAT before the stupid change. I can't access ANY of my records and it's super annoying and confusing. I get notifications in my email that things have been sent to MyChart but can't even access them. Please fix this and go back to what it was, it was significantly better.",
"Horrible, won't allow me to login in... I use the web version and it works perfectly.",
"Can't get help with problems in the app. Can't see messages I sent in the app. Unable to open some messages from provider, keep getting app shut down message, but provider is under the false impression that she has given me the information. Overall this app doesn't preform as advertised an can be dangerous to your health.",
"It is very convenient to check up on appointments, read reports, etc. However, we moved 3 months ago and I can't refill prescriptions through the app because it sends the request to my previous dr, not my current one. Very frustrating! There is no option to choose the dr",
On the old version I didn't have to enter password every time like on new version. Only problem entering password is I can on see letters and numbers for a few seconds. I would prefer to have the option of not hiding password as I enter it.I would be less likely to enter something wrong. Or have it to remember it instead.,
I enjoy having all my medical info at my fingertips; being able to chat with my health care provider & team without having to call in is awesome. The app provides an easy to navigate interface that resembles the full desktop website well enough to make it easy to flow from one to the other.,
Appt reminders and easy to submit for refills. Also so easy on look up test results or send message to my providers.,
"I can't even install this thing. It keeps saying it will install ""soon"".Caught in a loop. The app main page says ""installed"". When I click it it makes enter password I already established in signup process and then I get the previous mentioned message of installing ""SOON"". This app sucks from the jump. Im trying to access vital test results.",
"This app is great when it works. But in 9 out of 10 cases it shows the message ""there was a problem logging in with your username or password. Please try again."" And for sure there is nothing wrong with either of them because I can log in with same credentials just fine on the regular website. Please fix it. Thanks.",
"Used to work fine, now all of a sudden I keep getting server errors. I couldn't check in for my appointment today, can't look at billing, can't do anything without getting server errors. I've already done all I can to fix it on my end. Clear cache, data, log out, switch wifi, etc. It's not on my end.",
Very easy to use and very informative. Has all the answers I need and all the reminders I need. Two thumbs up,
"I am able to see multiple family records in the same app, keep up with vaccination records and appointments. My only suggestion for improvement is including test appointments at the hospital in the upcoming appointments, and the ability to not only change appointment dates, but also appointment locations.",
This app sends multiple notifications for each appointment. I have 33 appts and 77 notifications of those 33 appointments. Needs much work. If I wasn't receiving radiation treatments I would eliminate all use of this app. Every time I show up for treatment I get 2-3 notifications during the treatment. NOT HELPFUL!!!,
Server error issue: I keep receiving a server error msg every time I try to log into the app. It shows that there is a problem communicating with the server and for me to please try again. I've never had an issue with this app until now. I recently had a Dr's appt and I can't see any lab results or Dr's notes. Please fix asap! Thanks,
It is a very easy application for me to use. Im not overly tech-saavy and the application is simple. I like the option of being able to send my doctors messages after hours without having to contact the Dr office directly by phone and being able to access lab results. Over all a thumbs up for me!! 👍,
Everything I need to know at my fingertips about my entire family (with their permission) Super helpful that I don't have to call everytime I need an answer for something. Most of the time I know the results of tests ect before the doctor even calls. I can ask questions without having to make an appt or I can even use the app to make an appt. I can even link non thedacare visits to my chart so I have all my doctor in one spot. Highly recommend!!!! I honestly don't think I can manage without it!,
Love this app. Enabling me to make appointments or cancel them. Send direct messages to anyone of my Dr's. I'm able to check all my test results. Request. Rx refills. Literally just about everything. I can also find out what I need to do. Appointments to make [or] test to do. I use this app 3- 6 or 7 times a week. It varies. I do use it often.,
"The MyChart app is so very helpful for me and my family. I recently had a TBI and had to have an emergency Craniotomy. My memory among many other issues is so very bad right now. This app not only has a calendar that can remind you of every single appointment you have or had. You can view notes from your doctor visits, results from any test they have done. You can message the doctor if you have any questions or concerns. That's only a few of the many things you can do on it. I very highly recomm",
Great app to help with looking up when a visit is scheduled or a test! Great for looking up information too! Appreciate the app very much.,
"Would like to have a print option for documents or a save/download. Cannot see all of mychart on app, opens website in browser to show other options and documents. Never updated regularly or consistantly by all doctors... I've sent numerous messges for assistance, within MyChart regarding this issue for the past 2 years with no response...",
"This is a great way to handle Healthcare, my access to information and providers is very convenient.",
Good app overall. I'd just have the recommendations of being able to bulk select messages for either read all and then delete the selected messages. Sometimes i get hit with over 600 messages about test results and having to select one by one takes too long. Would also like to change email settings so i don't get emailed and notified. Just want one notification,
"Great app. I can request medication refills and do all types of other useful things right in the app... without having to call or visit my doctor in person. This is a very useful app to connect you with your healthcare provider team... nurses and doctor included. You can also check your medical files, medication lists, and after visit summery from your doctor. It's a really great app to have to stay on top of your medicinal needs with your healthcare provider team. It has lots of useful tools!!!",
"I absolutely, positively LOVE MyChart! This app is user friendly too! My questions are answered in record time. Instead of holding on the phone to speak with,I can schedule an appointment anytime just by opening the app. I currently have 3 doctors offices linked which is good for my providers to see my health history. I can attach needed documents and see future appointments I need to schedule. My grandson is also linked. MyChart helps me to manage my health easy and conveniently at a glance!",
Zoom links crash app. Another huge annoyawis the notifications that pop down from the bell icon in the upper left hand corner. They cover the appointment icon and every time I try and go to an appointment the notifications pop down right as I'm clicking on the appointment button so it takes me somewhere else. The notifications about alerts on the website for my kids is impossible to dismiss even though I have checked many times.,
"Being able to have access to all my medical issues, appointments, billing etc is great! Having the ability to contact any of my doctors for appointments or just general question without having to go in or call in, which both take a lot of time. Every message I have sent has been responded to in less than 48 hours, mostly within 24 hours. Having a lot of medical issues and many different doctors, this app makes the process so very much quicker and easier!.",
"It utterly sucks. They changed it and it is clunky and not as good as it was. It has regressed into something that looks like Facebook back in 2010. It is so bad I would delete it if I could, but i can't because this is the app my doctor's office uses so I am a captive user. I wish I had the power to revert it back the way it was. Bad job app programmers.",
So helpful. I have some health things that mean i need to see many different doctors frequently. If i didn't have this app it would be really impossible for me to keep track of everything and be able to see test results quickly and have them so all my doctors can see them. It's definitely one of the best and most used apps on my phone.,
"This app isn't good but I honestly expected it to be worse. For a healthcare app I expected something completely unusable and basically never loads, but this at least it usually loads. It has some really stupid quirks like begging for your emergency contacts home phone even if they don't have a separate home phone number, because nobody does anymore. It's also not easy to navigate, but if you bang your head against it enough you'll usually find what you're looking for. Low expectations...",
I absolutely hate this update. I used to be able to schedule an appointment with my actual doctor but now the only option is to schedule a virtual appointment with some stranger for the current day and only after 7pm. I don't know if this is the app's doing or if this is Meritus' bright idea. This change is very inconvenient.,
"Don't know what I do without it BUT it's not entirely easy to navigate and some of the organization doesn't make sense. Also, it's unfortunate that I can't easily have all the kids under one account login. That being said, I'm totally addicted to this app; I know things sometimes before even the doctors do - it's great. My favorite part is logging in on my phone and one tap adds the appointments and procedures to my calendar.",
This app has been very helpful in reminding me of upcoming appointments and keeping track of my health records.,
"This app gives me a ""no server found"" error message. I've been trying to get it resolved for the last year and unable to get technical support assistance. I've been sent between Grady Healthcare and Morehouse Medicine; each one says that the other facility supports the software. I'm having to change doctors because I can't communicate with Morehouse Med. via the app nor get through to anyone by phone.",
"App is ok. I find it easy to use. The constant ""update your information"" is annoying. With that said, it had the convenience of being able to make payments via the app until recently. Now, unable to scroll down in order to complete the information needed to process the payment.",
"Have used this without a problem for more than a year. More than a week ago the MyChart android app stopped working. I can no longer log in. This fault persists despite uninstall and reinstall. No update is offered. Accessing MyChart through my hospital's website has also stopped working. Trying to log in yields the message ""connection is not secure"". Wondering what is going on, and why.",
"This app does not remember my passwords (even if you check the ""Remember"" box), nor will it use my stored passwords for access. Since I have more than 500 active passwords, I can't remember them all and this forces me to put a sticky note up on my phone with my MyChart passwords on it (one for each of my medical groups) if I want to use this app. This, of course, would be a serious security compromise. The app seems to assume that everyone uses and remembers the same password for everything, which is also a serious security compromise.",
Very useful I like that it lets you know about your appointment and what it was for and that you can be in contact with your doctor!!!!!,
"the old version showed limit ranges of test results this new updated version just shows the results i am supposing the numbers in red are either too high or too low. i wish i was able to revert to the old version...yay!!! i can now see my test results clearly as before. thank you, ten stars for this app.",
"It is a great effort, however, most people f the functionality is broken. The apps goal is to seemlessly pull all the diagnostics, details, report, test results, appointments, messaging etc. But most of these functionality do not work and the support is clueless and will keep asking you to reach the providers, system support, etc. And one never gets and answer as why the reports are missing or not displayed, the providers say they see it in their systems and to call the systems support. SOMEONE?",
I love having an app that I can see the MyChart accounts for different healthcare systems. The menus need improved upon as it's difficult sometimes to find what you want. It should be easy to go from one section to another without having to backtrack to the main menu.,
Easy to use and really convenient. It's like a calendar for all the updates on your health. Keeps tracts of appointmneys as well as display result and personal info. If you need to change your address or insurance its really easy. Like the app overall.,
"I appreciate the concept, but this thing is a nightmare to navigate if you have multiple providers. Needs single sign-on capabilities so you don't have to log into each. And a single overview of all of your care team without having to log into separate entities.",
Fairly straightforward compared to similar apps I've used. Quirks like startup shows login screen requiring choice for biometric or password even though choice is stored by app. Insistence on putting news bulletin over homescreen after login despite a notification option. Minors. Annoying. It works - like a committee designed ap usually does.,
My chart is great !!!! I have results and scheduling at my fingertips . I really love it !!!!!,
Love this app it makes it so easy to get in touch with whatever DR or nurse you need. Making appointments and getting medicine refills are a breeze on here.,
"5 🌟concept 3 🌟optimistic over what a fully matured app might be. 🔑 Connected records! important tool for our medical teams across all the services we choose. 🔑 Medical records to be secure, no blanketed add on permissions, to the point of distrust. 🔑 Keep it simple, safe and live RT I was recently in hospital and transferred to a different hospital and while this critisism isn't about the app the previous hospital had not updated the data. It should all be seamless.",
"For the past 3-4 weeks, I have not gotten anything to work on this app. I get the perpetually spinning wheel and nothing (no matter which wifi or device I'm accessing). I've  uninstalled/reinstalled it several times in the hopes that it will resolve its issues. Alas, such has not been the case.  Before this, I would give this app a resounding 5-star review.",
"It's absolutely wonderful having 1 app where I can view everything about my doctors, along with my son's doctors and lab results, etc. I typically lose any kind of paperwork, appointment cards, and important phone numbers on a daily basis. MyChart allows me to keep all our records in order, in one easy app without me losing anything. Great job, thank you.",
Does not allow the use of password managers or biometric unlock. Basic stuff guys.,
"Ever since the most recent update, I am unable to log in to any of the services through my chart, repeatedly getting a ""Cannot connect to servers"" error. I use this chart for scheduling and managing not only my own Medical services, but those of my children, making this sudden and unexpected error exceptionally frustrating and inconvenient!",
"I do not care for this feature at all! Four entries popped up over a week ago, two for a supposed ""visit"" with a nurse I have never heard of & two for a doctor with whom I have nothing scheduled. The doctor does not show anything on my account from her end so all I can figure out is it is a mistake. When I call the My Chart Help desk asking the entries be removed, they say they can't remove them. On the entries, I am not given the option to cancel or delete them. It is so frustrating to imply something is scheduled when no notification included me in the decision making. No dates or any indication as to what they refer. I am getting ready to remove the entire app due to the incompetency of the product. Carla R. Brockman",
"This app would be great if it were more consistent. I get notifications of a message, but can't see them due to a server error. Test results are the same way or it never opens. Very frustrating when your info is on there and you can't share with Dr's who aren't on here.",
Great app to have if you also have a doctor that is efficient. This app allows me to request refills while I'm at the pharmacy and my doctor is great always on top of things. The app allows him to send the refill right to the pharmacy. I can schedule appointments and check my records from multiple facilities. Glad I have this app so much better than waiting on a receptionist and doctors to call when they have so much to do already in a busy practice.,
"This app used to be useful with the exception of not having access to video visit notes causing users to have to log into the provider's website portal. However, they recently removed an important (in my opinion) feature. Past test results which allowed you to see results to compare was removed. I have periodic bloodwork and having those numbers available for monitoring is needed. With it gone from this app I now have 0 use for it beyond it being needed for video visits. Going back to website.",
"Suddenly a linked epicmychart account is missing.. along with my shared log on. Infact, all dissapeared except Pennmed..other not even in Discover. The format moving from one account to another has changed. It didnt need fixing..now it is muddled, mixed & confusing I can no longer enter individual accounts or have on home screen but must go thru' one central(no choice which). Epic complete take over. There is no way to edit careteam errors. Sometimes, apps don't need updating.",
This App is so easy to navigate. It is the best that I have used so far. It's quick to access and very easy to navigate through. All of the details of your visit and what your Provider ordered is available. The Provider Messages is the best part. It takes away all of the frustration of leaving a message and having to wait for a response. What has taken many hours and even days to get an answer (at past Providers/other clinics) is now resolved in a short period of time. I absolutely love this.,
"Absolutely love MyChart! Linking all accounts under 1 username/password helps access medical records/information for my entire family. It's so much better than trying to keep track of several usernames & passwords. Also the app notifications for appointment reminders/confirmations, e-checkins, profile updates, test results & billing features are awesome, very efficient.",
"Appreciate the access to so mich of my info. Siggestiins fir improvements include a logout button on the home screen so I know my info is secure. The update info goes way to fast to be read by many people theregore it does us no good.. i really like that it shows a number on the icon when new info apprats pn the site and I would like to see coordination between My Chart and Mu Care, to show appointments for both and correct medications when changed on one sight it would correct on tbe other.",
"Love my chart! Just wish it would load everywhere, Facebook does, seems to me this would be more important. Otherwise this is Great app and easy to navigate. Can see test results as soon as they are loaded. Easy way to keep up with appointments past and future. I found out I had cancer in April and the appointments would have been crazy to keep up with but with my chart, I can see when I need to go for chemo or radiation, labs, port flushes. I've had no crashes just slow or no loading.",
Brilliant app. Helps me access my information and appointment dates and timings so easily. A Brilliant tool!!,
"This electronic medical record system is the best one of the 6 to 8 that I've used. It is particularly good because of the choices UW Medicine made: Everything is available on screen; access to care providers is direct; notifications are prompt (and actually take you to where you need to be, rather than dumping you in the general area).",
"Such a convenient way to see all your health information. So many details are viewable and you can update any if needed. I like how you can send a message to your healthcare provider through MyChart since sometimes it can be difficult to reach them by telephone. I like how you can view and complete pre-visit paperwork and questionnaires which saves time and paper. I also like how you can check in through the app when you get to your appt so they know youre there. Amazing, convenient, & modern",
"It has a feature to link accounts at separate health systems so you can ""see all your information in one place."" It doesn't work like that. When you log into one, it puts a button on the home page to go to the other. Click that button and it'll open your other mychart account IN A BROWSER instead of the app. Not useful. Android user",
"Depending on your provider & how they currentlt use this app, is EVERYTHING. It can vary w/ experience in navigation, layout, features & tools, all based upon your provider & clinic design; Altogether though, it is good technology & more simple than ever to access yoir personal information, appointments, medication history, reminders & accessing important data, +plus messaging! This would be even better if C.S. medical personnel, would activate & use the ""Remote Check-In"" feature !",
"The app tries but falls short. No menu section where you can go between your health care, settings and preferences. You have to use devices back button and that does not always go smoothly. Tried to add another provider. said I had to contact then to sign up. No prob, but when I tried to add a 3rd provider, Icould not get the option. just kept bringing me back to the 2nd provider. I unlinked the 2nd provider, but still no option to add another or delete the 2nd provider. This is Amateur Hour.",
"difficult to use now. it's a confusing mess! now my test results for 3 mouths are missing. Developer, I sent an email and no reply for 4 days so far. told it is proverbs, but all 4 was missing tests? one star for trying to delete my previous comment. app hangs when I try to read /send messages. worked great before. what gives?",
"Honestly this is a great app. It helps getting ahold of the doctor's office without the hassle of having to call, be put on hold, wait, stutter on my words, all that. I can set up appointments, get my test results back, read them for myself, and can still talk to my doctor after the appointments too. This is seriously the best idea for an app, I don't know why more places don't use MyChart. Handiest damn thing I've used in a while.",
"Instructions for virtual visits mention a way to check hardware, but the link doesn't exist in the app. Navigation is clunky and counterintuitive. Test graphics/scans can't be displayed in app. Communication options are nice, but don't make up for other issues.",
I love my chart. So easy to see each kids porfolio since they were born and easy to set up appts.,
"The majority of the app works great. I love having all my information and tools available so easily. However, I needed to conduct a virtual appointment and wasn't able to because it requires my phone number to be verified. Except I've been trying for months to verify it and the required text never comes. Please fix this!",
"It worked well on my iPhone and I liked it. But now, I have an Android. The app opens in the Android phone but after entering the digital ID and password, nothing is displayed! Tried in another Android and it doesn't work! Of course, I found out that it works on iOS. Any remedy?",
UPDATE: Turns out that the facility created multiple accounts for me so that's why the info wouldn't show up. I would recommend that if you have info problems ask someone at your facility they gave me number of help desk and was mostly working within that hour. Repeated failed to connect errors. When it does connect there is absolutely no info what so ever available.,
"It would be better if you made adjustments on the test screen. I have to go to Google and pull up mychart because I want to see previous test results and compare the results. I am offered different methods to use (past results, graph of past results) It is also slow on showing updated info. I have to use Google again. I like the method used for logging in.",
I have mixed reactions to MyChart. I think it is over used by some providers and at times is unclear about messages and test results. I receive too many messages and repeat messages. In addition the Covid Letter process rarely works for me. It allows me to access it only once and then deletes the Letter. Strange system.,
Very cool app...started to keep track of my flow as I was getting closer and closer periods. Like only getting a break for maybe one week a month...my only complaint is there are alot of options like to chart your moods and feelings...it can be like going down a rabbit hole. Overall it does what it should...I wish there was a notification letting me know a few days in advance when flow is coming. That'd be amaze.,
"I like the app. when it's working. I've been trying to update my Covid vaccines in it, but I have been getting system error messages for the past two-three days. I got my vaccines in one state, moved, got my booster in another state, but cannot update and of this information in MyChart. Otherwise, it's great for reminders and when the doctor's put in the information needed.",
"Great app. Improved dramatically. Everything right at your fingertips. Very informative and personalized, and even fingerprint login for faster convenience. Can't speak for anyone else, but I'm very appreciative of the thought that went into it's design.",
Easy access to your appts and test results.,
"The app is great, but the communication between the hospital check in and the app needs some work.",
The app makes it very easy to get information as well as give information. Plus you have your complete history at your fingertips if necessary. User friendly. This is a well-thought-out application from its developers. I highly recommend. Thank you for this My Chart app!,
This app is extremely helpful for me as a patient keeping two-way communication between myself and my care providers and my care team it is essential it has all my meds I can see reports and x-rays follow up notes upcoming appointments and I can share that externally with whoever I choose and it's great as a reference to follow up on so I never have to worry about remembering everything it's all right there and it's very helpful and always up to date truly a great resource!!!,
"I have tried multiple times to canceled or delete two E-visits scheduled in 2021 which never occurred. I got better and no longer needed the e-visit. I cannot delete those events from your software. I called the doctor's office. I called your hotline, your technical support and no one seems to know how to do it. It's annoying.",
Brilliant easy efficient to use so easy,
This app makes it so easy to reach out any hour night or day and get a response in short order and asking for specifics as well as the ability to send photos so the doctor can see exactly what you mean even though you are not in their presence. I am too happy with it and recommend it to anyone and everyone that is considering using this media for their first time. It makes all the difference for me personally and they even updated this app making it more user friendly not that long ago.,
This app is wonderful for keeping updated on your medical formation which includes results as well as appointment information. There are a few options that for some reason did not work for me which is the Rx Refill which if it did would have been an even better experience but however was a no go.... Everything else works fine and easy to navigate thru the app and is pretty self explanitory.,
"New and improved???? NOT! App has no back buttons and once you get into one of the links you have to completely close the app, then log back in just to get to the supposed shottcuts. Waste of precious time and not worth the effort to use.",
Very easy to use! Very convenient!,
You can't even get through to anyone any of the time or the system is not working properly.,
I have never been able to get test results just appointments,
It's nice being able to see all the notes they take at your appointments & changes made to your medications + it shows all your upcoming & past appointments & where they are located. It may be a little difficult learning how to use it & where everything is but I like having my meds list available at the click of a couple buttons.,
I can no longer access the bill pay area from within the app. I have always used the bill pay to pay the bills. But all of a sudden I constantly keep getting an error message unable to something like that. But the bottom line is I can't access it. Thank you. The issue has been resolved and am able to access bill pay.,
"Update: I was contacted about checking with the mychart support team via email. They then responded, asking if my stuff was up to date, and then I could call a number if that didn't work. My phone is up to date, as is the app, it was the first thing I checked. The point of an app is convenience, I will not be making a phone call, thanks. I will leave my one star review. ---‐- I am able to log in to the website, but the app keeps telling me my login is wrong, so I am unable to log in to the app.",
I love this app! It shows test results before the doctor is able to call you back and it keeps track of everything (as long as your doctor is using the mychart software)! It will even check you in once you show up to the address. You can even communicate with your doctor or the staff for upcoming appointments or rescheduling. It's definitely a game changer for me!,
"It's great and horrible at the same time. Great info if you can just get to it. Every time I try to see messages and letters and more information from Drs and everyone I get the following note instead: "" ERROR ON SERVER. INFORMATION CANNOT BE SHOWN RIGHT NOW. TRY AGAIN LATER."" Well later doesn't help either. Maybe once in a hundred times. Please fix this or give me a number to call.",
"This app is fine with me. App let me leave messages to my doctors, look at test results, when my appointments are, look at your meds list, etc. I linked my account with another hospital I go to & no problems there either. Only thing is having to e-check in on every appointment. That's a hassle.",
"Provides excellent information about appointments, test results, and directions to doctor visits, and allows me to check-in through the great portal.",
Worked extremely well while hospitalized for a week in November and relied on it to track daily test results. Was a huge fan. Since last update it does not work. Just a blank screen. Using it in Alberta Health Services. Please fix this.,
It's pretty meh. Does it's basic job but it would be nice if i was capable of adding or even looking up several of the different care providers in my clinic especially if I'm looking to schedule appointments with different specialists like a dentist. The Followmyhealth app offers this function tho it's not linkable to my current provider which sucks.,
Easy to use all information is in one chart you can see results of test and not have to wait to see the Doctor ask questions and so much more Thanks Baptist for MyChart,
"Completely impossible to sign in. I forgot my username, and every time I need to sign in, I can't. I tap on ""forgot username"" fill out all the neccessary info, and wait for the follow up email. But after 20 or so times, I haver NEVER gotten that follow up email. Having My Chart, but not being able to use it, is as useless as a third nipple in the middle of my back.",
Easy to use. Information is available quickly. Quick responses to questions,
"A useful tool for communicating with your health care providers, keeping track of appointments, and of your lab results.",
Very helpful with keeping track of my appointments!,
"The messages of what is going on,is always their in text! Only problem I have sometimes,is that it would be nice if their were a medical dictionary to explain some of the medical abbreviations,and definitions of corse,for a person that has no doctrine in medicine; it can be a difficult task without a medical dictionary of some sorts! Other than that you all have done an amazing job with the app.!( Thanks!!!!).",
"Pretty detailed and helpful; however, I don't like being unable to clear certain prompts, reminders, and/or suggestions which I don't want to use or sign-up for (paperless billing, etc.). If I don't want to do that, I don't want to continually see that. I may overlook something new and important because it gets lost amongst the other things that won't go away.",
"Incredible, updates sometimes lag barely, but imagine not having this and being left to wait for a letter or maybe a phone call, the world wide web can be such an amazing opportunity and powerful expansion as it continues to enhance Our Lives with information at the click of a button. So kudos to all the people who take the time to enter this information it just doesn't happen by Magic and kudos to my care team and my doctor Yancey Sloan at Virginia Mason Franciscan top notch",
Doesn't work for sending messages!!!!!! Somehow it fixates and totally locks in on one provider and steadfastly refuses to allow you to choose a different provider or to CC another provider so as far as looking at a lab result it is satisfactory as if you could decipher what the result means but for communicating with Providers this App is worthless and its description is very misleading!!!! Further absolutely ZERO ability to contact anyone for Help or any FAQs. So to me its a scam!!!!,
"Happy with the app...but it would be nice if I could send PDF files to my doctor. Most of the monitor apps export reports to PDF. The only problem is I can't attach them in messages, only pictures. Make it a huge pain to screen shot everything.",
"This app has been a game changer for our household! I like the access to both of our children's information all in one place. Scheduling appointments has never been easier and the reminders are helpful, but not overbearing. Havent had any technical issues with app, thus far.",
"I installed this app. Then, while scrolling to find my provider I accidentally touched a different one which then ""became my provider"". True, I could add more and then choose each time which one I really wanted, but I decided to uninstall and then try again. But then it happened again. And again. And again. All this because there's no obvious way to delete a provider or a simple question like ""Do you want to choose X as your provider?"". I'm certain I'm not the only one thus frustrated.",
"MyChart is so convenient. It's super easy to navigate. It has saved me so much time, not having to call the office. My health history, upcoming appointment information, test results, reminders for upcoming tests needed, and more are literally at my finger tips. I also can pre register and check in for my appointments online, saving even more time.",
"This app is almost mandatory for those w medical issues. However it is set up so annoyingly that its not even funny. When make an appointment not only does your provider call, you this app is set up to message you over and over letting you know about the appointment and you can't turn it off. So you think it's something important like a doctor messaging you and its not its this app being so freaking annoying and misleading its not even funny. Add a feature that turns that off or ill delete!",
"The App is okay and works but it seems the navigation is a bit awkward although I do eventually get to where I want to go and/or find the information I'm looking for. One specific complaint I do have is that I have this persistent message as soon as I log in telling me to update my Contact Information. No matter what I do, Edit, re-enter the same information, Save Changes...etc., the message won't go away. Apparently I can't make it happy with the Contact Info I've supplied.",
I love MyChart! It is super easy to get in touch with my medical team for everyone in my family to make appointments and request refills or just send a message to my nurse. All my appointments are conveniently in one place and I can set reminders to my calender so it's easy to remember when to get ready. I have access to all test results and records and after visit summaries all on one app. MyChart is a lifesaver! If there's one thing that makes life easier it's THIS!!,
Its great if your doctor loads the stuff up i had to try and log into a different provider and it doesnt allow me nor does it allow to contact for assistance. I tried to reset passwords ect trying to make it work and i never got the emails. The original organization everything works. Somehow my test results are divided on different companies on here. Its so annoying to not have access or direction when you should be able to see it. If it worked perfect i would give it five stars.,
"App is easy to use. I do miss looking at lab results in chart format. One suggestion: I see several types of doctors, who are with different hospitals. This means the app suggests the same screenings from different places. I would like to delete the duplicates.",
"Easy to use, and very accurate.",
"Using my chart is so easy to use, easy to re-order prescriptions, and alot of information at your fingertips tips.",
I love being able to see my results right away and also being able to message the doctors with questions I have,
"I love mychart, it makes scheduling apts, doing video apts, getting test results, getting Rxs, and everything really easy. Thanks to mychart. It gives access to multiple care providers in the same app; both of my children are covered and have files within the app. It's really great, I think. I would definitely suggest it for anyone.",
"I love this app. I am dealing with a very serious illness and this app has all the info I need for talking to my Dr. Scheduling appointments. Seeing my test results, my medications...etc. it is EASY to navigate. It has never glitched on me even once. I have done several visits virtually with ease. It doesn't mess with my phone or cause any issues. This app is a MUST for anyone going through anything with their health.",
"I successfully used the previous version but was told I must upgrade. Now the provider finder is broken. The new user experience simply doesn't work. I tried to find a PRISMA location for a test, it was asking me to open a video player app. This is not progress.",
"Garbage App  When I put in a password exactly as it says(at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase and one numeric) it will come back and read ""you must use  an alpha-numeric password"" when I do that it comes back and says ""you cannot use an alpha-numeric password"" though it is still 8 or more alpha-numeric or non alpha-numeric characters. It's circular. So even though I'm doing it correctly it doesn't matter.",
Love the portals makes everything easier,
"I have never been so frustrated. I have made a number of attempts to create an account. I put my information in hit enter only to get an error message (system problem). The two other portals I use are user-friendly I get all the information I need. Fortunately they don't use MyChart. There's a reason why you don't have a help desk phone number! I have wasted too much time on this, however, I am writing a letter to HUMC about my negative experience.",
"My original review somehow got deleted? Like the app. Convenient access to many features of the website. Main downside is the in-app camera does not limit file size. Tried to attach an image using the camera built into the app and it refused to attach because the file size was too big. Please reduce in-app camera resolution, add a crop image feature, or raise the max file size to accommodate. Thank you.",
"Due to a severe fall 4yrs ago I lost a great deal of mobility in my left leg and I have difficulty standing, walking, doing normal day to day routines & leaving home without prior transportation so I am always looking for resources & tools that give me the ability to get things done on my own. This app helps me complete necessary medical tasks without leaving home & or requiring me to seek the assistance of others. Additionall, I highly recommend this app if caring for elderly loved one(s).",
"Updating previous review. I tried the messages again today and it was working as normal, so perhaps there was a maintenance or outage for just the message service. Would be helpful to have some kind of information to the user when there is an outage. Otherwise, I love the app.",
It's a great app and it gives u everything you need in one app.,
Easy to use and communicate with my doctor. Very easy to request refills for medication.,
"I've seen a lot of doctors, and have dealt with a few different patient portals. MyChart is by far, the best. Messaging works, test results are posted fast and in full, making appointments is a snap, and being able to share you file with another provider is simply sharing a link. It's perfect.",
All my medical records in one place I love the access to lab & imaging reports & after visit summarys from my doctor and other doctors I'm referred to! I use My Care near weekly and love the access to my medical records! I wish there was a way to see graphs and trends of certain lab tests to easily see past results as compared to new ones. In order to do this I have had to download and input data manually via the BT Graph app. A new issue is I have close app to navigate away from lab results.,
The app doesn't ever let you know when an appointment has changed or been added if you didn't make the appointment yourself. I literally had to check on 2 different occasions for 2 different appointments to find out that something was scheduled without me knowing and that another appointment had been pushed back by months. I would have shown up with no proof of the appointment and would have wasted money and time. This app should do way better!,
Very useful. The user interface is a bit intimidating but i was surprised how much i can do with this app. A 'must have' for those with multiple conditions who have more than one doctor at more than one place. For instance i use a clinic and two hospitals and can communicate with all of them through this app. :^),
"The app is a great tool and does need some refinements but over all you can contact your doctor's, get your appointments, make & cancel appointments, but even though you've seen certain services that are not your doctor they can't be contacted directly. A lot of the menu items take you out of the app to the website. I'm sure that it has to do with security or something like that. Not sure if different hospital/doctor's have a different look but mine works good but other medical orgs don't connec",
"May be the best comprehensive health care software program ever devised. Incredibly easy to use and navigate, always up to date, and virtually indispensable. As a senior citizen with numerous pernicious health issues, I have grown to depend upon it to provide me with current notifications about upcoming appointments, medication reminders and test results. It allows me to communicate directly with my myriad health care providers and recieve timely responses from them. I access it daily.",
"Right now, I'm very disappointed in the app. I've had 2 positive covid tests. I had a 3rd one done Thursday, February 3 and I still don't have the results. I think there is something wrong with the app. I keep getting a ""server error"" message so I installed it on my tablet but stil no luvk. Up until now, the app has performed perfectly. Now that time is crucial, I have to wait until the Pharmacy opens to see if they can help me. SIgned, perplexed!!",
"It keeps sending me messages to my cell phone that I have new messages, then when I sign in to get the messages it says it can't access the messages because the cell phone they have been sending messages to for the past several years hasn't been verified by them all this time. Can someone please let me know what is going on, and if this APP is being run on a stable platform so that we can continue to use this? Or advise of a good APP to use for MSMC contact? Thanks so much.",
"Still having problems after the initial loading. I've tried 3 different phones 2 were upper midrange androids one was a less expensive phone and all three phones experienced the same problems. The log in works, but when I try to actually use the app it will tell me an error has occurred. It usually takes 4 or 5 attempts to get anything accomplished.",
"This little app simplifies the entire booking process & syncs with Google calendar - among others - so staying up to date with who needs what, where & when, it can't be any easier! Everything just a few taps away, for any appointment! As a man with some health issues, @ 1 point requiring 6 separate specialists (3 of which use MyChart & message each other inside the app instantly!) working toword a diagnosis,q I'm pleased to announce MyChart made the logistical & planning nightmare disappear! 😁",
"I love this app, especially quickly receiving test results in a bar chart format with normal ranges included for reference. Gives me the chance to review, research results on-line prior to discussing with the doctor so as to have informed questions. The ease of communication with doctors and their staffs couldn't be easier.",
"I never liked My Chart, and evidently the medical staff isn't very positive about it either. Most of the time the site is superfluous, when a message could easily be sent directly to the phone or email. Tonight I got a reminder to make an appointment for something that was already done. And... the site isn't user-friendly. It's not intuitive to non-ITs.",
It's nice having all of my records in one place and all of my medications so I can see everything. Love this app!,
"Since latest update I have been unable to access any records in mychart app. Before the update, there were no issues. Now all I can see is upcoming appointment. Cannot access lab results, medications, notes or even message my provider. Epic mychart was better 5 years ago than it is now. Stop screwing it up!",
"Works fine for me. I just installed it and, so far, no problems. I am able to log in, check and make appointments, message my doctor, e-check in-- the works. I really don't see why all the bad reviews. I can do everything from this app that I can do on my desktop. I love it. It's a complete, well-rounded application that serves its intended purpose: to keep my doctor and I connected. Set up was very easy--it took only minutes. Just wish I could change the ugly purple color.",
"I really like this, I usually get results before my provider. Messaging is very convenient.",
"I have grown to love this app it makes everything so much easier . Everything you need is all right at your finger tips there's no more standing in line or sitting on hold to talk to your doctor , same goes for all of your records ,, it keeps up with everything for you , plus it reminds you of up coming appointments, and it tells you when your meds are due for refill .etc. once you learn how to use it , there is nothing that does half of what this app can do.",
"Not as happy with recent update, only because of the billing section. My statements do not update after 24hrs as zero balance after paid in full. I usually have to call billing department to pay bills now because statements are three times slower to be posted on my chart. I love the app as a whole. All the other updates have been fine, but I do my billing online so that part has been a disappointment.",
"Couldn't register without a code online as it indicated was possible. Wouldn't check me in to the appointment like it offers, was not helpful in trying to send a message, doesn't allow for going backwards to previous screens without a reset of sorts leading to going through a few links just to get back to where you want to be. Will probably be replaced in a year or so by something equally disappointing.",
I LOVE the old app. This new app doesn't allow me to compare lab results with past results. That was extremely helpful. Please bring that feature back. I do like the sliding scale if you are only looking at one test.,
"Using this app is like using a 1997 website. Making an appointment, confusing and nearly impossible. Hmm, let's see, well the benefits are that I can receive messages from my doctor and lab results ... Both of which could simply be emailed to me directly. So I'm not sure what good this app is for the patient. Massive room for improvement.",
"This is a wonderfully easy app to use! It also consolidates all of your providers in one app! You can do many things with the app, request appointments, confirm appointments, request refills for prescriptions, write to a provider, view bills, etc. I think it's a great app and have had nothing but good outcomes using it!",
Perfect! 100% user friendly. I'm definitely impressed with lack of problems I have with this app. To date I have never had 1 problem! Iv used it for 2 years!! Thanks for such a well made application!!!! I can tell a lot of hard work was put into this application. It clearly shows!!! 10 stars is really deserved!!!!,
"This app is very useful for keeping track of your medical information. It allows you to ask for prescription renewals and it has a convenient method to health care providers. One thing that is not intuitive is how to sign off from the main screen. (You have to touch your icon.) I am still getting used to the updated version (11/09/21), but, so far, I am very satisfied.",
"Clunky, numerous nonsensical messages are displayed on home page, but no way to get rid of them, cannot attach pdf files to emails, email message size limitation forces user to send multiple emails instead of one. Three image attachment limit is silly. ECG results from Kardia are unable to be sent as they are not images. Terrible. Minus 2 stars...",
Love this app it's an easy way to make appt and see communicate with your healthcare professionals. The only trouble I've had was doing an appt. Via their video chat and was unable to connect to it because of technical difficulties but I was able to still see my Dr once it was fixed.,
"I can not see billing at all. It use to be so easy to just go in and pay a bill and see what I owed. But now, it's not even there and when I go to the regular website, billing shows nothing. I got mailed a paper bill with past due amounts that I didn't know I owed because of this. I thought I just didn't owe anything, turns out it just isn't showing up. Paying bills online was the main reason I downloaded the app, now it just seems a waste.",
"Unfortunately, mychart is used by a number of doctors and hospitals in my area. I was not able to get a reliable home page link because I couldn't tell the difference between them. I have to type the full address in my search engine every time I use it. I wish there were some kind of list at the beginning of the app that allowed me to choose which version I wanted. You all might want to consider this when you put out your next version.",
"My Providers pushed me into downloading this app. I finally tried it. It took me several tries for the app to be happy with the info I was plugging into it. From there, I'd have to say I'm disappointed in the app. The only info that is currently in my chart is a surgery I had 4yrs ago! It wont show upcoming appts., no test results, I cant even message my provider because the app wont allow me to! I was hesitant in trying this app, and I have to say I, I don't like it at all. Total waste of time.",
"EXCELLENT resource to manage my Healthcare needs!! I have been using MyChart for a few years and it is invaluable to me. I have several serious health issues and this app allows me to maintain my appointments, my lab test & radiological reports, and my medications. Everything is conveniently located right in the app. Love it. Love it. Love it.",
I've always loved this app and I really appreciate it but somewhere along the line they took a few things away that were awesome. Such as explaining each single thing that you were tested for in detail. You could view your images. It doesn't contain any of that any longer. I could spend a whole afternoon just reading up on the things that pertained to me medically. It's so sad because I loved it so much and it made this app so incredibly wonderful and now it's just wonderful😂,
"Am tired of seeing my medical info incorrect after I have corrected it numerous times. Keeps going back to previous past data or deletes it. E.g. Have a reminder now to have a colonoscopy before 12/21. Already had one in July, 2021! Was texting message to my doctor and message was sent by mistake w/o giving me an op to edit it. I have several doc appts sometimes close together. For each appt have to go back through same historical info, drug info, etc. Get asked same questions at doctors'",
"Have been using MyChart since it became available. Biggest complaint isn't about the app per se, rather its that not every health care provider doesn't use same digital record keeping program. MyChart doen't talk to Healow (other app many of my health care providers use) so I literally have to bounce back and forth between the two apps. Have had to open MyChart while consulting with health care providers to show them test results (easily found in MyChart) = make life easier = one digital point.",
"Love this app so easy to use. I love that I can communicate with my doctors and nurses by sending a msg through my chart, have a virtual visit if needed, make appointments, sign in online for an appointment the day before. I have access to my test results, after visit notes, plus see all appointments past and future. The bonus is being able to click a button and have my appointments added to my calendar. This is truly an essential app to have.",
"I do NOT like the way they've, ""upgraded it."" It was FAR SUPERIOR, more pleasing to the eye, more user friendly, BEFORE they got the BRIGHT IDEA of Fixing Something NOT BROKEN!! 😡 THIS version is HORRIBLE. They've taken things AWAY 😡 like the beautifully organized message center! It's a MESS now. PUT IT BACK the way it was, PLZ!! Scene from Monty Python: Too Much Free Time... ""Ooooooo. Let's just change THIS bcz we can! It'll mess w/everyone used to the old system! "" *Board applauds*",
"I loved this app, until today. I cannot connect in any way, shape, or form. Every time I try, I get an error saying connect to an internet network, and yet I am. This app WAS by far the most convenient medical app I have ever used. I WAS connected to my husbands doctors, hospitals, referals, it USED to make keeping his medical records easily accessable as well. Not any more. I have forced stop, uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail.",
"This application is extremely frustrating. Not only do verification codes frequently fail to send on time, whenever you reset a password it doesn't seem to sync properly and you're locked out once again and forced to go through the entire reset process just to view a message reply.",
"Overall decent and convenient app. However I wish for blood works amd etc. were seperated by a list in chronological (date of appoitement) order where one can open, as opposed to just seeing a long list. No option to print out like one would do from the drs office. Thanks.",
"So stinking convenient! I can always see what I need to see without contacting the clinic, test results, when bills are due, I can even send a message to my doctor, and she sees it and responds that day! Sometimes it's fine to talk to the medical assistant, but other times I just need some advice. I don't want to schedule appointments for that!",
"The main reason for me to get the app was to receive covid-19 results for travel restriction requirements. But you cannot print nor share the results from the app, and the web version doesn't show me to log in most of the time. State requirements are specific for travelers and lists CVS as an acceptable testing site, but getting the info to the state travel authorities is a pain. Wish there was an easy way to use the app for this or that the web page would be more reliable.",
That app had gotten worse since I started using it. I like the idea but like most health care systems it fails huge on delivery. The biggest complaint I have now is you can no longer pay your bills from the app. That was convenient since I don't have a checkbook to send in payments.,
I constantly get server error when trying to check in or trying to schedule an appointment. I think it maybe a timeout issue due to a week cell signal. I live in a remote area & don't have strong cell coverage. I wish that app communication would allow for slower connections.,
"Super annoyed that the option for biometric/fingerprint login was removed. It's a step backwards and I hope it's restored at some point soon. The app itself isn't very intuitive and seems to try to do too many things, nine particularly well.",
It is just OK. I can't get into billing at all. It keeps giving me a message that says An error occured on server. Please try again later. I have tried over the last 2 months at different times and still can't get in. Please fix the app or the server which ever is broken.,
No custom support.it's not user friendly setup. The copay are listed incorrectly so I can't pre-register. I've used the app to contact the general help chat and the billing department. Both say I needed to myChart support and myChart support said it's a billing issue and didn't want to further look into this. My chart support sent me back to billing. Shouldn't be this difficult.,
Don't know if there was an outage or what. This morning the app worked great. Went to get back on this afternoon and all my organizations were gone and wanted me to search for my organizations which nothing happened. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Logged back on and it works great again.,
"I really like this app. I like that you have the COVID QR code option. And I like that you have enabled biometric unlock. But now I can't access MyChart on my laptop with my password. It looks like you can either use biometrics or a password, not both. That is a little frustrating.",
I love being able to use MyChart to double check appointments and make them. It really makes things so much simpler for my busy life especially when I lose track of time and would forget to call during business hours. I find the appointment reminders very helpful as well.,
"This app was great, but it has suddenly stopped working. Have uninstalled and reinstalled but it does not open. Error message '404 - File or directory not found' appears. This is the same across all my devices. PLEASE fix this - lost without this app...",
It has been extremely helpful reminding me of appointments. It allows a recap of the visits which is also extremely helpful when there is much information and life is chaotic. I can go back and check on past appts. Know of future appts. Keep track of medicines and dosages that are needed. I am a scattered brain thinker and this app helps extremely,
"Have MyChart accounts at multiple facilities and using MyChart allows me to keep test results, appointments, medication lists and messages to/from all my providers, etc, all in one central location. Extremely convenient! Promoted better continuity between my various providers. Absolutely love MyChart! I would be lost without it.",
"This by far has been one of the best medical apps I've used to date. My labs and imaging results are usually sent same day. I have the ease of communicating with the staff. The only con is I wish you can schedule a video consult through the app. I feel I shouldn't have to call the office, in order to schedule a video consult.",
"My main doctor refuses to use So my chart looks a little better with the update but now instead of a sent and inbox folder.... I have ""conversations"" in a large pile? I have no idea what some of the replies are to or what they are regarding.. Also there should be a way to select all or multiple messages to erase. The automated ones take up space and going one by one takes forever. Also it seems there is no way to filter if a message contains attachment ... One step forward and two steps back..",
This app is super annoying. The notifications are non stop with no way to turn them off. Some of the reminders are inaccurate and it is not easy to navigate. The only reason I have the app is my insurance requires it to get a discount.,
"Could be better, I can't get my medical records to print out for a hard copy, not even test results, vaccination record, I can't even screenshot it either. It makes things difficult. 29JUN2022-Thank you for the info response, great app, sometimes I get my test results before my doctor has a moment to see them, very convenient that I can enable notifications for when I get a new test result or message. I use this app at least 3 times a week to advocate and collaborate my health with my providers.",
"This app is great with my regular doc organization, but I was prompted to download a separate version of it when setting up a covid vax apt today. I did, but then I had to set up another login (the online one with the same organization - IDPH - did not work). I did that, and still can't see the appointment, which was the entire point. Not sure if IDPH or MyChart is the issue here, I guess, but not impressed.",
This app is extremely useful and helpful. It allows me to accurately keep track of all my medical conditions as well as my medications and Dr's visits. MY ability to communicate with my Dr's is excellent and extremely helpfu along with being able to schedule both televisits and in person visits. I wish I could schedule my lab appointments through My Chart as well.,
I love being able to see all of my information in real time on this app. Super convenient and easy to navigate. Schedule appts. Message your provider directly. Refill prescriptions. Real time test results & current medical info w/provider notes & after visit summaries. Easily edit your contact info & more. Share some or all of your medical info with family. Link to your other providers so you can see all of your info in one easy to navigate application. I love this MyChart app! Two thumbs up!,
"Something changed in this app in the last month that makes it unusable. It consistently has errors communicating with the server. If I click into a test result, the doctor's info is there but the result is not. Please fix.",
"Love the app, however only giving 2 starts right now. Since the last update I have had problems logging in or if I'm able to log in, I keep receiving errors when I try to open test results, messages, or just about anything. I hope it can be resolved soon because I really do like the portal.",
"This app use to work perfectly fine now every time I log on to send a message it says error. I finally was able to send a messages after 15 attempts. Once I received a response I tried to review the message and its stil saying error. I uninstalled to install it back to see if it will work any better, please fix.",
"Not the most user friendly app. There are certain appointments that are in as an order, but can't schedule from. App and there is NO phone # provided to call to schedule appointment. Information drops off too fast, especially health history/past test results.",
"This is full of information, that's a great portal to share information between you and your healthcare provider and also for you to go over certain medical records, however, the big caveat here is that whoever made this app did not make it into an app like format. Actually had to go into my Chrome settings and asked for it to be shown as a desktop site just to see if it was a difference. There was no difference, very user-unfriendly and amateurish",
"Wanted to download appointments to my Google calendar, but instead shows up as Outlook. Tried to get help through healthcare provider to switch calendars, but no luck. Tried to get help through Epic. Evidentally an app with no support. Tried MyChart on my laptop and still downloads on totally blank Outlook calendar. Not useful unless you use an Outlook calendar.",
"Ive been using mychart for the last 3 1/2 to 4 years flawlessly. I signed in a week ago, it worked perfect, somehow (without updating) my phone began using the updated version. I know that sounds crazy, but the log-in page changed without me updating. Now it won't recognize my login info. When I request my username, I submit my first/last name & dob it says ""If your info matches our records an email with your username will be emailed to you. Ive not received any email.",
"I love being able to contact my doctor, refill prescriptions, and check over my past visit summaries online, but there's no home button in this app so it's easy to get lost in the maze and then have to exit the app to start over. Otherwise, it's great.",
"Excellent app that provide immediate access to appointments, test results and much, much more. When facing hard times medically this app helps put you at rest knowing it will alert you as soon as test results become available, keep up with your appointments and actually transfer them to your Google calendar. Awesome app and I appreciate having access to it and the work the developer put into it.",
Downloaded the app after receiving an invite from my health organization (Honor Health). Created my password (odd there's no confirm password in the process to ensure you didn't misspell your password). Tried logging in and received an error message saying the terms and conditions are unavailable. The login process fails and I was returned to the login screen. I was able to login via a web browser. So far the app is completely useless.,
"Buggy. Asks wrong sex for specific screening. Update breaks the app almost every time. Only option each time is to reinstall. Otherwise convenient to use. Response: Tried both Mychart support and my provider for a year, and all I saw are pointing fingers. Updated to 1 star.",
Was unable to get back into MyChart for my Baptist Health messages after just one day of having the app on my phone. I even set up a pin number so I would be able to log in without having to remember different passwords as I have more than one org that I use MyChart for. Each time I try to open the app it goes to a main screen but nothing ever opens now. Finally gave up and went back to using my browser to get into my accounts.,
"Unfortunately, this app has imposed online billing ONLY for my doctor visits without my knowledge or consent. If I am billed for something, I want to receive a physical bill in the mail. When a notice appears on the app showing that I have a bill due, if I eventually get in the mail a physical bill months later, it often says that it's past due. I'm afraid that my credit rating will suffer because of this.",
"Most of the program works pretty good for thorough communication with the clinic. But the telehealth sound doesn't work. And when composing a message on a touch type device, it will delete everything on a whim.",
New app is nice looking. But there's still some bugs like around loading of messages and verifying email address where it just loads up a blank screen. The website shows a 500 server error too. I hope they can fix these issues soon!,
"MyChart is great, I absolutely love using it. Its very convenient for scheduling appointments, contacting Dr. Or nurse staff, and referencing my medical records. Its also very convenient to see my bills and make payments. Its extremely user friendly and easy to navigate.",
I really like having my information in one place. Very easy to use. I'm able to contact my doctor easily and manage my prescriptions. I refer to the app often. I wish more of the billing was on there. Only certain billing shows up there.,
"I'm pleased with rapid communication of scheduling, test results, and answers to patient quandaries can be addressed with my chart. It's easier than phone system long waits, although staff who does that are helpful. It's just so busy. This app is less waiting and user friendly.",
I enjoyed this app. My only critique is that when you select the biometric option for some reason it's hit or miss. Sometimes the biometric is there and then the next time you attempt to open that app it's gone. So then you have to hunt down your password get back into the system re-enable to buy a metric and it just keeps toggling for no apparent reason.,
"It works, sometimes. When it works it's great. It is highly unreliable. Don't become dependent on it for communication with your doctor. Ex. I cannot currently open an after visit summary. I still cannot open a letter from the Dr's office. I've had trouble uploading documents and photos into messages. Sometimes I can request appointments, most times, I cannot. Sometimes, it just doesn't open at all.",
"I rarely sign in to the app, just every couple months. But it's like every time i do i have to relearn everything because everything has been changed. There is no reason to constantly update and rehab the app. If it ain't broke don't fix it! I understand bug repairs and such, but no reason to change the entire layout.",
"My healthcare team is so compassionate and extremely helpful. They are very expeditious in populating all communications, test results, etc.. My Chart makes me feel included by having such a detailed design. I can get refills without calling the pharmacy and I can ask questions or make comments. I can't think of anything it needs. It's perfect the way it is today.",
"I expected the app to have the exact same features as the online version, but it doesn't. The compare with past results feature is missing. That is one important feature for me and to not have it means I will not be using the app. I hope they can update that in the future.",
"I love the idea of the app, but every time I try to log in it says there was an error. I log in online it logs in, but on the app it won't go past the error message. I know I'm typing the info correct, and I've waited 2 weeks for it to improve before writing a review. I sure hope it gets corrected soon.",
"Very user friendly. GP and/staff response thru messaging on this app is efficient and timely. I've scheduled visits (in office and video) with confidence. Cancellation is also not a problem. During this covid epidemic, while communication and scheduling visits were so challenging, this app made it a little easier to get things done.",
"Overall I really enjoy having my records easily assessible. But no way to correct ""past due"" tests/assessments to indicate they were done, but done somewhere else. This makes it confusing to track what really needs to be done.",
"Well put together app which is easy to use as well as easy on the eyes. I'm never confused and it makes things so much easier to have everything you need in the palm of your hands. I was able to fill out paperwork through the app before my appointment which I think is great knowing I'll be in and out sooner on the day of the appointment. The app will show details about you as a patient which will include your preexisting conditions, medications and so on which you can edit or update.",
"Refreshing to finally have access to my own Healthcare information. I now feel a part of my ongoing Healthcare process and am empowered to be more preventive than reactive when it comes to my personal health needs. The GUI is very user friendly and intuitive, the messaging section is quick and the customization is open. One suggestion is the maximum file size be increased from 1mb to 3mb. It would allow for more detail to be shown in the case of video appointments.",
"Awesome app. Add your doctors to your profile within the app and instantly you can pull up previous visit summaries, the doctors notes, and makes requesting refills a piece of cake! If you work with more than one Healthcare Network, that is OK, there is an easy way to set up the other networks/doctors, and you can view each networks reports separately, or combine them, so all of your doctors are on the same page. The doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies use this app to communicate with each other.",
"Never got a chance to use the actual app. Everytime I attempted to use it I was asked to pick my provider, which I did multiple times. The only message I received was, ""Thank you for your submission"". Then no refresh, no next step, no new page, nothing. Pointless and a waste of space. Uninstalled after a few attempts and a couple of hours. Save yourself time and phone space. Just go to the actual website.",
"Overall, easy to use, fast check-in, quick answers from providers and for text results. Excellent! I only wish it linked with CVS more accurately, as my booster and flu shots show in CVS but not on MyChart yet. Still great. I get test results quickly, have access to my father's account, and generally everything I need.",
"Trying to change organizations isn't as easy as expected. I select change organizations, select the organization, select login, and it brings me back to the one that I don't want. Very slow when navigating to different areas.",
"This app has literally been a game changer for medical care. I used to spend hours with phone messages and voice-mail back and forth with my PCP's office just to schedule an appointment that wouldn't be available for a few months out. And it has saved hours and days requesting a refill for a prescription, with back and forth calls to the office and the pharmacy. This is an excellent communication tool for patients as well as awesome repository for all of my medical history, test results, etc.",
"This app is terrible and it's developers should be ashamed. The functionally is weak, fingerprint log in makes no since, you can't check-in like you're suppose to be able to do when arriving to appointments, the functions aren't streamlined. App technology and intuitiveness are too far advanced in 2019 for an app this poor to exists. Especially for how aggressively Health Care providers are shoving it down our throats.",
"This app never works. It can never verify me. Every time I visit my healthcare provider they give me an activation code. They never work as they can't verify my identity... I triple, and quadruple check to make sure the info is correct to no avail. Then after a few tries I'm locked out and asked to go in person. I already don't feel good after leaving the hospital... I don't need an app to app to add to my frustration. Same issue going on for 2 years now.",
"I really like MyChart! The app works well, and is easier than the desktop app at times. The App connects to the right people quickly, I'm able to see my appointments, I can review my lab work and doctor's comments at any time. All of the things I need in one spot.",
"My apologies for the last review and request for the application to be repaired. I appreciate good security and getting locked out of this application when I entered the incorrect password. Anyone can forget a password. I'm happy to admit, that was my problem. Good luck to anyone else ""forgetfulness"" causes stress to.",
"I am terrible with remembering medication names, appt days/time, etc. My chart is sooo amazing! It has everything I need at my fingertips, not to mention how easy it is to use! I absolutely love it! And the most important thing... No crashing, trouble loading, etc .",
"I love this app! I have several specialists at KUMED and this app keeps me informed on appointments, locations and times. It was so much harder doing it myself manually. The best feature is getting test results quickly and receiving information if I want to follow up. MyChart is easy to use and always at my fingertips. Thank you, MyChart!",
"Unuseable because I can not add my provider. Always shows error 404 ""can't find server"" when trying to add listed provider. Tried re-installing app multiple time with no luck. App has updated multiple times and the error is always the same. No method to contact support in app. Email epic support as suggested in devs reply to this review. Received no response back from dev.",
Great way to keep track of your appointments and message back and forth with with your care providers. Plus all your medical records are stored and shared with all your medical providers so your don't have to get medical file transfered or update yourself. The app sends out reminders about appointments and can check you in based on your location. Keep track of billing and make payments right from the app. Love on|chart!,
"I find my chart very useful and convient. Youre able to do and see so many things,... What I enjoy the most is, you are able to get answers to your medical questions that would otherwise require you to make an appointment with you're Doctor...I wish I would have downloaded the app alot sooner than I did. I would recommend everyone get the app....It saves time money and a whole lot of undo stress.",
I love the quickness and timely updates. I find it informative wroth super easy navigation. The ability to join other networks in addition to your primary one is a great feature without the need to use multiple apps.,
I absolutely love this app ! It's easy to use and gives you updated test results or visit summaries immediately and you can schedule appointments or cancel them as well as refill a prescription and talk to your Dr office all within the app. It's been pretty helpful for me and I strongly recommend using it !!!,
"Super Convenient. I love being able to just send a quick message through MyChart for my Doctor, rather than sitting on the phone on hold for 30-45 minutes. (My doctors office is notorious for putting you on hold and forgetting about you). Easily see up-coming appointments, lab results, schedule appointments, send messages to the doctor, request a medication refill... Communication through this App is simple, quicker and just much less of a inconvenience than calling. Thank you MyChart!",
"A fine app if you don't mind a confusing interface ( Give me a simplistic interfaces that shows me what I want, as I need it. Somehow this app keeps sending me messages to schedule appointments for additional tests. These messages should be directed to the doctor treating me, And not me directly. It is annoying and can't be turned off. And Yes, I have discussed this with doctor's office manager and she told me this is all coming from the app - My doctor didNot send these out. Fix This!",
The interface is poorly designed. For an app that is being used by a huge number of medical centers you would hope their UI would look better. The constant notifications that are useless and cannot be dismissed are also an annoyance.,
When you go into certain categories there is no x at the top to go back to the main menu. The only thing you could do is close out the window and log back into the app to go into something else in the menu. Only certain categories have the x at the top that lets you close out what you were looking at like a upcoming appointment and then you want to go back to look at a test result in the test result there's no access at the top to go back to the main menu. So again I'm forced to close out theapp,
Ive had this app for several months now and find it frustrating that i cannot message my provider when they're set up for this. I can't even make appts. I have reached out to MyChart several times without a response. This app is super glitchy and frustrating to do a simple task.,
"I love this app! It tracks everything, keeps you updated and informed, reminders are set for appointments/communication. It's perfect for on the spot moments when you need to look up medical information. I love that I can see trending test results and contact my Dr's anytime I need to. I highly recommend this app.",
"This is the most comprehensive app... I really like that all of my medical information is easily accessible and that you can achieve so many things within the app. The app is easy to use, but I would like to see the flow tweaked a little bit. Sometimes you go down a rabbit hole and can't get back to the main screen easily.",
"Its ok. I really would like to be able to REFILL Meds from the app rather than just renewals of prescriptions. I still have to dial in and or call in my scrips. It seems simple to me tbere should be two buttons on each med in list: REFILL( for meds not needing renewal yet) and RENEW & REFILL ( Meds needing renewed and refilled). Also I think, the list of appointments should be syncable to calendar on devices like cell & tablets. I really have to manually type each into my calendar.",
"This is a good app. User friendly for the most part. I use this app almost daily as I need it to remind me of a constantly changing dosage on one of my meds. It's great to have just about every feature a patient needs for their day to day usage. The app used to crash frequently, however, recently that has been fixed and it's rare to experience a crash. Five Stars is deserved for this app, mainly because of having the needed features in one place and at your fingertips.",
"This app makes it incredibly easy to converse with my primary care physician and any assisting physicians. It's like I can message them directly. I would compare it to texting. I can change appointments, request medication refills, or just simply state I do not need a medication anymore and remove it from my medication list on my own!!",
"MyChart is awesome! It is direct hands-on contact with your Healthcare provider and all of your records, such as test results and immunizations. You can schedule appointments or directly message your doctor, and Yes!, they respond. You get appointment reminders to your email and can add appointments directly to your personal calendar right from the app! No more after visit summaries and appointment cards,, its right in the app. This app is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone.",
"I have a lot of physical & mental issues, so you have no idea just how much a program like this has made my life easier. Finally, less paperwork, a better way to talk back and forth w/ dr's & nurses, track our test results. The only thing I can think of to improve is in messages. Wish we could break down purpose of our messages a little more. Like w/ type of message you're sending, i.e., if for dr, in what way? Update on an ongoing illness, report blood sugars or an error in record, etc.",
This app takes 5+ days to process a common medication refill in WA. It takes way more than 48 hrs for a response. People have run out of meds waiting for them to process refill requests. Currently the new option to sync with older accounts doesn't work and throws an error message every login with no information as how the user can rectify.,
"My Chart is an Excellent Application to have. Nevertheless, There's a number that appears, beneath your picture. This number usually indicates, that you did not read your unread items, Or did not utilize E-Check Information. Oftentimes, One is NOT able to access E-Check. Therefore, The number which indicates, your reading All of your unread items; Does Not Reduce.",
"Easy to use. Have access to what I would see on the regular website. I like the fact that I get notifications on the app with any updates such as messages, test results , appointments etc. I don't have to go online to check.",
"I used to love MyChart. I bragged about it to my friends and family for all it can do. I don't know what happened, but now when I run the app all I get is a white screen. I can no longer see any icons or check messages, appointments, Labs, billing or anything else. I'm forced to revert to the web if I want to use my chart because it's useless on my phone now.",
"This is the first patient portal app that I am really comfortable with and does what it says it will. I like the fact that it can work with different organizations and not just for one. I like the fact that there's a lot to it it's not just a few little fancy pages. Regarding the last comment, although it's quite meaty and full of various options - a lot of these options are not yet realized within the app. But the potential is there it just needs to be executed. Thank you!!",
"Love it. Easy to message my primary concerning anything. From refills to questions regarding about lab results, even ordered a X-ray when I had a longtime pain in my shoulder. Makes keeping up with my health easy and understandable. I even get reminders about bills. And paying bills so easy, no hold time, easy to pay directly from the app.Give it a shot. I think you'll love it too.",
"I was hit by a car a week after back surgery. All my doctors, meds, appointments, messages, all my therapies, this app works amazingly at being easy 2 use and everything about my health all in 1 place. I have a dozen meds, n dozen doctors this app is essential. I love it and I've never said that about any app.",
"Great for keeping track of all Medical stuff! I have appointments with Dr's and Therapists from 2 different insurance groups but, they both use this app. It allows me to see everything in date order on the same screen. If I need more detail I can easily switch groups w/a swipe.",
"Can't log in without changing password , they send a code to your email and when you go to use it, it kicks you to another screen and you have to do it all over again. It's fine if you have 2 phones to do it, but I don't. Worse app on my phone!!!!",
I love this app especially the. Ability to add to my calendar feature. Also the new look gives you mire options of how to look things up. Also like the ability to have my other hospitals linked up thru the same back dashboard. Keep up the good work.,
"Still needs more work. While it's nice to see part items quickly, there is no way to remove the useless items at all. There is no way to easily add notes on any items workout having to call in. Hope to see these abilities in the future.",
I like the fact of getting access to your records immediately. However I notice the app does not have some of the features the online logon does. Also the app does not like to open very well.....freezes up a lot.,
Good information love that I can keep up on appointments. Test results are good and bad although I like access I don't like that I get notifications for every tests and that I get the results before I know what they mean. I don't think they should be released to patients until they are finalized at the least. And that the doctor explains and releases after so I am not trying to be Dr. Google in between appointments. Works well with speed and easy to navigate,
I've been trying for a week to access My Chart only to have a pop up message tell me to update. I've tried endlessly to update and it wouldn't let me so I removed the app in hopes of it working when I installed again and what a mistake! I can't get the app to install at all now with crucial medical appointments coming up this week.,
"The chat with medical staff connecting multiple clinics for the same topic (just have to watch potential cross-talk) is a game-changer. Has prevented many phone calls. Viewing results, documents, & tracking bills is nice. Scheduling your own appointments (once you have a referral) is probably the best part. Highly recommend.",
"This has been so convenient, having EVERYTHING so easily accessible right in the palms of my hands. Very easy to navigate and find information or keep track of ALL upcoming appointments. I love using this app. And.... NO POP-UP ADS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS",
"Absolutely love this app. I don't have to call anyone and wait on the phone. I can get on MyChart and ask questions, refill scripts, schedule appointments and also cancel appointments. I can also look at all my test results and I don't have to wait for them to call me and tell me. You can even make it secure using a thumb print, pattern, or a code to get in too!",
"My Chart is easy to use, switches easily from one provider to another, does a great job of reminding me of appointments, lets me e-check in ahead of time saving office time and I can pay easily on the site. Love that they use biometrics! So much easier than passwords! And so secure!",
"This app is borderline useless. Takes minutes at a time to load every page (and no, it is not a problem with my internet connection.) Constantly glitching and removing features, now can no longer view any doctors notes from my previous visits and seems like they redid the entire documents section so I can only view the useless after visit summaries. What is the point of this app if you can actually access any of your medical records on it?",
"i love this app, but it hasn't been working for my mother and i for the last several weeks. We are unable to log on with password or fingerprint. There is a glitch in the app settings. It doesn't allow us to turn on the settings for number password or finger print.",
"Best app to keep all of your tests and medical information in on spot. You can co tact your doctors and ask questions and het answers pretty fast. I love this app, it's made my life really easy. I also like being able to see my test results as soon as they are put on the mychart system. Would highly recommend it to everyone!!",
"This app is garbage. Most commands fail, resulting in errors about connection issues. Sometimes I get lucky and can get what I need in just a few retries. Most of the time it either takes several retries or just flat out never works.",
"I like the app, colossal pain to update app. Should give link to update in old version instead of just making it quit working. No instructions. Had to delete old app, start over, reset username and password because not enough numbers and letters, Was a pain in the ....frustrating process. Why not update old version automatically so you don't have to reset username and password which couldn't remember from years ago.",
"The app used to work fine but now it tells me that I have to download and install a newer version. OK, except, after uninstalling the old version, rebooting and installing the latest version from the Play Store I get the same message. If a newer version is actually available, I have no idea where to find it. Currently the app is useless and I can't get to my medical info.",
"I love this app so far. All appointments, messages, billing, test results are at your fingertips. Messaging your provider with non emergency questions is great, and the response time is descent. I have not had any issues.",
"It's a good app. The implementation of it by the medical system I use is ok. One thing - Put the approximate time on the test results. They check Blood Glucose 12 times a day in a hospital, those results are so much more useful with the time noted. I'm sure you have that data, just make it visible on the consumer/patient side.",
"Absolutely HORRIBLE sign up process. By the time I got to the end of putting in all my information, it told me I was going to have to start the sign up process over...TWICE. I'll be uninstalling and just doing things the old fashioned way by calling up and having my records looked up in that manner, but hey. It's less of a headache for me. It just puts more work on the people that this awful app is supposed to make life easier for.",
Does not work very well for video chat.. I am giving this app two stars because it does not work with my Bluetooth headset. This makes the app almost unusable from my standpoint because I cannot have the phone close enough to my ear to hear what's going on.,
"I love being able to pay, schedule appointments, and request refills via the MyChart app. It saves us patients and the office staff precious time by not overwhelming their phone system with calls and as a patient, being put on hold. I have never felt like I could access care this easily by being able to directly communicate with my provider as I do with this app.",
"I love the website! It's convenient for both my children and me to keep up with our appointments all together on the same platform and switch between, and get things done. Absolutely love it. However, the app since it was updated for me has been acting up and not allowing me to log in via the app at all. I have to go to the website. Idk what's wrong or how to fix it. It keeps saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again"".",
"Overall, I do like the MyChart app. One thing that I would like to see in the my test results section is side-by-side test results from present to past so you can easily see how your current results differ from your past results to make measuring your progress more simple. I believe it was when I had Kaiser. Their system had side-by-side comparisons; it would be nice to see that on MyChart!",
An excellent easy to use app. Keeps all the info together. Only criticism is that it is not always possible to access records for amendments. Also it would be useful if the user could send messages/emails the Hospital departments.,
The app worked just fine before. Now I can't even access it. It keeps asking for access to my location which I have no interest in allowing. When I try to select a country or enter a medical organization it won't allow/find/accept any entry and I can't get past that screen. I can no longer access my medical information or submit/request anything. Roll your update back because this is a danger to patient health.,
Terrible app coding. Especially for sign up. Multiple attempted at creating profiles. Create>login> doesn't exist. Completely pointless. What's the point of a login if the private server doesn't even save your info to know that you have a profile to login in with,
"This is a nice App to have but I have noticed that it lacks the ability to be able to print a medication list or any document as a print feature is not available, as to my knowledge, as there is on the full webpage. Therefore I struggle in giving it a full 5 star review.",
"Thanks to a cancer diagnosis, I use this app way more than I would prefer. It is amazingly useful and fairly well designed. It's a bit annoying that it redirects to the website for some things, and a few things are missing, like historical test result comparisons, but overall this is a class A app.",
"So easy to use and so handy to have quick access to chart notes and reminders. If you take the time to set it up (just answer the questions) and get your meds in, it will save you and the nurses so much time going forward. I check in for my appts in the system, usually while I'm watching tv the evening before.",
SERIOUSLY NEEDS WORK!!! I'm rating it 4 star SOLELY because of its potential. A cloud based medical chart system that allows medical providers to see your charts from all providers. I was in hospital recently for 10 days. Tge hospital is EH medical provider but my PCP is RU. In the perfect world they could both see my records for both. They don't sync. Day 3 of my stay I ask why I have received my regular meds. They didn't see any listed. So! EPIC! Get on the ball and fix it.,
"Poor functionality, I thought I was having trouble getting my test results because I hadn't updated the app in a while, but once I updated I can't even find my provider anymore. I uninstalled the app rather than deal with the frustration.",
unable to load into my Samsung galaxy tablet. uninstalled several times as well as rebooted. once loaded it kept freezing at the consent for location. really poor and not usable. I know mychart as I have it on my iPhone. I know it works but not for android.,
"Very convenient. I really appreciate being able to see the summary of all of my visits as well as visit reminders, vaccine info and so much more. It can be a bit intimidating as a patient to comprehend all the medical jargon, but being able to look at notes and test results and be able to research every detail is life changing.",
"I use the MyChart app, and I find it to be incredibly helpful. It streamlines messages to and from all of my different healthcare providers. It keeps me updated on appointments and medications, and gives me immediate access to my health info. It is excellent!",
"I really like this app. Very easy to use, plus if you have any questions about how to use the app they have alot of videos on YouTube explaining how to use the app. This app keeps you updated on everything from medications to appointments past, and future. You can also send messages to your doctor, link all of your doctors together. Very useful app. I would give it 10 ⭐'s if I could.",
it would certainly be helpful if it worked considering it's the only way for me to contact my care providers: it tells me I'm disconnected if I try to join video calls & then kicks me even when it's 100% sure I'm connected､ as well as that now that I have a new phone it doesn't let me log in at all､ giving me the try again later error for days. reinstalling doesn't help & it's just completely broken & has been for years now,
I'm changing my original review from 5 stars to 3. It is difficult to navigate with no navigation buttons. The yellow/orange background color is terrible and you cannot customize it. It keeps telling me that I have to edit and confirm my phone and email but I have nothing to confirm and I can't take the message off. It doesn't actually connect with the clinics so don't try to cancel an appointment through this. However it's not completely useless and I like having it all in one place.,
"No longer working. For a long time this app was convenient and easy to navigate. But about 2 weeks ago it stopped working. I can no longer sign in. It won't load after I put in my password. I have uninstalled it twice to see if that makes a difference. No luck, I now have to sign in on my computer.",
"This app is extremely slow and seems to take forever to upload. It is difficult to navigate and not reliable during doctor's visits. Using this app is like going back to using a modem to connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the app three times before I could get it to do anything at all. Now I am still getting an error message every time I try to read a new message on My Chart on my mobile phone. If I could give the mobile app a different rating, I would give it a 0 instead of a 1.",
Test results have no time stamp which renders some of them almost useless. If blood work is repeated multiple times a day you cannot see the trend (if things are improving or getting worse) as I've found they dont come up in chronological order and no time is indicated to help determine the correct order.,
"I was cross checking some facts in course of writing a message to my provider. The app timed out before I could finish my message. I found no way of editing, and completing my message. I don't know if the message is sent or not. And whether I have to write and send a new message again!",
"There are reminders on the first page that have been done but you can't get off, which is very annoying. Test results are great to get. Very hard to combine previous doctors visits, test results, surgeries from another state with current information.",
"I love this app. It makes life so much easier and saves on unnecessary use of paper. I always know what's happening with my health, labs, medications, and appointments. My provider messages me information which also saves on unnecessary office visits. I recommend this to everyone. I even have my children's added to mine. Try it ! You are missing out.",
App sucks if you don't remember your password and you have to go through the email process which requires you to go out of application causing the application to to refresh at the beginning of giving your three bits of information and you've repeated this process over and over and over again causing your account to be disabled. It sucks.,
"This is a great app, couple complaints thoug. Some things I do have to log on to the actual website for my provider to read some results, or letters. Also with this most recent update, it won't allow me to save my fingerprint, so I have to type in my password every time. Minor complaints, I'm hoping it can be fixed soon :)",
"There is just to much that you can't change, correct, or cancel. It's really troublesome using this. I went in to update for an appointment and started having problems with my sign in. I don't live on this site so it's difficult when you think you know your sign in and you're forced to change it before you can get in. I need to finish now cause I probably could continue so I'm stopping.",
"It is too large to fit on one page but too small to read. Don't know what the fix would be exactly but can think about it and make suggestions, maybe one section at a time and tap 2 to get second section? Messages would be a good first section to appear! In my humble opinion of course",
Can be a little challenging to understand when you first install. Once you learn the app the convience of knowing your test results first hand without the dreaded wait for the doctor to call with them is a plus. Being I have no medical knowledge the results can be a little difficult to read from a layman's view. I do enjoy the accessibility if the app tough.,
"It's worked well and the appointment reminders are nice. It isn't possible to pay for those appointments on the app because the interface is very difficult to navigate. It wants your info but doesn't ever have a ""continue"" button.",
"Works well! Lot's of resources and information. Linking to different provider groups is great. Features available depend on what the provider organization has implemented, not all the same. I recommend this app, it keeps getting better.",
"I really like this app it's easy to keep up with my medical appointments, as well as my large list of medications. I'm a millennial so I don't like to spend a lot of time talking on the phone, with this app you can send and receive messages with your medical provider. One of my favorite features is the e-check in that let's you pre check into your appointment as well as pay your co-pay. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has to spend a lot of time at medical appointments.",
"This app saves me time trying to connect with my physician just to ask a question and allows the physician to be more efficient. I get timely answers that I can understand. I love having new scripts written for me with this app. Many times I think of the refills or the questions that I need to ask my doctor after they're working hours, sometimes in the middle of the night I'll remember something and I just use my app to take care of business. The app is constantly being updated w/ great features",
"Awesome app. Keeps up with messages back and forth to the doctor and nurses, appointment, and test results as well as appointments summary. Medications. Every test and x-ray from any facility can be added. I use it a lot. And depend on it to remind of my appointment and all my communicate I have to do on here. Thanks!!!",
This app sucks. I hate that my hospital forces us to use it. It is hard to find any of your info on it. Sigh up is hard and different for every hospital. I turned off notifications but it still harasses me. When I try to find a new doc it only lest me see new doctor in tx and I don't live in Texas. This app is frustrating. It's like the built an app for patients based on what the billing department wanted.,
"Useful app but every time I try to sign in it tells me my password is wrong. I have to force it to autofill the password, which is the same password I typed in, and it finally lets me on. **UPDATE** I decided it was not worth the aggravation so I just uninstalled it. Disappointing experience!",
"I love mychart it allows me to keep track of my appointments and medications. I can request refills and information. But getting my test results so quickly is the best feature. There was a time you waited for a call, letter or next appt. Sometimes it's hard to remember everything you discuss so the summary and reviews are good. Now it does depend a lot on the Dr.(office) as well. I'm fortunate I have an awesome Dr. who is very detailed.",
"Love it, it's so easy to setup appointments, text your Doctor and switch to your child's profile to do all those things. Responses from medical side come fast. Not sure why they have option for contacting technical and billing side from the app, you will never hear from them.",
I loved using this app when I can't access to a computer while being out of town or going to appointments. And now it keeps saying there's a newer version to download but I don't see any every time I go look for it or uninstall this app and reinstall it but still keeps saying there's a newer version,
"Love/hate relationship with this app. I love being able to access my information and schedule appointments. However, I HATE that I'm unable to to get the video feature for virtual appointments to work. I have contacted the developers who provided NO HELP WHATSOEVER. I have to use someone else's phone for my appointments.",
"nothing loads up. im trying to access my messages, test results ect...nothing. Nothing loads!!!!??? please fix everything about this app bc it would be really useful to have something that actually works.. also why even bother having an app that says ""server having problems"" EVERY DAMN TIME I TRY TO READ MESSAGES ?!?!?!. but it will notify ypy wheb u habe a message like 2 weeks after the message was sent to you. FIX IT OR DONT BOTHER!!",
"I can no longer log in to my account through the My chart app... any time I log in on the actual my chart website that is associated with my care provider I can log in just fine, but when attempting to log in through that app I am met with a message saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."". Hope this is fixed soon, otherwise it's a great app.",
"훌륭한 앱 I have been using (MyChart) this app since mid-late 2014 and never have I ever experienced any trouble with this app until now, that's why I am reinstalling MyChart back onto my phone as we speak. Idk if the creator of app is doing an update on it but everytime I was trying to login. It kept giving me a message about the server is experiencing technical difficulties please try again later. I have been trying and trying still no luck like what's up with that. #MyChartNeedsFixingPorFavor 💋",
"Who in their right mind thought, that blocking screenshots was a good idea. If you need to be able to save a message there is physically no way to do that. So frustrating; I uninstalled the app and went back to the website because of it",
"This is great, because I'm a patient of 2 different medical center and I merge both accounts with this app, and all my doctors now have access to all of my records. The only thing I have to provide are the images from studies (MRI, CT etc) everything else, any of them can see it no matter what medical center is.",
"This app thinks I'm a nomad. Everytime I sign in it wants me to update all my personal info that is up to date. Irritating. Now I just ignore it. Why don't they say, IF there are changes with your personal info please update. Overall it's a handy app and at least lets me input info without printing and filling in forms like some other medical apps.",
"It's impossible to speak to a physician because of my chart. The office relies 99% on this app for oatien lieu of interacting with [this] patient. I can not book, change my own appts. I've been blocked from using the Wait List option. There are so many mistakes in my chart that have been ignored, test results never discussed with me. Its showing Appts canceled I never made. Exclusive use of an App for patient care is not a fair substitute for doctor/patient interaction.",
"Does get confusing with the menu and where to get back to messages that appear on the home screen, are not in the Messaging tab. Update: Now that I've used this program much longer, it far exceeds my expectations.",
Getting more cumbersome with some providers (St. Luke's in KC MO) who force you into huge menu list before you get into the app. Effectively they force the user to select my chart twice before you can get to password/biometric screen. When I have to use that provider I just log into that provider on my laptop where they don't force that nonsense on the user.,
"I love it. Instead of dealing with phone calls or leaving messages that sometimes never get received, I realized that doctor's prefer this method as it is easier for them and a lot quicker for me to get a response back. I also love making my own appointments on My Chart. Super easy!! It's great 👍",
"Most generally this app works well. But to do any e-check ins, looking at financial aspects, confirming appointments or making a payment, it will continually come up and say there is an error on the server. Try again later. This is also doing the exact same thing for my wife. It gets aggrating as heck. And it isn't any certain time of day either., it is continuous. 😡",
So so slow/doesnt load. I like the idea of this app and all the options available. But it's useless if it does not work. This is my most frequent app that I have to close and reopen and update and do anything I can think of to make work.,
"I love it, if I forget to order my meds I can do it on the go with my phone. Easy to use. Access to all my test results appointments, etc... Smooth flow between screens no clunky slow load ups. Tech support is also spot on if you need anything",
"If you're editing an email to send to a doctor and you set the phone down, the app times out and deletes the draft instead of saving it. there is no function to save drafts. Completely unacceptable behavior for an app designed for professional correspondance with medical providers. deserves zero stars",
"It's only just ok. UI menu needs to include a menu to navigate to other sections on the app. In its current state, I need to switch accounts and log back in so I can get to my dashboard which is a bit frustrating.",
"I love the MyChart app. The functionality is great. To name a few; paperless, chart sharing across multiple hospital systems, I can communicate with my doctor's on my time and they can respond on their time, appointment reminders, veiw test results, med list, etc. The list goes on...",
One thing that would be really helpful would be a search function for test results. It would be great to see what that test looks like over time. Scrolling is very tedious and may be impossible for tests done quarterly or annually,
This app will not allow me to log in anymore. It always presents me with a change password option. I do not want to change my password as it works on my computers quite fine. It is already secure. I am trained in Security+ and this password already passed all parameters for being secure.,
"So far it is very easy to use and I love the fact that every Stitch of record that is in my medical file that I can view is at my fingertips and that all appointments and everything is scheduled and it's everything shows up on my chart is awesome thing that they have created and that I'd recommend it to anybody thank you for such a great app, the fact that I can see my files and look at myself at my test results and everything I think is an awesome thing even though I can't understand them.",
The app has a warning as soon as I open it asking me to confirm my email address. I've confirmed it a bunch of times but the warning won't go away. This app has been extremely helpful for me. I have sickle cell and see a few different doctors so it's nice to be able to look over my lab results and keep track of my appointments. Getting refills is a lot easier with the app as well.,
"Admittedly, I was skeptical at first. But I love the convenience. My provider normally replies to questions, or messages within a short time (generally 2 hours or less). I like that I can see test results the same day, even before my Doctor does. I really like the convenience of being able to get med refills basically with the click of a button. I needed refills so I messaged yesterday and this morning the pharmacy called, telling me they were ready.",
"Very smooth app! Easy to use, navigate, and it's intuitive. No real glitches I have noticed yet. This is an awesome option for a care provider and allows great access and information to medical information for me as a patient!",
"Great app for me and my family! It's so much more convenient to schedule an appointment or send a message to my doctor through the app than to have to spend time on the phone with the clinic. I love that I can easily check immunization history and past visit summaries when I need them, and that I can see all of my info from the 3 different clinics/hospitals I've been seen at all from one login.",
My Chart is one of my favorite apps ever. Medical records at a touch whenever I need them. Current medications list. Ability to make appointments without a phone call. I can message any of my doctors anytime of the day or night and they will respond within a reasonable time frame. Don't know how I ever did without this app.,
"The app crashes and returns you to the login screen when trying to login, pressing new user, or inputting a username. This does not appear to be a personal device issue, this seems like a software problem. Please fix. My details of the issue have been stated above.^",
"Worst updates I have ever seen in my life. You can't go back when your in the mobile version, I'm stuck on a preference page right now and no way to get out, I get multiple notifications on test results and there ends up just being one test result back once I log in and I could go on but why bother, the developers don't care -- it works for them so they don't care about what works or doesn't work for their customers.",
Absolutely love my chart! Easy to get results and information on visits and even schedule appointments. I may be fortunate to have a pcp who is responsive to messages through my chart but it has made my care so much easier without having to wait weeks for an appt just to have a question answered.,
"Very tedious. I am happy to be able to e mail my providers and see test results quickly. Having to submit the questionairres, and receiving CONSTANT, MULTIPLE REMINDERS is very irritating. The I.T. developers and facility need to keep the customer experience in mind.",
This app is probably the best thing AHS has offered. Being able to see my imaging reports as soon as they are ready and sharing my insights with my GP and other care providers is so handy. I haven't experienced any glitches with the app since having it for the past 2 years. 4 stars only because I wish it went further back in time for certain results and showed hospital imaging results and showed hospital stays and discharge notes,
"Of all the apps I have his one is the most useful. It's important to be able to communicate with your doctors with out making an appointment, or bothering with a ph call, it's everything in one place to help keep on top of your health, tests or prescriptions. This concept was a brilliant idea!",
"The apps is super easy to use, yet very powerful that it includes all my medical information with Kelsey, including visit notes, labs, imagings and medication. I certainly appreciate the future appointments and med refill reminders features. Only suggestion is that I wish all kinds of appointments woud be included and reminded as well.",
It's great! Fairly easy to use as in I would encourage anyone using it for the first time to thoroughly explore all the options. You can do everything from this app including prescription ordering. Absolutely the best I've experienced.,
"Genuinely useful way of accessing medical records, visit information, prescriptions, etc. It also works with many providers in this area and I can link them all. Occasionally some information may be slightly hidden, UI is good but imperfect.",
"This app is good...when it works. For the past week, I keep getting ""There is a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" There is nothing wrong with my login, because it works on the web version of MyChart. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not help.",
"I love having test results and after visit notes available at my fingertips! No more waiting for a call. Less time wasted checking in. And I can even leave messages for my doc. Its great if you have all services through the same organization, makes communication between all providers so much easier!",
I was extremely skeptical of using this app but I gotta admit its a game changer. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It's stocked full of information and scheduling of appointments to filling/picking up prescips. Reaching a medical professionals is easy as well via email.,
"This is by far one of the best Medical apps I have ever used. Much, much better than what I expected. I love the fact that labs and diagnostic tests results are documented in the app. and easy to review. Many more features are part of the app as well. Billing, messages, appointments (past and future) and more. Very well done. Thank you.",
This app is very difficult to maneuver through you can't go back sometimes it blocks you from going forward and it's just very frustrating now I am uninstalling the app so that I could reinstall the app so that I could go to my doctor's office this is an ongoing situation I've been using the MyChart for years and it's just every single time it's something thank you,
I use my chart for my OSF hospital records as well as doctors records in any health care I have had. My chart isn't easy to use although at times very complicated and complex and drawn out procedures to get done simple tasks. My chart once set up is very very informative. Although a little complex to set up very very useful in the end and very worth the time,
"Easy communication vehicle with medical staff. App is geared to staff not patient. 1.Must enter data, then epress Enter key on keyboard and follow that by pressing OK on app menu else data is not saved. Keyboard Enter and OK buttons are not synced as with other apps. 2 Account times out too quickly. 3.Friends & Family Access may or may not work. 4. Video appt has to be on Website cause dies not work on smartphone. Other than that a great concept.",
"I really like except: 1) annoying that can't clear alerts from bell icon or doesn't auto update after alert is viewed; 2) keep tapping on icons w/ red ! thinking it must be something new but it isn't, just repeat of alerts under (1); 3) start a message w a lot of important data, switch apps to verify drug, date, take a call & no draft saved! Completely disappears & have to start all over again UGH!!! Some have hard time typing. NO reason for this w app security! 4) No feedback option in app.",
I love that I have access to all of my test results and have to ability to contact my doctor but the app falls short when you need an e-visit. I've attempted to contact my doctor twice in regards to an upper respiratory issue and either it hasn't gone thru or there is no way to check or follow up. I hope I don't get charged twice.,
I keep getting 500 internal server error whenever I sometimes go to messages or if I go to appointments and then switch back to messages. I've voiced my concern with customer service technical support and they told me there's nothing they could do on their end. It happened after an update.,
The new upgrade bugs need to be addressed ASAP. Being in the digital area we are in. The system should not give an error everytime someone would log in. After log in. The system continue to give more errors by not letting you see anything in your account. Please fix ASAP. I don't want to arrive at the doctor's office and have to sit in my car trying to reset the app due to errors.,
"Remove the splash page and just have the login page again to reduce wasting time and extra clicks. Have updates via the mobile actually get updated. Offer a quick printable patient overview with immunization history via the app for travel, sports athlete, camp, and other organization health submissions. Allow other M Health Fairview organizations to use the app for consolidated record access scheduling, billing, etc. Example-Fairview Home Infusions. It's dumb your affiliates aren't included.",
"Doesn't work. When I try to open it, it does nothing and then says internet connection not available and closes. So I tried Facebook and my Google search and a couple other apps that require internet service to run and everything is just fine so I tried again and same results.",
"If I try to use the medication refill button from the screen with shortcuts, it errors EVERY TIME. But, I figured out that if I go to Menu first, and Medication refills from THAT screen, it goes through. Otherwise, I LOVE having this access!!",
"It's so convenient to have all my doctors, appointments, visit notes, medications, test results, etc. all in one spot. Plus, there is an easy messaging center so I can ask a quick question, order refills, etc. Very user friendly.",
I really love how easy it is to navigate and I get results as the medical team receives them without the wait and worry and I can call if I have any questions. This really has made things easier to keep track of and reminds me what's coming up and what I need for the year. The new update makes it even more simple to use!!,
"This is a great app except they will block you in the beginning if you don't answer one little questionnaire they have hidden in an obscure place. I had to call them twice to find it after being locked out of my child's account. I didn't appreciate this. If you want something answered that badly, put it right up front.",
"Limited app. It will not let you do any updating, medication list, problem list, doesn't show the message I sent, did not show my last labs results (out of the office), health reminders (drug test screening, etc) that do not pertain to me. To be such a LARGE medical system, it is limited.",
"I was finally able to change my password . Having perused through this App, it seems quite comprehensive. I have heard some negative rumblings about MyChart, but that was in the beginning. Everything seems fine, and the info is detailed and correct.",
This app works great I haven't had any problems with it at all. I'm glad I have a MyChart it's so convenient no paperwork to carry around everything goes in here even if you are seen at an outside facility you can connect them so the info from that facility can go to your MyChart. Test results and the reason why you went to medical facility in the first place.,
"Can't actually activate features advertised. I get multiple notifications and emails that features such as ""Appointment Arrival"" are available to be activated, yet only RARELY do they actually exist on the page or list described in the instructions. Super annoying. Please stop insisting I activate imaginary features!",
"User interface update is nice. But the app logs you out constantly so it's easier just to open it on browser. Can't get password managers to work with it, but that may just be my problem and not others.",
This app has given me the opportunity to communicate with my doctors easier as well as getting my teat results and making appointment fast and convenient. I can't have my phone on me at work and typically work before and after office hours. This app makes it to were I can schedule my appointments late at night hassle-free.,
"If I were a major Hospital and this was my app I would be so embarrassed it would not be released. Half the menu selections are not available. The log out button is hidden two deep in the menu, and then not even a true menu item. This whole app is a disaster.",
My Chart is an excellent service to interact with your doctors and medical care professionals as well as keep up with all your appointments and medications. I was able to have some doctor's appointments through the app with Zoom which worked out very well. I highly recommend this app.,
"Decent, But BUGGY. I like that I can schedule appointments and view most lab results (there's apparently a bug that precludes viewing all results). I dislike that the app will show a notification dot when there is nothing new added.",
I love this private app and it really keeps me on track with most of my appointments. Only works if you're with WVU Medicine... For example: Not Charleston area. I personally can't always remember test results or appointments but with this app I can easily share with my husband and he can review my results for himself and help me keep up with my appointments 💓 Thank you,
"I have no problems using it for Cone Health for myself but when I added my minor son to manage his account nothing ever shows up for him. Plus, I have to switch organizations to my Wake Health for my son every time I try to sign in it always tells me I have the wrong username and password even though I know it's correct because I have it written down. It says it'll send me a link to my email to reset everything and it never does! So I ALWAYS have to call the help line & them reset it!",
"Love it! Very convenient. You don't have to worry about calendars, appointment cards, etc. Everything from doctors notes to letters and appointments right there at your fingertips. Also you can schedule your own appointment and message your doc without having to go to the office.",
"Every day at 4:59am it alerts me my daughter has a new test result when she doesn't. Not all tests are viewable like some are missing. It has had an alert for the last week she has a new appointment but has not. She is a very sick kids gets admitted a week at a time per month. This system is unreliable. It even shows she is under the care of doctors she has been transferred from, never seen, but doesn't show her correct and current team!",
"This app sucks! It says my username and password are incorrect even though they aren't, I can log in online just fine but app absolutely refuses to work! I've reached out to customer service and they tried to help but I literally tried everything they suggested and nothing worked! Very disappointed, I was hoping to use this app to make my life easier.",
It's so hard to find anything. I keep looking for doctors note to me & each time I just run across them by pure luck. They are not under messages. Or notes. Only thing I can find is test results & upcoming appointments if there are any. I don't feel like it's user friendly.,
"This app is awesome for scheduling appointments, contacting your doctors, viewing you medical history, and much more! I personally feel like it could use a few touch-ups in terms of aesthetics.",
"Drives me nuts, keep getting push notifications that there is new information but after logging in there is nothing there. Also, get push notifications for my wife's account instead of just mine! And it keeps bugging me to go paperless, I don't want to go paperless, but I can't disable the request.",
"I wish all my providers used this app. It is easy and convenient. I can do online check ins, manage apponents, send messages, and review test results. It also allows the syncing of multiple providers. Love it",
"I love MyChart! It's so useful as a patient to track appointments, view my medication list, message providers, and more! I only wish my primary organization implemented more features, such as expanded self-scheduling and letting me update my medical info (med list, etc.).",
Awful. Created an account but every time I try accessing I'm told wrong password. When I try to rectify I'm put into frustrating [politically correct term] loop. Cannot get a live person in cust service either. You can literally die using this system. I have no idea why I'm writing this as I'm positive NO ONE will respond.,
"Perfect Medical Organization App! Everything in once place for the whole family. Easy to use and navigate. Privacy ensured, yet easy to login with a print. Easy to use at check-in for appointments at clinics and hospitals. Send messages directly to nurses or doctors.",
"I love that I can access all my appointments,and check in ahead of time. As well as seeing all my test results when they come back all in one place. I can make, cancel and change appointments as needed also. This app is wonderful!",
I absolutely LOVE this app!! I feel like communication between you and the providers you deal with are so much quicker than having to call and wait on the phone to talk to someone. Yes there are times that even on the app you have to wait for a response but it's not as bad as having to wait on the phone. I use the app more than having to call my providers. Soooo easy to deal with especially when you also have to deal with small children at the same time. I would DEFINITELY recommend this app!!,
"The reminder for tasks done is stuck. Even though the task is done,it reminds me everyday to do the task. It's been 2 months of repeating and no way to stop it! No ads, which is good. Also doesn't connect to my doctor. My doctor doesn't exist on the app.",
"Easy idea, but far from what it should be. Can't access basic things on the app. You get redirected to use the web page for some things instead of the app When I go to the web page, I get stuck in a loop on how to recover my user name when I didn't request to do so. Shouldn't be this hard to use an app when you spend so much money on health care. The app should be almost, if not, perfect to use.",
"Hard to use. Also, scheduled a Dr. Appointment because my provider doesn't have a direct like apparently, and the day of the appointment, I take time off work and go in and they have no appointment for me. On the app, it said that the appointment was success and to arrive 15 minutes early. Couldn't screenshot it for privacy reasons disclosed on app (how convenient), so I had no way to prove I had scheduled it. Just physically go in to schedule or wait forever on the phone with the scheduling.",
"Great for the most part. I keep getting a popup saying ""We're having issues getting data from your linked accounts."" My providers say they can't see records from my previous organizations - have 4 in total. Are there instructions on fixing? I unlinked all and relinked, or do I need to wait awhile inbetween? Or, do you need to do something on your end?",
For a week it will not allow me to log in on my or my husband's phone. This app use to be great but not anymore. Keeps saying there is a problem connecting to the server. In this time we need access to remote health care. I have uninstalled and redownloaded twice to no avail.,
This app helps with alot of different things. For example you can schedule appointments or you can get refills for your medications. Not to mention it allows you to see and review all of your test results. This app has really made things easier to manage.,
"Painful to use. The homepage keeps insisting they need to verify my email address when it is already in the system and they email me all the time. For example, ""you have a new test result, go to mychart to review."" And I always respond. Email address confirmed!!!! Also it wants to verify my cell phone number by sending a one-time code to my landline number. Good luck with that! And it will NEVER have my cell phone number so it can sdnd me BS reminders constantly! Also keeps reminding me I",
"No back or menu button. Must constantly exit the app and then log back in. Total pain in the posterior. Was this a high school programming project? Swipe sideways? Gee why didn't I think of that (sarcasm)? Doesn't work. Also, why can I delete prescriptions but not add new ones. I'm pretty sure now that high schoolers would have done a better job.",
"It was much easier to navigate before. You have to remember that you are dealing with 65-70 year old people. When sending a message, there's a big block at the top that will not move and the keyboard below! That leaves you about a 1/4 inch to write in and if you want to read it back, you have to scroll up and down using that 1/4 inch!",
I like the idea of being able to check my results so quickly. Except the app never lets me login! Keeps telling me there was trouble connecting to the server. My data works on every other app so I know its not just my phone.,
"Not always easy to navigate, difficult to figure out what the New Message is, and to get rid of Notices on my screen that are useless to me; Would like to clean up the general messages sent, when I choose not to answer or navigate through them.",
"This is an excellent app. It keeps me connected with my primary doctor and specialist too. It reminds me of my appointments, medications, and I can get advice, refill medications, letters, make appointments and schedule an emergency visit to. It also gives me the summeries after the visit. This app is almost like having a Doctor twenty-four hours seven days a week. Love it.",
"I was struck how easy it is to use the MyChart app. Access to my providers' notes, labs, X-ray interpretation, and medications ordered gives me the ability to have a current status report on my health status. Beyond the clinical features, the reminders of upcoming appointments and billing information have been extremely helpful.",
"I love this app it's super helpful to see everything in one place. Makes a busy life a lot easier to manage. ^,^ It would be nice if it had a spot to log things like glucose, food, and BP for doctors if that's something you habe to track but I mean it's not a big deal to just wrote it down old school style. (:",
"Sorry guys, but it can't be that you are not able to connect to server for straight 2 weeks now. Have uninstalled the app, re-installed, checked my internet connections, no matter which device (also my husband and his account): nothing! 2weeks no access to myChart through the app and still counting.",
"navigation is horrendous. It forces you to logout and login when viewing different screens. I use the fingerprint login feature. If its a Hippa issue, you should be able to verify the user on the next screen you want to view whether it be by password or fingerprint, not force you to log out and login.",
"I like the app alot. Get answers to questions without having to wait on hold or keep calling an office. A plethora of resources to access like end of life and health issues info. One place to access my records from multiple providers in different health systems. One small negative, wish my med list could separate prn from regular meds.",
"Great app! It's easy to use, I can easily export upcoming appointments to my calendar. I can check in to appointments the day of the appointment. Best of all, I get notified when my test results are available and I can view them from the app.",
"It is very convenient and fast. I like doing the paperwork via MyChart so you don't have to rush filling out handwriting the forms in the waiting room trying to get done before they call your name. Also, it is so convenient to find or send records. Love it!",
"Best Med Chart App! I've used several & this one is not only the easiest to navigate, it's also the easiest to teach someone to use. Updates are supper smooth, no ads popping up, just all the info I need in one spot. Love it.",
I think this is the best app ever!! I can send a message to my Dr's & get a response quick. I use to be able to view the notes from my visits and I can't now 😕.I use my chart app all the time. especially my upcoming appt's... can't seem to get the virtual video to work maybe it's just me ...,
"It is not logical. Random items are lsted. Cant update items such as - Can't add a vaccine that isn't listed. Items are listed that don't make sense. Such as a change in how to take an rx. It says theres a change but doesn't tell you what the change is. The ""change"" is mis information and should say rx was renewed by provider.",
"Gets worse after each update to ""improve"" the app. After last one things won't load, the screen goes blank when trying to pay bill and it keeps saying server error. It becomes less and less user friendly.",
Whenever I try to log in from the application. It's never worked for me anymore. I get the notification but when I log in that stupid thing never opens. I have to go into my mail and open it from the link. It's so fursutared. Can someone just fix that? It's very annoying now !!,
"This app has made staying in touch with my team of doctors and surgeons super easy. Besides being able to talk to my doctors when I have questions, I can also see my test results when they are available, make appointments, find new providers, and a few other things. That's kind of awesome because doctors get busy easily and this app, I believe, allows them the time they need to respond, without feeling completely swamped. I don't know though. I do know it's made my care a lot better. TY PPLZ!",
"Easy to read. Easy to find important answers, dates, and what the next important issues are, etc. Everything you need to know is listed very simply, to find quickly. Overall, very satisfied-dont change a thing. Thanks for providing this good app for us. ☺",
"This app is very useful. It gives you all the details of upcoming appointments, allows you to view your test results, and the option to pay any bills and co-pays. Also, it lists all your medications with an option to request refills. You can communicate with your Dr. by messaging as well.",
"I like that all my medical info is linked in one place. This is a real time saver since one can provide info, answer questionnaires, before a visit. I like the electronic check-in when I arrive for an appointment - no waiting in line. The message feature is great for communication with doctors & PAs. Test results are posted as soon as they are completed. This saves a lot of paper.",
"I love this app. It's easy to use and I like that you can sign in with a passcode, and if you forget your full sign on, it's easy to retrieve through email. Also, that you have your medical information right there. The only thing I wish it would do is show your test results while you are in the hospital instead of after you're discharged. But, that is probably a hospital decision.",
Terrible...For several weeks now when I try to log in it says there was a problem communicating with the server which renders the app totally useless. Several emails to support have gone unanswered. Terrible app all the way around.,
"Having multiple mycharts is annoying, especially since this apps garbage and never loads anything and just gives me errors. I linked my other accounts and it refuses to show them cause ""you dont have an account here"" despite having one there longer. Nothing medical related has ever been useful for me, and this app is the icing",
"I have found it very useful. However, this whole weekend is frustrating. I keep getting internal server errors and am looking at labs tomorrow for surgery Wednesday. Bad timing. I'm sure y'all can't really help that, but it's disconcerting.",
"Very nice app for keeping all my medical info in one place. You do have to use providers that also use MyChart (hasn't been a problem, but I use a large network) I use it quite often to check appointments, communicate with providers, refill prescriptions and a BUNCH of other suff. My providers network was hacked recently, and I really missed having access to MyChart (provider severed connection during recovery)",
"I absolutely love this app. It is so easy to manage. And its so convenient & has everything i need to know about my health history. I can do everything right from the app, refill meds, schedule appointments, communicate with my doctor, i can review all my medical records and test results. I recommend anyone who uses GHC to download the app!!",
"So useful to be able to check for appointments, read consultants letters. Things I would like improved blood tests showing creatinine/eGFR numbers. Also the upcoming tests don't really explain their timings. They have an expiry but don't say if/when I should book them for. Overall I am very grateful for the easy access.",
"Have not been able to log in for a week. Always says ""problem communicating with the server"". However I can log into the website no problem. Update 9/11/20. App is finally working again. The app really helps me to see my test results and appointments.",
"Absolutely indispensable! with all of the updates I can do everything from this app. View test results, schedule appts, pay my bill, review my doctor's notes and request refills for my meds. I can't even imagine going back into the dark ages when we didn't have this available to us. Love the Cleveland Clinic and love My Chart!!!!;",
"MyChart is the best thing that the medical professionals have come up with. It is simple and easy to access all your records, appointments and ability to contact your doctor without having to actually see them for something simple as a question or concern that you might have. Great time saver.",
"Two step verification. If you're going to send a person back to their email, have a link to go straight to the app. After checking the email and going back to the app, the bloody thing starts you all over again. Absolutely nonsensical. You need 2 devices just check in.",
"MyChart is a wonderful app! I usually receive answers to any messages sent within 24 hrs if not by return msg then ai receive a call. The app is easy to navigate & very dependable! It's great for use during times like now with Covid 19, I am 62 & prefer to not have any more exposure than necessary!",
"While in theory, this app would provide applicable interactions and communications but, currently it does not. Upon launch, there was a void between Drs & patients while ""somebody "" tried to figure it out. I yet have the ability to verify my email address and a questionnaire pops up for EVERY appointment even if no changes and/or same Department and care provider. I personally don't have the time nor inclination to participate in redundancy. PLEASE FIX THE BUGS! Launch = Stages!",
"Tried numerous times to log into Geisinger My Chart and I keep getting the error message that my user name or password is incorrect. I checked, both are correct. I can sign on no issues on my laptop, but the app won't recognize me. Gave up, uninstalled. I'll go online where it works.",
"I like the idea of having direct access to my medical information. It's quick and very easy to use. The app keeps tracks of all kinds of important info such as the medicines I take, my health diagnosis and test, surgeries and appointments. I really like being able to find out what I need and can usually find here.",
"When trying to correct a billing amount, or at least write someone an email about it, I find I can't ask any question anywhere RIDICULOUS! I log into My Chart; it tells me I have a new Systems Message. It tells me to sign in to MyChart. I just did; it's how I can see the message that there was something new!! STUPID STUPID! So I do it again anway and the bouncing Clare head-- I hate her-- sends me only to categories you've made up with no room for me to add something like Systems Messages.",
Two-factor only offers insecure email and phone verification. Please add proper token-based two-factor authentication support for actual increased security from two-factor authentication. It's a well-known documented and research fact that Sim spoofing is insanely easy so phone number is basically useless an email is also easily compromised. I know that some people prefer those and they should remain as an option but please also add an option for token-based Authentication,
"A friendly app that's beneficial and convenient for me. I often get ""server error"" msgs and can't connect but that could be probs on my end. The only other challege has been virtual appts - I always have to access/connect using the browser.",
Because this app failed to sync with the MyChart DB at UMICH I missed my appointment Do you know or even give a damn how hard it is to get a surgeon appt? Was it too much of me to expect a basic function like syncing should work? The financial statements aren't syncing either. What a piece of garbage. What ever happened to testing basic application functionality before releasing updates?,
Don't use this app on your cellphone for video visit because it will overheat and not work properly. My cellphone is now messed up really bad. I can't listen to music on apps now because it starts to overheat. So now I got to buy a new cellphone. I will not be using this app anymore because it will ruin your cellphone.,
Use to be able print now with the latest updates cannot print out what I use to. Turned a good app to being almost usless. I am using the same my chart since the beginning in 2008 printing worked fine till the last couple of updates and now does not work.,
"Usually this app works for me but today when trying to sign in with my passcode (on my Android phone app) I was just getting the circle loading symbol. I finally got into my account and could see the main menu but clicking on the message I was notified about, which I could partially see, slow loads into almost completely white blank screen with a header at the top. I did an update on the app as well and this didn't fix the issue. Hopefully this corrects itself later just like it suddenly stopped",
"It's nice to be able to message and receive messages back from PCP/ Medical assistant and that part is great.. The part that I'd frustrating is when I tried to link all my mychart/ecare/ etc..they weren't all linked and constantly locked out of my account , continually having to change passwords ...it's a pain in the rearend.",
Very frustrating. Transferred to another phoned. My log in information did not transfer user name and password did not transfer with it did not work. So i tried several times to change it with the help of others it still would not accept my request. So now the app that wàs once very helpful to me is useless and If you could possibly help me get this straightened out i would gratefully appreciate it. I have already tried new passwords and usewords.,
"I am very old school and with all the ability for a hack to get into this is always a factor that baing said I think this is greatest thing since soap ,can communicate without tying up phones the inconvenience of all that goes with phone I can create several messages at same time see all test results something I would have had to ask for years ago . Also the ability for being able to obtain info I think is awesome especially if u have health issues and are actively trying to improve urself.",
"EVERY TIME I try to log in, it says there was a problem with log in until max out attempts, then I have to redo my password, log in again, get the multiple text verifications, JUST to use the app, EVERY TIME. If there were an easier way to communicate with my medical providers, I would certainly use that, not this junk app.",
In theory this app should be great and less time consuming! This app is very frustrating! Just setting it up with my medical records was hard enough. But the next time I tried to log in it told me invalid user/password! I have to enter a verification code every time I log in which is a hassle because the insurance company takes forever to send that.,
"I had been happily using the app for years. However, after the 2/25/2021 update, the app stopped working on my One Plus 6t phone. It had worked perfectly beforehand. Upon clicking on the app, a blank white page comes up asking me to click to switch organizations. When I click on HHC (my only org) I am returned to the blank page. I e-mailed EPIC and was told the issue would be referred HHC, but I no one from either org has contacted me since. Looks like a case of finger pointing. How can I get this resolved? Who is responsible? HELP!",
"Love using this for my prescriptions....instead of having to call in and ask questions, I can just log on to my chart and look through all my medications and pretty much find out all the details, as well as have them refilled. I also receive text messages to log on when they are ready to be picked up and make sure everything is good to go before I make the trip to the pharmacy. ♡♡♡♡♡ this app!!!!!",
"This app opens okay, but after I follow a link to a section of MyChart, there is no way to get back to the main menu. I've tried swiping every which way and touching the icons on the screen, but nothing works. I have to shut it down and log in all over again. It's useless.",
"No notifications for prescriptions. I don't open this app every day, it would be useful if I received a notification that my prescription has been sent to the pharmacy, which pharmacy it was sent to, when it is ready for pickup, and if there was a problem filling it for whatever reason. I can message my doctor but I never hear back from them. All my notifications are turned on for this app.",
"The most convenient medical app ever. Everything is in one place. I can literally keep track of my appointments as well as my children's appointments. What I love most is being able to request refills, & checking in to appointments with a push of a button. No call waiting, or standing in line to check in at the doctors office. THANK YOU MY CHART!!! 10 out of 10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
It works but also has issues. It did not give me a username upon creating an account. Once signed put I had to use the forgot username link and the app would not allow me to put in my credentials. It showed the boxes but would not allow me to click on them and bring up my key board. Galaxy S20 Ultra,
"This app is great in theory and sucks in practice. I frequently have to log out and back in multiple times to get anything done, as I'm consistently met with errors. Might as well just call the doctor and sit on hold rather than try to message them through this crappy platform.",
Does what it is supposed to but I am constantly having a hard time connecting to the app or reading messages even if I have an internet connection. Also the interface isnt super great its a little confusing and difficult to navigate,
"I like the message function. I gave app 4 stars and not 5 because, the previous system/app, used by my health care provider, allowed me to graph test results over time; for example, I could track my A1C changes over time (several years, I think).",
"Wonderful app! All my medical details from my clinic and hospital are so easy to access. Covers past visits, upcoming appointments and tests, and completed test results. I can make appointments using app. All my medications and supplements are listed. I am able to send messages to my providers. I can use the app to pay providers and also to have billing details available. I do recommend!",
"MyChart is the best way to keep in touch with your healthcare team, get test results and keep your health records. You can see things done in different health systems (even in different states) all in one place (if they all use Epic). There is one thing that I think should improve. MyChart is only in English. This is a big inclusion issue.",
Conceptually an excellent tool. External factors have been frustrating. Telehealth and payment processing failed 90% of the time. Finally figured out it was the phone operating system. It removed permissions on a regular basis. WHAT???,
"Love this app. My son has about 8 different doctors and this is the best way to get ahold of them and the nurses. Way better than calling and waiting for a response from them. Only reason I took a star away was because the app crashes and is down at least one time a week. Otherwise it's user friendly and pretty smooth working. Everything is pretty straightforward! I recommend it, especially for people that have multiple doctors!",
"This is the best app that I have used. It's so easy to navigate and being able to contact someone by email instead of staying on hold on the phone saves so much time. I love the efficiency and convenience, as well as, the reminders and alerts. It's truly a life-saver for me.",
"The ""MyChart"" app provides a clear detailed understanding of my health information and treatment. All treatment information and test results are readily available to me. It tracks and reminds me of my upcoming appointments, it is impossible to miss or forget an appointment. All of my medication details are itemized and easily available. Also, communication with my doctor is a breeze. This app is supplements my health care perfectly. I can't have one without the other.",
Eliminates paper and historically records all interactions with my doctors. Allows for electronic check-in for my appointments and automatically puts all my appointments to my calendar. Great tool for someone that has a lot of medical stuff going on as well as the occasional user.,
Have to continuously check for messages by opening the app to look for meshes or replies. Notifications does not work properly even though it is turned on in my android phone. Reinstalled app twice and checked settings and permissions are on. Still doesn't notify properly of new messages.,
"The best, easiest to use, most intuitive and user friendly patient portal I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. It's all here from the simple login to finding whatever you are looking for or accomplishing whatever you need. Great app",
I love this app. I can fill out all the paperwork in my living room while drinking my coffee. I can set an notification on my phone to notify them when I have arrived. I can request medication refills. I can go into my chart and update any changes that accure. It's a wonderful app.,
"It's annoying that there is no back button or ""x"" to get from test results to home. Have to re-login on every test result. This is on Android 12. Was doing it on Android 11 as well. iOS doesn't have this issue at all.",
"Didn't work, unable to sign in despite numerous attempts, just easier to access my account via the webpage *Edit* After a further attempt to use the app. I'm trying to use the app, however the verification code is constantly taking well in excess of the 10 minute validity time to come through meaning it's constantly excited and I can't sign in to my account.",
It's a good app to have if you go to doctors and labs often. It's a large app with more than 100mb. It has a big issue which is that when you get messages or test results you won't be able to print them.,
"A badly designed app intended to serve as your health portal. Information is not updated and many times false. Making appointments is a pain, and there's no way to make follow up nursing appointments. Also no way to delete Dr's that have left (they frequently do), so when presented with options for appts half of the Dr listed don't work there any longer.",
This app is very easy to use. I don't get any ads. I like getting my test results asap. And I like emailing my Dr. The only thing I have a problem with is the number of notifications on the icon. I can be all over this app and the notification don't always decrease.,
We like this app very much. It allows us to keep in contact with our Drs office much easier than a phone call. Lab results are fast and educational. I like the new ability to switch between me and my wife without having to sign in again.,
"I love my providers at the UofU, but I hate MyChart and the Emergency Room providers. MyChart is down more than it works. I have retried to install the app to my phone 3 times now and it's still ""pending"". More than half the time I try to check for my appointment instructions the app is not working and I have to call the provider's office.",
The SEND button on the lower right corner in the MESSAGE needs to be moved somewhere else especially when you're working on a mobile device. You accidentally hit the SEND button too many times it's ridiculous. Please Move the SEND button immediately.,
Medical Items added by patient disappeared. Quite difficult to add information in correct areas. Menus are hard to navigate. Updates and corrections are hard to do. Some drop down menus are lacking easy to use data points. Capitalization in some fields need fixed.,
"Love this app! I use it DAILY multiple times a day. My meds, allergies, history, messages, bills, everything, results, visits, scheduling, even messaging my team is available. Everything you could want at your fingertips! I've even pulled up my allergies when I had to call 911 when I was having chest pains and couldn't breathe and took a ride to the ER and the paramedics found it VERY USEFUL to have my meds and allergies all there. Multicare and providence combined! Keep up awesomeness!",
"This is very helpful. Helps me to keep up with my appointments and to schedule appointments also. Let me know what doctor, the time, and also the day of my appointments. It also allows me to cancel if I can't make it or view earlier appointments that are available. This app also sends reminders in advance so that I can keep up with my appointments.",
"Update: After giving you all of the information that you asked for you now insist that you cannot find this review. Your whole system is messing up, website and app! Up until very recently I've been very happy with the staff. It's a little cluttered but it has worked well. Now it just doesn't work at all. I get error messages anytime I try to open anything and I have to go to the website to get anything done. The app is useless to me now. Hope this gets fixed soon.",
My issues have nothing to do with the app itself. It is great I love it and how it works. The app is wonderful and so informative keeps me up on my meds and tests if only I understood some of the test results and was informed about whether they were good or not and what I should or shouldn't do. I ask but it takes time to get answers and sometimes don't.,
"I only use this app because it is my surgeon's office method of communication. However, the message and billing portion are the only things that work on my Samsung phone. I can't review test results, letters or documents on my phone. So inconvenient.",
"Helpful and easy to use. One suggestion though. When I receive a notification to log on for new info it is not clear what is new. I have to search messages, test results, reminders, etc and sometimes find nothing. Why not list it right on top?",
"Too many errors, blurry ineligible documents from my doctor, server errors, won't save my login info even with the box checked, and information provided is in codes and is hard to understand unless you're the medical professionals who provided it. Seems more doctor-friendly than patient-friendly. Everyone I know who was told to use this app by their doctor is frustrated with it.",
"Convenient to have everything in one place, but the app is a bit confusing due to the myriad of types of information. For example, a ""Letter"" is distinct from a ""Message"", so you need to look for those in different places.",
"I love being able to message your Dr's (any of them!) And get a response in usually less than 24h. The TeleHealth is well integrated although it is not as easy as a zoom/teams call. It's great to have a secure place for all these things, on your cel phone!",
"This app is fantastic! I have been a Sansum Clinic patient since the beginning. It's so easy, convenient and secure. It's now a quicker way to communicate with my health care providers. Love the telehealth option.",
Mychart was 5 stars before the update. Now I can't navigate the sight at all. I can't message my doctor or schedule an appointment. It is pretty much useless for managing your Healthcare. Some of the new features are nice but should've been combined with the old features instead of used to replace them.,
It has been so helpful to use this app during my health emergency. All my information in one place. Able to reach out to all of my doctors and keep up with appointments and my medications at the same time. The only thing I would say is negative would not be because of the App but that the doctors don't always immediately respond. Other than that I have no issues!!!,
"I absolutely love this app.. It's interface is the coolest, and very easy to use.. it has all the appointments and lab test (results) information, so you don't have to call and ask.. has many other great/useful features as well.",
it is a fantastic app but I would like to see some changes 1.messages I would like to swipe left or right to go from one message to the other also on test results I would like to be able to copy and paste into Google so that I could find out the layman's version of what the medical people are talking about. I would like a dark theme,
"I like having access to my medical records, lab test results, and imaging/procedure notes at my fingertips. Doctors don't seem to have time to cover all of those in detail. And let's face it...educated medical consumers are better patients. My only issue is that there is a lot of redundant information presented.",
This app is extremely helpful especially for forgetful people like myself. It's also easy and convenient to use. I can look back at a past visit or test and see the trends of my bloodwork results for instance. Love it and use it all the time.,
"There are problems with MyChart. If a Doctor makes a mistake in his/her comments under "" lab results."" It stays there forever. Good Luck trying to correct it. There is no deleting a comment in this section. Only in "" messages"" can a comment be deleted. This causes a problem in maintaining correct patient information. I can see many problems to come, which could be avoided due to this format used in MyChart...lab results.",
"This is an unbeatable way of receiving results of tests, meetings, scans etc straight to your phone as soon as they are available. Allyour records are then kept in sequence for easy referral. I am SO glad I have this App.",
After entering my passcode the app will open. However when I attempt to open something the app crashes. This is something new. I have sent two messages with no response. I sent first one 2 weeks ago.,
"User interface is a little overcomplicated, but it seems to work for the most part. Having trouble paying my bill on the app, however. Whenever I try to click ""pay bill"" under billing summary an error occurs on the server.",
"I use My Chart regularly to keep track of my appointments, vaccinations, test results and communications with my PCP. The security and convenience make it one of the best tools for good health as a senior. Thank you for the excellent design and updates!",
"Easy to use ,and navigate through your medical information, shows reminders of up coming appts ,after doctor visit summaries, let's you know what tests you need ,or flu shot reminders. You can read your lab results, after the tests you take. Also contact your physician if you have questions or need to change appts. Overall, pretty convenient app,also less use of paper and a great way to stay in check with your health.",
"Super helpful and easy to use. I can contact my doctor directly for anything I need to ask about and get my test results sent directly to me within a couple of days at most. It allows me to view past test results as well. So no more searching for years old papers, in hopes I still even have them. Definitely worth a download.",
I love having the app because with my memory alot of times I can go back and look at what was discussed. Only downfall is alot of times the app hasn't been working or it freezes and closes. But all in all I like being able to talk with nurses or Dr on the app,
"For most part it is pretty good app. The biggest problem I have, as a retired person, is it always asks for my and wife's date of retirement. Would be OK if I could type in mm/dd/yyyy format but it makes us pick from calendar and we are forced to go back month by month....I retired in 2013 and wife in 2016. What a pain!",
"Almost perfect, except I'd like the ability to dismiss all reminders, etc. Sometimes I get referrals and go to doctors who don't use MyChart. So even though I've had appointment I still get reminders on the main screen and it makes it cluttered.",
"This WAS a great app, however after the most recent update it became useless. I am unable to get past the login screen no matter whether I'm using a passcode or my username and password. It's frustrating to have to find a computer to get my test results, reminders about appointments or to send a message to my physician.",
"It's a great idea to have all your test results as soon as they are processed and in one place. It's also great to have the ability to share your chart with whatever medical professional you are seeing. The verifying of your info is to a fault sometimes, but all in all, a very good app.",
It's new user experience design is way easier to navigate for me. The fact that I still could be login in one while checking on other organizations are easier to navigate. I can view test results check messages from my care team thank you for the easier layout from deastop to phone. Consider that the app is the same way. I will come back with 4star rating.,
This app is amazing and very helpful for me as well as my children. In syncs with other hospital and doctor's on the list. It in my case makes it easy to pull up any info I need to tell them if I forget something . Log in is easy as far password it simple just to do a pin. Doctor's and staff respond quick even on weekends and always making sure your health comes first.,
I use the app 2-3 times a day. The main problem is that the links in the Upcoming Visit reminder Do Not take you to the relevant Upcoming Visit rendering them useless. I do enjoy the Send Note and Appointment Scheduling sections. It's a very useful app that could be a lot better.,
Worst App ever!!! There are so many problems since their last update that I get a headache everytime I try to navigate my way through the plethora of problematic changes they've made to MyChart. This is NOT a helpful or user friendly app. Former versions were SO much better!,
There is one real important thing and that is there are times when I go and see a specialist or have to go to the emergency room for one thing or another. All of these doctors do a fantastic job of writing down in detail all procedures with results of all the test that has been done. Fantastic. Now the doctors or nurse practitioners want even put down the shots they have given you and it appears that you haven't had any shots at all when you know of most of them but not all.,
"Overall the app is organized well, well equipped with features, and functional. However, there is no Dark Mode, making the overly bright color scheme annoying and hard to look at. If a Dark Mode is added, I would happily give 5 stars 🌟",
"In my account, I linked 3 organizations who all use MyChart. Please provide a central MyChart support contact to troubleshoot the error message that says an organization is having difficulty accessing data from another one. The wording of the error message clearly states a data access failure, *not* an issue with limited permissions set by an organization. As the user it is difficult to determine on whose end the data problem resides, and each organization's support just blames the other place.",
"Excellent app. Very helpful for the patient. I'm a 73 year old patient of Leon Health and I use this app constantly. I use it for everything, refills, appts,test results. It's very much user friendly. Thank you Epic for creating this. Only one suggestion, have a module to be able to schedule transportation.",
"I just was sending my Primary Care Dr a question as a follow up to recent labs, and the app abruptly logged me out before my message was completed and sent. When I logged back in, the lengthy, detailed message was completely gone without a trace. I am so mad right now, to re-create this message will be an exhausting ordeal..I was logged in and working on the detail of this follow-up question for about 40 continuous minutes..why NO WARNING MESSAGE BEFORE GETTING BOOTED OUT?! Total BS..",
Easy to navigate. Reminders for everything. Updates you immediately when you receive test results or questionnaires. Easy to talk to your doctor via message. Easy to cancel and reschedule appointments in seconds.,
"So Far, Great! I love being able to access my results before I go in and speak with my doctor. Its helped me take charge in things I need to change and what I need to work on. I'm also extremely forgetful of when and where my appointments are, but this app has been a life saver every time. More places should use MyChart!",
"This app is AMAZING. I love this tool and have been using it for years. I can make and cancel my own appointments, check my test results the moment they come in, often before the doctor even sees them-and can compare all test results from years before. I can send messeges to doctors, and read appointment summaries and notes. Office directions, e-check in's, appointment reminders etc. Can't recommend it enough.",
I like the app because I can get all my medical appointments and results before I even go see the Dr. But for 2 days now I have not been able to access the app. It keeps saying it cannot connect to the server and to try again later. I have already Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. And it still doesn't work. Please fix,
"Excellent setup. Wonderful way to communicate to doctor with updates on condition, questions, and medication refills. A great way to review results of lab and x-ray results and for doctor comments regarding them. It's nice to be able to see upcoming appointments and get reminders as well as pre-registration. I highly recommend and appreciate this app.",
It's complete garbage. would give no stars but not an option. I can't access anything. I have multiple test results that this system can't recognize my info and tells me call support. it can't even do a simple password reset.,
"I really love the app however... being in the health field & myself having multiple health issues, I personally would like to see some kind of health journal/tracker/pain & sleep log, etc.. incorporated into this app. patients to enter their own info for better treatment in f/u care & tracking. With all the bogus apps out there, I would like to think the health systems that use this app would want this for their patients as well. Just a suggestion.",
"I have found this app very useful and helpful for appointment scheduling and reminders as well as getting after visit summaries from appointments with the doctors I've seen. I just think it's a very usable, helpful platform for patient-doctor connection.",
"Difficulties keeping a train of communication current. Each topic gets a new header, and older messages are not easily accessible. The notifications lag, and newer messages are not always on top. It's okay, better than nothing, but KaiserPermanentes is far better.",
could use more options when booking and scheduling apointments. like showing what they have available instead just putting in your availability. also need the ability to move between patients. I cannot access my children's records easily. i have to leave the app. makes it time consuming.,
I could not get into the chart for my information. I was trying to transmit pictures to my Doctor but was not able to do so.Keeps saying unable to find server. I do not know who is keeping track of the numbers on this program but 4.7 seems very high when yo have to wait 10 hrs for a return call and that was on the portal you could actually access.,
"It's nice but the messages have stopped working for several days if not a week or more. There's no way to report the issue in the app. It also sucks that billing isn't in the app and has to be done through emails that rarely get recieved. Overall, it's nice but needs work.",
"Sometimes hard to use. I get notices that there is a message, but there is none. I get notices on other issues, BUT don't get them when a new referral is added, or new information. Needs to be consistant. Other then those problems, it has been a good app.",
"This was a great app when I first started using. It provided easy access to substantial personal health information. Then like others have mentioned, accessing your medical info at the sign in became frustrating. I think something is wrong with the sign in and password. I have 1 password that works online only. can you fix?",
"The MyChart app is easy to use and I like how I can leave a message for my Doctor and they will get all the info I need them to have, without struggling with a third-party person. It's unfortunate, but at times it's hard to have someone take a message with all of the important information that you need to get to your Doctor. It's also easy to check on your upcoming appts and look at and print out copies of prior appt records. I would recommend this app for anyone to try. (Doctors too)",
"Pharmacy refill request system is unpredictable & undependable. Getting this working properly should be a high priority as it is much more efficient than voice phone calls. In the past I could enter requests, within 24 hours get confirmation of the requests, then an info message of when meds would be ready to pickup. Simple, no fuss both parties handled the transaction in a convenient & efficient manner",
"The new enhanced version is confusing and difficult to navigate. The messages read like texts. The messages are difficult to manage. I have yet to figure out how to sort messages by sender, date or chronology. The graphics remind me of game. I've looked for something positive and have yet to find it.🙁🙁🙁👎👎👎",
Extremely helpful. Im not very high tech but I can do the basics on my phone. The my chart seems overwhelming at first but once you get to know the site you realize you are connected to ALL your doctors. You can send them a message and typically hear back the same day or first thing the next day. You can get your refills on your medications . You see your past/present appointments. Shows notes about what you discussed. This is one of the best time saving apps available.,
"App doesn't work at all, I can't log in, I can't do username or password recovery to check if I'm just putting in the wrong details, the Web based version just says ""page cannot be loaded."" I need to be able to see a message and the results of a recent hospital visit and can't access them at all. Terrible system.",
App gets glitchy. It asks to confirm email address but also doesn't work. The medical records documents to download isn't accurate with what's on file. And too many repeated messages on the main screen that cannot be dismissed.,
Latest update broke the ability to switch organizations. It always opens the same organization no matter which one I actually tap. Only fix seems to be removing fingerprint authentication from every account. I switched to passcode and that works.,
"Best way to stay in touch with providers, keep up to date on test results/ appointments, and the location is helpful as it lets the check in office know when you arrive to the premesis which is always helpful if you're running a little behind. Best way to have in pocket access to your own personal medical history/ children's medical history/information. Easy to navigate, never had an issue out of the 2 years I've had my chart, also helps me keep up with what prescription medication I also take.",
"Features of the app do not work most of the time. In particular, letters/messages between providers and patient. If you can access them, they are read only. You can't screen-shot or print them because of HIPAA.",
I haven't been able to log in since last week. Keep getting a message saying there was a problem communicating with the server and to try again later. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it still doesn't work. It's a shame as I found it very useful to keep track of my daughter's hospital appointments and letters until it stopped working.,
"User-friendly interface, overall, it makes my healthcare much easier to manage. I used to have to schedule hours to make an appointment or call for random stuff, but with MyChart, I can schedule, request refills, etc within just a couple minutes.",
"Works great with Google calendar. Out of all of my apps I will absolutely tell anyone reading this MyChart app is the best app I have. Never any ad's, 99.9% of the time it's working perfectly, best way for the patient's to work with the people that provide our healthcare. I can get the lab work results just minutes after they worked on the blood or whatever. I can message health care people, request appointments, see what events are next to do, read notes & after visit summaries. 20star app!",
"The info I need is in the app but can't go back to home screen once I select to view something e.g. test results, appointments. I have to log out and log back in each time, I've done this 5 times in a row. That's why I gave it 2 stars, this isn't user friendly.",
Love having all my needed information in one convenient place. The app updates almost immediately when appointments are scheduled. The after visit summary is posted before I leave the parking lot sometimes. Having access to all my past blood test results helps me see if I'm on track to getting and staying healthy.,
Extremely useful excellent service always functional and very convenient for both the medical care provider as well as the patient. This app and service works flawlessly for me and keeps me up to date with follow ups prescriptions in most cases same day test and lab results pass results even overdue exams and vaccinations or upcoming ones. I highly recommend this application it's phenomenal get this app and have unlimited access to you own medical records everywhere anytime when you need it!!!!,
"I love this app, I think all doctors should have it because it helps people keep track of there appointments, test results, past due exams needed, stuff you need to get done for your doctor, you can message your doctor of any questions, schedule appointments, ask for refills on your medication's & everything on the go. Great app & I recommend it to everyone. I hope all doctors see this app as beneficial & get it so everyone can keep there medical needs up to date. Need notification button!!",
"Good app. Saves lots of time with communicating with various doctors and also making or changing appointments. Plus, i have access to all my meds, vacine/booster schedules, ect all in one place. I recomend getting the app and taking a few min to check out a its features.",
"Love being able to see results of visits, tests, etc. One place for all medical stuff including prescriptions. Make and cancel appointments in a click or two. You can link most of the doctors, and your accounts in one place. Love this app so much!! 5 star rating!! Highly recommended!!",
"If you forget your password, or try too many times, you get locked out. Forever. You cannot communicate with the administrator. Also, app won't allow two patients to log in/out on same phone. Pointless.",
glitchy .. you can't even schedule an appointment in the app .. mail system is horrible .. UI navigation is hit and miss .. app is sluggish and not very responsive most of the time .. unable to close out certain notifications and or having very thin little control over what you can control 💬,
"MyChart disappeared after my phone updated on its own. When I go to my apps in my phone shows I don't have it anymore, but when I bring it up here, it shows it's installed. But it's not, and I have no way of getting it back seemingly....so yes...I hate it.",
I haven't had any issues while using the app. It's made it really convenient as far as seeing lab results and communicating with my health team. It also is nice having the option to do e- check in so I can take care of my copays before even going in to the office,
This app pretty good. It has navigation dead ends...like if you have multiple test to veiw there is no back button to get back to the main menu. Closing the app and logging back in to review test results gets old fast.,
"I like the recent update it's easy and user friendly to use. I love the layout and you can do a lot, request visits and refill, see lab results, etc. It's very handy, like looking at your own health record. Love it :)",
"Overall, I love Epic as both a RN and a patient. The new app design isn't so great though. The design is childish and 99% of Epic's amazing functionality is buried deep in the app. If I wasn't already aware of everything that could be accomplished in MyChart I'd never find it as a new user.",
"MyChart is a very impressive Healthcare management system. The app has made keeping all my appointments, test results, and communication with various care givers easily accessible. The app even allows me to obtain care estimates, apply for payment options, and more. It's fantastic! Bravo to the development team!",
This is a literal lifesaver. I use it daily to monitor my medical needs and communicate with a busy doctor's office without having to wait on hold for long periods of time. Having all of your medical charts and reminders for vaccinations and tests is amazing! It's changed my life and the ease at which I'm able to look after myself.,
"One of the most important things is for the patient to have manual control over who is part of their care team. With this app, care givers are added whether they are just one time visits in the ER or urgent care or a result of shopping for the right doctor and deleted automatically in an arbitrary period of time or because the list is too full. After that, messages can't be managed in any way so you can put them into folders, etc. You just have to rely on the search tool which is cumbersome.",
"I'd like to use a unique, long, complex password made using a password generator, but this app doesn't allow pasting. So instead I have to make one that's short and memorable enough for the ""enter your new password twice."" Not cool.",
"I really enjoy using MyChart. I love that all my medical information is available to me in one place. I also like that I can go back and look at past test results, pay my bill, and look at upcoming appointments. It's extremely easy to navigate too!",
This APP does not work! Messages don't come through at all. I keep getting error messages. Have removed from phone and reloaded three times with same results. No stars at all unless they force it to make review go through,
"I love using MyChart. I can find out when my doctor's appointments are, tests, procedures, x-rays etc. are. It is easy to use. I can even have video visit with my doctor and save me a trip to the office unless I need some lab work done. Also I can check test results it's just a wonderful app. And so easy to use",
This is a great application to use on my phone and my tablet but when I try to log onto my health care provider's website on my computer it no longer recognizes my password and I have to constantly request a new one. I didn't have this issue before installing MyChart and I am wondering is this is an issue related to having MyChart downloaded on my other devices? Other than that the application is very helpful and easy to access and I haven't had any other problems with the application itself.,
"I went for a covid test. Results are supposed to available in 2 days or less. It's been 2 days and I keep checking this app under test results, nothing. I want to ask a question or troubleshoot? There is literally no way to contact any type of support. I think I'll go into messages and maybe reply to my ""visit"" carbon-copied response. Replies not allowed. I call cvs, it's out of their hands, nothing they can do. Refer to the app. The whole system is garbage, not wasting time or money here again.",
"Great way to find test results & communicate with physicians. But it's a royal pain to use b/c every time you want to look at a different test result, you have to exit the app and log back in. There should be a back arrow to go back to the main screen.",
"App fails to remember account information. I have ""opened"" my account 3 times with different user names and passwords. Each time upon returning there ""incorrect information"" notices requiring a complete account renewal. WAY TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE USEFUL.",
"Making appointments in this app is a waste of time. Two times the app has changed my appointment to whatever it wants. This is not what I selected nor confirmed. Your app is taking away time I could be doing something else. If I select an available time that is offered, DO NOT CHANGE IT!!! OTHERWISE do not have the time available.",
"I think that I love this app because my doctor, the nurses, etc really pay attention to the messages. Also, everything is in one place so other doctors, facilities, nurses, testing, etc cross communicate. It's been very helpful and incredibly easy for me.",
"Every time I login it says there is a server error, but stuff appears to work. It is not as functional as the website, key features like time history graphs missing. But for the simpler stuff, it is good.",
"I enjoy using this app. It helps simplify checking at the doctor's office. I can avoid a lot unnecessary paper after my appointments since I can read my doctor's notes. Prescription refills are also made easy. And you can update your medication list. Finally, I like the way you can communicate with your doctor, nurse or PA. The greatest advantage of this app is that by using it as my means of communication I feel connected to my team of health care professionals.",
I've been using MyChart for my clinic for about a week and a half now. I got bloodwork done and all my results were in the app the next day! I was also able to send a message to my Dr and upload a form I needed signed. All my clinic notes are in there as well as any other info I need... It's really crazy how awesome this app is. Easy to use too. It really brings this stuff to a new level.,
"I found it based on scheduling and the limited amount of nurses, techs, in other support services that there can often be a stretching of the system in it's entirety. I found that using MyChart to make requests and to give me first hand glimpse of my hospital stay relative to my expected discharge date is so beneficial because it allows me to think and to get everything together in one way as to make it easier for the staff, it heightens my expectations because often we push the bed button",
"Damn near useless as an App Majority of the functions that the app theoretically provided as a service just bring you to a prompt that tells you that you have to log into the website to get said service haha. Good for seeing a bill though and getting notifications, but for anything else...just use the site because you have to anyway.",
I love this app it really helps. I would like to see a change and use this as my planner. I'm chronically ill so I have appointments outside of my doctors that associate with mychart. So for the appointments that are outside mychart I end up missing. It's mostly physical therapy referred by my doctor.,
The feature to see test results so quickly is amazing especially when the system notifies you by text that message and results are ready to view. I like how it can share details of appointments in my calendar including it's map directions. I liked seeing the variety of nearby blood testing facilities along with their available test time slots. The Pre Check In features streamline the arrival faster so you can fill out the questionnaire forms electronically at your leisure instead of in office.,
This makes medical stuff so much simpler and easier to manage. Only problem is all the offices need an on boarding manual as they will only use part of the app and take forever to switch over. But it's so convenient for me.,
"This app is consistently updated and has proved helpful in contacting my doctors, checking on appts and updating medlists. Updating vaccinations seems not to ""stick"" when I do it, but that may be a failure of medical staff and not the app. It seems to need their approval. Since I get vaccinations at the pharmacy (and there seems to be no communication between the pharmacy and the health plan) that aspect may need improvement. Apparently patient input is not accepted.",
"As per other reviews, app has been very unstable for me and asks me to re-enter information already entered. Also m, doesn't merge well with other Allina clinic's personal and medical records. Unfortunately, providers depend on this faulty app to manage health records.",
"I had trouble signing up. Directions are given after mistakes instead of before.....sometimes you just have to take a wild guess....finally got it after 5 frustrating attempts, which is why i never wanted to sign up..........dont know how long it will work or if I'll know how to fully use it, my phone is possessed and does what it wants not what i want......so dont count on this as my only way of communication, its definitely not...",
"Finally. Goodness gracious, been using My Chart for I don't know how years and finally the ability to schedule appts. via the app is here. Sheesh, been waiting forever for that one. Having to call in to schedule an appt. wasn't always convenient since I work during the hours the doctor offices are typically open. Now I can schedule an appt at 8pm or even on the weekends. It's great. Thanks Epic.👍🏼",
"My favorite feature of MyChart is the ability to communicate via an easy-to-use messaging section within the app with each of my providers! MyChart also makes it easy to schedule and view appointments, check-in online, view any payments due, log in using biometrics, includes push and/or email notifications, and so much more!",
"Nice app, works pretty well. Please implement a way for us to clear health reminders. I got a flu shot and some blood work at a different provider, and there's no way for me to clear the reminders for those. It gets wore annoying. Same issue for some vaccinations for my kids.",
This app is really good. It is easy to use and very fun to interact with my medical group. This gives me the power changey appointment dates and get vital information. This app also is easy for me to add the appointment date on my calendar. This a very well made app. Please keep up the very awesome work.,
"The worst app ever. God forbid you have to ever log in. On the computer it works, but the app does not. No customer support. Forgot username? Sure send an email. Wont do that either. Also, let's say you want to use cvs but then go to another provider. NOPE! The user names dont transfer. Cannot make a new account. At this point you are withholding medical information. This service is terrible.",
This app is very user friendly. It's easy to message nurse or dr. They reply quickly. Easy to pay a balance. Love getting test results asap and seeing the comparison to previous test results. I don't have any problems with the app.,
"It's so convenient and I get my questions answered in a timely manner, my test results before I even see the doctor, and I can get appointments and med adjustments immediately. You all ate not only professional but the absolute best. Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!",
I love this app easy to use and navigate even for an older inexperienced technically challenged individual. You can make appointments and communicate with your doctor easily through this app. I especially love that my prescription refills can easily be addressed through the app.,
"Was better before the changes, interface was more user friendly and it used to allow you to view if your messages had been read which is no longer an option, not sure if this a practice change or not, but it would be nice to have this feature back.",
"It doesn't work properly anymore, it is so slow, it lags, freezes, can't acess data/labs/test/etc, can't make app'ts anymore, different organizations can't update information from each other anymore. It's been like that for months!",
"I love the convenience of this app. Different doctors can easily review the other visits and medications I am taking. I get my test results quickly and can look back and compare progress myself. I get appointment reminders, pay my bill. It's great!",
"I have to create a new password most of the time I open the app. So I avoid checking my messages. I just want the information and not picking out new passwords. It causes a lot of anxiety for me, I do understand security. I have to have someone else open it for me or just throw the whole mess in the river.",
The app works consistently for scheduling appointments and sending messages. But did a recent update get rid of the ability to log in with your fingerprint? It used to be so convenient and now it's gone.,
"Some test results are unreadable that they are not in a proper HTML format. It's quite messy format! A spreadsheet will help to understand what test results said. Another than that, it's fairly good app.",
For as many times I have used it and for what I have used it for it has worked very well. App most definitely holds quite a lot of information all of which seem to be Very easy to understand and navigate to regardless what you may be looking for.,
"I like the option the MyChart App affords however, I am not a fan of how now there is a major lack of customer service. Everything goes through the app. Thank goodness I can swim but I feel for those that sink. It's not as intuitive as I would hope and I have a stupid outstanding balance I cannot pay (?!?) Come to find out you can only do this on line via the web page. Mind blown 😳 😐",
"There are many things that I like about this app: 1. Since both MD Anderson and Houston Methodist use it, my doctors at both can see all my test results 2. I like the format it uses to show test results. There is an indicator that shows where you are in the acceptable range (indicated by a black line on green) 3. Easy to communicate with my providers through messages 4. Easy log-on with a pin code 5. Being able to access my visit summaries 6. Can zoom in on large images like mammagrams or MRIs",
"I have used MyChart for years and have found it easy to navigate... until recently. Around the time that MyChart made some recent ""improvements"", the medical facilities that I were linked to my earliest MyChart are no longer linked. I am unable to correct this issue. And that creates a problem.",
"MyChart is a fantastic way for the individual to keep track of all the medical tests, procedures and visits. As an engineering type and educator there is never enough information to assist with my self-care. I have found it very easy to use, comprehensive and immediate. It gets better all the time.",
"The app is good but it could be better. If I wanted to elink other facilities is hard because you either cannot find them, there under different name and/or different state. If you put in the name of who you are looking it will not give it to it says unable to locate. You cannot submit requests for medicine you have to the messages to request your medicine. If you see doctors in location and they use mychart most of them do not show up.",
"Completely unusable. I keep being toldy password is wrong. I have confirmed I am using the correct password as it works for logging into my records directly on the website, but it will not work on the app. The app does not have a way to reset my past so I my only option is the one from the login on the website which does not work. I have reset my password on the website and it still would not work in the app. On top of this month keep getting errors saying ""service unavailable"".",
"I'm not the best patient and I have a bad habit of either forgetting things or over lapping things so since using the app I have done much better and for me that's a good thing. The my chart app has been great , I don't have a lot of time to sit on hold waiting to talk to someone or have someone call me back. Plus it's nice to get results from tests instead of having to wait till the next time I see the doctor or a letter in the mail.",
Biometric authentication is broken on Android. Any interruption from the expected flow results in the feature being disabled and a password being required. After a few iterations of this nonsense I was forced to change my password to a much weaker one I could remember and not be locked out of the app when I need it.,
"I absolutely love this app, it literally has all of my medical charts, last and future appointments, labs, up to date and past due or due shots and past due or due procedures like physicals and such. I also love that you can directly message all of your providers for medical, mediation, non emergency, and other questions or concerns. I am sure there are some other great things I am missing to put on here about this app but it is truly a must have app for me.",
"Epic is a great app that My Chart uses. It's easy to login, navigate, send emails/receive emails from my Primary care doctor. Exam results, diagnoses, ex-rays are delivered expeditiously. Appts & reminders everything is great about this app as a client with my Health plans. Lastly, u can link other doctors & hospitals on the app and see everything n one wop☺️👏",
"This app really helps me keep all of my important medical information on hand in one place. It is easy to access, is user friendly and keeps things complete. I wish that it was possible to get all doctors to use it all of the time, it makes the records less comprehensive and incomplete. That said, it is miles ahead of what used to be available. Keep up the great work.",
"Originally, this was a helpful app. However someone from Mars has decided to ""update/modernize' it. Now it is a disaster. Completely worthless as a tool, especially when it is based on one's medical care. I will now tell my medical providers to stop using this app to keep me informed. I can get better results of MyChart now by simply talking to my garage door. Do NOT rely on this app for any help whatsoever, it will only confuse you beyond belief.",
This app had improved leaps and bounds and used to be a total nightmare. One of the best updates they added was the use of biometrics to sign in. They also make paying bills much easier. Layout is better and it's easier to find things.,
"The only problem my wife and I have inside the MyChart app is when we put in our credit card information and the boxes light up green, the only buttons available are ""BACK"" or ""CANCEL"". No ""continue"" or ""next"" button shows. Otherwise, the HFHS MyChart app is amazingly good!",
"This app was amazing, I loved it! It stopped working a few days ago when it updated. Now it won't even load past the select your organization screen, it has become totally unusable.",
It's fairly easy to use and the learning curve is low. I love that I can add appointments to my Google calendar with a few taps. It's very helpful for scheduling new appointments and getting faster refills of prescriptions with no refills.,
"I used to love the app. I have no idea what happened, but I no longer receive notifications. I've checked everything and it's not on my end. It's very frustrating to have to keep logging in to see if anything has changed or anyone is sending you a message. The format has changed too...not a very user friendly app.",
"So many resets for the user name and passwords. Even get shut out of the app. Not user friendly for seniors at all who have tremors, bad vision and memory problems. It is better to pick up the telephone and call your doctor than use the MyChart app!",
The one prior to this new aop was so so much easier to navigate. It had bigger letters and was a lot more attractive. Real professionally done. This new one looks very elementary like you are just starting to learn how to build a app.,
"This particular app is a great disappointment. It is difficult to use. It is supposed to link with my other sources of medical information, but keeps telling me it can't find the the info in my Sanford Chart. To get my info, I have to switch the old app. Very, very annoying!",
I absolutely LOVE this app. The fact that I can access both mine and my son's info is extremely convenient. I love the appointment reminders and test result notifications. I have yet to find anything I CAN'T do on this app. It has just made my life so much easier.,
I absolutely love the my chart app if it wasn't for the app I would probly miss all my appointments because of the my chart app it's a snap to add the appointments to the calendar so convenient and easy-to-use keeps you up to date and informed it's probably one of the best things modern technology has done I recommend this app to everyone who plans on trying to stay on top of your health care issues you will not be disappointed thank you developers you got this one out of the park for sure.,
"I wish all of our local health organizations used a portal like this. Everything is clearly organized, and I can take care of everything in one app. Billing, appointments, test results- all are easily accessible. I can even message my providers. Love it.",
"So grateful for this app. It keeps communication with all my caregivers simple and so convenient!! This app literally offers every single avenue for staying in touch with an my healthcare providers and my son's providers as well, we each have our own separate profiles. Also, I've never seen an ad on this app. My only concern is, I can't figure out how to separate my son's profile in order to give his father access, without having to give him access to mine as well.",
Your improvements never include older phones my S4 can no longer use this app. It won't download. It's pissing me off the way you guys improve things and forget about all these phones that have the apps already. Include them in your app improvements so we don't lose the app on our old phone. Thanks,
I'm so GRATEFUL for this app or feature it REALLY makes my life & my son's life more manageable bc EVERYTHING is right here at your finger tips in one place. The fact that you can click on the menu or ANY of the high lighted features takes AWAY all frustration when trying to give or receive medical information. Thanks to the ones who invented MyChart. I BELIEVE it was a team effort well done.,
Perfect for communicating in non-emergency situations. You can go back and view test results and visit summaries to refresh your memory on issues. Reminders and instant updating of appointments are very helpful.,
"This app is great. Helps me stay up on my health care needs, helps stay in touch with my providers, and surely helps to keep records of my health. They change things up from time to time, but it's for better function in the app. So, great going Maine Health.",
I love this app & I would highly recommend it. It's very useful when scheduling appointments & checking what shots (like Tetanus is due). It also keeps track of the shots you have taken in the past and when you got the shot.,
"This is probably the best app ever. It's great to be able to see results of different tests, register for upcoming appointments ,requesting prescription refills and so much more. It's hard to think about how frustrating it was before starting to use My Chart. This makes everything so much easier.",
"As a general rule my chart is great. My only concern or complaint is that when there is somthing negative I can not see the results. I will give you some examples when I had biopsies done the results are not posted, in my case 2 time the biopsies were positive for cancer, but I could not see them or know till I went for a follow up visit. I still can not see the biopsies results 1 or 2 later. It would be nice to know the results as soon as they are available My chart is a great tool to have",
"I use this app ALL THE TIME! I can download my appointments to my personal calendar; I can review my labs, tests, & procedures results as soon as they're available--long before the doctor visit to receive the results; and I send and receive messages from my providers. These are only 3 of my most used resources of the app, I haven't even touched the surface of what information and resources the patient portal provides! It's a true godsend for me. Thanks, Carle!",
I'm not sure if it's from the app or lack of concern from health office but when I use this app for last 3 months my medication renewal has been stuck in system and I have to keep waiting in chronic pain for usually 3 days after several messages to doctors to get them filled. Not sure again if it's app or lack of patient concern from office.,
this app has a very difficult time loading messages its quite frustrating I'm finding it easier just to go back to my email and use the direct link to my chart. certainly don' want to trust your app for a video appointment........!!,
"The ability to almost immediately see test results, the ability to directly communicate with your doctors and the ability to schedule or cancel appointments are awesome features. I find MyChart a very useful program.",
"This is amazing app to communicate with my physicians, and those of my 94 year old mom. When she had to go to the ER it was great to see test results so quickly, and I could ask her doctor questions. I do have one issue... The message option doesn't allow me to attach a file. My daughter also uses MyChart to communicate with her doctors and those of her infant daughter. She has an icon that allows her to upload pictures. My app does not and it doesn't matter if I'm using my phone or laptop.",
Just updated app. It has lost all my information. I get a screen that wants me to search for medical organizations. I type in BJC Washington University and nothing comes up. I uninstalled the app & re-installed. Same problem. Everything is fine on the web version.,
"It only has one screen and no menu.?? Another update. It doesn't have my insurance listed and no place to add my insurance. But the biggest no no for me is that you have to sign up, I don't need Mote id's and passwords since my phone is already secure. Signing up should ALWAYS be optional.",
"All though I Love my Dr. But with this app, I am unable view test results, schedule an appointment other than mammogram and than it won't go through. I keep getting ERROR 500, and taken back to home page. Very Frustrating. I can't ask questions or message in this app. All I see is Past results, but no appts.",
Needs updated crashes all the time and doesn't load most of the time. Keep needing to do a forced stop and clear cache and sometimes it works. It's a matter of luck! Better to use on the pc. 😥,
I sincerely wish that this system should not have been revises recently. There was nothing wrong with the previous version and since the revision we have had consistent problems logging in. If lucky enough to get logged in the changes made will not let us use the Pay My Bill file. Please stop changing thing!,
"It doesn't connect to my health network. I've gone and made the appointment with my provider and registered through the MyChart website. I then registered and entered the correct network in the app and the doctors office can see I am registered in the system, but nothing shows up in the app about my appointments or what doctors I'm seeing. It's like the app doesn't connect to the website at all.",
"I had the opposite experience of the review below me. I had no problems seeing (or downloading,) our after-visit summaries, updating personal info, sending/receiving messages, checking in...but I cannot see our recent test results, even as ""pending.""",
"Solid on basics. For an app that handles medical data and communications, that's what I'm looking for. Feature request: a section to upload images for practitioners. Using message area requires too much effort all around.",
"Very easy to navigate. The whole app is very easy to use. And it has all my information in one place. I can, pay my bill, ask questions, schedule appointments. Check test results. We'll you get the picture. Overall great app. I would recommend to anyone that needs it.",
"I love using MyChart. It's such a great way to communicate with the doctor and medical facility. I used the ""schedule an appointment"" option for the first time. Wow! It was great. Got my appointment so quick and easy. (I am not technology savvy, so if I can use this app, anyone can.) Thank you MyChart for making it so easy.",
I've just recently started using this incredible app. and I really love it. Keeps me all organized and I can get everything done now with so much ease. The turn around time to receive answers to all of my concerns or questions is so fast ! Less than 24hr most of the time. I can't praise this system enough.,
Love getting notified when my test results are ready. Definitely love being able to see all test results and notes. Great to have upcoming appointments consolidated. Also super easy to make appointments at my convenience and save a phone call and being put on hold.,
The overall operations of the app are exceptionally wonderful.. Except there is no way to update the payment due once all payments have been submitted by the insurance company.. I'm still showing a balance that was due (4 months ago ) prior to all payments that's been submitted by the insurance company (and it is now April )...,
I wish the e check in actually worked. I know it's probably my providers issue. But why even let that provider use it if you always have to check in again. Then they direct you the kiosk. Then the kiosk won't let you continue cause it makes you pay something and then they will finally talk to you at the desk. I guess my comment is just let the providers disable this feature cause now I have to do 3 steps rather than just talk to the desk.,
I was sure if what i read in permissions. It look like if i resd it right that your provider can turn your mic on to listen to you. For instant if they want to listen to you sleep. Or other reason. Im not sure i like that if they have that ability?,
"This app is great for getting the results of medical tests, often before your doctor gets the results. You can communicate with your doctor in the app. I took off one star because you have to communicate with each hospital system before getting their results in the app. Once the app knows who I am, all my hospital systems should be connected.",
Everything is found in one app from all of my providers. Easy for me and my providers to communicate and stay in the know 24/7. I'm being able to use the app with ease and confidence - and speak directly to my providers when necessary.,
I really love using this app. It reminds me I have an appointment and lets me see everything I need to know about my medical info. And it's quicker getting in for my apt. However I do not like the kiosk and having to scan it. I would rather have a number I could enter. The kiosk likes giving me problems.,
"I go out of my way to find providers that use MyChart. It makes scheduling, communicating, and viewing/tracking results so easy! I especially love that I can give access to providers unaffiliated with other providers. This has eliminated many unnecessary repeat labs.",
"This app is great makes it much easier to see all health issues and procedures. Appointments,doctors, test results ,all in one place. I wish it was a little easier to move your health record around. I.e. social security or somthing like that. But beside that. this app is great thankyou",
"My chart works great,not sure where the connection is missing but it always ask to fill out documents before arriving to save time,and then when you arrive they say they didn't receive it? Communication from My Chart to the office needs to be a stronger transmission signal?? Work on that and it will get 5 stars.",
The app is very user friendly with one exception. If you need to modify any information on a prescription you have to completely remove it and reenter all the information. I seldom have all the needed information so I just don't change it. I have had medical staff express the same frustration.,
"Love the app... Easy to use. Sometimes I have problems with the video appt hopefully the issue will be fixed soon but otherwise I love the ease with viewing my test results, setting appts and the ability to message my providers.",
I like this app because it keeps all my medical records together only thing is when you stop taking a medicine or the dosage changes it doesn't change in the my chart . Mine shows medications I took years ago. It also has down diseases I have never had. I got to find out how to fix this.,
"The only thing about MyChart is if you have to just edit your medications. The dosage changed or need more information. You have to get rid of the medication and then put it in again. And it doesn't update your changes until the doctor oks them. But its alot better then some of the other Portals I have to try and use they can be very frustrating when they don't work and you keep thinking your making a mistake, but actually its the program.",
"Awesome tool for keeping on top of one's health care. Lots of information, some a patient doesn't usually have access to. Easily find test results, upcoming and past appointments & messages from providers. Easy to use.",
"Great potential, but not there yet. KOOTENAI HEALTH Go Live has had minimal support for patients with MyChart. Not all data from portals has been (or will be) imported. The provider list is not populated until you have an appointment. Only the ""official"" provider appears on provider list, so in family practice, if you didn't see your assigned doc, you can send mail to that provider, but can't easily follow up with the one you actually saw. If you have a problem you can't contact anyone.",
"When trying to open messages, it often scrolls and won't open and then kicks me right back to the main page. Also, it keeps asking me to verify my phone number and to press the button to receive a code. It never comes. I liked the previous app better.",
I would never be able to keep track of all my appts and test results if not for this application. Anyone with a long term medical problem needs to use this to be their own health advocate. Some changes recommended are with the appts to separate old from new not shown together it gets confusing.,
Great to be able to check in before your appointment and see your lab work as well as message your doctors and more. Makes things much easier. I just wish they would explain what those numbers and test mean on each one . It's hard if you don't know medical terms. But it's a great app.,
They need to allow the app to view the Tiff files of results. What's the point of the app in the first place if you can't view the images? And they you warn users about downloading the image to the device! That would be avoided if your app can actually view Tiff images of the patient results.,
"I use this app for all my medical places that are connected. I am able to talk to my doctors, refill prescriptions, request appointments. Even check in to appointments. Those app is awesome. I love being able to compare past test results.",
"It's a great place for me to consolidate medical records. I'm able to grant access to Drs from different practices, send messages to get quick answers or refills. If I have an issue it's with making appts. I can request an appt but not make one.",
I hate the update! Before I would regularly communicate with my providers. Now there's no messages. I tried different things but nothing gets me to my messages. I wanted to get the name and phone number from the last message from a surgeon but now I can't find it. I wanted to Uninstaller the update but it Uninstaller the whole app. I don't know why they do stupid stuff like this.,
"This is probably one of the best apps I've ever seen. It's great to have one space for doctor & apts, medicines and submitting refills. And also for quite a few different branches, clinics or hospitals can be added into it so it literally is all in one app! It's great!!",
"App does not line up with the Surgical dept times and the office handling the patients . I had this appointment for 4 months, the day before the procedure they call to tell me to come in 90 mins later, so they say. No VM, no email, no message in app, no call to my emergency contact. I couldn't of picked up the phone anyway I was busy and already into prepping for the test the next day. I will let you figure out what I was having. Not good system. Office says through app they can't message.",
"This app is very good at making sure my Doctors are all on the same page as I work through a medical emergency. It also helps them to tract exactly which medication I am taking. There have been times getting the application to open has been difficult, I was on a good internet connection. The application was laggy.",
"It's very easy to use and everything is right there for you to access: your health history, medications, appointments, notes you can send and receive from your doctor, test results, you can link all your doctors together and even give a family member access to your account which is nice if there is a health emergency. I might be missing something. I would've given a five if they could send a text message (like the old app) along with the email when there is something added to your account.",
Horrible app. Doesn't always connect properly. Poor layout in the app. App should also allow users to consolidate data from multiple mychart apps. This thing appears to be developed and maintained by robots rather than humans.,
"To be fair i This app does make certain things easier.. but i thing that to be a heath app that is linked to your personal medical record, it is very dull. There are multiple data that i could provide my doctor through this app but cant. Like: steps perday and anything that can be traked by a smart watch or other trackers. Weight Period dates,Psychological topis or events, medicine Reminder and verifications etc",
The app is really good. My only issue is that new provider's have to send an invite to be added to the profile which causes a delay in communication especially in the larger medical systems that are linked to mychart.,
"Functionally awkward and inflexible to use, but a bit cleaner phone interface than PC web has. ""Connection error"" seems FIXED by phone restart plus switching back and forth between home wifi network and cell network. DEVS: nothing to discuss now!",
These days IT people do more damage than improvement when they do update. Suddenly fingerprint login disappeared and the app is asking endless for login credentials even when I select to remember my device. Most of the times do not take them and I gave up. It is now useless to me. But it was nice just a month ago.,
Probably the most valuable app I own. Saves me a ton of time and usually runs well. The ability to track appointments and communicate with doctors from various medical groups all in one app is a lifesaver. I highly recommend the app.,
"Great!! I am able to email directly to my doctor about anything at any point in time, I can set appointments and have the option to be put on the ""watchlist"" where if any availabilities open up you'll get an earlier appointment. You get test results, blood work, any paperwork you'd normally have to go in to discuss can easily be done right over your phone in a manner of minutes!!!",
It's very user-friendly and convenient. I never liked the process of trying to communicate with doctors over the phone. This takes out all the anxiety. It also helps me keep everything organized. One of my favorite features is that I can use it to order refills on my prescriptions without calling the Dr or the pharmacy.,
Great for seeing all test results right away. Great for asking questions of care providers by email. Most answer questions right away. So much easier and less time wasting than attempting to contact providers by phone.,
Navigation is confusing. Mobile application does not adjust to the size of phone screen. In profile section it is impossible to select the country USA. Lools like this app wasn't properly updated and tested for several years.,
"All of my health information at my fingertips. It's even easier now that I can sign in with my PIN. I can message my provider and receive a quick response, access my medical and prescription information, allergies, prior and upcoming visits, appointment reminders and immunization records. I especially love pre-check-in. I do it at my leisure and everything is already done before check-in. I highly recommend this app.",
"Easy-to-use and handy. Informative. 24×7 reference. Scheduling and/or canceling an appointment, finding a provider, or requesting a refill and/or referral are a piece of cake. If a medical dictionary (explaining medical terms and tests in a non technical language) is added, it would be a great thing for all the patients and persons using this app.",
"Very easy to navigate and use. Whatever you're looking for, can be easily found. This is a perfect app for communicating with your healthcare professionals and for checking your upcoming appointments, lab results, etc...",
"Easy to reorder meds, leave messages for health team, recommend this app for anyone that can use it. Would give it 10/10 stars if I could. Also easy to make payments on account if your insurance sucks and you have to pay for your appointments even though that's covered through most insurances but apparently not through SIGNA. Sorry my insurance sucks but this app is great.",
I was typing a big question to doctor and while referring document in-between screen went off and along with that typed (unsent) message also vanished. Can't find any draft or other option to recover the message. Infact I didn't even move out or switch the app. Waste of time and disappointing.,
Part of the time your appointments have expired by the time they show up in the app. The other part of the time there is expired referrals before you even get them and appointments with out the time of the appointment and appointments that have been cancled. Not sure if its the App or the medical people using it that are causing the problem.,
Made appt. for Telemedicine and once submitted and confirmed the appt. was made for in office due to error in the MyChart app. Customer service contacted and I was told they can't do anything. The problem is repeatable and obviously a programming error. If customer service can't help.then who can?? A bit frustrating 😑,
"This app is great. I had great anxiety about making my first doctor's appointment in over 10 years, but this app made it a breeze. Did all the paperwork online ahead of time, and when i got to the doctors i barely had to wait at all. All my test results are easily accessible thru the app, and I can message my doctor thru it too. Appointments reminders are there too",
"Very useful for tracking appointments, communication, and getting results. It allows me to have a one stop shop for anything medical. Plus they are actively adding things to make it more useful.",
"I love how easy it is to use. I love that I have all my important medical stuff all in one place. Makes scheduled appointments easier to remember because I can check, I can fill paperwork out before I get there so I don't have to go early to appointments and it allows me to check my appointment summary whenever I need/want. I love having the app!!!!",
Information on medications I'm on is wrong. Totally messed up and no way to fix it. Providers I've never seen are listed as my providers. The whole thing is a dumpster fire. Seems to be designed to keep me separated from my provider and to keep me from having to bother the office staff with phone calls.,
"The number one reason for this app to exist is to make it easier for me to make an appointment to see my doctor. This app is terrible at making appointments and after a brief conversation with the lady working reception. I have learned it is a common experience she deals with daily. Do not use this app to make an appointments, unless you don't mind to have your time wasted.",
"Guess I'll never understand how to use this. Usually only open to message doc, but it has a doctor that left last year still on list, there is no editing my messages(the cursor goes where ever) I try then can't change receipt, subject or wording without starting app from start again hoping to get right name.",
"I use this app a lot. It keeps everything well organized and easy to access. Making and changing appointments is easy and straightforward. You often get test results before your Dr. does. You also get visit summaries, doctor notes, and immunization reminders. And much much more.",
"I worked as a software developer for many years and this would never get used in my world. To start with, why when I look at medications I can't sort them and paging through I see multiple listing for the same thing. At least sort them alphabetically or by date. And I can't find one of my providers. There should be a search/sort option",
"Extremely convenient. I get to see my test results the moment they're available. It has saved me so much time at the ER. I frequently go to the ER for tonsil problems, so it's nice to know right away that I do/don't have certain issues. I can also manage my children's stuff so that gives me a ton of peace of mind when taking them to the doctor/ER/UC.",
"Had Baptist Health app recently updated then app lost communication, tried reinstalling app to no avail, still same message of unable to communicate. I then downloaded the my chart app itself with a couple different icons I am now able to my chart app in its stand alone application. Yet to see if Baptist Health hospital Elizabethtown, ky. still able to communicate with myself through My Chart app. I'm assuming they will, hopefully",
"At first, I was receiving notifications but now I don't. That's the only issue I'm having. I have to remove the app then add it back. It's such an inconvenience especially when I receive messages from my doctor's office. Please if possible can you fix this issue? I'd greatly appreciate it!",
"I love Loyola MyChart! All of your health-care providers are right there for you to choose who you need to see. You can leave messages AND provide a photo so that doc can get a idea of current issue.. very easy to navigate and better responses than calling and trying to get to the right doc/clinic. I recommend everyone to sign up, very useful ❤",
"It is very convenient to track appointments with kids, spouse, or even an elderly parent you care for. Some of the interface could be simpler but still pretty easy and helpful.",
"I absolutely LOVE using MyChart! I love being able to see test results, and doctor comments related to visits, diagnosis, and details about procedures performed on me. I was able to read every action that took place during an operation l had! It was fascinating and informative! It's easy to view all my medications, send messages to doctors, and see their responses. It also provides an easy way to make payments on my account. Everything is right here at the swipe of my finger!! It's great!",
Ever since the update I cannot video chat with my doctor. I get through the check in and then it just keeps on telling me to check in. Which shows it's been completed already. I have cancer and need to meet with my doctor which is in another town. Please fix this so I don't have to try make the drive for a 30 minute appointment before I start chemotherapy each week. This app was running just fine before that last update and now I can't get it to work at all. Frustrating.,
Very frustrating. The icon has a red circle with the number 4 in it as if there were 4 unread messages. I can not find anything. The program tells me I need to update my contact info but all fields are filled out. What a poorly designed program.,
"So far it's great. System easy to navigate. My primary doctor is not on this app but most of my other doctors are. It's nice having all your doctor's reports, medications, test results, and appointments all in one spot. I would have giving it five stars but you can't print out your test results to show another doctor and you can't forward them to another doctor. I hope they address this and update the app 😃",
"Very temperamental app. Works sometimes. No point in having something that works like this, if I have to keep phoning the hospital to make sure that all has been booked . It changes week to week, not good!",
"Great experience so far. Easy to use and navigate. Really enjoy how quick I get my test results back, and how easy I can communicate with my nurse practitioner. Great to see the healthcare system moving in the right direction.",
"This app is so helpful and makes my life easier. I was there was a section to log medicine doses as well as symptoms that the doctors can see as well. I also wish there was an option for a ""medicine cabinet"". Meaning meds you have been given but aren't taking at that moment but can easily be put in a section of meds that you are taking if that changes during your treatment.",
"Frustrated!! I'm used to using Cerner's portal so I'm sure part of it is just a learning curve. For example on the lab work, it shows the lab value, & the lab results, the normal range but no TIME that the test was performed. That information is vital to my results. I would also like for there to be a section where I could dispute what's in the medical records",
"MyChart is a potentially useful App, but seems to be very limited, at least as it is used by my local hospital. There is no integration with GP records, not even a note of who my GP is. The one hospital clinic I attend is well documented, however. Also, it will allow the hospital to reduce paperwork for appointments erc. And it's useful to have an online record of the past appointments. Overall, recommended.",
"There is no consistency between all the apps. The billing system says I don't owe anything but all the different doctors in their separate legal companies send paper bills that I can't pay online. Customer service can't do anything to help. They just give me a link to a different system to pay the bill. What kind of IT programming is that? Methodist offers a cohesive image of its doctors and services. But, they implemented an expensive application that can't sync all these pieces .",
"I think the app has very useful applications; however, not one of   my physicians likes or appreciates my using it.  In fact, one of my doctors chastised me for using it 4 times in one year to ask a non-complicated office follow-up question.  If they don't want me to use it then why does it exist?.  Additionally, accounts are monitored by a nurse or PA and rarely does the question get addressed or even seen by your actual physician.  Works well for requesting medication refills but seems useless other than viewing test results that often need interpretation.  Each time I have attempted to schedule an appt through MyChart, I receive an error message telling me it cannot  be scheduled and to call my physician's office.  Additionally, when i update my meds list, preregister for appt.s, changes are never saved and I end up having to update at the office after wasting time online and trying to fill out paper forms having only one arm.",
"When you choose 1st item to choose and that is OPEN, it never will open up. It just sits with a signal that says it is trying. Waiting more than ten minutes, it is still trying to open the application. Robert",
"The multiple emails and constant pop-ups to update information that was updated the day before for another doctor appointment are incredibly overcomplicated, & of no value. It has less than 50% success rate for allowing me to check-in or emsil my DR, often wont accept any type of signature. 6 of 10 test result notifications this week produce a page that is blank. The character limit on the messages is ridiculous",
"My only complaint...Sometimes results are posted in My Chart BEFORE the doctor sees them. If it's bad news, or seems that way, the patient has way too much stress about what they received, and sometimes have to wait days for the doctor to read the results and get back with them. The results should NOT be available until the doctor releases them!",
"It's a good app at times; however, I cannot always view lab results from doctors. I'm not sure if whoever is responsible for uploading the results does not know what they're doing. During these instances, I have to send a message in the app and wait for a response and then request that they mail my results to me. It's very annoying to have to do that.",
Honestly super helpful for checking prescriptions and appointments. Also great frame of reference for checking past notes and info like Growth and Weight. Love the option to message with pictures and it helps avoid extra visits when it's something simple solved over the app.,
"A junky-looking interface. Awkward to move around in. Nothing is simple. For example, there's little commonality between pages, plus no homepage banner or breadcrumbs to allow easy transition and consistent orientation.",
"Generally a good app. Issues: No dark mode, Not able to contact everybody on my care team. No realistic way to ask for Tech Support Help For issue like the fact that I can't contact my care team. Would like the option to request an appointment by department and not just by care team member. Sometimes you don't have a doctor assigned to you so they Just assign you to whoever is available.",
"I like MyChart, it's a quick and easy way to access all medical info from providers who provide your care. You can ask questions, respond to messages, see your health records, results, medications list and any up an coming appointments you may have. The only thing I don't like is it's only within one network so if you have a provider outside this network, you won't be able to access health info with that particular provider. Overall good app...",
"Very handy app. I am able to schedule and change appointments, check lab results, communicate with my doctor directly by email (They do respond quickly!). There are many benefits to accessing your own health information. I have found it to be a very helpful tool.",
"Poor design, not user-friendly. No feedback or support option. Calender does not sync with device. And in app calendar does not provide notifications. Poor consistency in headings. Aweful navigation experience, very very dated.",
"I ❤️ MyChart for many reasons! Just to list a few of my favorites, I'm able to set appointments for my daughter and I, in under 2-3 minutes! Making appointments over the phone for us both is around 15-20 minutes. I love that you're able to go over the results of tests. Being able to message within MyChart with your Dr. Is fantastic. Conducting a live video visit in the comfort of your home with a doctor is convenient! Having the capability of refilling your Rx is very helpful.",
"Easy to use, creating your appointments are a breeze and all of your past visits are there too so if you need to reference its all there. Recommend the application as it make s everything so easy. Lastly, you can also make your co -payment on the app.",
It's so convenient to be able to communicate with my doctors without having to make an appointment that said there's only one thing I would like added to this app is option to review your medication list and modify it by checking a box next to the medication letting our doctors know what medications we currently taking which we don't by not checking the box next to medication or vice versa. Other than that I would give it a four and a half star if I I had that option.,
This App is Amazing!! I have a few chronic medical problems and this app combined with CVS is so convenient and easy to use. Both my Primary care and minute clinic offer E-Visits and it couldn't be easier to navigate. Thank you so much for such an awesome design!!,
"Easy to use, accurate & effective... for everything except the check-in. I've tried that at 3 different places in the last month & they said it didn't make it from the MyChart app to their computers.",
"I like having the My Chart app. It's like your own personal calendar for all your upcoming appts. So they are all in one place n I don't have to have any notes on paper that I always lose anyway. Also, quick n easy way to contact your Dr. With a quick question or comment when you don't have time to call them.",
"The app is great. Easy to navigate. The only issue I have, is the doctors don't use it!!!!!!! This month I put in for refills. It was 7 days ago. She still has not filled them! A great app is not worth my time if all parties don't use it! Great app, but terrible service for the Drs.",
"Love the ease of messaging physicians, viewing test results, and confirming appts and even having virtual appts. Occasionally has annoying bugs and i think the test results page could be more streamlined so that we can compare similar ones (iron from today vs iron from last year etc) otherwise great app has definitely made medical life easier",
"If I could give this app negative infinity stars, I would!!!! I recently got a new phone and tried signing in. It kept saying something about needing a verification code. It never sent anything to my email, so the app is rendered useless because I can't sign into it, and it's stupid verification process. This app used to be good, but now I never want to use it again!!!",
"Very easy to use. I can find out everything that the doctor can see and I can also see what the doctor writes about me. Things that I should be aware of but am not told by the doctor I can find here. I set and cancel appts., request medication refills, send messages to my doctor, and look up medical terminology all from this one app. Very easy to use.",
The app itself is ok. I don't enjoy that I was pushed into it. I don't enjoy having something else for hackers to get all my personal medical information from. The billing area could use a lot of work and the fact that some providers no longer send bills in the mail and only use the app would have been great information.,
I really appreciate all of the hard work and thought that has been put into this app to make it a very user-friendly experience. I read the one comment about medication requests and I can attest that any request made via meds list is immediately picked up by the doctor's staff and processed. I can only see an issue being brought up if a provider needs to be seen to ensure that med still needs to be issued.,
"I love MyChart it's easy to use and I get test results very fast. I can communicate with my doctors without going into the office and can pay my bills through the app. I also have all my Covid 19 information in one location. If you forget your appointment or want to make an appointment, you can see and make them here. Easy peasy!!!",
"Easy on the eyes, easy-to-navigate once you fill around and to navigate it's very easy you do have to stay in touch with the app so that you don't pile up your mail but at the same time they always put the new mail up top so if you have to go back and show you another doctor something your stuff is always there so that is always great",
"Fantastic little app. Great connection with my doctor, with my lab results, with billing ect. It is one of the most useful apps I have ever been able to take advantage of. Great job programmers. 👍👏🌺",
"The worst and useless app ever. The scheduling bring you one day before when synced to Google calendar. New interface does not have appointments but has research papers short cut. Why the hell I need to read researches. I want to see my appointments, manage my bills, see my medical records, see post office visit summaries. This app stopped providing this. USELESS! Recommended solution is not working because there is no such feature as to change your shortcuts!!!! What is the purpose of this app???? Read medical researches and not being able to communicate with your medical provider or see your upcoming appointments! Whoever was doing THE NEW UPDATE is NUTS!!!! mAYBE i AM WRONG THE APP IS AIMED AT FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BTW, whoever is reading this I found a solution: UCLA Health APP: easy to schedule appointments and get all your information. My chart sucks! I hate this so much, so not user friendly. This person who designed it should be fired!!!",
I found this portal similar to others. They are designed by techies for techies. They are unclear and just as unclear when they try to tell you how to undo your mistakes. A Portal designer needs to think like a novice starting with how do you find the portal in the first place. Don't assume that everyone already has the necessary info. Give more info than you think you need when going step by step. Time is valuable. Technology done right can help save time but done poorly it just wastes it,
"Constant data connection issues. Everything on my end has been quadruple checked. The connection that MyChart is supposed to provide between myself and my care team is paramount, yet these issues persist, unchecked. Think of the loss of care for many, many patients this problem could be causing.",
"While it is user friendly. I personally think it is a lazy alternative to reaching out to the Dr. In my opinion, it only allows the Dr or health care facility to not have to HIRE a person to answer ones personal important health questions. Also, it is far slower than actually being able to call and talk to the Dr, or an assistant. So no, I personally do not like it. With the exorbitant medical costs that we pay in this Country, one would think the health care provider would hire someone.",
"Best tele health app I have ever used. Easy to read, submit etc.. very pleasant positive experience all around. All should have this particular app. Easy to read, view records, questions, connect w/ e appt, submit information. Hands down, awesome. Well done kids.",
The app is great. I love that you can access your records when you need it. You don't have to print after visit summaries (Saving some trees). If you have non-emergency questions you can ask. I would have gave the app 5 stars but I wish you could cancel directly on the app and not have to call. Especially if your child has an appointment early Monday morning and he is won't be able to make it. Thank you!,
"Suggestions for improvement. 1. Allow for screen shots. 2. Add Printing and/or Save (as PDF) option in more key areas, especially for Message strings and reports/lists. 3. The Reply button is not always available as 'active' after receiving a Message from med staff.",
Love this app. Works great 99% off the time for me. No problematic ads! Usually easy to navigate but they could make it easier to find your way back to the start page for a table of contents.,
"I dont usually rate apps but, I really do like this app. Several things I love are that I'm able to read the Dr. notes in detail about me and the overall visit. Being able to make an appointment through the app is a plus and notifications about overdue tests and or procedures, reminders of upcoming appointments are super awesome.",
"My personal experience with the app it's really good especially because I have 2 children and one its special need what means more appointments and multiple especialists so the app allows me to stay on schedule with all the appointments by having everything I need in one place , also the technical support its awesome, the response its immediately And my problem was resolved in no time.",
"MyChart is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I can do and see almost all my medical needs online, which for a 70 year old is terrific. The messaging feature lets me get answers to basic medical questions that probably don't need an office visit. The Video Visit feature saves me from having to schlep to the Clinics for most of my consultations. I can read After Visit Summaries and Test Results online. The more I use it, the better I like it.",
"Online scheduling of appointments for follow-up care is a pain; the app gives you symptoms/ailments to select, but there is no option for ""other"" or ""none of these"", and no place to list what you actually want an appointment for. It also only lists primary care doctor and one that I saw one time because my doctor was out of the office that day. However, the cardiologist I'm supposed to see yearly is not listed. Location options are limited and out of date (includes places that are closed).",
This is a tool to help me understand my recent cancer diagnoses. It allows me the ability to see and ask questions to my team of doctors on blood and lab work that I NEVER would have asked before. It tracks appointments and in some cases let's me checkin on appointment. It contains all of my prescription info as well as help me understand that. Next...bring in the images. This is a great app.,
I love how quick and easy the app is. Only downside is for printing results from the app. I have to use the website in order to print results. The app doesn't give you the option to print directly.,
Very easy to use. Loved being able to link MyChart from the U of U with MyChart with Sutter Health. Made it extremely convenient to give my providers access to my previous medical records. Love the messaging feature. Only wish I could remove providers on my own once I am no longer seeing them.,
I like the easy reading of my chart information. I have a very difficult time going back to previous page. If there were options in a drop down menu it would be much easier to maneuver around the screens.,
Using MYChart is very good and very informative.My one frustrating thing or issue is huge; every time I any test result there's no way to return to any other page except to Log Out. Why? Why not allow me to return to the starting menu and view any other page? Extremely frustrating!,
"This app is very helpful and easy to manage. It is more convenient than having to log into the internet site. I use it everyday b/c I have so many doctor appointments and doctors. Makes my life easier with everything from appointments, test results to after summary. I'm happy",
"If you can't find some of your items like contact your provider, refill meds, current appts, etc it is because of new upgrade. Your Dr office CAN'T fix it, calling the help line is a waste of their time & yours when you can just Go to settings, Uninstall/remove my chart app from your phone, wait a couple minutes & Install my chart App again. It should have all missing items back now. If it doesn't try one more time, then call the # provided and tell them you need help.",
"I have a huge problem with remembering to schedule apps or even remembering when my apps are, but having this app, really helps me. The fact that I can fill out everything in the comfort of my own home, and don't have to worry about doing it once I get there, helps me get seen quicker. I love this!!",
"This app is confusing to use, makes my life a nightmare trying to manage myself and my kids health. We have to log in to multiple drs and it's a different log in for each, nothing works as it should which just adds more wasted time. But every dr uses it now so I'm trapped. Man I can't wait until the next best thing gets here. This app sucks. I consider myself to be above average for my age in relation to using and understanding technology.",
"Good app, still needs a little work. I am trying to share my account access with my wife, but all it does is show me that no one else has access to my records & does not have any link to add her (University of Michigan version). Otherwise, it's a great app.",
Very convenient for me. So much better than having to use robot phone menus! I get to have all my medical information at my fingertips. Making appointments is very easy with options to filter your available times. I love this 😊,
"Got locked out and can't log in. My account was completely locked out after a few password attempts. I called CVS and they have NO IDEA what to do. I sat through 15 minutes of robot voicemails just to have a dead line and nobody to talk to..... DO I HAVE COVID OR NOT???? Terrible, terrible, terrible system. Complete waste of time. Seriously don't use this app if you don't have to or you will get stuck like me.",
The MyChart app for Norton Health care was working fine last week now does work at all and keeps navigating you to a different site and wants u to download something..WTH!? I need to get on there today! I tried getting on the Baptist Health MyChart and it works just fine. Please fix this. I even tried going to their website and that isn't working either. Not sure what to do!! ***Edit...Problem has been fixed but I still can't see documents my doctor sends to me online under letters. ***,
I very much like MyChart. It is so user friendly and easy to navigate the program. The speed in which it is updated is amazing. There is usually info on the same day tests are given. I am super happy with the app.,
"I appreciate all of the easy access information on the app and the go-between messaging and information shared between myself and my doctors and even paying bills through the app to doctors and services. However, some doctors will send you a bill but you can't pay through the app. That's a little frustrating, but that's on the doctor's office is not the app to the best of my knowledge",
I hardly have any issues with this app. Its an easy way to contact your doctors for non-emergency stuff. Only issues I've ever had was not able to attach certain pics ive taken and occasionally my fingerprint would have to be put in again... other than that Its great!,
This app is really great because I am able to bring up all my medical info for whatever doctor I'm at. It's easy to bring my tablet and pull up my medication list and give to them. That way they know exactly what and how much you are taking. It says you can share it somehow but I've never tried so I can't really comment on that aspect. The other thing I really like is my appointments go straight to the app so I have access to when it is whenever I need to look. Also all test results are shown,
"I have used this app for YEARS. I switched phones and now can't even log in. Tried ""forgot username"" and it says it will send an email, but I NEVER get the email and I have only ever used ONE email for everything. I can't try the ""forgot password"" since every username I try (which I've NEVER changed the username) says it's wrong. I tried calling the help number that's literally through and on the app and the number is disconnected and hangs up on you.",
"Loved this app; however when I tried to reinstall it on my cellphone it kept telling there was a version problem and I needed to install the new version before I could log in; now I've looked on Google play, and even tried to google info about this new version but to no avail. I would appreciate some assistance in getting it so that I can put it on my phone. You guys need to tell us what the new version is and how we can install it on the phone",
"This app is amazing. It's so easy to navigate and find the info that is needed. I can find test results, schedule appointments, and check into appointments. Highly recommended to make your Healthcare experience easier.",
My Chart is an excellent tool for maintaining my health! All my records and history are available to me or another medical team/person any time like if I'm out of the country and need medical care. I also love it for tracking appointments or for communicating my status or questions or concerns. Thanks to those who consistently make it better. Keep it up!,
This is the easiest Application to use and is very helpful when it comes to knowing about upcoming procedures or appointments. I really like the ability to put it on my calendar with details because it has addresses & phone numbers so I can access it right on my calendar.. Thank you very much for the opportunity to make this all so accessible !!!,
Adequate but not great It's very clunky...not smooth or polished No way to simply swipe away nuisance messages The 4 digit pin option is gone No external notification when your doc messages you. Hard to manage data without a long over complicated menu of non descriptive options. But at least is something,
"Every single attempt to get into my chart and it says I need to enter the correct password. It's so frustrating so I've had a new passwords every single time! I'm running out of passwords, And patience. Haven't had as much problems with the mobile as I have my new laptop. Even when I've used the four digit PIN, it says your PIN has been changed by logging in with username and password.",
"It's so convenient for keeping track of and confirming appointments, communicating with my provider and viewing test results among other things. The app is pretty intuitive/ user friendly, too.",
"What's the point of viewing my bill online if I need an identifying number that can only be located on the bill I'll receive in the mail. Edit 11/5/21: Wish I'd given it two stars with my last review only so I could lower my rating. I needed test results that I could submit to my employer. App does not have the ability to export test results that I could find. So that's either lack of a fundamental feature or poor user experience. Additionally, the app restricts screenshots. What's the point?",
I received an email that asked me to confirm my appointment. I waited with tab open with the code box to put in the code for when the email notification came in.I pressed send code 2x thinking they didn't get my request. After getting 8 emails with codes and trying them I was locked out of my account. Thankfully the Dr's office texted me a confirmation text. I never wanted this app in the first place. You just confirmed the headache I was trying to avoid. Goodbye MyChart.,
"Again?! Seriously I'm already registered with my Pharmacy, then I have to register on this site, then I have to download their app, then I have to agree to like three pages of fine print... this goes way beyond the scope of security and everything could have been handled through my Pharmacy site. I will probably delete the app as soon as I get the result but I have the feeling that amongst all the permissions I've given there will still be a bunch of entanglements.",
"MyChart can be useful for checking test results. I was using the messaging function to communicate with my PCP until recently when I found that I had no control over it. It is impossible to delete any old messages, even useless appointment reminders from 5 years ago. I contacted support and was informed there was no need for me to be able to delete my old messages and that these would just become part of my permanent medical record. This caused me to stop using the messaging function altogether.",
Great app that makes it easier to deal with medical everything! Love that you can interact with providers real time as well as access all the necessary documents for medical everything. I hope PII is secure don't know yet because this is a first for here but so far so good. A lot more efficient than waiting forever to attempt contacting drs office rn,
"I've been using it for years now. Simple and easy way to speak with your provider directly..renew medicines , review test results, schedule appintments etc. I have a few health issues, and honestly thanks to my chart, I have an even better relationship with my providers. Ask a question, get advice get a response..its just that simple !",
"All past,test results no longer show, past Dr visits also gone, future visits gone but one and it shows video visit which is wrong. App used to work. My wife's still works. Did checking. I didn't know there was two different accounts. I was able to link them and everything is now. Working. Sorry for my mistake",
"Response to the developer: I received a call from my Dr office a bit ago, with more information about this issue. They told me what they think caused it, but not sure. Totally understandable. I have taken the steps I was told to this issue fixed. I have never had any other issues with MyChart.",
"Update - The issue I described in my prior 3 star review is resolved or at least explained to my satisfaction. MyChart by Epic Systems is a well crafted app. With a decently designed UI, it's a great ⚕️ resource both the end user and the institution providing the patient records. Like myself I know my hospital was also slammed by Covid. We're all a bit tired, I get it. If a clerk inputs info different than the snail mail bill the app can only display whatever's been put in. (GIGO) 😷",
"It has a few hiccups, but overall, I definitely feel that Mychart deserves 5 stars. It allows me to see all my sons appointments, message each nurse/doctor/ specialist. It also allows me to see all of his latest vitals and weights and even his test results, not just the reports but even all of the specific numbers. It has his medications listed and family history and makes it easy to share or print this info with other facilities and doctors. I'm extremely happy with this app, WELL DONE!",
"I love being able to see my own medical records, especially when some doctors aren't very thorough when discussing test results etc. It's so important to be involved in your own medical care and fully aware of what's going on. I only wish this was available 15 years ago when I lost a lot of valuable records due to regular ""purging"" of files. No more lost files, thanks to apps like this!",
"Mychart is great. The gap is me reloading the app to get back to the menu after looking at any lab or other test result on mobile. The app is easy to use, but it does almost nothing correctly.",
"Locked me out of access. It wouldn't accept my password. Then it would be unresponsive when I tried to set up on my Google account. Then it wouldn't accept my information. I was trying to look up the result of my covid test ~>:-( To app creator/manager: Thank You for helping me with my username. It actually did help me with access,and I really appreciate that. Unfortunately I still can't use the app because now it's outdated, so I had to uninstall again.",
"So far the application does exactly what I expected. Simple enough to use, has some nice systems for biometric and customization of a photo avatar, works wow well to schedule, and keep up to date with a major life chasing event, in my case.",
"A few weeks ago, I dumped this app and gave it a one star rating. I was recently informed the app was upgraded, so I took a chance and loaded it again. Man, what a change! Great job on the new look and functionality of features. Bravo!!! This one's a keeper.",
"I have used this app for a few years now. I love that I can see appointment notes and test results. I also am able to communicate with my doctor much more easily through the appa nd always get very quick replies. I even got a same day appointment with my PCP the other day!! The only negative remark I have is for the procedures cost estimator, which I have never had any success with.",
"This app attempts to overlay a single interface on top of various medical information systems available to patients. It seems a reasonable goal, but there are not enough participating providers of medical information who subscribe to the service. I still have to go to many different places in order to get what little medical information is available to me digitally, and this platform needs to be made so open and accessible that all of the providers are willing to participate to share information",
"Edit: ever since Virginia Mason took over, this app (and the paperwork you get) are so bad. I seriously miss CHI. Right now it won't even let me login.... Original: Hate all the updates they did recently. It was laid out better before, easier to use and easier to access what you're looking for. It was definitely easier to find billing stuff.",
"I don't know what the software geniuses are doing with this app. It's never been great but every time you make changes, it gets worse! You had it easy to get into and maneuver around but now to get in the geniuses want me to wait to get a special code in my email. TIME, TIME, TIME people! Really? Stop playing around. Fix it. Stop wasting my time. I have a life too. It was working great with a user name & passcode. We have had 3 sets now, maybe more. JUST DO IT!",
"This app has been life changing for me. It makes it so easy to communicate with my doctors, request refills, view my past visits, and more. I have anxiety talking on the phone and usually pass it off to my fiance, so this has given me some independence as well.",
"Terrible App. Their server doesn't work. My mom took covid test before travel abroad and we tried to download test results from the App and the website for 2 days. But NO LUCK. I called customer service and they told me try again, they could not help me. The test was $135, I think it cost it cost enough to get good service! Very disappointed!!!",
"Much nicer,now! Just keep up the improvements. Also, keep everything ""SIMPLE"" For our seniors please! This technology stuff is very difficult most of the ""older Gens.."" I .hate the ads & hate having to enter the passwords before using any game or other site!!!",
If you type to many characters. It closes you out. Message lost and you have to start over from the beginning . Very frustrating. Would be better if it allowed you to edit to correct,
"Not use friendly at all. Please get rid of Clare. Not only does she obstruct the view from the user, she bounces around in a visually distorting way, which can be harmful to people with migraines and seizures. A bot should not be associated with a medical app.",
This app is worthless and actually provides no real contact with a provider. It has lost emails and doesn't have access to phone number when the worthless app doesn't work. It will send emails to with an inability to respond. Nobody is required to respond.,
"I am very greatful for MyChart. The time saved not having to pay phone tag with Dr offices is amazing. I don't have to worry about missing a phone call from the lab/dr.office because I can see at an ease on literally... 1. Open app, 2. Press lab results 3. BOOM... everything is there!!! Much more to the app like, prescription refill, questions to the Dr, bill statements, and bill pay!!! #WINNING Thank you to the developers... Makes my life so much easier.",
"It's easy to use but the fact that NONE of your test results shows your name on it is a HUGE problem. I haven't found a way to download a specific test result either so if I want to show an employer a screenshot, like in this case, of a TB test there's no way to show that it actually belongs to me. I would have to actually go to the office, pull up my profile and show them, and even then they have no copy to place in my file. FIX THIS PLEASE.",
"I like having all my health information in one place. However, I am often aggrevated at the sign in. I put the correct info in and it tells me not correct and I request a verification code thru email and it never comes. Sometimes, I have to keep working at it over an hour to get it to finally work. Wish I knew if I was doing something wrong.",
Very helpful with scheduling appointments. It's very nice to be able to message with care providers when needing questions answered. I like being able to see test results even MRI pictures. Great App so easy to use!,
"I absolutely hate that you only have five log in tries, before it FORCES you to change your password. I've had to change my password every time I've logged in for the past month, despite writing my password down. Even if it was just a typo the first five times, and you know your password, it doesn't matter. If you put it in wrong five times you HAVE TO change it. SUPER ANOYING.",
It is very difficult to sign up and use this format. It will not except my email address. The app is somewhat easier to start up. But how are we going to get our code on our email and copy it to our chart when we have to escape the app or chart to go to email? It will not except it at that point.,
I like my chart but it's a little clunky to use. One thing that always puzzles me about it though is that no matter what I do it always wants me to update or confirm my email and phone number. Everything is in there correct. And I do not see a confirm button anywhere. So there's really nothing I can do. This is a bug that should be fixed,
"Annoyed with not being able to contact my doctor's. When I mean doctor's gyn is a doctor, psych is a doctor. And scheduling appointments that are needed. Calling can be annoying on both ends. Making app's help both parties in a major way. In other words you are messing up and it's time for a upgrade duh. Fix this I'll change my grading.",
"It great to be able yo so many wonderful things in one place. Prescription refills, communicate with your doctor , see test results. Is a plus However I would like to be able to see my records in the app as well that would be a complete package. Overall it's fantastic",
"Had to give 1 star, no option to give 0 stars. Received a 3 text messages with verification codes to my number listed in application. DID NOT REQUEST! After attempting to use computer generated response system for 30 minutes with no option for any information pertinent to the issue, I attempted to get in contact with a representative to resolve the problem. I waited for 30 minutes only to be told that I would have to call a different number. Meanwhile, someone is attempting to access my info",
"I historically avoid doctor visits. This app takes out so many of the hurdles that might've otherwise prevented me from seeking the help I need. It helps so very much in finding my information, keeping notes, contacting my doctor(s), finding a specialist, finding the location, and checking in. I would like to especially note that the medical history notes function is so much more helpful than the traditional one-lined medical forms, as confirmed by my doctor's appreciation of my notes.",
Certain items will work but when I changed settings for notifications I was still getting text messages app notification and email and that is way too much. Even after I changed it for just one notification. Frustrating!,
"I received a message yesterday and am unable to find it today. the continual pop-ups and reminders on the home page are annoying, at best. I have repestedly clicked the link to verify my email and NEVER receive a code. I do NOT want paperless billing. Make it go away!!",
"I am surprised at how easy this app is to use. I do wish one could get bavk to a file they were viewing, easily though. I will cerainly need to remember the names of each test. Or just keep using the computer for recalls like that. I am happy this is so easy to use. I have used other apps like thus, & am not. Great job overall.",
"I love this app because I can make appointments, be put on a waiting list to get a sooner appointment. I can email my doctor's with any questions, and they respond without having to call their office and wait for a phone call back. I am able to see my test results once they are submitted by the lab, alot of times before my doctor sees them. I am able to see all my upcoming appointments and be reminded and I can check in before I get there!! This is a great app.",
"Uninstalled app immediately because it does not remember login passwords. Epic says that's to protect user medical data, but my other medical apps remember passwords. I was hoping for an app that would make it easy for me to receive messages from my doctors. Instead, I'm accessing MyChart by browser. My brief experience of the in-app MyChart interface was positive.",
"This app is absolutely amazing. My husband and I are taking care of an elderly parent with MANY serious health issues therefore has MANY different doctors. This app puts everything in one place. All test results are in the app, all upcoming appointments, all things that are due(like vaccines and tests & much more) And you can ask questions in the app if you ever need to. This app has saved so much time and stress and I'm so grateful for it. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!!",
I've been using MyChart for over 4 years and had been very pleased but this year they Quit allowing me to do Screenshots for my personal comparisons. It's not easy using a different phone to take pictures of the sections I need to compare with previous months!,
"""There was a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" When I stop getting this message while trying to use this app i will rethink my review. As it stands the only way to login with the app is to use a backdoor and have it change my password. After that i have access but it should not take 10 minutes to use the app. Sea Mar is the organization im trying to connect to.",
"Just signed up. My opinion. App is useless! Takes you to home page. You can click on options. Shows results. So far, so good. Bottom of page. Do you have questions. If you click that, takes you to a page where you can ask your provider general questions. No other options! No way to go back to home page! To check on anything else! If I have to log out. Then log back in to find out something else. That is a waste of my time! VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS APP!",
The app is missing features that are available in the web client. Immunizations and sent messages are missing. The works well otherwise. It never crashes.,
"I mean, I suppose the app works alright but why make a video chat client you can only use on a tiny mobile device? There needs to be a Windows / Mac version of this app so people can use a proper microphone and screen, rather than having to talk to their doctor on a tiny phone screen. For something as important as communicating with your doctor, you're going to want to use proper video conferencing equipment and not garbage technology like an iPhone.",
"I started out really liking this app, and it's ability for me to work with family doctors. Then every place requires a new Log in, and if it's for a child, a second login for the same store most of the time. I've been forced to create 6 different profiles for 1 app because every different place and person requires a new profile. I can no longer remember which is which, and his forbid that I have different passwords to protect myself.",
"I liked it better when it used to notify me something had been added to MyChart (test results, lab tests were scheduled, etc.) Now I have to keep checking to see if anything has been added. I didn't know labs were ordered before my last appt. I showed up without them done. The doctor wasn't happy about not having the information he needed for my appointment and I wasn't happy to have to repeat/pay for another appt.",
"Very helpful for keeping reminders on all doctor's appointments and visit summaries. The lab results are also easy to have access to without getting a phone call from your local lab, clinic or hospital. This app is very well organized and I highly recommend it.",
"Amazing modern technological development! So many advantages, especially when your providers use it well. Easy communication with them. Easy access to records and test results. Hard to find anything bad to say about this app.",
I like but get a little confused switching back and forth between groups. Also there should be an option to upload documents if something needs to be sent and you can't fax or it takes to long in the mail.,
"All works well except that I keep getting notifications that alternate appointment times are available in Messages. But when I go there, there are no new messages. This is an almost daily occurrence and it is very annoying.",
"I love this app. I'm no longer wondering and worring about my results etc. Getting into my doctor is not easy and they never call with our results so this takes all the anxiety of waiting. The information you see is the same as the doctor sees so theres no surprises. It's a great app. I think everyone should at least check it out, I'm sure you'll want it to.",
I would give it 100stars if I could. Very convenient and the doctor responds in a timely matter if not very quickly. Very easy to navigate through considering have multiple people in the app like I have to kids and you can see which child you want to veiw their information. Very easy on the eyes as well to see where you need to go.,
"My chart is a great app! I appreciate that it shows appointments,tests,labs. It shows the appointments coming up and with whom you will be seeing. You can contact the doctors about any questions,concerns or comments that you may have about your health. I feel that my chart is an important extension for the doctors to keep in contact with their patients.",
The app can be cumbersome to navigate. It is good for getting test results and reminders for appointments. I wouldn't recommend it for asking questions of you medical providers or trying to make appointments.,
"Sometimes good, Good: is being able to communicate w/Doctors & zoom Appts & EZ rx refill via app = 5-Stars! then other items are VERY frustrating...It asks you to fill out or ""click"" on items - to fill out info & then an error message appears...so I just give up. So ZERO stars.... = 3 Stars Total.",
"Everything is on ""My Chart"", So easy to use. I'd be lost without it. If you can't remember everything ""they"" said, look and see, no matter how far back. I'd give it a +10, highly recommended it.",
"I like that I can now see my reports and find out what the doctors actually write instead of the short version I sometimes get. Have medical background so I can understand, but not all doctors like that. App is good wish I knew better how to use it, cause it always gives me a number of messages I have and I read everything, but it still tells me that I have tha same number not open. I really like this app. keeps me informed,don't have to carry my paper charts from Dr. to Dr. Which are full.",
"I have been using this my chart for probably 10+yrs. It is amazing!! You never miss an app and or any information that was wired as of you , in the app you can see all is that!! Plus send messages/ questions to anyone that is using the Sentara My Chart, also you can connect other offices whom don't use my chart and/or another Doc office, it can be connected to your may chart!!i Allow me to tell you this too...If i figured this out. anyone can!! I'M very much technology challenged !!!",
"My experience with MyChart has been terrific! I have not experienced glitches, freeze ups, nor received any error messages. The application is designed as user friendly, it efficient, and fast most of the time.",
"The linked account interface leaves alot to be desired. Between my 2 kids and I we have 9 different mychart accounts. When notifications pop up it does not tell you which account has a notice. The new 2 factor identification system doesn't work and you can't screenshot to get things like the address of the appointment, or print our refferals.",
"Marvelous way to communicate with your doctors. Inguire about test results, request new prescriptions and ask about health problems. Everyone should set one up for themselves. It's not always easy to contact them by phone. Not for emergencies. The app is not difficult to use.",
"App stopped working for several months and repeated calls got me no where. There's an email option that they give you where it takes several days to get a response from and it's very frustrating not being able to call and explain the problem and what's going on. Considering this is a medical app where your life could be affected by not seeing test results and being able to communicate with your Doctor, this is unacceptable and just shows how little they care about taking this app seriously.",
Just updated phone to Samsung S22+ MyChart is even more user friendly than before. Not a Tech person but w/ this version of MyChart I am able to navigate app w/o questoning my in house Tech support! I feel at ease using this app now. I previously been very hesitant to use & uncertain of myself. Thx for the user friendly updates & changes which will save us all time & expense.,
"I love being able to access all of mine & my family's medical info, doctors, notes, tests, scans, & lab results, all in 1 place, anytime, anywhere..It's super convenient, and being able to E-Register has saved me valuable time when checking in.. I've grown to love & depend on this app..",
"I am so grateful for this easy, convenient way to stay in touch with my doctor, access past test results and visit summaries. Having all my health information so easily accessible helps me manage my self-care and receive assistance from my physician when necessary. This app has steadily improved over the years and generally works flawlessly.",
"Impossible to do patient/doctor video conference. Tried and failed three times for the same video appointment. Must keep trying but it's VERY hard to understand. I need help with this. If I knew ""MyChart's"" customer service number, I'd call them because this is intolerable. All other aspects are OK.",
"Love how all test result, appointments, confirmation or cancelations, telehealth visits, after visit summary, medications, direct messaging to your provider and the team, and updating your info is all integrated into this system. Easy access for all your needs. I just Love these ease of use. There is so much more than I could write about.",
"My chart makes the limited time practitioners can spend with me less of an issue. I also really appreciate being able to do ""paperwork"" on my own time. One thing I irritates me is that I have a lot of health issues and appointments, and have to do the same pre check for each one; especially the Medicare part. That the same info has to be given each time, which for me is often more than weekly. There should be a first question that asks if anything has changed since your last visit.",
"Great I can view my records 👍. Know what I can't do that seems to be an extremely important function of the app? Send or read messages from my physician, doesn't matter where I'm using the app from whether my computer, phone app or phone browser. Also, what's the point in seeing what you owe if there's no function to pay the bill? 👎",
"This is a very user-friendly interface that facilitate your access to medical records, appointments, visits summary,etc. Also you can request medication refill and send non emergency message to you provider and they reply as quick as possible. I really find this platform very helpful 👏 🙂 👌",
"I like being able to have all of my prescription, mental health info., Vaccination status, hospital procedures, and list of all my doctors, in the palm of my hand! I just wish it was easier to get into when under duress! Like while in an ambulance, having a panic attack, or simply to medicated to operate properly.",
Im trying to schedule an appointment. I answered all the questions. Chose a time. Sighned in. Then it wants a code to verify my identity. When I leave to retrieve the code I can't get back where I scheduled my appointment. Been trying two hours. Each time I have to start all over again. I give up. Very very frustrating and time consuming. I use my my chart password. Why do I have to verify its me to get an appointment. This is awful. Don't like the new my chart. Too complicated. The previous,
"Seems like a good system, it's nice to be able to consolidate everything with Atlantic health into one spot. Could use features and some things updated to work faster.",
"Excellent experience using my chart to help keep my test results and all of my doctors information in one app. It also helps remind me of an upcoming appointments, and makes it easy to request refills. I highly recommend using the app if it works with your doctor's office!",
"There needs to be a way of editing the number of providers that you have. By either adding a hiding option or archive or even just a favorites section, cause I don't think I'll be contacting the random ER doctor I saw 5 years ago that still shows up on my account. There is no way of changing my primary care physician from within the app even though I have done so through the office. So test results from another doctor are forwarded to an office I haven't been to in years!",
Not for anyone with more than 1 kid. You have to create a username for each kid you have and then you can't even use the app. It needs some major updating. If you could switch between kids with 1 username it would be so much easier. Instead I have to go online and used their website as I've saved the log in infor their. I have 4 kids so the app is useless!,
I've had to talk to re-verify and talk to customer service way too often. Really angry that I have to call them again to get them the link my accounts again. I already went through this and I had my second daughter added and here we are again. Very angry because I have to have records from the doctor's visits and I can't get them without having this fixed! Worst app ever. Easier to log into my bank.,
"I like having all my doctor's in one place. Contacting physicians is so easy and right at my finger tips. Prompt answer usually the same day. I ask questions, check resent lab results and get appointment reminders. Scheduling or cancelling appointments are easy too. MyChart is so simple and convenient.",
"I really like being able to see my results of tests, notes/details of visits, time/date of future visits, etc. Even being able to schedule a new appointment & messaging your providers is great. This app is very helpful. I highly reccomend it.",
This app is priceless. Many of my medical appointments (and I have a lot) follow blood work. I don't need to drive the 60-mile round trip just to talk about the lab results. MyChart let's me see the report and do a virtual visit. I would not be able to be seen by the U.K. endocrinologist without this ability. I use the message function to ask questions or send FYI info much more often than I telephone.,
Makes communication a whole lot easier. I have a couple suggestions for a couple minor changes would help increase the ease of use for those on the patient end of things. (Not saying that its difficult to use cuz it's not),
"This app is phenomenally handy - it's very useful to be able to easily access appointment information, test results and visit notes. I like being able to chart past test results to get an idea of where I am compared with where I've been.",
"I am not sure why the NHS can't develop one app that works across all hospitals in the UK. This app has clearly not been tested for usability, it doesn't show my correct medication and this can't be updated by the patient, any letters from doctors can't be saved and then shared with other hospitals/GPs and ultimately everything feels cluttered and the navigation is terrible. This feels like a developer (probably a friend of Matt Hancock) just took the money and run.",
"I would like to rely on it rather than only using paper billing, but unfortunately the paperless billing is so short term and does not provide adequate details of previous payments that I have returned to paper billing. I was getting charged for something I believed I paid, but could not discern what the charges were for.",
"Guthrie Health Care is the best. Now, MyChart - I have never used an app as clearly simply and so useful. From scheduling appointments & having the app add them to your calendar(s) to informing the staff that you have arrived for your appointments. I am most impressed with the ability to check in before each visit so I do not have to stand at the front desk and answer a lot of questions before my appointment. Also being able to message the staff and receive immediate replies is very impressive.",
"I like the app... but this security code, I've been given 4 different code numbers just to get into My Chart... Frustrating to say the least... Well I've lost my contacts on my old phone, and can't get into My Chart, on the new phone, nothing but a hassle on something that should be so simple , my username nor my password, works anymore, just frustrating to say the least...",
"I love that I can access all my results, appointments, medications, etc. and communicate with my doctors all at my finger tips. My Chart is a great app to have, very helpful and convenient.",
"Pretty good app. Quick and responsive. Accommodates biometric sign in. Homepage can be crowded with non-relevant notifications but that can be cleared easily. Homepage has everything you need to find results, history, and appointments. You can make appointments and request medication refills too.",
"I live in a very remote location, so MyChart is critical to my healthcare. Often I experience low bandwidth or slow response internet, and there is nothing I can do to make that better. I use many other apps that require internet, yet MyChart gives me server error when my internet conditions are less than optimal - when other communications apps still function. A health critical app like MyChart should be more tolerant to internet issues than other apps, not less.",
"Great way to keep track of your appts, meds, msgs, past visits, test results, everything you need for your healthcare. So much better when you have everything you need in one place. I use it often and have never had any problems.",
I really enjoy this application because it keeps me informed of all my appointments and I'm able to access my care team and schedule appointments and it's very well optimized as well as very well coordinated for people to go through. The application is very useful for me when I communicate with my primary physician.,
I love this app! I have no complaints about it. It allows me to view all my doctors notes and allows me to communicate with my primary care physician! She is ABSOLUTELY the best doctor by far in my 70 years. If I send her a question or have a health issue she responds quickly even late after her office hours and weekends. So so much easier than the old way of having to call a answering service. I also love being able to see my test results from all of my doctors who are in the same network.,
This is an example of an interactive user interface that is poorly designed causing needless anxiety for the patient to navigate! It is shocking that it came from Epic and that NYP allowed it to deployed. It is obvious that the kind of user testing was not performed nor if a soft launch was carried those responsible should have been removed from the project.,
"Navigating a little difficult after you select some sections, there isn't a way to navigate back to the Menu to select another section. I get logged out to be able to navigate to another section. The easy am want to use this the open when I have to.",
"This app worked fine until now .I use it a lot with two children with special medical needs. Now it has stopped working. I have a video visit with my daughter's doctor today. Now I get to walk around with the laptop in my hand. UGH! The updated app will not let me log in.The icon just spins. Here's the frustrating part. When you click the HELP button. It says, ""If you are having trouble logging in, contact technical support"" . That all, There is no phone number, no info at all on how to get technical support. Jole Sack could fix this FUBAR.",
"I have few issues outside of code send times. All my essential health records in one place, even lists of current medications, and access to customer care. You can even check in to your appointments in the app!! Great stuff. Get beefier servers.",
Great app! Makes things very convenient so that I can schedule an appointments or cancel one if needed..! Also there is a lot of cool features to this app that I think a lot of people would like and enjoy...!!! 😄😁,
"I love this app. It's so nice to be able to message my doctor and have him or his nurses respond within an hour or 2. It reminds me of my upcoming appointments and I am able to see anything from every doctor I see, all in one place. It used to be hard to get a hold of your primary care doctor when calling and emailing were the only options and now it takes me around 5 minutes, depending on why I'm messaging, to ask him questions and it lets me know when they have seen it!",
I do not like this app because I can not change from messages to the home screen or other locations without shutting down. Also the app shows I have a messages within the app but it is not easy to find.,
"Really like My Chart. Easy to use and so convenient. Can't give five stars because of a couple issues ... Can only make appts with the doctor's that are assigned to your account, which are the doctor's that you have seen. This is an issue with North Oaks (not the app) when I use My Chart I can make an appt with any doctor. I don't need referrals with my ins so I'm being restricted by NO. Second issue is that I can't delete certain messages, past appts, test, referrals, etc.",
This app is extremely helpful in keeping track of my appointments and medical testing. I love having the option to message providers rather than calling them and it is convenient to be able to schedule through the app as well.,
This worked great for years. Now All the sudden... and I believe it's linked to the latest update date of October 12th.... I can't see any of my son's appointments from the past or future and no one can seem to figure it to out! I was also told today that you need an Android of 10 or newer which according to the app details it says a 7 or newer not sure anyone knows what's going on🤦‍♀️,
Very easy for Appointment reminders and letting me know when bills are due. I like being able to see my history also. It helped when I was looking to see if the hospital had the doctor needed as well. I am glad this app is available!,
Pulling all my medical history together has open my eyes to several issues that had been overlooked. I have seen several doctors within many different organizations throughout the years. Which is why there was no continuity of care. Having a complete history in a central location has allowed me to identify pertinent issues that are FINALLY being addressed. I wish more locations were available to link.,
Ita getting better. Biometrics does now function. It would be better of you could just default to having biometrics being your primary unlock. It has a button to let you access this unlock BUT should have a secondary unlock available below the password box for biometrics. Also when messages are recieved there is no way to see who has read them. As folks may not reapond for days after readimg a message I would like to know who read it so i can take steps to get in touch with my docs if needed.,
"Not the most UI friendly app, but it works. However, every time I open it I am prompted to provide the pass code emailed to me even though I check the box to recognize my device in the future. A bit obnoxious, but not a deal breaker.",
"Easy access to health care appointments, communications, test results. Really user-friendly, the organization of this app is so helpful during times of (medical) stress and a true relief instead of waiting on the phone.",
"Good App to use mostly and easy-to-use interface. Since the update recently, I have multiple locations and now not all of them are not being able to see the names of each location.",
"I absolutely love this app!! Everything is in one place including: messages from my doctor, test results, appointments past and present, notes from those appointments, referrals etc...PLUS I can message my doctor right from the app on my phone!! So convenient!",
I can see everything first hand as results are coming in. Everything is up to date on my care. All my Drs are listed. And my visits to other locations are automatically added as well. It's fun to use and very useful. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.,
"THe concept makes sense and is really needed. Especially during these times in 2020. However, it is not applicable if you are doing a consult and need to use a laptop instead of a phone for location reasons. Installing it on the ipad didn't work because apparently it didn't have the necessary plug-in. Was not aware of this until a day before the appointment when we attempted to run the app. Doing a mental health/well being check-in/consult with a child did not give the child the autonomy that was needed because he needed to rely on an adult to work with errors and mobile interruptions. My wife uses another program for therapy sessions that is a little more user firendly.",
"myChart can be a helpful tool at times, but I find that support is seriously lacking. My concerns are not typically addressed in ways that are helpful or constructive. The support people are nice, but they won't follow through on commitments and some of their hidebound policies are useless and unreasonable and do NOT allow for special, individual circumstances. I've been trying to get HELPFUL attention for the same issue for over a year and a half and it's a total joke.",
"Easy, functional and user friendly. I can keep track of all of my kids and my health everything here! From doc appts to lab results. As soon as a nurse or doctor enters info into their system it pops up in my mychart app. I'd be lost without it. No cons here at all. I've even messaged my PT that I was running late and they were able to reply right back.",
I SPENT FOREVER TRYING TO LOG IN!!! I came up with a username and password DOESN'T WORK!!! I HAVE A TEST RESULT that I can't VIEW 😬😬😬😬😬😬 6/15/22 I'm using another app using a pass code using a 4 digit pin ITS AWESOME! I DON'T HAVE to put in a password anymore and I can view results and messages quickly.,
"I very much like this app. It helps me keep track of my medical stuff like never before. I have 1 huge problem with it though. It keeps telling me that I have a message that can't be viewed on the app and literally all it is, is like 4 sentences that my insurance company approved something! Seriously though I think that my $1k+ smart phone can handle 4 sentences after using my fingerprints to authenticate that it's really me......",
"Using this app it's nice to be able to see my test results before the Dr does and also read the Dr comments so you sometimes know a little more than what was told. Also, I can keep up with my meds. I have a seven day pill pack and I go down my list of meds, which is slot, to make sure I don't miss any. I can also get refills from this app. Very satisfied with it.",
I get test results as soon as they are available without having to wait for doctors and nurses. I am able to do most things in the app tgat I used to have to do over the phone. I can't really go through all that I was able to do just in the last month alone. Add yo it that I have access to my doctor as well as the pharmacy I use through this app. I just love convenience and this app is nothing but convenient!,
"Completely useless now. It use to work, but now I can't even login. The last time I logged in a week ago, it wasn't even my medical records but someone elses for both my laptop and android. I'm really concerned now because obviously there's a serious problem with site and app. Your personal information as well as mine could be going to other users and it doesn't seem like anyone is fixing it. Idk if this is covered under the HIPPA laws, but I will be checking it out for possible violations.",
"Great app, never have had any problems. I message my doctor, request refills, set appointments, everything without the need to call and hold forever. I do wish there was the option to include attachments to the messages we send to and from the doctor.",
"I really love this app! it is perfect for making sure you have your appt correct, everything you need to know you get the results before the Dr does. and I don't know how we ever lived without this app. it does go from state to state, all my California surgical records and lab records are here for my doctors in South Carolina to look at It is a beautiful beautiful thing.",
Absolutely love this application. It has my mobile Corona virus qr scan vaccination for digital scanning so I can have proof on my mobile device at any time. It also contains all of my labs that my doctor orders. This comes in handy to personally reference and prepare to mention any concerns with medical professionals. Vaccination reminders for things like the flu shot are also available. It also stores other important imagination like my medication allergies.,
"It is very effective and efficient. I have an issue with listening to someone explain something versus reading it. The healthcare professionals explain things still, but MyChart makes it so much easier to understand. I can Google medical jargon to understand it better since I can see it without having to wait for a F.O.I.A response.",
Information on tests and ability to schedule and be reminded of appointments is great. I do wish they would fix the feature that notifies the front desk that the patient has arrived. It NEVER works.,
"This app works really well for keeping track of your appointments, Contacting your doctor. In fact I was recently sick and was able to contact my doctor through the app and speak with a nurse and ultimately my doctor within hours of leaving a text. Are using this app I was able to get an appointment scheduled to be seen that day.The app also keeps a log of all your medical tests. With this app you can communicate directly with your doctor about what those results mean. Definitely use this app",
"My Chart is an app I wouldn't want to be without! I can manage scheduling, review appointment status, review history and more! I get test results within hours and I can study them. It answers questions before I have to ask! It is a wonderful medical service tool!",
"Horrible. Missing information, mismatched dates, no effective way to report problems (why I'm here). I'm left chatting with some poor nurse who is seeing different due dates for the same tests. Confusing duplications. Noticeable delays between orders submitted and arriving at testing facilities. The app supposedly designed for patient communication (in fact, it's essentially the ONLY communication) contains terms and instructions that would be completely incomprehensible to the average patient.",
New updates need reversed. I was able to see all of my test results last year. I changed nothing. I am still logged into the app but it doesn't show hardly any of my information. Talked to a person at local carle office and they told me to update the app. It is already up to date. How is it that nearly everyone complains about the same issues but every single person must email your customer service? Should you guys not just fix the bugs??,
Horrible. This App makes it impossible to speak to your doctors or even start an account. The app and links sent to me by the Hospital literally wouldn't even let me create an account. I had to stop services and now I have no access to the Therapy or Medicine I need. I hate this app. They need to use Blue Jeans or another alternative. This one doesn't even work. This app has no place as a mediator between doctors and paitents. A Horrible app.,
Very easy to keep all medical needs in one place &keep in contact during the pandemic while everything has an added layer of difficulties .This brings all your needs to your fingertips .Calendars of appts &visits .Tests &medication renewals ..It's very convenient.Id suggest to anyone whom has the availability to access,
"I've been using MyChart from the day I was diagnosed with end stage, Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, about 4 years ago. The best medical app I've ever used, and it's everything anyone would need, for all necessary doctor messages, and med lists, diagnoses, test results, and everything anyone would need to be fully informed, and in touch with their specialist doctors. Just the best.",
"As a first time patient at ARC, I have never used an online chart info, but I like it immensely..I'm lucky that I have a fantastic Dr and she documents everything. I'm an RN so I can read info like lab etc and everything is up to date..the app is totally yours alone. I just emailed, uploaded my new Insurance, it took 2 minutes to do If y'all don't have a app like this, see if u can get one. There are no ads, and it's easy to use.",
"I can't even sign up. I tried signing up. I'm a new user, so it says to click sign up online, then it will send you a code. I filled out all my information, even did the ReCaptcha. I click submit,& it says the ReCaptcha needs to be completed & I did finish it. At the same time, a heart shows up & says ""loading"" doesn't go away, nothing happens. So it's not letting me sign up EVEN THOUGH I've completed the entire form & the recaptcha! If I can sign up I'll update my review!",
"it is especially nice being able to access test results, current and past medications, and other records while being a patient hospitalized. for me, it is better to read something to understand it rather than just having the doctors and nurses explain it! thank you!",
"This has made communicating with my physicians so much easier and efficient! I no longer wait on hold, wait for an available nurse, and wait for an answer. It's also great for med refills. I can see when the request is viewed and when they sent it to the pharmacy. Visit summaries, procedure prep instructions, check in, and updating my contact and billing info are all so much easier! Honestly, I can't say anything negative about this app. It genuinely makes my life easier.",
"The remember my username setting keeps turning itself back on, it's been incredibly frustrating trying to get signed on. If it wasn't for its poor ability to use LastPass and forget the username I would give it four or five stars.",
This app is 95% user friendly. I never have issues with my medical records and test results but the billing and paid receipts could more readily available and FSA acceptable or just plain easy to read. My employer does not accept them as provided and always asks for more itemized info or denies my claim outright. It can be frustrating.,
"I enjoy this app because I have access to my lab results without having to wait for a follow up appointment. It makes knowing what is going on with my health easier to access. Also, if I have any questions I can leave a quick message for any of my Drs through the app. It's easier than trying to leave a phone message they may never hear",
"No graphs to show how blood values are changing. Prefer to have results all on 1 page rather than having to click on groups to find out what 1 particular value is, particularly when I have to screenshot results to send to other doctors not on the system.",
"So convenient. Easy to make appointments, get refills, really just do business in general while busy with everyday life. Love it. 2/7/23 I continue to love this app. So convenient. Can't say enigma good things about this app. Probably the best app. I have. Keep up the great work. 👍",
"Excellent App! While I was in the hospital I was able to get results from all testing preformed, review the results and have meaningful dialog with my care team. Definitely a one-stop-shopping app. I can honestly recommend to others to download the app.",
Like the results and records. BUT severe lack of bring about to schedule wellness appointments. The filters are forced hard when it's a medical group and your doctor moved on. Would love an option for any provider. Had to go to the office for an actually appointment since the doctor no longer available.,
I'm honestly so sick of mychart. I have been locked out so many times. It says wrong password so I reset the password and put in the password I thought it was as the new one and it tells me I can't use the current password.... so if that's the current password I should be able to get in right? Wrong! It's so frustrating! For a long time I had a 4 digit pin and would get right in. Now it won't let me. Shouldnt that be MY choice??!!! Idc who gets into sees my info about my bronchitis or the flu.,
"Great app to use to have access to your medical records, get reminders for upcoming appointments, and if you want to ask your doctor a question but not make an appointment, you can message them. You can also pay your bills so it makes keeping everything medical related super organized.",
Smooth switching between organizations sometimes errors over-all the app is very easy to communicate to my different sources in health thank you,
"This is the best platform I have ever used. Its great for scheduling, refill prescription s, and most importantly communication with my care team thats prompt with an easy access record of what was discussed. Very intuitive and helpful software.",
"This app is very helpful!! I would 100% recommend it to anyone!. It makes going to the doctors so much easier, less of a hassle. Easy to directly communicate to your doctors. Best part is you can link your doctor offices together, if they are under different physicality's & systems. Over all it makes you're life & their life's simpler.",
Excellent communication portal. Works terrific as a method to track medications and appointments.,
"At first, it was a little difficult, but practice makes perfect, I enjoy texting with the medical team when I have questions. There's more things you can do, like pay , make appointments and see test results.",
It works sporadically.. i haven't been able to see any test results for the past few months.,
I love this app. But seem to be having problems signing in tonight. It does not want to take my password. When I got to forgot password it will not bring up keyboard so I can enter information. I use to use the 4 number entery. But it says my password has been changed. Want let me sign in any other way either. Has something been done to the system? Thank you for you help. I will contact them.,
Great app. You can find anything you need to know about your health. It even list your meds so you don't have to write them down or bring them with you. It keeps track of your appointments. You don't have to wait for one doctors office to send records to the other doctors office. It's all there! I have just moved and hoping my new health system is on/uses mychart!!,
All the important information is buried in this app. You can tell MyCharts patients are not the priority,
"Useful app when it works, very glitchy , won't let me login a lot of times, locks me out of my accounts. 90% of the time it says system down. Especially for CVS for some reason. So the theory is great the performance is only so so. Needs some serious work still . Once it's no longer a beta feeling app I'd probably give it 5 stars cuz this is the way medicine should be , everything in one place so all the docs can see and be on the same page.",
Very easy to use and very convenient,
MyChart makes it so much easier to schedule appointments and to keep up with everything at the doctors.,
Love application and the availability of my medical records on the palm of my hands.,
"If you have no real medical issues it may be great. But, I was trying to check in and much of the information was incorrect, but I couldn't change it. They had a lot missing too. This ap through U of R is constantly not working in connection with Rochester Regional mycare through mychart. At this point there are not images showing. A message from UofR is blank. Appointments too.",
"Terrible app. Interface is annoying to use. Can't download any documents. Messaging is almost non existent. Can't take screen shots, idgaf about privacy. Can't even access invoice recipes to turn into insurance.",
Info contained in app is accurate. Message sending to a provider is not possible. Despite doctor always telling us to send him a message it is not possible. App will not allow you to pick a contact(s) to message. App has no help staff to work thru issues and can not help with app issues. You are limited to just what the app supplies. Clinic staff always instructs you to message your provider BUT you can't.,
"So far, the MyChart app is working fine.",
"I really like this app, as I can send in refills and texts questions,etc to nurse and doctor. Handy for me.",
This is a really good option. Some one from the office usually responds pretty fast.,
"I haven't been able to read my messages for months. I can see a preview from the home screen but it will not load anything other than a blank page. I've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, and clearing storage.",
"At 51 yrs old, I've lived in 48 different states. This is, hand down, the most organized system ever. Keep up the great work!",
I love that I'm able to text him my request in their back to me within 24-48 hours if it's something that's not immediate I can deal with this,
"This tool gives detailed information about the patient history, upcoming visits, payment options, link to other facility records and lot more. There are few short comings in the app, which I may need to figure out or call the support to resolve, but that doesn't stop me from using this app. Very handy and helpful app. I recommend this every one.",
No good can't give and receive responses from my doctor in a timely manner.,
The app works well and is easy to use.,
"Basically a broadcast medium to the patient. If one sends a message to the provider's office, (s)he probably doesn't see it unless the staffer decides it is important. The default setting is only a few tens of characters. That means detailed questions or responses come up against a hard wall. Every space and punctuation mark count. Limits ability to communicate effectively doctor-patient-doctor when describing issues, asking prescription medicine specific questions.",
"Keep moving functions around making them hard to find. Once found, very functional. Better than phone when applicable. Open 24/7. Connects to a few (so far) other health systems. Private practice info must be scanned into MHR. OVERALL a big PLUS.",
"Has of 8-30-23 Updated the app now it won't log in! Won't let you change the password. What did you people do to this app? 0 stars if I could! Edit: It still WONT LOG IN!!! WTH??!! WOULD YOU SAY "" WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE ENJOYING THE APP"" In fact I'm not enjoying the app!!!! Has of September 5, I uninstalled this app. I'm tired of it not loading, not logging in and nothing but errors",
Everyone at the clinic are very professional. Geoff and Wendy are top notch. Make their patients feel comfortable and relaxed. 5 stars,
"The app is great. I live 15 minutes from my medical group and I spent 3 afternoons trying to get labwork scheduled. After hearing all about COVID, my ""wait time"" was 24 minutes or 30 minutes or 39 minutes. Then I wanted called back. They called back and a recording said that I was ""1st in the Q"". Then, they were busy answering calls. After 20 minutes of being ""1st in the Q"", I hung up. I set up OSFMyChart and have been communicating through messages. It is great. Get the app. No more wait times.",
"Great app, easy to setup appointments and you can see all your medications and upcoming visits with your doctor. You can also see the results of your tests and message your doctor if you have questions about your results.",
"All of my medications are not actively available in the new MyChart. They all say they are not currently available for renewal until after my next office visit. Without going into detail, this is the most cumbersome piece of garbage I've ever encountered. Absolutely frustrating to the max. The old system at the hospital that I go to had all of my medications listed, just why they could not be integrated into the new system without my needing to make an appointment with my doctor is beyond me.",
The app is very simple and very handy. It makes making appointments a simple task. Also stay in touch with your provider. University health care is the best medical in the western United States. They have caring staff and also staff who will stand beside you when your in the worst condition and help you get back to life and living the proper way. Thanks u of u Dr's and staff and thanks for the app,
"Great to have that way I'm able to communicate with my Dr on my schedule. Not put on lengthy hold times to get a message to my Dr. I can ask just about anything through the app. From appointments, refills and test results and much more. Great tool to have in the palm of my hands. Should I be out of town I have everything I need with me. No bulky paperwork or the chance to misplace my documents.",
"this app was great until the new security feature requiring me to get an e-mail code and enter it every time i use the app. this feature is very inconvenient if like me, you do not have another device or a split screen function on your phone. i have been on 6 times today messaging with my medical care team and every time i hit the ""skip this step next time"" button but every time i still have to get an e-mail verification code. how can i opt out of this new feature?",
"I love it, test results, and messaging with doctor and medical assistant. I use it all the time!",
Works great this makes your medical information much easier too retrieve with apps like this. Great to get feedback from doctor and lab results instead of having to wait for days and be glued to your phone. One plus with covid is it spead up these kind of apps and teletherapy.,
"I've used MyChart well over a year and have become dependent on it. You can view the results of tests or labs. It keeps an itinerary of future tests, lab, or procedures. You can open written communications with your doctors if you have questions. With the options set by your medical team, you can maintain communications by phone, text, or through the internet .",
"Having to deal with a lot of doctors, tests , appointments and new health issues MYCHART helps keep me on tack. Appointment reminders , fast test results . Able to investigate health issues. Contact Doctors, ask questions ,refill prescriptions and a lot more ! I really like this app. Would highly recommend this to everyone !",
App has a flaw. If you read this your application is easy to hack. You may want to know that I am not happy with the fact that you can't keep my information secure,
Perfect and easy to use 👌,
This app is so convenient when you need refills on medication. Now a days you have to call another call center in a different state and get people who have no clue what you need and lie to you when you need a call back from a doctor. All health apps are so much better. You can leave messages about your concerns and get a message back through these health apps.,
"@MyChart app, I just wanted to thank you so much for creating such an amazing and beneficial, user friendly app. Life is so much easier to access my own personal medical records, make doctor appointments, request medication refills, referrals, email my Pr",
"MyChart has literally saved my life. I have many health issues and multiple providers. I can easily contact my health team through messages. It's easy for my providers to check out everything if I happen to go to the ER. My entire family, from Seattle to Texas have MyChart and it's great for them too. I highly recommend this app if you can get it.",
"This app is not the most intuitive at first, but it's heads above others. I have doctors using MyChart, Charm, FollowMyHealth, NextMD, and some others I haven't even accessed. The more I use MyChart, the easier it gets, and after using multiple others, it's definitely the easiest. I'm now getting instant access to my lab results, which is awesome. I also love that I can link my records between my doctors that use it, which is so helpful when you see as many doctors as I do.",
I really did not want to rate yet bc I just began to use. I will update.,
I like this app. Makes it real easy to see what my treatments have been and what's coming next. I can see all meds and vitamins I take and all my info to be able to compare at check in when there is a new person at the check in desk. We can compare info and get all straightened out. Nice. Also nice to see doctors summary and notes. Very nice to see those when trying to remember who said what and when.,
"My mother is in LMC HOSPITAL, and she is hard of hearing. I have tried to use my chart for her to find out if she is okay! But the activation code is not working.",
"Great, efficient way of communication between many departments of the hospital and the patient. Love having access to this site. I just had surgery and couldn't remenber all the instructions. Its downloaded on here. I have many upcoming PT appointments/ dr appointments. This is an excellent way to make sure I have all the correct dates/times. I may need documentation of some of my past medical records. This is another very simple way of getting them. This is a huge asset and I love this system!",
"This app is such a great tool, is so easy to use, and convenient when I have questions about my health. Everything you need is right at your disposal.",
It's a pretty handy app to have. I use it for keeping track of pending vaccinations and doctor's appointments. Plus I can communicate directly with the doctors if I have any concerns. Nice. (It really needs a dark mode. That would earn it an additional star.),
I find it to be very useful!! Like alot!!!,
"Does it's job, but....I'm a caretaker for an older adult. Obviously, he doesn't have a smartphone, so I put this app on my phone so we don't lose track of appts and test results. All well and good except there is no way for me to access all of MY health and billing info. Multiple profiles would be a must for those with multiple children and dependents.",
"This is an overwhelming ap that doesn't enable you to conduct business. You can message providers, see results, & schedule appointments. Still have to call during normal hours to cancel or reschedule appointments. Because the ap does not list the names of non-medical providers, when you try to reschedule those appointments and the operator asks for their name... you can't provide it. Billing messages fill up your ap in box. In short, core business functions get an A, but everything fails F!",
I like having my test results at my finger tips. No longer need to ask Dr for copy. Can print myself.,
"This is so easy to use. You are able to make appointments, check test results, leave a message for the doctor and a lot more. You can also check in with the app. Want a referral, MyChart can do that; want/need to share your medical history with other health organizations? MyChart has you covered. Kudos to developer. Okay one major concern: the search criteria for new pharmacies needs a look up by phone number. With mail order companies you don't always have a zip code.",
"Having extremely difficult time setting up a Mychart account for the U of Medicine, in Seattle, Wa. It was impossible to make a $35.00 payment. None of the credit cards on file would not work. couldn't come up with an acceptable pass word. Have given up attempting to make a payment thru your system. I do have a n existing MyChart account for the Swedish/Providence system.",
"I am enjoying this app. It's easy to get around, check my appointments, tests and messages.",
"It's absolutely convenient for contacting doctors or finding appointments, and any info needed related to my medical history. The fact that the info is posted so quickly is amazing. Even more amazing is the fact that the info cannot be transferred by anyone. I was not able to forward info to an insurance agent because the files are confidential. I appreciated learning that for myself.",
"This app makes everything so much easier. It is very helpful and definitely streamlines the entire process, labs, appointment scheduling, interaction between medical facilities, and refill requests. Superb",
"This whole app as well as the internal system is garbage. Get routed to the wrong people, get multiples of notifications, providers or automation is sending out messages on its own n makes it seem like the patient sent it.",
"Tried following the instructions provided by the health care provider and had great difficulty with their instructions. After installing the app on a Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 I tried to login to the provider and was informed that I need to update the app. Really, I just installed the app. Unfortunately, the app store didn't have another version to update to, now what?",
Very easy to use and efficient!,
"This app works well. I like that I can see my test results and then ask questions about specific tests. I also enjoy the direct communication I can have with my doctors without having to pick up the phone and stop them from what they're doing in the middle of the day. The only thing I don't like is because one of my doctors is in private practice, I'm not able to get my records from there, which also means I'm not able to remove an alert that keeps popping up.",
"I think this app is nice, but I didnt give it 5 stars because I think it would be even more helpful if it had an ""after visit summary"" feature under health summary, that way the parent can always keep up with the information or refer back to a certain visit. Plus side the doctors office wouldn't have to waste so much paper. ~HOPEFULLY THAT OPTION GETS ADDED~",
It is terrible. Don't work properly. Issues all the time with providence providers.,
"Awesome, easy. Just a click and I'm in to a perfect setup where I can click to know my next appt and I can also change it if it need be. I love it I can scroll down and read my upcoming medical needs so I can plan ahead and schedule as I see fit. And I can review my prescriptions and administered details. Absolutely love it you made life so much easier. Thank You",
"Having all records of medical treatment, test results, medications and appointments available at your fingertips is extremely important and helpful. I cannot imagine keeping track of all this via hardcopy ever again. Appointments even populate your e-calendar!",
The best way to keep up with your next appointments and its location/time/ & medications taken. 💊 😓,
Is is easy to keep up with appointments,
Had a difficult time setting up the app on phone but after a little work it worked fine.,
"Works well. Great for communication with physician, making appointments and reading test results.",
"I tried several times to create an account for my mother, but was not able to. Third-party verification is pretty much worthless. Why should I provide financial information to that third-party? After finally creatin account, tried to create username & password. Tried multiple user names & used specified formats, but every attempt failed. Called help desk, but was told they cannot help me without mother's verbal permission, but she can't talk right now. Maybe I should have changed my voice.",
The app is amazing only thing I wish is that you could print out the information is send it to an email,
I love the app.. Its easy to use but only thing i dont like bout it is that it gives u the option to cancel an appointment but when u click on it to cancel that appointment it pops up a window saying please call to cancel ur appointment... If that is there for us to use then we should be allowed to cancel it.. An u cant even schdule an appointment either...,
Nice app easy to navigate.,
"I absolutely hate this app. I just want to know what my messages are, when my appointments are, etc and it's like Fort Knox! I despise HIPPA!!! I have nothing to hide and there should be options so I can have easier access to my medical records. Who has a fax anymore? Just email me my eye glass Rx for heaven's sake. Who can harm me knowing that. I should be able to choose how I receive all my medical information. I am capable of doing that. I am not stupid! NO STARS",
Excellent and easy to use!,
"MyChart is the best health app that was created for the Doctor/Patient communication. It allows the patient to have a direct view of their health record, future/past appointments, letters/referrals sent, bill payments, etc. This app affords one a hands-on approach to knowing exactly what was discussed with the doctor/assistant/staff. It also helps the environment because every doctor's visit can now be viewed on the phone or computer; therefore, assisting with paperless transactions.",
"Great app. Only issues I've ever had have been taking a picture rather than attaching a picture. Taking a picture to upload, such as insurance card, has caused the app to crash everytime.",
Most of the time app doesn't work. When you login and press on anything it will just say an error occurred. Thought maybe it was just my phone so had me daughter try it on her phone and Mychart does the same on her phone. Gave 2 stars just because when it does work (rarely) it is nice.,
I have to have four different MyChart accounts to see all of my medical records. This fact alone makes it a lousy app.,
"I love Trinity Health. The doctors and staff are wonderful. They take,very good care,of me",
"I like the My Chart App because all of your different doctors that are in the same network, can see all of the different information about you, (Blood Test Results, or any other Results or tests, or Procedures that you have done) all in one place. That makes it a lot easier for you, and your doctors to be able to see, what has been done, and possibly what needs to be done, and shows all of your different appointments, bills, list of medications etc, all in one place. It makes it very easy.",
My phone updated and deleted the original app that my healthcare provider uses so I downloaded this one. It took a little getting used to as I had used the last one for several years but otherwise I'm totally happy with this app. In fact there's one thing for sure I like better and that's in the personalize section. The old app only has pink as a choice and this one has purple so I'm totally happy about that!,
Excellent app to keep an eye on treatment and medication Inc test results,
Easy to use...Information needed is easily accessible.....,
"For several years, I have usred MyChart and appreciated it a great deal. Then I discovered a reportable problem, which the hospital proceeded to try to fix. In the process, my access to MyChart was totally eliminated and I couldn't verify appointments or prescriptions. It was not just aggravating; it was also dangerous. I called three times to by PCP's office and to the tech help people for My Chart, requesting to get my access to My Chart repaired. Nice people, but not effective. I'm getting angry. PLEASE FIX. I don't want to have to make a big fuss out of this I just want to do the best possible communication with my health care professionals,. PLEASE!!! Sick people don't need unnecessary anxiety over electronic systems.",
"Convenient app for my medical info, provides oftenly updated test results (almost weekly for me due to meds); I couldn't use it but for non-physc (which are most of mine..) I believe you can easily request refills for, you can reschedule appts and cancel in a convenient matter, you can request medical visits (I don't think I can w my counselor just Dr visits), you can easily ask questions to your Dr specifically through the app,in a timely manner. Also you can check vaccinations current and due",
"I have never enjoyed using this app prior to the Cleveland Clinic. It is simple, easy & very direct. Making it truly pleasurable. When dealing with medical issues & being able to contact the doctor & his amazing associates is an incredible stress reliever. Which I am extremely grateful to have at my fingertips!! Thank you so very much for an extremely ""USER FRIENDLY APP.""",
"Not really a fan, I truly dislike all of my family's private medical info all over the internet that can easily be hacked, & shown to any & everyone. The ONLY reason I use it is because I feel forced to do so if myself or my child have to do a telemedicine app in order to be seen if/when the hospitals does not allow in-person visits. I 100% dislike every single piece of my medical life broadcast to any & every medical person who has access. Although it's easy to use. I prefer to remain private.",
"I like this app. It is very easy to understand and results are posted very fast. My PC owner/hospital has changed to a new app, I like this one much better. It also links all of my doctors or any medical treatment to this app. I hope my PC doesn't stop using it.",
This has simplified my life! Keeps me on top of all my appointments with all my providers and makes it easy to ask for refills and view my health information. I can access test results and get reminders for wellness visits and tests. I love that I can check in to my appointment on the app in my car before even going in!!,
"Far to many text and email messages to check My Chart, and they keep coming even after logging in. Billing info is very diffilcult to follow up on and check information about charges. The app is very helpful in many ways but needs a lot of fine tuning.",
"Easy login process. Easy to navigate through. Medical information including visit notes, prescription, lab results, and upcoming visit notifications available to patient and medical staff 24/7.",
"Usually have to login on PC because the mobile app all too often says function not available, try later.",
"Definitely a great way to stay in the loop and ahead. When seeing the doctor, and he order test, you don't have to wait on results. You get them immediately. You can pay bills through this app as well. Schedule appointments without being on hold for hours. Ask questions to you Doctor with out scheduling an appointment. I love this chart.",
"Great customer service, wonderful environment, everyone that works there are friendly and attentive to your needs and very observating...great place to get cared for, no long waits",
I love this app!! I recently have had some health issues that require me to see several different specialists and this app helps me keep my appointments in order. It also gives me my lab results as soon as they come in so I don't have to wait for my next appointment to hear the results!,
I love being able to see my test results without calling the doctor. All of my medical information is available and easy to navigate. I can make and cancel appointments and request medication refills. Everything is at your finger tips. What a Great app!,
Can be very confusing at times. I've experienced a much better format than this one. Needs to be reformed.,
"I use this app for 99.9% of all of my medical appointment scheduling, results review, and communicating with my healthcare professionals in a convenient and efficient manner. I can also switch between facilities on this app which makes consolidating medical records much much easier.",
"Cant rest password. Cant reset username. When I go to make a new account it tells me there's already an account associated with the info given. Tried restting my password, app tells me that the info provided does not match any records. How can I be in the system and not in at the same time?? Tried giving the telephone number a call, went straight to voice mail. I just want to see the doctor",
I love the convenience to get messages to and from my Dr!,
"Keeps you informed. Helps keep track of appointments, and test results. You can also pay your medical bills here. Granted, it works best within the Beaumont network, for example, I mistakenly chose a Beaumont 'affiliated' Dermatologist and that information wasn't saved on the app. But test results come to you just as fast as they go to your Dr. It's a great way to keep track of your medical information.",
"This app is horrible, yeah it looks professional but good luck being able to message your doctor, or leave messages for your so called care team. Instead you have to call and be put on hold for 30 minutes just to leave a message or talk to someone. Just a sad system, especially for someone that's disabled. If I could give less than 1 star I would.",
"Don't like the app. Not that simple of a user interface. As a user, I don't have full control to delete or reschedule a lot of the selected services such as medical refills or cansalling an appointment reminder.",
"MyChart is very easy and convenient to use. I've had good experiences communicating with providers, getting med refill authorizations, and requesting appointments. I love being able to review my medical history at anytime!",
"I spent over 30 minutes sending reset codes this morning for my password. None of them worked. Got home from work spent another 30 min at least. Finally one worked go to log in with the new password and it doesnt work either, says its wrong. Doesnt matter what i do. Im done. Screw it. My blood pressure is higher now. Thanks a lot for nothing!",
"This application is the best in any store, I've been using it since it was just starting and I have not had any problems or issues. I have many medical issues, and anytime I see a new doctor or facility I get many compliments because of this Application. I can only say on my personal experience I will not use any other Application for my medical records. I have everything in one place, and as soon as the doctor gets my results I do too, sometimes even before the doctor. Simply the best one ever",
"I just logged in. I have what you are calling ""letters"" going back over one year. These a messages, not letters. Letters are what one receives in the mail. Not only did I not receive these in the mail, I didn't receive them in email or by any other means. The information was only a available in the MyChart app. Your passive communications are not helpful. It is difficult to reconcile all of the messaging about supporting my health care needs when I am not getting any messages (or letters).",
"My chart is awesome! Your staff is great, Dr Hope is the best,my chart gives me a quick way to communicate with my Doctor.",
A very direct and somewhat easy to use tool to keep track of medical proceedures and test results !,
I used to love this app but not anymore. The new layout is terrible. Keep giving me server and login issues. I'm using this app since its inception and saw it evolving for the better but this last update is giving me headaches. I have to try so many times just to login. Why have they removed the fingerprint sensor? Can't see future appointments and other messages. It was such a good app and now its a waste of time.,
Absolutely wonderful to have all your doctors medications appointments test results and añy other medical information at your finger tips. No more calling offices and being put on hold just to make an appointment. Easy breezy and right through the app is how I schedule appointments. They even keep track of when your mammograms and other important screenings are due. Has changed my life for the better.,
Easy to use and see your results,
It has a nice clean inter face. Simple and easy to understand. Easy to navigate. If I dismiss something it doesn't constantly reappear. Just overall a great app.,
"Really like this app, can access appointments, make appointments, order meds, and more.",
"I have been trying once again to get on my chart. I actually made it. And then it kicked me out? To go get a new activation code, I am using the code I was given and it will not accept it, terribly frustrating. I have step by step directions given to me by specialist and it does not work. And I only got the capcha pictures briefly once. As much as I tapped they would not show up. Why does this have to be so hard? And my time. Time consuming? All I want is to have my new. R.x. call",
Get server errors constantly when trying to access visit summaries. Want to be able to track vitals and weight fluctuations and wish that could be fixed. I do like getting lab reports in real time though.,
I love having access to my personal medical information without having to make an appointment. Also getting info and reminders. I like being able to leave messages and ask for refills on meds with mychart which is way easier than calling and being on hold.,
"Tried to make a payment and a notification came back as error so I tried again, same error notification. Got daily bank statement next morning both transaction went through. I will never use this ap to pay a bill every in my life. Wish I could give minus stars. This app is straight trash.",
Not a fan. Tasks assigned that I don't have the equipment for. Not easy to use for someone who is sick. Some cludgy interfaces. Not sure if it's the app or the myDhr bit set up by ACT health.,
"I love this app! I hate going to the doctor, or doing anything medical really. However, being able to make appointments and keep up with messages from my doctor all from the app makes it a little less of a chore. I love how it reminds you of vaccines and lets you log in with Biometrics...no password to remember!",
Very convient and accurate plus saves me time,
"Some updates are needed, you can't fix issues with the ""update your information"" area, even if no updates are needed you can't dismiss this notification or check that it is accurate. Also when looking at your appointment information the application doesn't give you the floor or suite number of your Doctor, some people are new patients and are not familiar with where to go once in the building. Giving that information WITH the appointment time, location and Doctor would be very helpful.",
"Fantastic App and User Friendly too. It's easy to navigate. Test results, X-rays or CT scans come back immediately. As well as, getting a response from a msg you sent to your PA or MD. It's nice that you can always be current on paying you medical bill or just making payments. You claims description is just a click away. There is so much more to explore.. So you see that's why its a 5 starratinf",
"Easy way to communicate with one's Doctors, View Bills, View Tests and keep up on new Health Trends ...",
"I love my chart. Great app, to schedule, cancel or even go over past appointments. Thank you",
"I find this app easy to use and a little frightening. Results are clear and accurate, that's why it can be frightening.",
"Once it finally is in working order on my phone, it's an excellent feature. The verification is alittle annoying to have to verify over and over.",
"My Chart is a very useful app with lots of great features. The only negative is way too many emails, sometimes several in one day, instead of one email covering all messages together.",
Mychart is a very useful and informative. Also very HIPPA safe,
Always was slow and had poor funcionality but as of a few days ago the messages and letters sections aren't working. I'm waiting on biopsy results and get blood test regularly that I need to check on and need to be able to access mychart. I can't remember my password to log in online and don't want to hassle with changing it. I'm uninstalling the app and trying again. If that doesn't work I'll have to change my password and find my username. Please fix.,
Best way to keep in contact with your primary care provider. Leave them a message and they will get back in contact with you. So it's no need to call the office when you have MyChart. Plus whatever tests or x-rays that you get you will see everything in MyChart. So basically you have your medical records at your fingertips.,
"The My Chart app is the best thing I have ever used. I can set up Drs appointments, see test results and send messages to my health care team, asking any questions I may have. All of my Drs, and any clinic or hospital that I visit, can access important information about my medications, emergency contact and allergy alerts. This app is truly a must have!",
I think this is great that I can access my information without going to the office!!,
"Ugh. For something so important, this app really sucks. Especially as a father of 3, it's ridiculously counter-intuitive to access their information. Worse yet, our doctor's office is entirely dependent on it, so when the app screws up, which happens often, it's our fault. Would leave zero stars if possible.",
"Easy to use, most of the information needed at your fingertips. Great for e- checkin.",
"The idea is good. But your information is not right (place,date, time or test).",
"Easy and convenient, especially for people who are always on the go and disabled.",
Love!! This app is the best. Mycharts app helps me keep track of all my appointments it is very convenient. I dont have to use my calendar but for other doctors appointments that don't go through Umass medical. I definitely need my calendar. I'd even get it for my kids but I rather only because I rather not use my email for their only because when they become adults they will want it. I had this app for at least a few years I only just put a review on it now I forgot to put one.,
"It's a ok app. Now where it has the option to talk to a doctor there is no doctor available ever, I had it open searching for 38hours and still no one to talk to and that was just me trying out the app. so yeah that's a major problem if you are not trying to have people going to the doctor for a small issue that can be taken care of by phone but also I do understand it's brand new and with what is going on it does have an effect. But overall it's better than nothing.",
"My chart is actually awesome, I love watching for my test results, and health info, and keeping track myself, I will say this, because of my chart I have caught a couple things, I pointed out to my doctor's, who all are very busy anymore it seems, and it's a good thing I did, IMO this is the number one app in existence, this makes it possible for us to have complete access, complete knowledge to our own healthcare, that knowledge is priceless",
"The app has gaps and flaws and there are NO links or phone numbers to IT or other tech help. Lab report lists properly, viewing it shows only a shell with headers and no result info. Messaging clinic staff is worthless, they see the report fully through the EMR. Told me to contact EPIC IT but there is NOTHING in the app to get help. She doesn't know your #. She's fine, you're fine, I'm screwed. Pretty crappy to deploy a healthcare portal then not provide support for patients using it.",
"Update: No, my email & phone number is correct in the account. I have proof on ny acct & my husband's mychart account we received the 2 step code text 4 - 6 hours later from when we requested the codes i have the text messages w/the proof for the developer. Since the new 2 step verification I can not log in highly upset. I'm still waiting on an email or text for the codes to come through to log in! This is ridiculous I can not even communicate w/my Dr. Like this. This needs to be fixed asap!",
Apparently the app does not recognize passwords with special characters. I keep getting a server not available message when I try to log in. Rather concerning that account login would have a bug. This error impacting access to Charlotte Eye Ear Nose & Throat Associates (CEENTA).,
"App is still not accessable due to a server error on the app everytime you try to sign in.The app hasn't been working consistently for a month now. I've already reached out for help multiple times with no response - apparently others have tried as well. This needs to be fixed, you are effecting people's health and access to medical care!",
"unable to remove providers I don't see anymore. Must be able to remove blacklisted providers. I'm getting reminders for upcoming procedures and blood draws that I never scheduled and will never complete. I REAALLLY don't need yet another nag from this app. Your app believes that if I had a test last year, I must need it again and a reminder msg, year after year until the sun explodes even though I no longer use the provider. the app is irritating but it's not like I got a choice.",
Love that all of my information is captured in one app and is readily accessible. My only complaint is that some lab tests do not format well for printing. Historical blood work is one example.,
"Never been able to schedule an appointment through the app. App conflicts itself with its messaging (verifications, usages, etc.). Pre-appointment screening rarely seems to work and has to be repeated.",
"Just got the app this morning, and have been unable to log in. Continues to say ""terms and conditions unable to load at this time. Please try again later."" Or ""problem reaching the server. Please try again later."" I have deleted and redownload, tried hours later and still isnt working. Super frustrated as I have a video appointment on friday morning I need this App for.",
"This is the first app of it's kind that has been even remotely useful for me. All the others that I've been promoted to access by one medical provider or another have been absolutely useless. But I'm actually able to access information, make contact, and keep track of things with MyChart.",
"I love using my chart! It's easy to get into. It's very convenient! This app is so helpful to see my appointments or tests that are due. Plus I love that I may request my medicine refills & gets sent right away to my pharmacy!! I also love that other Dr.s, nutritionist have access to my info!😇",
"This app makes it sooooooo easy to communicate with my doctor and staff! Simply check boxes to reorder prescriptions, I can see ALL my test results instantly, and get my questions answered quickly and accurately. VERY user friendly app. Great for those of us with numerous medical problems and need things simple and efficient!",
Very useful. Would give 5 stars if we could have it constantly sync appointments with our calendar instead of having to do every single one individually. Would make it a lot easier.,
"It's now more useful to have access to MyChart via this app. Test results are more viewable now, and the notifications are much more manageable. Still some shortcomings, but usability has improved, particularly with providers which have updated their versions of Epic.",
"does not update when visiting providers. I've gone to the hospital system and providers that use My Chart over and over again, but my information never gets updated. Not even my current PCP reflects accurately. I'm so sick of having to re- enter my current info with each visit only for it to apparently never be stored anywhere because the providers never have it right and it never reflects in the app. completely useless. I thought Epic and MyChart were supposed to be the best?",
"I'm in a weird place about this app. It is fantastic except for one massive, glaring flaw: There doesn't seem to be a way to update anything after you submit it. This is the most obvious with medical and family history. Once you fill out the form, you can't change the answers. I can't add half my family's medical history anymore because I failed to get it all down the first time. What if you forget something? What if something changes? These are questions the designers should have asked.",
I haven't used the app for a month or two and I went to open it tonight to try to make an appointment with my doctor and immediately get the app is not responding notification from Android. It doesn't even try to start running. It's current on updates.,
** Clunky - Disjointed - Confusing ** Those three words sum up everyone's experience trying to navigate through this app across different doctors. What could and should be so easy is difficult. I can appreciate the difficult task this app has given the volume of doctors but they're supposed to be making things easy and instead make it harder.,
I'm using a Samsung S10 5G and the app is constantly crashing when you sign on. I'm trying to set an appointment and it is now not allowing me to. When I get a message from my doctor I can read that but when I go into sign up for the appointment I cannot. Hopefully the issue gets fixed.,
"My Chart has been wonderful to use. My only critique would be this: When I try make a payment other than the minimum (such as a higher payment), I cannot. The only way a payment is accepted is to make the amount due. A small inconvenience, but worth noting. Thank you!",
"Great app but fails to function properly with fingerprint recognition. Asks to hold finger to sensor, appears to sense digit on the reader but only clears the reader screen without attempting to authenticate. Fingerprint settings correct and usable within Android but app is handing off appropriately? Samsung Note 5",
Love this app and love that you added COVID-19 status to the app but the only issue with it is that the app is only showing my first two shots. I got my I got my booster back in October and it doesn't show that information yet and there's no way to refresh that area to see if things updated.,
"Great app! Clearly shows where to go to ask my doctor for refills, to review past visits' notes and labs, and to email my doctor any questions I may have, as well as review any messages my doctor or her office may have for me. I've been very pleased with the ease of user intuitiveness for this app.",
"I have a valid login. I reload the app and it still tells me not valid. It won't let me change passwords, tells me invalid info. If I go in via the web there are no issues. I don't understand what's going on. Prior to this I had no issues with the app.",
"Love this app! I hate making phone calls so to be able to set up appointments, request refills, and see your test results right from your phone is amazing! Also it seems to make check in much faster and easier on everyone.",
"Love having all conveniently located, and able to check at any time my test results, Labs, etc. It's great for communication with doctors and usually faster. If there are any mistakes made, it's much easier getting them corrected. Thank you for having a great team of Family physicians in Outpatient Care!",
"My Healthcare provider, Kaiser Permanente, is one of the biggest ones in the Pacifc Northwest but it's not listed on your app. And when I search for it on the invisible search bar (blue cursor on a same color blue background) it's STILL not found --despite the SUPER HELPFUL suggestion to ""Try searching for it by name"".",
"Had to give this app 1 star in order to leave my feedback. I hate the app, updated history, have had blood work done, and had covid results but nothing ever shows up on my app!!! Uninstalled and reinstalled still nothing! Keeps track of when I open the app is all it is good for!!!!",
"I love this app, yes creating account is a little aggravating but I can see when medications are called in, I can see my upcoming appts test results Etc. Ive been reading comments and I don't have any problems at all. Love this app. All I can say to people is if u need help just call the appointment line and they will walk you through this. I did and even though little long had Absolutely NO PROBLEMS at all. I do my video appts on here and love it.. This was great during lockdown.",
"I like the app and have 3 providers linked but the pin and finger Auth only works once. If I set up pin and try to do the same for the other two, the next time I login it tells me there's a problem with the pin or fingerprint login and I have to login with my credentials again. Fix that.",
"I keep getting reminders for tests and shots I have had. Tried editing them, but haven't been successful. I don't use Anmed as a primary source of care, but do have it on the app for specialists. Shouldn't be so hard.",
"I like the app but lately nothing wants to load up. Every time I go to look at messages, it doesn't show up and stays as a write screen. Even when I updated the app, the messages still doesn't want to load.",
"The app never opens properly - it always says there is a problem, so I end up having to go online to the ahs website instead. When it has worked properly, it is quite useful and easy to navigate.",
"After the last update, Mychart crashes constantly. No matter what I do, there's an error code, system failure & the screen closes out. Totally useless & I'm betting if Google is in charge of this data now, our medical records are very compromised & not remotely secure. None of this is okay! People's medical records NEED TO BE TOP SECRET & NOT PRONE TO TECH GLITCHES & VULNERABILITIES!",
Maybe I'm not seeing it or its not working for me but there's no back or home button. Every time I look at a message I have to log out or close the app to get back to the main screen. Unless I'm not see it this has got to be the DUMBEST thing I've ever run into on any app.,
Great way to keep track of appointments as well as contact yout physician and request refills. Great to see lab results and keep track of health issues. Haven't tried the e-visit feature yet (not sure what the copay is on that) but I recommend this to everyone who has a physician who uses EPIC.,
"Not very user friendly ""unable to take screenshots due to privacy policy"" I thought it was MY chart not YOUR chart. Both of my arms are broken and when I need to pass information along it's screenshots. But guess that can't happen here. It also never saves my login when I ask it to do so Making me retype my info with both my arms broken.",
"Love this app, keeps all my doctors notes, upcoming appointments, medical payments that are due... tests/exams & medications all in one place! It also reminds me of what payments are due, with detailed billing so I know what I'm paying for. I'm able to print all documents needed for my records.",
I love this app it's better than communicating over the phone you can communicate with your doctors and they answer by the end of the day depending on what day it is the very next morning very easy to use and navigate you also can pay your copay make appointments schedule appointments whatever you need to do if you don't like talking on the phone as much.,
"Constant errors. Will wait and wait for a page to open then get a message that there's an error on the page. Can't open my test results, can't open my appointments. Completely unreliable system makes it impossible to use to communicate effectively with my health care team.",
Doesn't work. Can't access zoom meetings. Can't read test results. Can't update anything. I've tried to use this several times. It takes firebrick to load and then I get an error message that I should try back later. Again. Uninstalling,
"Won't find anything now. Had my info saved. I just had to put in my password. Now it won't find anything. I live in WA. I search WA and it can't find any results. There's no login screen. I don't know what the point of this update was, but it's a useless app now.",
"I love this app, however the last week, neither me or my wife have been able log into it. We keep getting a message that says ""terms and conditions can not be loaded at this time, please try again later"". We have both updated the app and reinstalled it and nothing has worked. We have a 1 week old and this is the quickest and easiest way to communicate with his dr but haven't been able to use it.",
"I love this app! I can see all my test results, upcoming appointments, test reminders and request my Rx refills in message instead of navigating the answering system on phone which usually results in my doc not getting the messages. I can even speak with my provider via messaging if I need to ask a question or update on new health info. Love it! Most awesome that it even can be linked w/other providers outside my main system and pharmacies too.",
"Richard J Brazeau Sr.... This app is fantastic. I can keep up with test results and appointments, and even do zoom if I can't make it in. Getting in touch with do to rs is as easy as sending a message, and I hear back within day. I don't know what I'd do without it.",
"I loved this app at first as I have 2 children that had/have multiple specialists. It was an easy way to keep track of appts and communicate with drs. However, the app keeps closing while I am actively using it. I looked to see if it needed an update, but it doesn't. Why is it bugging out all of a sudden?",
"Makes life easier to check appointments, early sign in, all records at my fingertips, easy to reschedule appointments or ask a question. Great service, reminders, adds to my calendar, confirms appointments, can't say enough good things about this service, thank you!",
"Whatever update that was made that caused the app to only work under wifi/internet usage sucks. It's great if you are on wifi but if you're not it doesn't load, you're lucky to even be able to sign in without wifi. If this were to be fixed I would give it 5 stars.",
This app keeps me informed very timely. It also saves time for me as well as the hospital team for communicating on land lines. It's efficient and effective in every way I've experienced it.,
"For the most part I love the app. I however have tried multiple times to figure out why I don't have an attachment button to send a document. When I have inquiried, I just get told the person on the phones app seems to be just fine.",
"The app is great, it keeps me in the loop with everything going on from PCP, MET DR, Therapist, to all test results and medications... Appointments and after visit summaries are all easy to access. This app makes everything much easier to stay on top of when it comes to my overall health and well being. Everyone should use it",
"Freezes on open screen. Does not open. What was once a fantastic app has been rendered useless. I have a silly amount of appointments and rely on this app on the go. Get this fixed, please.",
Allows get locked out!! Never accepts my user name or password!! Then disables my account after a couple tries. So frustrating and it sucks. Just not going to use the app if I have trouble getting in every time I use it!!,
The Android version lacks print and share functions. CvS sent my Covid test results to MyChart. There was no print to pdf or sharing functionality. It's only accessible if you have an internet connection...and that cannot be guaranteed. Problems at airports!!,
"Stop working. This app was working great then all of a sudden it stop. I uninstall then reinstall and still not working. The message I got was: Services Unavailable: HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable. Server Error 404-File or directory not found. The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.",
"Great, until it sucks. Communication and primary functions are excellent, but visit and lab summary information is a PDF. Guess what format you cannot view *** fixed! Gained a star, then lost a half star due to folding some financial functions.",
"Very helpful for keeping up with appointments and health records. Convenient for appointment reminders, check-ins, and everything health related. Easy to navigate. I really like it.",
"Very informative to have access to all of my medical records, test results and doctor/hospital reports. The app is extremely easy to use and very helpful that you can do a web search of any conditions or medical terminology of results that you don't understand by pressing down on the words then a choice will come up for dictionary or web search.",
"After the 2021 update, it seems to work flawlessly across several medical systems in Indiana. The personell keep the info updated, I no longer loose all those ""visit summaries"" and reports. Keeps accurate records of vaccinations, available to the doctor. Allows easy prelim. check in & insurance updates. It's great!",
"This is just an aweful app. I try to login, username/password incorrect. I press forgot username/password. They say that an email was sent to me. I got nothing. I call bellin. They reset my account. Try to go into the account again. SAME THING. So I'm just gonna call every time. Way faster and less headache to deal with. Fix this app.",
"I have been using My Chart for several years and I find it to be the best tool for managing my health care. I use it to communicate with all my doctors, keep track of my appointments, and medications. It gives me instant access to my medical history. It's great to be able to do it all from one place and at anytime thank you for a great app.",
It's fairly easy to navigate. A few too many menu options; could use simplification. Documents are tricky to locate. I wish it accepted larger photo files for avatar uploads.,
"I really like this app. Interface is as complicated as it needs to be - but no more than that. It is really great to have all your health info available on your phone. Greatly facilitates communication with my primary care doc. Overall, I would highly recommend this app.",
"Bill pay link always missing. Everytime I go to the app (Android phone) to pay, the link to pay is never available. This also happens sometimes on my computer. This has been a constant issue. Ultimately I always have to call to pay my bill. :-(",
"I find my chart excellent to use and I'm 60 yrs old and have been using it for about 3 yrs now, it takes time and I still don't know everything thing. What u could do is allow messages to permanently be deleted out of my chart because it does the app itself takes up a lot of space of your phone",
Updated the app and now it's permanently stuck at selecting where I get my care..... Which it won't pull anything for me to choose and also won't let me go anywhere to log in or access my account. From useful to dumpster fire in one update. And no... I'm not about to play email yeah with developers. I work all day and it's not my job to maintain or fix your product.... That is your job,
"Frustrating. Not intuitive. Ask Amazon or Ebay for suggestions. Try finding information and you'll see. You need a person to guide to to sites, and heaven forbid you forget. It's labyrinthian, and just as one gets accommodated, the designers change it. At least we can print out pages now.",
This is an easy to use app... Makes it easy to check in when your going to appointments because it skips all the long wait process to check in at the providers office... Needless to say I'll keep using it until it's no longer needed.,
"Been using this for years now. The app needs some cleaning up, streamlining and organizational care, which is affecting its continuity. I get the direction their aiming for, and I'm guessing that COVID overwhelmed their programmers, not giving them enough perspective on how to implement continuity at such as fast pace. Using social security numbers could quickly streamline and prevent repetitive accounts when a more sickly individual is dealing with lots of doctors and hospitals.",
"Unfortunately, it just loads the organization's screen with a locked banner that does not move when you scroll or have any information to help you. And when I chose my hospital within the system it just took me to the site where they said they had moved to a different site. I wanted not to use the web for my med record but it seems I will have no choice. It was the only way to use MyChart.",
"I really love that I have the ability to get my health information and a couple clicks. This is handy In so many ways it keeps track of everything gives you appointment reminders, check any test results for more detailed information, health history, upcoming,, test and lab reminders, etc. Thank you for letting Patients have a little power over their health care.😁❤",
I've had no issues working in the app. You don't get a lot of instruction so you fumble around a bit. The biometrics disappeared recently which I miss. Hope that option comes back,
"MyChart is super easy to use to get lab results, check appointments, see letters from docs, schedule appts, and read follow-up info. I've used it to pull reports for my VA appts and to connect my docs outside of Atlantic Health. I'm not tech savvy and i think it is useful and easy.",
Fantastic! I changed my review of my chart from 3 stars to 5. I contacted their support and they responded immediately and showed me how to switch between two providers. Very easy. Love this app. I would recommend this to anyone.,
"I have been using the MyChart app since it first came out, I loved it, everything I needed about my medicine and my medical history and vaccinations, etc, etc, was right at my fingertips, but there's an old saying,"" if it ain't broke, don't fix it""! As far as I'm concerned it wasn't broke, new system is not old guy friendly. Prefer the system the way it was before it was updated this last time, just my opinion.",
"I love this app so much. It is extremely helpful, especially since I have a variety of health issues, its easy to keep up with my appointments, doctors reviews, labs and medications. Strongly suggest to anyone!",
"By far the best app to help me manage my and my children's medical anything. I can also connect to different organizations if they use the MyChart system which has been extremely helpful. My only suggestion would be a way to positively acknowledge a response to a patient message. When a nurse, doctor, or other medical individual responds when I message it would be nice to be able to send a react or thanks without sending another message.",
I love this app. I communicate with my doctors and their associates. It helps me by having my appointments all listed out so I dont have scheduling mix-ups. I can see all my test results so I can stay current with my care. All around the best thing.,
"I never get a notification of billing, I'm supposed to be paper free but I have to keep checking back for a bill",
Great app much easier to see results for any testing. Quicker way to communicate with Healthcare team. Make appointments get reminders. Also almost all hospitals can access your information.,
"✓App Approved - very easy to use & understand...Has multiple menu options, continues to get better & better with updates! Very Smart & Well-Thought-Out! Simple to keep updated with current records, as well as your health history...Compatible to use as a One-Stop app for all your health care info, including your patient records from multiple doctors/ offices. You are able to do Virtual Appointment Visits with your providers, message & ask questions, billing & payments, add family members, & share",
"Very convenient to use which I like, however it syncs only one of my providers and I use 2 different ones. Its extremely frustrating having to use my other providers patient portal instead of just one app. Would give 5 stars if all worked well",
It's OK. Some appointments are delayed in getting updated times. Had a few with location being incorrect and told by staff to ignore app location and go by the printout. Check in feature has never worked.,
It's a little odd on trying to get a new doctor on my messaging list. So like for refills I had to message a previous doctor because my current one is not there. Outside of that after getting payment updated somehow so I can pay for my prescriptions through the app everything is going so far so well good. Referral scheduled appointments aren't on it so it's mainly prescriptions and general practitioners so far.,
Amazing this app is wonderful. It's so nice just looking at the app and seeing when my husband's appointments are. We both love it. It has saved us our sanity. No more writing his appointments down and trying to remember them. This app is amazing. I recommend it too everyone. It's more then worth it. 5 stars 🌟,
Lately the app will not allow me to view messages or test results. Says an errer has occurred in the server. Edit: An upload was available yesterday. Ever since that update it has been working effectively so far.,
"This is a great app as I'm figuring it out, it is user friendly as I am not technology friendly, it's a easy way to keep up with up coming procedures and appointments without having to wait on hold use automated system. I'm very pleased with my chart app.",
"Continually Crashes. Says ""An Error has occurred on the Server. Try again later.""(?!) Did I say ""continually?"" Perhaps I meant ""Repeatedly,"" or ""Repeatedly repeatedly,"" as It Does This...time!...after time!...after time!---NEVER letting me GET TO, or DO Whatever It Was that I Opened this APP For...in the frigging first place! So, it's Very Frustrating TO USE, though it does provide Very Useful Information, of course.",
Sometimes I can use it and sometimes I can't. I have a phone not a computer so its had to make copies.,
"I was waiting for a text of the passcode and never saw it. I requested a second one.. Then I checked my EMAIL. I am not sure people realize it will be emailed to them, or text to their phone number. But this screening process is also occurring long after the person has accessed their records in MyChart. So it's a little confusing.",
I really like this MyChart app. I love being able to look at my test results. I like being able to send questions or share the things I have done with my doctor like getting vaccines. I feel like it gives me an open line of communication with my doctors that I did not have without MyChart. Great App!! Works very well! Sharon K,
"## UPDATE 5/3/22 ## Issue still not fixed. I've tried contacting all contact options. If I didn't have 12 Drs at Gould and another 6 at UCSF, I'd uninstall! *I thought I had figured out why Gould and UCSF hadn't been syncing, another curve ball hits. Forget contacting tech support! They think everyone is stupid. Has worked great for years. At least I still communicate with my Doctors.*",
"I would like it if other portals could be used through this app as well. Instead of having multiple ones and not uploading information to mychart. Patient portal needs to be integrated into the mychart or everyone ""institutions/companies"" need only to stick with ONE app.",
"Looks great. Very resourceful. Only thing i have yet to find is a way to have all my family's records and details (wife, son, daughter) in one place. I see myself having to log in/log off just to see everyone's appointments, medications, ect. which isn't a deal breaker, I just find it ""slightly"" inconvenient. (But it may be for a reason i don't yet know)",
"Rating one star because everyone and their mother every single time I go to Cleveland clinic hound and pressure me to get the app, and I literally don't care. The app is whatever, nothing special. Literally the one thing I went to do in the app said the link was **broken**. Funny cause I was trying to stop yall from sending me double notifications. Stop sending me notifications by email to tell me that I got a notification in the app. One notification is plenty. So irrelevant, wasting my time!!",
"What's going on with the app? Signed on yesterday and looks like an update took place. I've only been able to login once in the last 2 days. Keeps saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again later"". I'm logging into my mom's account (I'm her HCPOA) because she is in the hospital. I feel lost without the app. I even tried logging into MY MyChart, and I get the same response. There are no updates that I need to do. Please fix this.",
"Great ap but it desperately needs a search function. 031023 thanks for your response, indeed I found the search function in the menu section, albeit, it is not able search for test results, example I would like to know what was the results of one specific item in a lipid panel test.",
"Better than a poke in the eye with a stick! It took me a little time to remember to login to check for info from my doctors, but they do a really great job of keeping this site up-to-date with all my stuff. Now it's my preferred method for communicating with my doctors. Update, June 2022: I used the app to send a msg to my dr's office for assistance getting a new disability placard from the state. In less than a day I got a reply saying the form has been faxed to the state for me. Booyah!",
So much easier to communicate every doctor should have this I love it,
They've had four months since the start of lockdown to improve the video conferencing feature and it's still barely usable most of the time. The rest of the app is passable for what it is.,
"Not old people/senior friendly. Navigation is horrible. When trying to communicate with a certain person, the entire medical staff can read your message, so it's no longer private.",
"SO MANY ""INNOVATIONS"" are anything BUT! This however gives you REAL-TIME feedback and allows you to streamline the processes of registration, prescription refills and sharing your data from one provider to another.",
"When signing in. It would remove the username once typing in the password and vice-versa. Once able to put both credentials in, I would get the error ""no internet connection found"" Phone is up to date/tried on wifi and cellular, same error. Unable to use/just stick to the website.",
"The app is very frustrating. ""Server errors"" generally prevent accessing messages, questionnaires, and test results. The sad thing is that if it worked properly, it would be very useful.",
"Every telemed visit, MyChart looks different than the last. There's no tutorial about how to use it after updates. I send messages to doctors for my daughter and they say they aren't getting them. I have tried using it for appointments with 0 success. MyChart is useless to my family and trying to make appointments the doctors say we can make, hasn't worked once. We are still waiting after more than 2 years to schedule and complete a genetic test, for example.",
"My Chart makes communication with my Doctor, and with her staff so easy! I can make appointments, ask questions, renew prescriptions, and see all test results in advance so that I can discuss them with my Doctor. I can also check in for appointments and fill out the questionnaires in advance, and even pay my co-pays on My Chart! I think it's one of the best apps I've ever used!",
"Everyone is very friendly and helpful; from check-in in the room you're placed in, doctor's and staff. Check-out is easy and friendly. They try to answer all your questions. I just wish they could help with making referral appointments. I had to call the office due to the distance from when the doctor ordered a procedure to the earliest I could get it scheduled, not until February. The doctor was able to get it ordered for a week after the appointment I had with him. This happened twice.",
"Can't get into my acct. ever,tired of messing with it. Mychart sucks",
"Not very responsive. Doesn't save info that is put in. I have medications listed that I haven't taken in over ten years. No matter how many times I remove them, they're always put back on by the next time I log in. Requested a refill for one to see if it went through and it did, no questions asked.",
Love everything about this app. Its so easy to use. I can access all my medical records with just a few clicks.,
Updates in MyChart make it easier to follow up with my providers and pharmacy. Epic is continuing to help me navigate my health care.,
This makes communication with my health care professionals so simple.,
"I depend on the ""My Chart"" as an essential Healthcare tool. I use My Chart help me keep track of appointments and test results which are posted the same day, as my appointments are scheduled. The easy accessibility to all my medical records and ability to send/recieve emails to my Physicians offices is comforting to me when I have questions or concerns. The Non-urgent emails are answered in 48 hours. My Chart is one of the reasons why I transfered to Great Plains.",
"Epic engineers, your form code sucks. It's beyond frustrating and infuriating when it loses data. I spent 30 minutes filling out medical problems form (with all the dates and comments it asks) for my mom as a patient, only to click ""next"" and lose everything. Session timeout? Next I go through this hellish form again and then my WiFi gets a hiccup - again, complete amnesia on the app behalf. Not even the slightest attempt to save the data and retry. Treat user input and time better!",
"I love this app it allows me to see my.medical records, test results, upcoming appointments. I can also check in online so I don't have to do in the office. Make visit much faster. Can also make payments and keep track of expenses. I can't say enough good things about this app. I would recommend this app to all medical patients.",
"I have the worst time to get into this app. I don't know who maintains it on the hospital's end, but I wish they'd work out whatever bugs they have going on. I wish I could give it only a 1/2 star as it doesn't deserve a full star. I can't review anything in my chart. It's very aggravating & annoying to put in all of my information each time, & it tells me my info is wrong. THEY'RE WRONG!!",
Awesome! All the info I need at my fingertips. Just wish all my doctor's used it. I get test results before my doctor's do.,
"Does what you need it to but sometimes it needs refreshing because I will notice after a few months I stop getting notifications so I have to Uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again. And I think it should show the mri images with results or xray pics , etc but it just has results.",
I like this app. Keeps well informed with your doctors app. Lists your meds doses you need to do nothing but log in. This app is all about keeping you up to date with all your health needs of even illnesses. You can msg your doctors off scedule and or cancel. This lets you see test results as soon as they are done. Thiis app is a must almost necessary for anyone dealing with healthcare. Very easy to use. The menu is a geat feature it is complete. The detail that went into this app second to none,
"Needs improvement for scheduling!!! What's the point of selecting ""office visit"" if you're forcing the appointment to be virtual? You can't get a physical done virtually. Remove ""annual physical"" from the description because its deceiving. No one answers the phone so this is my only way to schedule an appointment but I dont want virtual appointments. If the ""office visit"" tab is supposed to be virtual then you better state that its virtual only!!!!",
"It's super easy to pull up my medical information no matter where I'm located. MyChart allows me ease of use... never having to personally recall every medication I take and the dosage, I just open the app. Appointments, setting up payment plans, refill requests, communication with my various providers (and the staff responses) ...it's an amazingly awesome tool ! What there NOT to love about MyChart ? Nothing...lol !",
This is the best tool in managing my health and since I have several issues if I have a question usually I can find the answer in doctors notes after my visit and I love the option to give my family access to answer any questions they might have. But for me I guess the best thing is being able to communicate with a doctor or their nurse or pharmacy and schedule my appointment with text message every one of these departments have been so good about getting back to me same day. Love this app.,
Message option hardly ever works,
"It includes so many useful things...except they don't include any clinics I go to for linking availability and their sites for tracking medical and appointments are also not linkable to MyChart. Prescriptions can't even be manually added or tracked even with adding local pharmacy. I can't add any clinics manually either or other med. info manually. All this makes this, unfortunately, still a good chunk not useful to me. Just not the best experience for me but I'm sure it is for others.",
Great ap with access to all med records. I love it,
Not bad although I can't seem to send messages anymore on one side of the my chart. (I have two),
"I think the app is a great tool to have for those who want to be ""super involved"" in their healthcare. You can do damn near everything possible to keep tabs on your health and future care plans. The only thing i personally would like to see, would be more medical establishments linked to the app. If one of your team members is not affiliated, then you have to have their app on your platform as well.",
"I'm not a big Apps kinda guy but this is simple, organized and helps keep you aware of your health.",
I like that I can schedule an appointment to see my PCP or message them. Also like seeing my test results quickly. I also like that they have all my medical conditions and all the medications I'm taking listed. I don't like that they have the onset date medical condition when the app started and not the actual onset date. They could go back and also include test results from years back so they can all be there for reference in case they're ever needed in an emergency.,
"I like that I can see results before my doctor, I don't have to sit around waiting for a call with results, and I can update my status anytime any wair. As for ads shown ? Haven't seen any 😁 great app, I definitely recommend it.",
"MyChart has been a God send for me to manage my healthcare. Having cancer I have numerous appointments that would be hard to keep up with without this app. Also, having a constant connection to my care team via the message function brings me peace of mind and I have used it several times to communicate questions. I love this app.",
"Since I've begun using MyChart, everything has become easier. I used to have a really hard time remembering appointments. Problem solved with MyChart's appointment calendar. There's a way to view all my information from each clinic separately or all in one place. I can easily access all test information or request prescription refills without the hassle of calling and waiting on hold. If only I cld member to request it 48 hrs before I run out. MyChart probably has prescription reminders too Idk",
"In general, I like MyChart. I have the results of tests, blood work, etc. very quickly. I can look back at older results to see any changes, etc. I have had a few little issues, but nothing major.",
"I use this app all the time to communicate with my doctors and their staff. I can request them to schedule me an appointment if I am unable to call, send basic questions to the team through the messages portion, review any and all of my test results just by clicking the title, I can quickly and easily see when my next upcoming appointments are going to be, I can answer health history questions ahead of my appt to save time while in the office. I am able to request refills as needed too.",
"Love this app! It's very user-friendly and I love being able to see all past tests and nots, and I also love being able to message back and forth with the office and my drs! It's also great that MyChart is available for many different medical organizations. Thank you MyChart! You are a lifesaver!",
I am happy to be able to see my test results ASAP. It matters and may end up saving my life a couple of weeks from now. Medication changes are always scary.,
"Its great to have this app! I use this app a lot as I can quickly find my medication list, if I'm overdue for something like a flu shot, etc. I used this app to schedule my 3 Covid vaccine injections. I dan schedule doctors appointments. I'm also able to connect other institutions like UConn so I call see most of my medical history. This app saves me quite a bit of time.",
I love how interactive this app allows me to be with my Healthcare,
"Very easy and convenient to schedule medical appointments, review test results, and even attend virtual visits. I can do everything in one app, and I've had better access to care and better quality of care since my local health system adopted EPIC and MyChart. I wish they had offered electronic records and telehealth years ago.",
"The app keeps me instantly informed and updated and is easy to use, even for an old dog like me.",
"I love MyChart.. it's the best chart system. It's easy to follow and they responded quickly. I'm normally not the one to be equipped with this type of system, but MyChart is a perfect fit for me. I will definitely recommend anyone to download and get the charting 🤗",
"This app is fantastic..... it's incredibly easy to connect with my various providers & I get a response so much faster than calling & leaving a message, also I can see results from all the different tests & at least have an idea before follow is with the Docs.",
"App won't allow login to Sutter Health system. Error message says ""Update Required This version is no longer supported by My Health Online. Please update the app."" The installed app version number matches latest on Google Play (10.1.5) and reinstalling application had no effect. I'm still receiving notifications from clinic but can't login to see the full details via this app. I hope this issue is addressed soon as I enjoy the convenience of this application.",
I have been using this app for years and the last few days it has been crashing everytime I have tried to open anything other then messages. This is the only option I have to access my medical records since I no longer live near the area where my appointments were. It is very frustrating. A month ago I would have given it 5 stars.,
"I hate using this app. It is clumbsy, not intuitive, and poorly organized. The big thing on people's minds now is covid. Symptoms, protection, and covid vaccinations should be on first page after sign-in, with clear instructions on how, where, etc to get covid vaccinations. Currently, it's like ""Where's Waldo"" in finding covid vaccination info, and you have to scroll to the bottom. Stop with all the marketing that takes up a lot of space. We are on the app, don't waste our time.",
Love the app don't have to remember appts and can see most of the results almost in real time great app,
I enjoy having my medical history or leaving notes for the Dr at a moments notice and the response back is usually pretty quick,
"Love the easy access to my medical information. Wish there was a way to correct family history, as it was initiallt incorrectly entered at the physicians office.",
This is a very well used app. Ive had good experiences with it. My problem is the user....lol Getting older actually is much easier to keep all medical ends tied together. Its been great and if ever a nitch its just a phone call to the techs! There great!!,
Have not been able to access MY UCSF info because there support team cannot hear when I speak via my mobile phone. Took my mobile in and it's working fine. No one seems to want to help and are giving me the runaround rather than assist me Update...I am getting assistance after my review. I having connection issues with the organization so I can reset my password. I've been contacted by the organization via email. I appreciate bthe app people reading out to the organization,
I really like being able to see firsthand my summary from my visits and I also get to see test results or any graphs that they have have shown me at my appointment.,
"It's easy to access for making appointments and checking test results, asking questions to see if you need to see the doctor.",
So much better than text messages or emails from the doctor! Very easy to download register and off you go 😬,
"I like the design, layout, and overall idea of the app, but it has some lacking functionality. I see my billing, but not able to pay. I can input the information, but no way of submitting.",
"Difficult for a senior to set up. It asks for a code and I've never seen any code. After getting set up, it is great at providing up to date reminders and information.",
"I have been using MyChart for nearly 7 years and have been thoroughly satisfied with all of its aspects. It is an excellent communication tool to ask follow up questions of your provider, to obtain lab results in a timely manner and to review appointment follow up notes. Navigating MyChart is very easy and user friendly!",
THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE FOR MY HEALTHCARE. MY HEALTH IS WORTH THE 30 TO 45 MINUTE DRIVE... ONE WAY! ALL THE DOCTORS IN MY AREA ARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY!!!!! THANK YOU UTSW.,
I enjoy using mychart because I can see all my Dr's. & what they said to me after the appointment . Plus I can video chat with them all on mychart. Love it!!,
Aside from the horrible mychart support reps hanging up on me mid call twice (as in hearing the phone being set down and disconnected) the app is great. They should probably just fire them and give the job to IT since the error resolved eventually and I did it manually.,
"Can't get rid of the notice, otherwise, it's very effective for communication.",
Once I got MyChart up and running it has been very easy to use.!!,
I've used this app for awhile but suddenly it crashes and I'm unable to use it for any of my medical needs. For something that is supposed to fill all needs prior to or soon after seeing a doctor this app should be monitored to avoid the glitches that are going on. If I could I would rate it zero stars. Fix your app and I'll raise my rating.,
"I love this app...when it works! For the past 2 days, this app has shut down and taken me back to the app to sign in again. I have checked for updates, uninstalled/reinstalled, and it will srill not work. I have truly enjoyed this app and pray the issue will be resolved quickly. Thank you!",
I really like MyChart. It keeps all my appointments and medications refills in order.,
Excellent and perfect details,
Confusing and hard to understand. I forgot my password and username. Too difficult to use this app. Had to uninstall.,
"The sign in is a big hassle. Not only do I have to remember my password but now you want a code which I have to leave MyChart app to go to the text app. I have lost connection with MyChart (possibly a goof on my part) but it's a pain in the part. I have checked the opt out option but I am still required to enter a code. Otherwise, I love this app",
Overall I think this is one of the better health record management applications out there on the marketplace. The convenience of being able to produce a covid-19 vaccine QR code accessible by biometric authentication is a huge plus. The only area of improvement I can think of is the user interface could probably use a bit more of a modern visual update.,
I enjoy this app because I like it when I can see my results early.,
Hard to keep track als9 wont delete old messages,
"I absolutely love using this app. It is easy to navigate, I can add other health care providers from other facilities, pharmacies, and more to it so that I can have more of my records in one place for better access to all my records to make sure I have the best care available!",
My Chart is a Wonderful tool to use to keep up with my appointments and to keep in touch with my doctors. I'm glad I am able to see my results of any labs that were done. This app is a Great tool.,
"Too much on options and redundant features. It has a problematic interface that creates loops. Always login issues and password changes as well. You ask for specific issues that you have received via feedback via your and you apparently don't review your own crash reports. Stop asking us to do stuff for you, I don't work for you and I am forced to use this app. Stop blaming everyone and everything else and actually make MyChart about the customers experience.",
"I love being able to get paperwork done before I arrive, days before. I can email my health team so easily. I have all my conditions, medications and profile info easily accessable and available for me to give input or edit directly. I get my test results as soon as they become available, and often feedback from the doctor via messages before I even get to an appointment. This is a relief esp for scary tests. I can do video visits right from the app. I can get on waitlists for any appointment.",
"I love being able to keep in contact with my doctor's through St Elizabeth plus other places. You can check the graphs for weight, BP, blood work, and more through the app. Write your doctor get reminders. The app works great! Anyone wanting a great doctor Dr Michael Dragan in Northern KY! The video visit works great especially during covid and don't need a computer just a phone.",
"KU MEDICAL CENTER MyChart App is absolutely amazing. It gives you access to everything in your medical records. In the palm of your hands. From tests results, blood work & clinical notes. You can make appointments or cancel appointments with your providers. You can also contact your various medical providers directly with the text feature in the MyChart App.",
"This is a really Great, as far as I can tell. I'm 58yo and I'm not as tech savvy as most of the younger generation. In my limited use of this app, I did discover 1 Semi Important Flaw. I've received documentation from my Dr's. that I needed to print or Email. Need to print hard copy for my HR dept.. I also would like to print out a hard copy for my folder at home. If that can be corrected, it would be Great.",
The at really does come in handy when needing to speak to your provider. My only issue is that it does not service all the providers you may have. I may have had vaccinations other places but I'm not able to place that in my chart. And when going to providers they do not enter my information where I can see it in my chart for vaccines.🙃,
"PT/OT/ST following stroke ...really nice people, experienced, capable, effective...I'm about to go back for more help, and I'm delighted! Kelly, Marrissa, others I only worked with briefly. Clean, convenient, well equiped, organized, efficient.",
"Very convenient way to keep track of medications and appointments. Easy to make appointments, make payments, request refills, and communicate with providers. I feel like this app helps me stay on top of things regarding my healthcare.",
"The app logs me out every single time. My doctor, staff, patients such as myself all have the same issue even if it's a cancer center or other medical centers. The entire clinic doesn't understand why this issue has not been fixed. This issue occurs across most Android/Apple/Microsoft phones/tablets/Laptops/Desktops. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED NOT ONLY FOR CANCER PATIENTS BUT FOR EVERYONE.",
"Out of our 12 devices at home only one can be used. Evidently the other devices have too Old of an Android operating system! We have contacted the administrator of the app but to no avail, there has been no satisfaction! I do not feel that we should buy a new phone just to be able to use my chart! Epic Systems Corporation responded on 3/31/2021 and said that our Note 4 with Android 6 will work but it does not work on the app, but it does work if I go into the internet on the Note 4.",
"No matter which hospital chart I request, I get all of my Beaumont past and future physical therapy appts. This is ridiculous. Hate it!.",
"this is 20th century technology in the third decade of the 21st Century. However I have no choice but to use it because of the medical system that I am in. There is no simple way to correct errors. Every time I get a new prescription, the software shows I just began that particular medication, even though I may have been taking it for 20 years In my opinion, MyChart is a rip off of my medical system and any other medical system or medical vendor that is conned into buying it.",
"COVID vaccine overdue? Are you kinding me? How presumptuous! Additionally, app randomly asks to verify contact information, yet nothing suggesting an annual physical. Hummm. I really do not want to think this way, but it seems there is an agenda driving things here. At least the app works, even after updates. More than I can say for many others.",
"Well, I have kids and I can't access multiple charts using my phone and email address. I should be able to look at my children's charts, they obviously don't have a phone or email. Fix this. Otherwise very good app and user friendly.",
Tried to sign up for it and constantly said my personal information entered was incorrect. I double checked the information three times before trying again and it still said my information was wrong (it didn't even tell me what part of the information was wrong). Then it deactivated my code so now I have to call and ask for a new code. Very frustrating.,
"So appreciate being able to get test results, after visit summaries, and notes! Everything in one place and easily accessible. Very much like being able to make appts and send messages to my providers! A great tool for me!!",
"Everything is right in your hand, from appointments to medications. It is so easy to use. Great app.",
"I used this app a couple times. Until recently it worked fine, but now it's not connecting to my microphone, and I ensured that the permissions are set correctly as well as rebooting my samsung galaxy s20.",
"I really enjoy using my chart. It's great seeing the test results and reports as they come into mychart. Honestly there is a lot I don't understand in these results so seeing them before my next office visit gives me a chance to look up unknowns. This helps me prepare for the visit making it more efficient and effective. Furthermore, I have doctors in other organizations and even out of state. No longer do I need to send them my records because they can download them from mychart.",
"Fairly easy to use, but it can use better instruction on how to get back to main screen.",
"This is such an awesome app! (One of the best yet!) Such a nice feature to be able to send the provider a message, request or question and get such a quick response back 😊 Communication is so clear & efficient! ( stored for reference) Also, so nice to see immediate test results versus waiting to hear back from the clinic by phone or waiting for another appointment.",
"Great app allowing to go paperless! Not only does it allow the storage of medical information related to a patient but also the communication with all the KC Hospital Departments. Unfortunately, It seems the Covid-19 Updating Team does not have access to the comments users send them. I have asked them for a while to update my Covid status, but either they have never seen or they ignore the message. Suggestion : MyChart should allow its users to send Covid-19 Team messages and files directly.",
great app it's nice to be able to look at your test results and now with the lovely medical book at tells you all about what the test results were for what they're done cuz we all know when we sit in front of our doctors we forget to ask where we feel stupid for asking or they give us an answer that makes no sense to us at all and so it's nice to be able to see ourselves and I've had my doctor's forget or not noticed something that I did this has happened more times then it should. A must!!!,
Being able to check in from the app is great!,
"Information goes missing or is charged without doctor or patient approval. Does not keep current with your doctor list; the pcp I have listed has not been my paper for about a year and I am missing doctors as well. The new format makes it much less user friendly via phone usage. Difficult to maneuver around and find things. Has broken links , freezes, tells me a Dr in San Diego that was never a part of VMC phoned me the other day(lol). Basically, it looks to be made by and for 1st graders.",
"I really like 👍 this app. You are able to access test results without having to wait days for someone to call you with results, make non urgent Dr. appointments, send messages to your doctor and get information on upcoming appointments and tests that you need to have done. It's convenient and easy to use. The clinic response time is usually very quick too.",
"I would give 5* but the one thing that needs to be addressed is not being able to swipe back in this app, I have to log out and login again to get from one section to the other there needs to be a back arrow incorporated in every section or put the dashboard on top to have access to the other sections, other than that I like the app. Update 1-20-2023 this app needs more work I still can't switch back without logging out please fix this problem!!!",
"I like being able to schedule appointments and view results, but I can't give this 5 stars simply because of excessive notifications. I made an appointment today (1/15) for Wednesday (1/19) I have recieved two notifications today AND two phone calls reminding me if the appt I made today. There needs to be an user setting in the app to manage notifications",
This is an amazing app. When I went to the hospital It gave me my blood work results and all my test results and all the doctors notes and with this app it gives you every single aspect of the doctors or hospitals visit as well as wherever you get your prescriptions it has all that health information for you on this app. Also all of your upcoming appointments will be on this app as well . I love this app!!! Very interactive .,
Servers for app are down more than they work. Very frustrating when trying to get information and the app rarely works. Definitely needs better servers or a revamp of the whole system.,
"Life without MyChart would not be nearly as easy. I coordinate all my doctor's appointments, refill prescriptions, correspond with my physician's, check labs and x-ray results, check history and see what's scheduled or needs to be scheduled in the future. I truly wish all my business was as easy to coordinate. I highly recommend.",
This App is absolutely fantastic. I love having my daughter's medical records available to me without having to ho through the trouble of calling anyone for help. I love being able to message her Dr.s and being able to schedule her appointments as well. No more waiting on the phone for someone to answer even though the phone etiquette at TCH is amazing too!,
"Notification: overdue bill! Okay, login, choose which family member (just have to guess, because no info), and then NOTHING! WTH? I don't see any new notifications or messages or bills. This app is worse than useless, it's infuriating.",
Best app around for health needs. Works across various medical facilities and pharmaceutical companies.,
Nice to check on appointments and tests results. Easy way to pay bill!,
"I love my chart; it would have gotten 5 stars, however, it's reminders are not always accurate and I find this annoying. Love the fact you can add appointments straight to your phone's calendar, makes it very convenient for large family.",
I love this app. It helps me getting ahold of doctors so much faster and easier. I love that I can look at all test results and ask questions at anytime. The best thing is that I can talk to my children's doctors anytime I need them without the wait of the phone call and it makes it easier to get a hold of more then one doctor if need be. 1000% recommend this app 👌 👏,
I don't understand how the medical field could so called UPGRADE and not have checked out all these issues first. This is a disaster. I am locked out and can't get into until you unlock me. 1. The secret code was numbers and letter (didn't work). Need numbers only. 2. If I go to e-mail for secret code it closes the login so I have to start over. By then the secret code has expired. 3. After numerous attempts it locks you out. Can't get in until you unlock me. I HATE IT !!,
"I absolutely love this app. It is so easy to use for not only appts, but for speaking to your Dr, medication requests, tests results, any messages from the Dr. etc. Its literally easier to use rather than calling and being put on hold waiting. They usually get in touch with you alot faster than a phone call. I've used some other apps in the past but this one is genuinely 10 stars rather than 5. The best part of this app for me is because I have to see 4 other dr's they all use this one app.",
"Very convenient and easy to access. I check the dates and times of my appointments. This is the best feature. No appointment cards needed. I missed the test results not being there during the computer changes this fall. Just shows how much I refer to it. I have a large number of pages to fill out for the drug company that makes the MS drug I tried. Wish they would have asked for this information when I first reported the problems I was having several years ago. The test results and doctor appointment dates on MyChart should help me fill out these papers. My thanks to the developers of this site, and to everyone who makes it work so seamlessly, or so it seems to this user.",
I can't never just go to it I always got to put in my name and passcodes and it just sucks for me,
"This app has come along way since we first started using it. I like that I can look up my own health records, keep an eye on my meds and have appts right there at my finger tips. My husband and I share our accts so it's convenient for us to help each other remember things. It's very easy to send messages and such to your Dr and staff.",
"Great app to keep up with health data, talk with care team and great resources.",
So easy to navigate and accessible to view all of my medical files/info in one place!,
I like that it keeps all of my information across multiple doctors in one place. Even for my family as well. Easy check in prior to visit so I'm not waiting as long to be seen. I get notifications when notes and test results are entered to my chart. My care team is very responsive to my questions and I can pay my invoices without having to wait on hold for someone. I would definitely recommend downloading the app.,
"The method to reorder medications is no longer user friendly, very frustrating and confusing.",
"Best way to communicate with my doctors! Referrals, questions, etc. are quickly addressed when there really is no need to be ""seen"". I love that I can SEE my test results and can ask questions of my doctor and get answers regarding those. In the past, test results were kind of ""hidden"" from us.",
When I first tried installing the MyChart app it showed pending for well over 10 hours. I then posted a review with concerns and a lower rating than I would have if it would have installed. The developer contacted me immediately showing their concerns with my problem. Today I tried installing it again and only took 3 minutes to install. Working great and I love all features. Thanks developers and I am changing my rating to 5 stars. Great app!!,
Always so easy to use. Very quick responses when emails sent or questions asked. Only 4 stars because you can't always schedule appointments online and I don't always have the time to call.,
Its asking for an update. Nothing has changed. I've been going in about every 3 weeks. It's a bit of overkill. Same problems this is not user friendly at all. You keep asking me to enter codes then it says the code is wrong. Now I'm trying to give you 2 stars but it won't let me do it...so let me just tell you that you're down to 2 stars now. How in world can someone not savvy enough to work through all this even give you any information? Let me guess your response. Striving right?,
"This is the best place if you do chemo, everything and everyone there treats you like a queen. Thank you for everything.",
Excellent app. It's great to have access to all my healthcare information in the same place.,
"This app is very easy to use. I highly recommend it. I've never had a problem loading with it. It keeps me informed with all my appointments, my medications, test results, exams everything I need to know. It's very easy to navigate not a problem there what so ever! It also keeps you informed with your billing and insurance. It also has e-check for you to check in early so you don't have all that paper work to fill out in the doctor's office. That's why I give this app a 5+. It's that good!!",
I love this app for the patient portal. It's easy to use and the best way to communicate with my doctor and office staff.,
Love being able to see scheduled appointments plus test results.have used the message feature to give stats when needed.,
"CANNOT USE APP! Click on app, told I'm using an old app! I have to update! NO WAY TO UPDATE!!!! Trying for DAYS! I've been in excruciating pain all weekend long! (Easter weekend)No one in doctor's office! ONLY WAY to contact doctor, is through the app! Jumping through hoops all day! Got in touch with IT, got some help! Trying to download new app!!",
"Love this app! I can take care of both mine and my husband's medical needs through it. Questions for the Dr or about a bill? Just send it through the app. Same with prescription refills or if you have to list them off to another Dr or hospital, they're right there, never any doubt about what you take or the strength. Just makes a lot of the medical things in our life easier and I'm all for anything that can do that!",
"It's an awesome app when it works. I love being able to talk to my doctor and all my specialists without needing to sit on the phone or have an unnecessary appointment. But the updates SUCK!!! Then having to call tech support to get me signed in again and again. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""",
"Disappointed. It won't open to read messages, test results, etc. And as I see other people's replies, nothing gets done about fixing the problems by the developer's. Totally disappointed in this app.",
Keeps me very well informed of my appointments and test results.,
"I have submitted two tickets, not a single has had any response. I also contacted customer service and it has been 9 days since I sent the message. Still no response. Whoever runs this app is extremely unprofessional and making it increasingly difficult to carry out my treatment plans.",
This is an wonderful app one I would recommend to all Patients and Clinicians alike. Support is also easy-going...lastly this is surely the app to have on your phone because all of the information needed to enter into other Countries is right at you fingertips.,
"MyChart portal is so easy to keep up with all my appointments, doctor notes, tests, lab results etc. (past and present). It allows me to pull up all my information during a follow up visit and go over the notes with my doctor. This allows me to get a better understanding of my health care needs. This is my go to app to stay informed.",
"Can't stand this app already. I NEED to use it to connect with my doctors, and I've been trying to connect information for weeks, but I'm confused and the entire thing is a visually overstimulating mess. My girlfriends app also says she HAS NO CARE TEAM. I'm trying to just find a way to turn on a Dark Mode, because the app is so bright it hurts my eyes. How is a healthcare app this inaccessible? 2 stars because I am figuring things out, but its overwhelming and frustrating. Neurodivergent.",
I am thoroughly enjoying the new system that my hospital implemented. I can see not only my results but also my kids,
"Best have called the system, Epic-Failure. As an inpatient, what a cluster of an experience. Screwed up meds and tests, and 'broken telephone' now is electronic. Reporting from physicians by and large is non-existent, and access to test results (dispute REPEATED requests) is non-existent. It is garbage. Rolled out live and no one seems to know how to use it. The whole mess makes making being sick in hospital just terrifying. If I could give this experience a Zero, I would. It's garbage.",
"App will not log me in, no matter whether I'm using biometrics or username+password, even after resetting the password, problem has persisted for 2 days, with the error message ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."" Calling the number via the ""Get Help"" link only got me a person who could reset my password for the MyChart website, he had no idea what was going on with the app and said no customer service existed for the app specifically. Unacceptable.",
"Super easy to communicate, pay bills, schedule labs. Love it",
I am my husband's primary caregiver. I have had My Chart visible to me for years. I had to delete my account to open his and then it would not let me open mine again. So it appears you can only operate ONE My Chart account on your phone at at time. That is very time consuming having to go back and forth and I do not think it is worth the effort. I believe it is easier to call and bother my doctor's for the information. That's why they get paid the big bucks.,
Love this app so much. I love how I camln get my lab results on it and talk to someone from your doctor's office ask them questions. Always have a list of your scheduled apts with the time and that your able to check in on it and save your self doing all that paper work when you get there. Such a great app.,
"I can't stand the fact That I can't make my own appointments on this app, seems the only thing this app is good for is information about the visits you already got information from at said visits or appointments, having to call the number is so time consuming. Waiting over an hour just to make an appointment for 3 months down the road. Need this app to be more efficient and effective.",
"It's helps keep track of things, but I wish it had a sound notification. I don't always remember to check it every day",
"Can't email results to yourself through app, trying to print outside app is impossible.",
"The MyChart app is a lifesaver! First, it's very easy to use. Second, it allows me to switch between caregivers. I use Baptist hospital and clinics for my primary care, and I use UAMS for my specialty care. I can email my doctors about all my medical needs. Plus, I can pay my medical expenses through the app. I absolutely love this app!",
Very convenient and easy-to-use,
"Love the care coordination and easy to access to medical history and results from multiple providers, including labs and hosptial visits in one user friendly application. This is extremely useful when you have multiple providers or conditions you're managing. Would love to see more integration features in the future and easy (possibly) automated identification of online medical records (since multiple providers have their own service and not one shared solution).",
Makes keeping track of my appointments so easy and I can view all my test results.,
Great tool! I have used it hundreds of times.,
This app does not work installing it and opening it to get started cuz I don't know exactly what health network I'm on and I don't know how to add it for it to be the correct one it's complicated for me and invasive as to why you even need that info. Plus there is only one part of Lovelace that's in-network for my insurance so I could only access the mychart through a link they sent me for an appt. The app isnt set up for patients in my situation without being given acces by link,
"Love the user friendliness but alot of print features are non existing on the app. I can see the doctor overview and click the floppy disk icon to save but on the full ""doc notes"" or ""letters"" it won't let me save or print. Please fix these.",
Someone deleted my review but what I said was blood work results come back fast and appointments are posted fast however do not send personal or medical information of any kind through the messaging part. It does not go to the doctors email. After waiting 2 weeks for an answer I called my doctor and she said she doesn't know why the app has that feature when messages are sent into the abyss and not to the doctors.,
"Tells me everything going on with my wife. I've actually learned a lot of the vocabulary that doctors and nurses speak while they communicate to each other, because I had to correct them. It's really good for if they had any questions because I would be able to answer their questions. Before this app, I just bobbed my shoulders. Setting appointments is easier, a long with refilling medication. Just a push of the button. Any questions, just ask away and you'll get an answer either in 1 or 2 days",
"The app is so fixated on security that it's almost impossible to use. It will not even allow a verification code sent by text to be copied and pasted. No, you have to write it down and then type it in. I don't care if somebody knows I take Lisinopril, Judith.",
"Excellent app that allows you to access your most recent test results, compare them with previous testing , get feedback from your doctor, set appointments and other great features! I highly recommend to anyone interested in keeping on top of their healthcare!",
It's been a long haul for me since I have been disabled since 2017 a life changing event. It's so hard to cover bills and pay for food then parking at the hospital then you get told about the ins deductible. And know I get told it's been wave thank you Jesus. Thank you methodist. Just to be able to breathe and not worry.,
"Makes information easily accessible. If all providers were like Dr. Tavares team, this would have been 5 stars; however, they are not even close to the exceptional care, using MyChart, as is Ms. Susan Denmark, who is apart of Dr. Ts professional/patient centered care.",
"Extremely frustrating! This app says ""error"" half the time and I am having problems getting staff to respond to my messages. It does not replace being able to call the office, although they no longer answer phones.",
This app is a fxxxing nighmare. This is a very poor way to see your results. I do not recommend this app. If you want to be able to see your covid results go to some other place besides CVS. If this is indicative of the way they give you YOUR results it does not speak highly of CVS. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. It seems that they are more interested in getting you to go to GOOGLE Play. I would not be surprised if they are getting a kick-back from GOOGLE. Why not just send you your results in an email? Why make something that could be very simple so difficult?,
"Nice, however the creator of this app, changed it, whenever a app is too easy to use some young Community College comes along decides to make us hit 5 buttons where preciously we tapped one. I've edited this review. I think TEMPLE IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA. 💜💚❤️💙🧡🌈 But should have assistance read their texts on mycharts to cut down on response time. 😉 All apps need a little improvement.",
I hate this app. It is very intrusive and the notifications are irrelevant.,
We live in the country and have satellite internet and most of the features of app don't work when I'm at Home. Where due to illness I spend most of my time. So I don't get messages or thi gs like visit summary. Test records etc In a ti.ely manner or have access to them at all. When in town works much better. This should work no matter where I am with an internet connection,
"Love this app. It switches and shares info between Memorial and Cleveland Clinic quickly and easily. The pre-checkin automatically shows you as ""Here"" so you don't have wait foand go torthe checkin counter. All test results and doctor's notes are readily available and easily accessed.",
"I was happy to use My Chart and being able to log in using a 4 digit passcode instead of using a password. Then I was told my pass code had expired, I was not so happy. Anyway after talking to numerous people only 1 being helpful I was able to figure out what to do by myself. But the problem was when I tried to use the passcode it said to sign in using password then reset passcode which didn't work. I'm just glad I can use the passcode again.",
Very hard to get into. Signs you out all the time. Now you have to use a new code they send it in your messages. You have to copy to Mychart. It took me 10 min I have dyslexia. I was diagnosed with it in my 40's I actually don't like the app at all sorry,
Garbage. So many features don't work the only o w that sure does and when you owe money.,
"The app is much better than the regular my Alberta health app because you are also able to see x-rays, ultrasounds, prescribed medications, and summaries of doctor visits. However, the app does not explain what every test means like on the my Alberta health app, and a few of my test results I am unable to find anymore which I find strange.",
Overall it's very intuitive and easy to use. I just wish that it was easier to access a comprehensive vaccination report and to see billing details with fewer clicks.,
"I recently had open heart surgery. This app allowed me to keep informed, with test results, doctors notes, and up coming tests.",
Amazing!!! This app allows me to make change or cancel appointments. Request refills and send secured messages to my Dr. I always receive a response within 24-48 hours and I get to see all of my test results as soon as my Dr. Receives them. I love this app because I can do so much from my own phone laptop or tablet without leaving home. I highly recommend if your Dr. Is apart of it jump on this bandwagon.,
"The most informative part of this is having first hand view at test results and the doctor's notes. Being able to ask questions about any of those results. Also past and future appointment accessibility, you can tap to add your appointments right to your calendar with details. I love it, keeps you on top of your healthcare with your preventive care when tests are coming due. Practically having your medical records at your fingertips!",
"Love this app! All my appointments, lab results, everything all tied up nicely. If I have questions I can contact my medical team via messaging. This is by far the best app for clear communication and my specific health information. I like that I can see the results and formulate any questions I might have prior to my appointment making this invaluable to me.",
Very useful and keeps me up to date with all info needing known between all my Drs. Definitely recommend this app to anyone who sees Drs regularly,
"This is Soooooo helpful! If I'm on vacation and at an urgent care that may not be Norton related (hope never), and need to share my info, I am able to link if they are as advanced as Norton's is. Has been sooo beneficial! Also, all other Norton doctorate able to look at my history without me having to have it all written out! It's great!!! Thank you!",
"It's constantly sending emails and text stating I have new test results or messages and i do not, there is nothing there, also not understanding the results, other then that. The app is great",
"This is a great app , you can message your doctor to schedule an appointment or ask any questions , you can request prescription refills , find out test results in real time , review your overall health , and schedule test appointments . This app has no ads and is extremely easy to navigate through . The only negative thing is you cannot take a screen shot to save on your device . This is the only add-on the app could really use .",
"Today I had 15 messages for MyChart. Why? I get message after message after message, but I can't find any new messages. Also, why can't I have a simple list of all of my next week's appointments in a row. Why is there only one appointment listed, and why do I have to go searching for another appointment information that's on the same day? I get so frustrated with the extremely poor organization of information. I also get tired of 20 emails a day saying that I have a message from Altru.",
"Literally never works. I constantly have open and close the app because it won't work, and it crashes all the time. This app would be very useful if it actually worked. I'm a cancer patient and I practically rely on this unreliable app.",
"Awesome experience, I am able to keep up with my medical appointments better. I see the results of my test right away. The test results show not only the test and why you received it, it also gives you the range results to let you know if you need to change your diet or let you know to ask your Dr about any questions you have to help in your medical care to stay healthy. I also use it to communicate anything to my providers or request appointments. Oh my goodness, I can go on and on. Thank you!",
"I have used this app for several years. I like that I can make appointments online, message my doctor with questions and concerns, keep track of upcoming appts., get results of tests and compare to previous tests, and they are connected to other providers. My clinic is 60 miles from me, so I went to an Urgent Care to test for Covid. They were both on MyChart and I had the result on my MyChart phone app before the Phys. Asst. came in to tell me the results!",
Beneficial when seeing clinicians without access to my info. Also easily communicate with my care team.,
"I like My Chart for the ability to see results from tests and reviews of my appointments in a very timely fashion. Also, like the ease of pre-checking in, all of my history, and the ability to message my doctors.",
"Please add Samsung Health support like you did with Google Fit. Please add Dark Mode support. There's so much white, it hurts my eyes. Dark mode has been a feature in Android since version 9.0, we are now in version 12 and still don't have this support from you guys. It's unacceptable and inexcusable in 2022. I don't understand why you guys aren't supporting this BASIC feature.",
"I thought maybe there was an update but there was not when I checked. My Chart will not let me load anything, my phone doesn't even register that the app is open, I can't see any of my messages to my doctor, when I try to open them it's blank when I know it wasn't a couple days ago. please fix this, this is the only way I can communicate with my Doctor",
My chart has changed. Unable to schedule appointments with regularly seen doctors. Only certain docs available in the list now. Covid vaccine appointments are pushed on the top of the list on almost every page of this app now. It is relentless. Even tho my cancer doctor advised against getting the vaccine until my cancer and immune system isn't compromised anymore. I'm pissed. This USED to be a invaluable tool that I loved. I already messaged customer service about this... No response yet,
My entire medical history at my qt fingertips as well as access to all labs and films. The fact that I can see all of my appointments past and present and pre-register saves a lot of time. Every facility or group I have been seen at is there Any bill I owe is right there and I can pay it. I appreciate that I can message my provider or anyone else on my team 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I really can't think of anything that has been missed.,
I love everything about this app. I wish I would have connected all my providers and hospitals a long time ago because with my chart you got your test results you can communicate with your provider you can schedule appointments request medication refills and so much more. I highly recommend my chart. Download it and start using it today I guarantee you you will not regret it.,
"This has been one of my best apps!! I enjoy tremendously how quickly I get to see the results of my care. This app makes me feel a part of my medical team! Before this app was available to patients, we did not know the results of our test and doctor summaries, as we get with this app!! Thank you so much for offering this app to me, the patient!!",
Love my chart! It is so helpful and convenient!!! I love being able to switch back and forth from osf to Unity Point on the same app. It's a great way to keep track of your meds and allergies 🙂,
This makes it incredibly easy to write messages to your provider without having to call the office and loop around the automatic number roulette. Also allows you to refill prescriptions without having to call either. You can write a message describing symptoms ( like sinus pressure or cold/flu) and they will write you back and if needed prescribe something to help.,
"Totally unable to set a ""passcode"". It never uses the camera, always fails to recognize my fingerprint and never lets me set a passcode. Never, never never! I have tried a zillion times on my Galaxy Flip 5G. Never - as if it does not recognize this phones camera nor its fingerprint input device. It did sort of work on my previous Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. But never on this flip.",
I received a text to upload this app and the does not provide anything. I mean...absolutely nothing. It is ridiculous. I have been trying for 4 days and could be spreading germs like wildfire. Where else can i get tested without using this big waste of time. Ugh. I would give 0 stars if it were an option.,
"Great app except I have to change my password every time I try to log on. Which is rediculous!! The up needs fixed, easier to just call the doctors office for results and appt. Less Hassel, love the app once I get into it but probably won't be using anymore, suppose to be easy.",
"I wanted to put 6 stars, but lately some of your apps are bey frustrating. I realize that you have a number of updates and for the most part I have appreciated the updates. However, in this ""test run"" I have had some of my info that I consistently done with "" E Check In"" has supppsitedly been missing (a message I have received from SSMentrr Health Care) and I had to go back and re-enter.",
Overall excellent application in today's standards. It makes staying up to date on my health and communicating with my doctor or scheduling an appointment easy. And they add relevant and useful things regularly which is nice. Would definitely recommend the app.,
"I like the app and it very useful, however I do have a beef with it.  The fact that I am able to see test results without talking to my doctor first is disheartening.  I have been dealing with issues and I am in no state to see test results that pretty much provide my diagnosis before my doctor can meet with me.  There should be an option for the doctor or the patient to decide if they want to receive these messages.",
"1) this app doesn't let u upload images or write notes more than 400 characters (AND if u respond to an MD note, it counts the contents of the original note in the 400 char limit!) 2) U can't upload imaging or labs/anything else. 3) BC several of my providers use EPIC as well, it's very confusing to get notices from Mychart when u have to open ALL of them to see who it's from. 4)It doesn't let u download anything, for ex: radiologist reports.5] Providers hate it 6) [It just cut me off: 400 ch!]",
"It's nice to be able to access my records and information, and to email my doctor's from the app, but it constantly pushes notifications that I have new test results or new messages from my doctors when in fact there is nothing new in my chart; I haven't even seen a doctor in months.",
"In Covid times, you want a reliable way to check results. I tested a few months ago and everything was fine with the app. I had to retest. Was sent a new activation link and now cannot log in. Fun times.",
"I get notifications that I have something new in my charts but there is no direct reference to what is new so I have to go everywhere to try and find it. Very frustrating. Also a number indicating number of new items attached to the app icon, but I see nothing new touched every item but still see the same number of items on the icon.",
Using the is app is very frustrating. Everytime I get new test results the app crashes and says it cannot connect to server. The idea of this app is great when it is working.,
"Excellent app. I can easily see all of my appt details and health chart details as well. Test results are also posted in a very quick manner, once completed results are on file. I would highly recommend this app to anyone.",
This app is not longer functioning properly at all! When I try to view billing or my account statements the app crashes & closes. Other aspects of the app start to load & then just keep trying endlessly w/out success. Please fix this stuff!,
The app is very useful when it worked 100%. For whatever reason after the update I can no longer use the microphone while on telemedicine visits with my Dr.'s I've called the tele-help number listed but they weren't helpful. Anyone know how to fix this issue?!,
"terrible app. never works, always having issues. whats the point of having access to my records if i can never view them. if you have an app down this much you really should be looking for a new provider.",
Each time I try logging in it gives me an error message. I have to reset my password each time just to access the app. All this happened after the new update but before that the app was working good and it was a great app to use.,
Ever since I switched providers and went from MultiCare to Providence health care the app doesn't work anymore and just keeps saying my logon and password doesn't match. I have to sign on through my laptop to access MyChart now. No clue to why the app stopped working.,
"Mediocre. Can't pay bills easily. Credit card is default. Takes lots of effort to use checking acct info. Difficult to navigate to some areas and data is incomplete, as though not used or completed by licensee/provider.",
"This app is trash. All I want is to contact straight directly to and from my doctor only. The medical records and billing are common sense, but the app itself is annoying to use. It takes a day or two for a reply from someone else that can't really help you. Even if I make a call directly to the clinic, they can't help me.",
"Absolutely LOVE this app and Novant. If you hate filling out paper forms over and over, you will love the app. Before your visit, use eCheckin. You just review your info, accept it or update it. No starting over with blank forms everything you go. Love it. Plus your future appointments are there. Your test results are there. Your medical data is there. Piece of cake. Works great! Makes your visit easier & makes it easier on the staff too.",
"Terrible. Could not pay bill when tried 4-5x. Had to end up calling it in. And now receive 404 server error and cannot get in at all. Thought maybe uninstalling/reinstall would work? Unfortunately no, same error. Might these errors have started with the new ""upgrades"". Need to fix please.",
"Makes trips to the clinic easier. You can set up appointments, see upcoming appointments, read all your documents, see past appointment documents and now because of covid the added option of telehealth appointments are great! I absolutely love the app and fully reccomend it!",
"I generally groan when an app rolls out a new interface, but have to say I'm really liking the new format. Much cleaner, larger, and still very easy to find everything.",
This app is amazing and I love it! I get a message sent to me with a reminder of my next appointment-it asks if I want to add to my calendar_of course!!! 😁 It has so many features & is wicked easy to navigate!,
"Pretty easy to use, can sometimes get lost on where something is, but overall it's great for tracking my appointments and seeing my visit summaries and test results without having to contact the doctor.",
Love the app. One of the few that is consistent. I like seeing everything about my health in 1 place. Being able to communicate with my careteam is important to me and I'm able to do so without having to make an appointment. I can easily keep track of appointments and review doctors' notes.,
The access to my records while in the hospital and not having to wait to see test results was a powerful tool I was able to use toward becoming my own best patient advocate. Seeing the medicine and any changes made was invaluable information. In addition being able to make food choices within my assigned menu was such a wonderful way to track my own dietary restrictions. I just think having access to all within the MyChart app made me feel involved and informed in setting my health goals.,
"Love it! Quick, easy, helpful, feel more connected to physician, uncomplicated with only occasional minor glitches such as having to repeat something you just completed as it showed up as not done. Excellent!",
"For the past few months I can no longer open the billing section or test results within the app. It always says ""an error has occurred with the server."" The only thing I can really use the app for is to see upcoming appointments.",
DO. NOT. USE. AN. APP. FOR. HEALTHCARE. Especially this one. Too easy for your data to be exposed. It doesn't work very well and biometrics sign-in seems to be gone. You also run the risk of being profiled by hospital staff.,
"Conveinient and easy to use. Trying to keep appts straight can be tough, with Mychart I never have to think about where or when I have to be somewhere. Just a look at the app and I have everything at my fingertips.",
Can't enter payment info from the app because it requires a capture that is cut off. Awful user experience. The weak canned response is an even worse customer experience and I also contacted support months ago and to no one's surprise I never heard back. Fix it!,
"I am so happy using this app. I can message the doctor for refills, questions, etc. It keeps a record of lab tests, blood test, cat scan results and much more. So easy to use. Finally a resourceful app that is actually working well. Thank you.",
"Absolutely 💯 love it. Without this app I wouldn't be able to communicate with my diabetic team, n my doctors specialists. And my surgeon . If I could rate it 20 stars 🌟 I definitely would! I recommend 5his 4 anyone needing to keep up with their records, Blood work. test results ect. Without the hassle of having 2 call multiple doctors. This is extremely important for anyone having to to rely on making multiple Dr appointments by just using this app alone. 👌",
"No biometric login. Very annoying, each time you have to type in your username and password. They should be an option to save username and password with biometrics. I checked the option to use biometrics is not there / not available",
I used to love this app. But for the past month i havent been able to login. I keep getting an error about the terms and conditions not loading. Please fix this. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and updated my password. Help!,
"""There was a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" Even when the website works, I almost always get response on the app. Sometimes putting in my key 10 times works, sometimes I have to wait a day, sometimes it just works. Hoping to get this resolved.",
"It's great to be able to get after-visit reports and get information about what is going on with various doctors; good for being able to show one provider what/where you're at with another. I haven't used the messaging service yet, but I prefer speaking to someone anyway.",
Easy to use app. Makes setting up my doctor appointments much easier and convenient. Lots of good features on the app as well. It has continued to make improvements over the years.,
"Absolutely awful. I'm not sure what happened, but I can't get into my account. This new update has made everything just terrible. Whether I use my fingerprint or manually log in it just tells me there's an error and I can't do anything. They need to roll out another update and fix this!",
I love this app. Can soak straight with my doctor anyone and fat responses.,
"I was just reading a comment it said some glitches, I can't even get logged in. When I try to change password and it gives me the image I can't see anything at the bottom to ask for a different image or submit it. I get locked out and tells me to make a call but have only seen the number a couple times. It also keeps asking me to refresh, stop and something else when I submit my new password. All I want to do is confirm an appointment.",
"It takes forever at times for messages or appointments to load at times, you have to continuously log in and then out to try and get it to reset.. You can't effectively communicate with your caretram or do half the stuff you used to be able to do through the regular website..",
I love this app it keeps me up to date with my medical stuff unlike before wish this app had been around a long time ago it keeps me on track and accountable plus am able to talk to my Dr or care team with more then just the phone it gives me piece of mind I would recommend anyone to take full advantage of my chart app it's great! Every time I get on the app I find out something new in always exploring it and finding new things!,
Love the app! Very easy to use!,
"I must check MyChart weekly. In the 10+ years of use, I have never had a problem with the app and every section is easily understood. If I should need help with anything, all the answers are right there and found quickly. Also it seems secure and private. 5 stars.",
It's good. I like being able to message my doctor & quickly see test results. The billing section is weird tho. Lots of clicks to see a detailed bill. It makes it look like they really want your money but don't want to tell you why.,
"I am still getting used to things on here. Like today messages were there, I read them and then they disappeared. Felt like I was made a fool because I had called the ultrasound clinic at St Anthony's, where the ultrasound appts were scheduled. St Anthony's had no idea what I was talking about. On other appts & reminders the site does okay. Communication between patient and nurse / doctor works nicely. As well as the linking. But have to set up all sides..",
"Honestly, the people giving poor reviews just sound dumb and like it's more of an operator error than anything 🙄 but anyways, I absolutely LOVE this app and have always had a really great experience with it and it has helped tremendously with communicating with providers for me and especially my children! I am so glad this app exists and I know why it is the top app because it's absolutely amazing!! 😍🇻🇦💜💜💜💜💯💯💯",
"I have only used it three times with my doctor. I am very impressed at the ease of use. I am limited in computer stuff and it's damn hard to find a kid to help me out add the ""Rona"" virus and it's zilch. So I really love this Dr. Chat thing! Saves so much gas, time and all I bet these are going to be very popular after finding new normal BIG THANK YOU!!! FOR the people who set it up.",
"Update: Face Unlock is now available for Android devices! Thanks for the update! I love MyChart but it's a bummer that I can't sign in with Face Unlock. All of the modern apps support it, but yours doesn't. Please update it to allow Face Unlock as I no longer have a fingerprint sensor.",
Very hard to use this app .. NOT well designed ..many dead ends ..navigation hard cant change incorrect info ..worst part is REQUIRING to use it ..VERY HARD ON OLD PEOPLE W BAD EYES!!! DOES NOT WORK ON PC WITH LARGE SCREEN!?! .im stuck trying to read tiny text on a small screen .. poor design for regular non medical people probably great fot doctors and staff TERRIBLE for patients !!!,
"Takes 10 minutes to login, something changed and I need to spend 10 minutes of login errors until i finally can input my metrics, but not without having even more errors while inside de app. Update: contacted by the developers, let's see how it goes. Already sent also an email to that address. Update: still not working, getting same errors and now I just add data for my Dr once a week if I'm lucky...",
"Needs referral management, billing shows notification when there's no payment due, view statement is hit or miss, you can't reorganize the icons or remove them, you can't change profile picture, mychart customer service is hard to get to, needs help section providing number to mychart team. Referral, referral, referral! Please add referral management. Seeing referral status and referral details should be essential. Please also add referral notifications when status changes.",
"It is very helpful in managing the many facets of Healthcare. I wish there was a way to make sure the new doctors actually review the different illnesses you type in in the patient added health conditions ect. Since not everyone has all electronic health records. I know you can enter them. I realize that they have to be confirmed ect. I was just wanting to know how to sort this out when you have an extremely long and complex health history, with many many doctors all over a big city",
"Terrible App whoever made it will never get out of he.. now you can never get your records the Dr just says go to ""my chart"" and of course there is nothing really there just some stupidity. Also impossible to log in you need to make a complicated pswrd and you can't even select ""show password"" so you can never remember what u used.. it's a lot harder to log in to this then into one's bank account, how ridiculous.",
"I used to appreciate the functionality and ease of use of this app, but now it no longer appears to work. I constantly get push notifications to check it, but after login, it won't connect to the server. Very disappointing.",
"Downloaded app and stuck on find my location. Insists on using location finder, which just keeps running. There's a whole list of states in the background, but won't let me pick one.",
This app has been having problems for months. It's buggy and I've even tried it on PC and my Samsung phone both of them have the same problem. As of today 5/4/2020 I just missed an appointment with my doctor because they could not get a link to me in the app because the messages would not load.,
"My Chart is wonderful. My medical history is easily accessible. I can monitor my own progress and it helps me to stay on track with my annual appointments. Also, I can always get in touch with my doctor if I have any issues and concerns. My experience with My Chart has been great.",
"Pretty handy and easy to use. It does have several glitches. It tells me tests and preventive procedures need to be done, but they've already been done months before. It can loop glitch often. But when it works, it works well.",
"I have used this app with no problem on android and IOS.,but since my phone updated to Android 11 all I get when trying to log in is” There was a problem communicating with the server.Try again later.” My IPad still works fine but Android has become useless.",
"I basically only ever use this app when 1) I'm looking up when I have an appointment, and 2) so that I get push notifications when a doctor sends me a message. Works fine for those. Handles multiple providers well. Big fan of the touch unlock.",
"Very informative and allows you to see all your medical results (blood work, x-rays and tests of all kinds). I really enjoy reading about what's happening with me instead of having to call or return to the doctor to understand your treatment and what it all means. I highly recommend this app for anyone to use.",
"Great app, easy to use & navigate! And now I don't have to enter my login info every time bc I can use biometrics/pin to login. Way better/more convenient than using web browser version! The only thing I'd love to see in the future is a Dark Theme. NOTE: This was originally a 3-star review of me complaining about having to manually enter my login info everytime. That was my only issue with this app, but the devs responded quickly with a solution to my problem. Thank you, Epic!!",
Doesnt always works. Duplicate meds espec. on ones where one of the scripts is expired... have to give a email & don't use email...tech support said put anything it just to go on. Can't verify it I dont use it. It took 2-3 days to get someone from tech to assist in unlocking app only because I kept calling till someone answered. No evef returned call back option message I left.,
I do not like the new update that sends me to download a Google video conference app. That is outside of the my chart app. I believe this should be against my hippa privacy. I understand this made navigation for a computer much easier for people and it has made it difficult for Android users to do a video conference with the doctor. The update should be within the app and not Google Play having to download something new. I am very unhappy with new update,
"Great for getting your results quickly but frustrating that there is no way to share your results. I needed them for work and it wont let me send it through email, link, and the app wont even let you screenshot.",
"I like having my medical records, test results, etc., in one convenient app. Still trying to navigate everything the app has to offer. So far, I do like it and would highly recommend it to anyone. Eliminates the need for paper, also.",
"Mostly positive experience, slightly confusing interface at first. Links could be better at direction of services. Also links to x-rays and imaging would be beneficial.",
The app is easy to use and it's easy to find appointments which for me that's kind of hard to remember sometimes but I get pushed notifications reminding the other appointments and I can see all my lab results that's a plus.,
Easy and user friendly,
It's as a accurate and up to date as an app like this can be and I absolutely love it. It's easy to use and it's understand. Overall it's a great app!,
"I love having instant, easy access to mine and my kid's medical care history, upcoming and past appointments with all the doctor's and nurse's notes as well as lab/procedure results. It also reminds you of overdue wellness procedures and immunizations and EVERYTHING about your medical history right at your fingertips from anywhere. Amazing app!",
"I love that I get results quickly and able to reorder meds without having to wait for a doc to reorder or the pharmacy to answer the phone However, I have multiple doctors. I'd like to be able to make an appointment from the app for all of them. Not just some. As a woman, I have an obgyn, pcp, endo, oncologist and neuro.... Why can't I make an appt from the app with my existing doctors? Also, The questionnaires should be updated by that doctors office. You can answer and do it again in office.",
"This app has made my medical issues easier to manage! Medication, labs, referrals, and my appointments are all at my finger tips instead of on a bunch of little pieces of paper. The app works smoothly and without error! Thank you!",
"I used to love this app and used it all the time. But now I can't get on, I keep getting a ""Trouble connecting with server try again later"" message. This message has kept me from being able to access the app for while now so now I have to use my home computer to access mychart. This needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!",
"The app has stopped opening, it goes to the load screen and shuts down immediately. I tried Uninstalling and installing it again and it still will not open. Will change my rating back to 4 once it's fixed.",
Overall great medical app. Easy to use and keep track of appts for household. Like the ability to message physicians when needed and also scheduling appointments is super easy. No real issues since we have had it.,
This app is life changing. It gives me test results each time I have tests. It's an easy way to contact your doctor's office to ask questions. My doctor's office is very quick to respond. All of my medical records are now in one location. Also if I see a doctor that is not in my normal provider group they can access these records. I highly recommend using this app.,
"Difficult to navigate. You have different passwords for each organization and not ALL organizations are listed. Once that is figured out, It is nice to have your information shared with other providers to update your care with them and notify other medical specialist of your medical team. (Everyone on same page!!! At last)",
This app is very nice and really easy to use. To be able to view my lab results and X-rays is a big plus.. not to mention the ease in scheduling and sometimes rescheduling appts.,
"MyChart app is very helpful and very convenient it shows you everything you need to know about about upcoming information, Awesome 👍",
"MyChart is great except when I'm trying schedule an appointment. Since they have ""revamped"" the app my children's doctor's office isn't an option anymore. It's been like this for a year at least and when I asked no ones knows why. I would like to see their doctor's office back on there and not have to call the office every time to schedule an appointment.",
So useful for me to be aware of test results. Helps me develop questions prior to exams. Messaging is such an efficient way to communicate. Other doctors and specialists reviewing medical history is so valuable for diagnosis and proper treatment. The ability for me to release records to medical personnel out of this network is critical as I live seasonally.,
"I really enjoy the convenience of this app to see notes, test results, schedule appointments, and pay my bills. It works great to send nonurgent messages to doctors, too. It's the one thing that seems to make healthcare easier in the US.",
I don't know how I would keep track of my appointments without this app. Also it is very convenient for viewing test results. Many times my test results are posted to the app before I even get home from the appointment!,
I'm unable to contact my doctor's office by phone. I am only able to reach customer service. I tried to send a message through this app and it keeps telling me that I can't set an appointment or send a message. There is no way to reach my doctor. EDIT TO DEVELOPER: I AM UNABLE TO CONTACT THEM DIRECTLY WHICH IS WHY I TRIED THE APP. Calling them just brings you to customer service as I said above. I KNOW how to contact them. THEY make it impossible to speak to the office and just give the run arou,
"After using it for almost a year, I find it easier to use, fairly robust, and with a great deal of information. It allows you to make sure the meds are accurate and can be ordered via the application. I also like being able to sent notes to my doctor and get a response from her. Very good app and recommend it.",
"I am very happy to have learned about MyChart! I'm very new to it but already love it! It's very helpful, convenient, and much more! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make things a little easier and convenient for themselves. Yes, it's just one thing in this difficult life we live, but one thing here and one thing there adds up and helps!",
"It is agood app except that I can't take a screenshot of the verification of me making a payment ""due to security policy.""",
"I have switched my PCP, diabetes NP, Sleep Apnea physician all to U of U health because My Chart is so easy!!! My doctors were all IHC and their app is a nightmare; just when I think I have it finally figured out, it still won't let me in and I have to go thru the same hair-pulling frustration again and again!! MyChart lets me message my provider, see lab results, pay a balance, etc. And the best part is love all my new providers at the U!! Best app I've ever used.",
"I am giving a 4 star rating mostly because I am still getting accustom to it's tools. It is getting easier to send a message to my medical team. Where I think I am able to share everything that ails me, and my providers are able to troubleshoot and find remedies with less miscommunication, and patient forgetting to talk about something they are in need to discuss with their medical teams",
Would be better but you send messages to your doctors on important problems and they never get back to you. Good concept but doesn't work.,
"Beware of debt collectors! Debt collection is a built in part of this app. Collectors have direct access within this app for allegedly unpaid (substantiated or not) medical bills. Do NOT click or call the number if the app states a bill has been sent to collections. They attempted to collect an erroneous bill from 2009??? Fail. In response to the developer, my provider did not program the functionality to allow for this. Debt collectors should not be an integrated part of the system.",
It very very very hard to go back to last screen or the main menu. So much so that I have to multiple times close the app and reopen it. Very annoying. You need to have a visable back button,
"Great app however it doesn't tell you what type of appointment you have whether it's with midwife, doctor or to get bloods taken so you never really know what your appointment is until you get there.",
"I depend on this app to keep up with my appointments, make appointments, communicate with my doctors and nurses, get my test results... It's everything I need one place. It's convenient, useful, and dependable.",
"Baytown/Houston Methodist are God sent Angels. Every member of my team has been extremely professional, courteous, kind and caring. Handling all my questions and concerns in such a timely manner, at times it seems as I am their only patient. Catering to me as if I were a King.This app has greatly enhanced the level of communication and given me a much greater level of understanding of my condition. Houston Methodist & ""mychart"" has left no room for error and together achieved perfection.",
"Some sections like questionaire and medications come back continuously as error, try again. Repeated tries give error message.",
I love the responsiveness by my DR. With this app. Reminders are very helpful too.,
"I have a diffacult medical history, & when I need to get in contact with my primary care manager, to schedule an appointment or need a medication renewals; all those things plus many other issues great or small, ""My Chart"" has been the ""Best"" medical information to have at your fingertips. At first I was unsure about signing up, and ""NOW"", I'm so glad I did!!",
"I still haven't figured out all the features but it's been really helpful since I downloaded it. it even retrieved old visits I completely forgot about, and let me link accounts I needed. it's a very useful app, I look forward to learning more about it as I use it",
"It's pretty good but filling out the pre visit questionnaire when you have an appointment with a doctor seems to be a waste of time sometimes they can't even use it and at other times it's probably much easier to fill it out in the office. Also they keep on asking the same questions over and over, saying Medicare requires them to ask this question periodically. Still re-ask the question a couple of days later though if they have an opportunity.",
"I really like how I can keep up with everything. Appointments, test results, billing, scheduling, and so much more are all on the ""MyChart"" app. Accessible qhen I need it. This app is wonderful.",
"I love using MyChart. I definitely recommend this app. MyChart allows me to receive messages, instructions, all upcoming and referral appointments as well as test results. I can also see what medications I will be taking and bills. Along with receiving messages, I am able to ask any questions or express concerns about my medical care. MyChart has other features as well.",
"I use this app very frequently. I enjoy & benefit from having a collected place for info from a couple of healthcare systems I use. I wish that Epic would take on the responsibility of putting into the app itself clarifications about how my personal health information flows. Major example: messaging a doctor. It should be made clear in the interface of the app who in the clinic will be notified & who will have access to messages I send, & what the clinic's internal policies are regarding that.",
EDIT FOR OUTRAGE!! -5 ⭐ I READ DOWN AND SEE OTHERS ARE MISSING APPOINTMENTS AS WELL.... THAT TELLS ME IT'S %100 THE APP. This is UNACCEPTABLE!! GARBAGE!! Not pleased since they have integrated it with other Medical Systems. I'm not getting contacted for my appointments anymore. Nothing has changed on my side whatsoever so it's definitely something to do with this app. Worked fine for years and now I've missed three appointments. Plus it seems like the information that I have now is limited.,
"MyChart app is quite useful. You will have access to all your Medical information, and so much more, instead of having to ask permission and go through all the red tape just to view your own medical records. Having something like this would have been great 25 - 30 years ago. We were lucky if we received information like we can now. What? You haven't downloaded the App, what are you waiting for? Download it now, you won't regret it, I promise! I'm very thankful for MyChart App.",
I love being able to receive test results always able to contact my doctor,
This app has been so helpful in my journey through breast cancer & helped me remove appointments when I was going through chemo brain but especially the ability to communicate with my care team & get answers quickly has been the best part of this app. I'm also trying to set up my husband's phone for his app as well because he's not as computer savvy as I am but I'm sure once he's used to using this app he too will be on top of his health as I am trying to regain mine.,
"Since I started using the MyChart app due to looong holds on the phone, I have found it to be very helpful, always dependable and when you leave a message for the doctor (even at odd hours), the nurse views and responds to you the first thing in the morning. They are very polite and compassionate with their answers. I'm so thankful for it. It really does help with my peace of mind 😌!",
Easy to use. Easy to schedule appointments abd see test results.,
I like my charts due to it reminds me of my appointments. Very helpful for myself.,
"Though it can be a bit clunky to move around in at times, it makes it alot easier to communicate with my doctor for whatever reasons. All in all this is a good app and a great idea for people everywhere that have access to a cell phone.",
Easy to use and offers multiple sign in options. Fast and reliable information.,
"As newer versions of the app come out, the easy of use has suffered considerably. Sending most of the menu options out to the web version is ridiculous. And forcing you to retype your username is plain stupid. The secret is the password NOT the username. Atleast have an option to keep the username between sessions. I understand some users have more than 1 username (ie spouse, children). But most of us dont.",
"Great to get test results quickly, to be able to renew subscriptions, to communicate with the doctors.",
Love the app it helps me be more active and help me talk to the doctor about what's going on with me. And because I cannot move around that good.,
Absolutely ridiculous I could not access this when I was out of the country and had a message about a test result in my email that said to check my chart. I ended up calling after being told could not log in try again later and was told that because I was in Mexico it would not work nThis only works in the UK and US I was told. Not sure of the logic of blocking other countries and I could have used a VPN to get to it but I shouldn't have to. Really annoyed with this restricted access to my chart,
The option for video appointment is on here and I set up an appointment for my son for it to be cancelled and they wanted to reschedule me for a whole different time and day. If that worked for me I would have chose that option. Because they said they only do in person not video appointments anymore. And can't get video appointments taken off,
Don't like it. Why do I need a password to get texts on my phone. It takes more than one try to get through. It's a pain.,
Easy to use and I am able to see my information.,
Love MyChart. It promptly provides me with test results and written summaries of doctors' visits. Easy to search. Easy to understand. Allows me to review everything the doctor said. That's extremely helpful because I can sometimes forget what was said at the appointment.,
"I absolutely love this app ! Its so awesome that i get notifications if there is a message for me , and also i get notified of upcoming treatments/ procedures and regular appointments. After an appointment or procedure there is always an after visit summary loaded on to my notes for me to read , which is awesome ! If i need to contact my medical team i can send them a message , they will either text me back or telephone me ! Overall a brilliant app which makes life that much simpler !",
"Is new for me, but I really like it.just to be able to recive my medical information and keep in touch with my Dr. Makes everything easy for me.",
I get an error viewing my messages. It says there was an error getting my messages and an error displaying the error page. The does not soar to be a way to fix this. Messaging is core functionality for this app.,
"Great app, keeps track of appointments and test results. Allows for better communication with my healthcare providers. Allows me to review my test results prior to appointments giving me a better opportunity to come up with any questions. As a Veteran I require appointment verification for Veteran Affairs for some appointments, always had to remember to ask for a signed note before, now I just take a screenshot of my appointment details and am good to go.",
Love using my chart Love how I can contact my doctor anytime and they respond back. Much easier and faster than a phone call.,
I love being able to text with my Dr! Refills are simple and convenient. I am also able to keep my test results at my fingertips. So many positive things and I cant think of even 1 negative!,
Brilliant app very handy for all your appointment,
"Very good, very helpful. I absolutely love mychart and it helps so much. It saves time and gives you direct access to your medical records and test results. Wow, can you imagine all of the time you save from being on hold... thank you MYCHART.",
"Love using Mychart. So easy and convenient to make appointment, review results, getting reminders and paying any balance all in one app for myself and my family. I would definitely recommend others to take advantage of this app!",
Using for a while now..can see test results in a timely fashion. Sometimes I believe that can be a situation where a patient can see something strange and has not yet had a chance to discuss it with the physician. Case being my daughter has been diagnosed with MS and she saw a brain scan with lesions before her doctor discussed it with her.,
This app is a great help when scheduling my various appointments and in keeping up with the test results.,
"Great app, I've used it for almost a year love this app, yo!! The app had the ability to add photos to show your doctor, then suddenly the option stopped and the app isn't as great anymore. WHY DID YOU DEACTIVATE THE PHOTO OPTION GUYS, RIGHT WHEN I NEED IT FOR MY PAIN MGMT TOO.. PLEASE MAKE IT WORK AGAIN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...",
I should be able to cancel appointments at will. No explanation. I cancelled a procedure by phone that is still showing on the app. Tried calling the doctor's office. Got a recording they'll call back in 2 days. Seems I'd be better if without the app.,
"App has glitches that need to be fixed. For example, when I choose to look at medications, there is no way to return to main menu to view other areas. I have to log out and then log back in.",
"First of all, I write this review as a Millennial whose work and personal life involve technology aids. Currently, I'm going through a major diagnoses and treatments with multiple hospitals and universities. MyChart makes it so simple and stress-free to access my different CareTeam providers. I can upload records easily. I get notifications when there's a new message, test results, or an earlier appointment available. While the diagnosis still sucks, MyChart makes it a little more bearable.",
"I enjoy the benefits of MyChart. If I have a question about my visit, I am able to reread my visit summary. I always toss the paper copy so this is a good way to keep track of it all. My two kids and myself are all on my chart, and it is easy to just switch profiles without having too many different logins/passwords.",
"Excellent app. It has everything I need access to, and is very easy to navigate.",
"There is no way to edit information that the patient enters if the information changes. The pt. must make an new entry & remove the previous info. For example, your Dr changes ""the amount of"" or ""how often"" for a medication you take, even if the strength is the same. Need to make a simple way for the Drs office to upload the entries a patient makes. While they can see the pt. added info, some offices cannot easily upload the new info or update procedures done @ facilities outside of MyChart.",
"I love that I can see test results and not have to call about it, and also I can see my upcoming appointments. Very handy app to have. I love it. If I ever have questions, I ask on here, and they answer back fairly quick. Saves alot of time on the phone.",
"Just the peace of mind of knowing and having all your medical info as well as prescriptions, vaccinations, procedures, appointments, etc. all at your fingertips I highly recommend this app to anyone considering it.",
"This is the best app to see your own results from exams, medical records, appointment related information.",
This is the worst app I've ever had. It's always down. There's a problem with the server all the time. One would think they would do a better job with an app designed to get important medical info. It's supposed to make things easier but it only frustrates and angers. Extremely disappointed.,
"This is a pretty neat App, you can see all your pasted visits, updated lab results, make hospital bill payments, and switch between accounts from previous health care provider, if you have a new employer and lose your old health care provider between charges of careers, all your medical results will still be visible, honestly best application I've use, easy to understand too.",
"Very easy to check current appointments, test results and personal Info. My only complaint is that all email and text messages are in Spanish. Can't figure out how to change that.",
"Login is a pain. Biometrics has never worked for me and Google doesn't recognize the password field so I have to look it up every time. Otherwise, the features and ease of use are pretty good for my needs. Would be five stars but for login hassle.",
"The app will notify you the same day that you had your test taken, great for when your worried about the results! Very great feature is that you can message your privider with any question you might have forgotten during doctors visit. Overall an amzing app that I totally recommend having.",
The app is rubbish it always doesnt load properly and you cannot contact your team on there like they said you would be able to the old system was miles better it's a waste of time and effort this new system and should revert to the old system was less hassle,
Best app to keep up with your health care,
"It's great to be at a specialist appointment and when asked about a test, I can show them the results from months before . The only downside is the new two step authentication doesn't work and it's a pain to work around it every time.",
"Seemingly useful, until you have a second doctor and you need to reenter all of your information again. It seems insane that I can't just let both organizations access the same information without double entering everything. Honestly a 0 star move, but it is occasionally helpful.",
"Pretty Amazing. This app sends me messages on things I forget it does , which evidently seems to be everything medically! Thank You so much for creating an app that encompasses everything we need in records, especially, and an app that functions SO smoothly!",
I have a lot of appointments and I really like this app. My whole medical chart is on there.,
The Upgraded MyChart app is improved. The inability to access central scheduling within the app is frustrating. That's all I've found that's lacking. Thanx B,
"Not user friendly in the slightest. Cannot retrieve my password with my data. I can't imagine an elderly person trying to manage their healthcare with this. It gives me a local phone number, but I can't simply highlight and call it... nope... need a pen and paper for that because apparently this is 10,000 BC.",
Always work with a lot of good information,
"I changed phones and went a week without it, and really was lost without it.",
Handy and comprehensive. Following up appointments and monitoring our test results is a breeze. Interfacing with nurses is much easier. Strongly diminishes needs to keep medical records on papers. I love it.,
"Excellent app. 4/5 stars. The one feature that would be great to add to the app would be to be able to view pictures of tests like MRI and others. Edit: After reading the reply by the app rep, they're right that some features are restricted by the health institutions themselves. I figure since a patient is able to see test results like blood tests, why not also images from tests like CT scans or MRI? I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",
Mychart used to be great and I could access all my results. Now it says I have to download it and then I can't see it. If I log in from my PC its different than before but I can see the reports at least. So there really is no point in the app if I have to log in via PC to get what I need. I called the support line and they said it was my doctor but its like that for all my different doctors that have uploaded and for my son as well.,
Wants to be a great app. Falls short. Wish the U would offer ANY other option! After having to verify my identity 3 different ways EVERY time I log in it then only stores some of the info I give. And won't update with CURRENT conditions. Nothing like having to repeat yourself over and over again only to have to repeat yourself yet again in person because it won't update the Drs. DUMB!,
"This app is incredible and it's so easy to use for anyone or anybody that goes to see any doctor, will also link to most hospitals that are using the program EPIC. That way it's easy for the emergency doctors and the primary care physicians to communicate back and forth to one another. I love this app and have saved me so much trouble trying to send a text message to my doctor and then relaying it to my pharmacy.",
"I love the ease of using the app and it is very nice to have test results and appointments recorded. I wish all doctor's offices would use it. It would be handy for them to see what other doctors have said and tested for do I wouldn't have to tell them. Also, it would be nice to have a standard patient information form and releases that the patient fills out once for all physicians, clinics and hospitals.",
Great way to keep track of medical information.,
"This app is extremely helpful in managing most all of your doctors. It's very convenient & user friendly. It's very helpful scheduling appointments , following up with the Dr. or his nurse for after visit questions. Sometimes it's quicker to get a response though the app with your provider than it is to call and await response. You can view all visits that you have ever had including dr's notes. 100% recommended to help navigate any medical info you need.",
"I love this app. It keeps a busy mama like me from forgetting appts! It has all of mine and my children's physician notes, medication list, added and dc'd meds, in one place. Not to mention how convenient the virtual appointments are with my children's specialist that's over 3 hours away from where we live. The fact that I can add all of the specialist/physicians my children and I see to my 1 account and it's organized for easy access, IS A HUGE DEAL! Thank you for creating this awesome app!",
"Great app overall for managing and linking your health information from doctors and clinics using Epic electronic health records. Especially if you receive care from more than one organization. Only issue I had was some minor issues with Biometric log in on my Google Pixel 6a smart phone under Android 13. However, I don't think it is the app itself rather a minor hardware specific issue with the app on my device. Password login works great though.",
Dr Reddy is an excellent physician and he knew immediately what was the issue i was having. He took excellent care of me and the problem has since resolved. Thank you Dr. Reddy.,
"I love it!!! I tend to forget appointments as well as even more important items, this keeps track of EVERYTHING for me, from meds to conversations with my doctor, as well as emergency visits and any visits for other procedures. No more needing to ask myself, ""What did they say again?"", or having to answer ""I don't know"" to my doctor anymore. So convenient.",
"I use my chart for my dad because it is the best in keeping up with his appointments, and medications.. It also help me order his medications, make appointments and communicate with the doctor right from the the app. It's very very easy to use. It helps me to make sure my dad is getting the care he needs and reading about his medical & mental health conditions.. Great app guys keep up the good work.. I thank you guys.",
This is the worst program I have ever tried. You switch the name because you couldn't access your account. Now you are able to access the site except you have to add an unknown hoop to jump thru and it times out before your horseshit program can get number out.,
This app is VERY helpful. It helps me keep track of upcoming appointments in order of a list form. It also reminds me before my appointments. I love being able to email my doctor if I have a problem.,
"I use this app with Cleveland Clinic only, and 95% of my doctors work at Cleveland Clinic. So I can't say anything about using this app with more than one organization, but for my purpose, it works amazingly. All my info is centralized and accessible by all my Cleveland Clinic doctors, so they are always aware of any changes recorded by any other doctor at the clinic. It simply makes sense. I haven't experienced any issues like the ones described by some of the other people in the reviews.",
Wonderful and very helpful medical team. I love them so much and I am so happy for their supervision of my pregnancy,
MyChart works great I'm glad to have it it helps me out a lot to be able to message in the doctors then refill my prescriptions easy I would recommend this to everybody I know ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥,
"This app is excellent. It allows me to keep all of my appointments, medical history, medications all in one place. You can even schedule appointments right in the app. For someone like me who has a lot of medical problems it helps keep everything organized.",
I'm not totally sure if this is a real portal app to doctors or if the doctors are too busy to respond or if the app let's them see the responses. The 24-48 hours response time is a complete scam. I gave it 2 stars because it keeps important information with easy access instead of visiting the medical records office or calling for results.,
I have 4 kids and only have 2 of them available for my chart but I do love this app I am able to see test results before the Dr calls about them,
Excellent way to get fast responses to any questions or concerns.,
"I love this app, because it keeps me in the loop with my dr visits and easy to request medication refills. Also I am able to get my test results,as well as get reminders of my appointments and to request appointments. This app is a wonderful app.",
"Always super easy to use. Easy to access. Laid out well so you can find what you need, compare test results, make appointments, talk to your provider/staff...it's all right here! One of my favorite apps for sure.",
"I love the ability to ask the provider questions and then they can respond when able. More convenient and better communication for everyone. Plus it's great to be able to pull up info on the go from my ph. All my records are in 1 place, going back to 2015!! LOVE MyChart",
"Great to have all your medical information in one place and easily accessible. I love the ability to message my Dr's. with questions, easy to access medications list, pay my bills and reminders to schedule appts, get vaccinations or have tests done.",
"My Chart is a great way to keep track of most everything related to Dr visits, testing, prescription refills, etc. Even better when the provider responds to questions in the app. I just spent 20 minutes returning a phone call that was unnessesary because all the info was already in MyChart.",
"Honestly, MyChart is one of my favorite apps I have on my phone. It gives me peace of mind. I can can get results without having to call, schedule appointments, or even have a virtual appointment when needed. My ultimate favorite! Thank you Epic for this app.",
"I love MyChart! I can keep up with prescriptions, provider notes, make appointments, and pay my bill all in one place!",
"The My Chart app rocks! Super easy to use and helps you, and your healthcare providers to easily communicate. I'm a somewhat technogically challenged senior and I love it!",
It is just great to be able to look at Lab results and ask for refills on line instead of calling,
It is easier to sign in than providers. Has all info needed at all times.,
"UF saved my life with a liver transplant and a stroke during surgery for the 4 months I was there. This app made it incredibly easy and fast to find my labs and scans. Also, most importantly easy access to my transplant team via messages back and forth. This has been crucial for me with my new liver after coming home. Thanks to everyone involved! Lizzy",
"I use mychart for my son, it's a great app, I can make sure he gets everything he needs to get.... I can make appointments and send msges and I get a response in a timely manor.... very happy with this. And will continue to keep using.. the only thing I don't like is that I can't download forms like school notes of anything, witch would be helpful of I could....",
Helps with keeping my medical appointments organized and accessible to all my blood work. Makes sense and so helpful,
"I hate using this app, condtant reminders for vaccinations I that I recently had. You can hide them for a time then they come back. If I don't want a vaccine I don't want it! There is so much garbage I can't find the information I need. My guess is the app promoters promiss to offset the cost of the app service by hounding patients to take vaccines and other services they don't need or want.",
"When I was told I had to meet with my NEW family Dr. This way I was super anxious. The Jefferson health call center was very patient while helping me navigate the app and my first appointment on here. Was nervous to read my own blood work but found it extremely empowering. Super convenient to have my lab test results from the past n present w/ the drs synopsis to refer back to. The ability to ask questions, annual, Healthcare alerts, make or cancel appointments, meds. N more ALL IN 1 PLACE! :)",
"Waste of NHS MONEY, How many apps do we need, already have 2 different NHS apps, and not one of them do what they are ment to do. Why we can't go back to basics and stop complicating things, I don't know.",
"I like how it Centralizes all the medical records and attempts to save time for everyone using e-checkin and stuff. i used it for e-checkin and I was so excited about not filling all the paperwork at doctors but when I went there, they asked to to do that anyway and I wasted even more time using this app. I argued that I cheked in but thry said that different thing and these forms are different which I dont think they were. it failed to serve it's primary purpose.... :(",
"This is one the most easy to use apps regarding your physical and mental health. Schedule appointments, review lab results, summaries after doctor appointments. Awesome awesome awesome.",
Its sure is a helpful app. I enjoy being able see test results and contacting doctor thru the app. Especially when a question comes up and you think about and send it to them right away. Before you forget about it.,
It is very reliable and convenient. It's easy to access it's easy to get answers it's fast and efficient. I'm able to talk to my doctor without having to wait on the phone I'm able to get my questions answered so I don't have to come into the doctor's office. And I always have reminders of everything medicines results I can see everything and it's just amazing to not have to go through a bunch of paperwork to find it. I am very grateful for whoever created the MyChart app! Thank you!,
Absolutely amazing and convenient!,
"This app works well. I can do so much in this app. Make appointments, send messages my doctor directly, request refills, even have a virtual visit with my doctor and best of all I can see my test results. I love the convenience of seeing my medical records all in one area.",
The app is so convenient and so helpful. App is live and current with communicating with nurses and drs,
"I used MyChart for my mother until she passed & I saw the benefits of having her medical information available in one place, plus the ability to contact her doctors, since I was co-caregiver, but worked in another city. So I added my own MyChart & I enjoy it very much because I can upload info, reschedule appointments, ask questions without bothering the staff during busy hours. I will eventually give access to my sons, so as I mature in age so they can be aware of things. It's great!!!",
"I love, love using (MY-CHART), I have Presbyterian, Lovelace and Cleveland Clinic all on My-Chart. I love that my wife can see my messages, and the software is very user friendly for all ages. I love the fact that: 1). I can include pictures, while we message our doctors. 2). I love that I can set appointments on My-Chart. 3). Also, transfering from all the aforesaid hospitals by pressing one button. There, is plenty more to list, but I can assure you will love it. Respectfully, Carlos.",
"This app is AMAZING!! As if going to CHOP when your baby is sick isn't enough on your mind, they have literally made every single other task simple, quick, easy and thorough. I can pay his copay, ask a doctor a question, check in to appts, schedule or cancel appts, send more questions to doctors... you get the hint. As a first time mom of a 9 month old, CHOP has truly eliminated so much more of the ""heavyness"" allowing things to be done, remembered and stored all in this app. Highly recommend.",
E - checkin requires a date from 17 yrars ago. I could just type a 10 char date: 10/01/2005. The app instead requires i select that date from a monthly calendar. To position on the date I have to go back. 17 years. That means click the back carot 204 times to select 10/1/2005.? Well i am 73 yrs old and my thumb cannot click a 1 char button 204 times successfully. So i cannot get past the first question in e-checkin form. Plus 'contact us' button on every does not contact Anybody. Try it.,
"Totally unnecessary and overly complicated, we don't have normal visits to this business and are not part of this group but had a one time special reference. It took days to get the Mychart app & account up to even make an appointment. No one would even talk to us with out the account by the time I figured it all out appointments are a month out.",
Excellent source for medical information,
Everything I need in one place. The app is user-friendly for the most part.,
"I love this app, it's informative and keeps track of all my medical stuff, medications, detailed dr. visits, preventative, and stats. The fact I can text my Dr. and have her text me back in a day or two is great. This is the best thing since sliced bread!",
I love this app! Makes tracking my kids' medical records and appointments so easy.,
I am still learning my way around the app and I find it to be quite easy to use and it is the most helpful and convenient way for me to access all of my medical information and quickly resolve anything that needs to be done and I personally would be extremely lost without it and I will suggest everyone who is a WVU patient to get registered for an account and it's so easy and only takes a couple of minutes and you have everything at your finger tips.,
"App is good and organized. But the idea that someone can get a call from an office saying ""we need to see but can't discuss it over the phone"", but all results including finding out you have cancer are just sent to straight to the patients' view without ever being discussed by a doctor first is gross. The extra level of anxiety caused by self educating because an appointment is days or weeks away should be avoided. This is easy, doctor pushes results AFTER discussing with a patient FIRST!",
"Although the MyChart app offers several conveniences like a list of current meds, setting appointments, since 1990 I am less able to make direct contact with my care team in real time. I used to be able to call and make a request -done. Now, I message the team and wait several days for the answer.",
"Passable. It is nice to be able to send messages and check test results. If a treat or screening isn't properly removed or checked off by medical staff when you attend it, then it stays on your announcements forever. There really needs to be some user agency to be able what to you want.",
It will not let me get into anything. Always says an error has occurred try back later,
"There is no help for this app, used the contact page but no response. The app has my name incorrectly listed, I didn't out it in that way and no way to change it. I know my name but apparently the app thinks it knows better by not letting me update it or providing a way to do that. Not getting insurance denials and medication not available due to this user unfriendly life controlling app.",
"This app needs to be turned into something compatible with a computer. Its a pain in the butt to talk to my doctor through my little phone screen and if that isnt bad enough, the system locks me out every time that i try to log in. I have to recreate a password and the last time that happened i got locked out of my account and my account got deactivated , minutes before my visit with my doctor.",
It's sooo easy to use and I love all of the access to your medical info it gives.,
My appointments and lab are easy to view. Nice to see my appointments and click on past and view notes.,
Easy to use and navigate.,
"I think it's a great way to keep current on your medical situations. The only thing I'd change is to dispute a doctor's notes because my new doctor is trying to make me have illnesses and other things, (i.e. heart problem?) That I've never even had. Otherwise, it's a wonderful tracking system too. Susan Youngs",
Very helpful. Sometimes it's better to ask a non urgent question as it comes up rather than wait until an appointment that might be months away. Besides it can give the doctor more time to answer the question rather than be put on the spot during an appointment. And I wouldn't mind paying a small fee in order to be able to communicate with my doctor thru MyChart.,
"I love being able to have the majority of medical information consolidated, the ability to make / cancel / receive appointment reminders, and to send messages to my primary physician. This app works very well for my current needs.",
"I was hospitalized for over a month this past year with severe kidney damage, extreme blood loss and 4 plugged arteries in my heart and this app was universe sent! I knew my test results before my nurses and it allowed me to give access to my family so that I didn't have to keep repeating things over and over. It also allowed all of the multitude of doctors I had to see what each was doing. Thank you. I would give you 100 stars if I could.",
"MyChart is very sufficient to us that really needs to talk with or possibly see the doctor. With it's up-to-date latest technology you can find information of covid-19, and your very own medical history. I'm loving this app because it helps me to keep up with different doctors appointments and medical history. Thank you MyChart for making life a whole lot easier.",
"I love the fact of the messaging, however, for me, the appointment reminders have not been updating. I feel silly calling around trying to remember which person goes with which place because I'm usually on the go when I'm making the appointments and barely remember to write it down somewhere. Which is my fault. I should not depend on technology. Other than that it's handy for people like me who forget the medications, or have to keep up with 6 people's information.",
"I'm sorry, isn't this supposed to actually DO SOMETHING other than display the provider logo!? Like, I dunno.... Maybe have a login option SOMEWHERE, instead of just a question mark telling me to call customer service for such a basic function? Instead there's nothing. No login, no links, no icons. It's more useless than an old fashioned paper business card.",
"I have trouble making phone calls and talking with people due to being autistic and this app makes it so that I can contact my doctors directly through the app if I have questions or need to set up an appointment! It also gives you access to your visit summary and notes that they have about each visit. If you had a test the results are uploaded and you can see the stats taken from your visit such as weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and more! I can't say how much I enjoy the features <3",
"No better Ambien than the loading times for MyChart. Just on my attempt to sign up for an account on my care provider, I ended getting some very nice rest from waiting an eternity for what was a futile attempt in the first place. When I woke up after my second nap (no exaggeration) I was left on the same blank screen from my first attempt. Unable to sign up for an account but Atleast this app is getting me some nice rest.",
"Good app,easy to install, all medical reports in one place,easy to download and print for your own records. Only downside is that my PET scan reports are not visible before 2022, which makes my paper trail incomplete",
"App won't load & only shows it's ""waiting for verification "" to continue installing. Not the 1st time I've had problems w/app. Then it was ""updated"" so doing nothing but ""waiting for verification"" again & that was 25 minutes ago. I had already called the helpline & following their instructions & still won't load. Now I have to notify my doctor's office to report.",
Over all very disappointed It keeps reminding me of appointments I need to do or tests I need to get done for doctors that I don't see. They even say expired but all I can do is pause it for 1 mo or so. This app is soo really frustrating to use and only good to see test results.,
"Terrible. Not as advertised. I get all my care at Boston Medical Center. Can't get access to non-lab test results like MRI, X-Ray, etc. Doctors/Staff are TOO SLOW to update test results, diagnoses. Can't schedule, change, or cancel appointments with the app. Many of the glowing positive reviews for this app are obviously fake or from paid reviewers. Epic just sucks.",
"We have an HP Windows 7 laptop and prefer to use it whenever necessary as it is more convenient for us older population then the phones. We are not PHONE HOLDERS as most of the population. There is no way to download this app to anything other then Apple I phones or, like ours, Android phones. We did have to download to our Androids because of physician visits scheduled and had to attend. Updates need to be made for all accessible laptop and desktop computers with cameras.",
"It helps me with my appointments through reminders. I can share info with doctors who aren't in the system. It is a great tool. I really wish there was a way to connect to the other doctor's systems, who do not report via MyChart. It would be beneficial for patients.",
My chart is a very helpful app when getting information from my doctor. It is very inclusive with information that I'm interested in. The one issue I have is the doctor's office sends me messages and I sent a message back and thought it was going directly to my doctor's office when in fact it went to a or their main office and they responded with basically not having any idea what I was talking about. I asked that you update the app so I can send a message directly to my doctor's office. Thanks.,
Very Usefull App for My Marsden - Results & Future Appointments.How can I download the App for my Laptop..Can i have the app on both devices..? H,
"All my medical information in one place. Being able to sit down and read through all my medical results is a plus. I am able to understand stuu about my body much better. Usually after leaving the doctor's office I forgot everything he/she said, but now I have somewhere to go back to if I get confused about my condition. Thank you for giving patients this gateway to assist in their well-being.",
Is very helpful and fast response.,
"I can log into TriHealth, but I am unable to login to Premiere Health on my tablet. I cannot use the app on my phone.",
I HATE this. Much rather have the personal interaction!,
Best ever. You can check what you forgot about your appointment and what there Dr said about you. Love this. My Chart.,
"Great app to keep up with all 4 of my kids and my doctor's appointments. It's also easy to send messages to the doctor's/nurses to ask questions, they usually get back to me within 24hrs. Also great to be able to cancel or reschedule appointments on here as well, you don't have to call and wait. After visit summaries are available to view. Tests and any lab work are posted when ready.",
"My 87 year old Mom was rushed to a hospital where her doctors did not have privileges. I had downloaded MyChart with her information so that I could keep track of her appointments, Etc. It was such a blessing to be able to show new doctors her previous test results, lab results plus her list of medications. I highly recommend this app.",
Don't really know what you want me to say. It's an average medical app that functions.,
"With this app, I can set up a televised video conference with my doctor. I can schedule available appointments, save appointment info to my calendar, and request refills. Your entire medical charts are right at your fingertips. That way doctors at other facilities can view my medical info (x-rays, MRI readings, surgical, vaccinations, and my allergies. The future is now!",
"Such a great app for families! You can create an account for yourself, other caregivers, even your teen! It's user friendly, efficient... You can echeck in and turn on location so they know when you have arrived. You can manage bills, get access to medical information, ask questions... Plus you get lab results and notifications faster than hospital staff can even alert you. It's amazing 🤩 Thank you!!",
"Looks to have a lot of functionality, but in my case there's hardly any information contained within it. Edit: developer kindly got in touch so I've altered my rating to 4 stars. Looks like it has a lot of potential.",
"I hate this app!!! One point because there is no lesser option. Really...-10! Often, inaccurate, is cumbersome to use, and replicates misinformation which is passed on to other providers! NO WAY TO CORRECT ERRORS! TThere are far too many issues to list! People should NOT be forced to use it because of inept administrators! Surely, there is a better app somewhere!",
"I absolutely love mychart. I can communicate with all my doctors without calling them. I can ask for refill of my medications with no problem. I can make & cancel my appointments. There is so many benefits from mychart, the list goes on and on. Believe me, you won't regret downloading this app.",
"This app is unusable. Literally every time I try and use the app the server connection times out. Regardless of how I am connected to the internet, I have always been unable to view estimates, fill out questionnaires or review doctor's notes.",
So much more convenient than calling and being placed on hold and waiting and then not being able to get an answer. And great resource to go back and look at past visits to see if you had all your vaccines and I just love using the app really has everything I need.,
"Pros: -Can look up appointment info, cancel or confirm appointment, and do a full check in before you arrive. - Prescribed medication list available. - Test results are uploaded quickly and easy to read; they include info on normal range, etc. Your doctor can message regarding the results and treatment plans. -Can easily message your doctor with questions regarding prescriptions, treatment, future appointments, etc. Cons: -Way too many emails; needs an easy way to update email settings.",
Was getting an error message. Couldn't read messages from my doc or reply. I uninstalled and reinstalled and I was able to see and reply. Now today I can't even open anything again. I tried to log in on a computer and it still doesn't work. I uninstalled again and it didn't fix the problem. Please fix this issue.,
I love the MyChart app. It's best way for me to stay in contact with my position and my health care system so I don't have to wait on phone calls or be put on hold when I know that somebody's too busy to stop what they're doing to talk on the phone and I'm always responded to promptly and within a reasonable amount of time. I thank you. Ever created the app system and I appreciate it. John from speedway Indiana,
Great! It's very convenient to use especially if you go to a doctor that is out of network or if you are in an ER that is not part of the Orlando Regional Network. They are able to get their answers right away instead of waiting for return phone calls which makes it that much easier/quicker to diagnose and treat you.,
"Ithink the app is great. My only concern is that it isnt able to be accessed by other dr and staff at all. I think you should have a guest dr area to show them test results, get medication info on a patient and of course, be able to download any new images or info so it is more colabritive. Also, when i say i dont want to be reminded of my say, mamogram, please dont. It gets anoying seeing it every day.",
"Very convenient to have medical records and care info available at my fingertips in one place. It can be confusing at times to find things, but overall a good app.",
MyChart is completely useless to me here in 1st weekend of Oct 2021. I need to find and schedule booster shot. All I get from MyChart is a server error message. I have been trying for several days. Unbelievable that you people cannot maintain a functioning online system doing what MyChart is supposed to do. If I can find a way to choose another healthcare system I will do so and encourage everyone I know to do the same,
So nice to be able to see test results on line and send msgs,
"Love the fact that I have a secure, non intrusive access to my doctor w/o going thru the infernal experience of calling them for a question that matters to me, even though it might be simple. I can remember visits, meds, upcoming tests and my questions are answered some times within hours! There are no ads.",
This is awesome. Easy to use and very helpful in many ways. Called to change appointment. Left a message to change it and it was done the next day. I justed checked my chart and the new appointment was on there. Keep up the good work,
I'm very unorganized individual and always forget my appointments this app helps with thinhs line that so I like it,
Only issue I've experienced was when it came to a my chart visit with any doctor. It always tells me an error has occured. I will turn my phone off and try again but it still happens. Plus when you sign in you they always send you a secure number despite having the correct password,
Now I have much better communication with all my doctor's and that's priceless! Information & reminders for screening & tests that are routine is no longer an issue! Had you had this level of communication between doctors then I would not have gotten upset with the repeatitive questions and being treated like a new patient on every visit. So now you've addressed this why not unblock me from seeing your general doctors? That is why I got so upset. I don't see how that's my fault! Unblock me! SMH!,
It's amazing how they connect your records from all these years so u can see the changes in your health. It's hard to connect with other records though which is frustrating,
Just fine easy to easy to use.,
"I think this is a great tool to have to keep up with all my health issues I have. It's great, in between, knowledge of issues going on for me to know and also for my Dr's to see too. I can without going always into Dr's ofc for questions..I can message Dr's on here. Good communication tool. Also can do my meds to refill, get checked in ahead of appts and make appts...I can see my test results even. It's been great help with multiple health problems. Thanks.",
"I can't leave ""0""!! This app is terrible. I'm trying to view my test results and it keeps taking me in circles. This app is a TOTAL waste of time. Can't get my test results because of this junk app. I'll schedule an appt with my physician. How do you provide testing, have everyone download the app...but the app doesn't work? Genius CVS....amazing!!",
"Mychart is the worst thing to happen to medicine since opioids. We go to the doctor and they tell us everything is fine, then we look at mychart and everything is flagged, coded abnormal, or worse shown as something potentially deadly with absolutely no context. Did something new pop up? Were we lied to? If the doctor just wants to keep an eye on something but isn't concerned now, why are we seeing our baby has microcephaly online? There needs to be a way to provide more context.",
Very easy and convenient,
This app is okay however it needs streamlining..It saves unimportant things that need deletion..You cant send all formats..limited files..asks for history updates every use** and is a time hog..Scheduling for Telemed calls is bugged...Requires second app zoom...etc System does not allow for proper adding of history always..Also does not allow for history outside of Atlantic Health ..,
Very convenient and easy to navigate and use. It comes in handy. I use it to easily add my appointments to my Google calendar and to schedule appointments and refill prescriptions. It's great!,
Unable to open messages,
"Usually will need to go all the way back to the main menu, which is tedious. Should be able to go back to the previous screen and start from there. When reading a response to a message I sent to a provider, the only option giving is an x in the upper right hand corner and clicking on the x brings you all the way back to the main menu, it doesn't bring you back to the previous screen, which is the screen with all of your messages.",
Changes in software have led to decreased reliability and function. It used to be great and has really gone down hill; frustrating not only patients but doctors.,
"This app is an awesome way for me to keep in touch with my doctors, medications and appointments. I have several doctors that are all in the same network and this app helps me reach all of them in one place. If you have a doctor who is not in the network the app also lets them see medical info that they may need on you by using a link. I LOVE THIS APP!!!",
The app changes to much. There are always new additions and changes before the app has even been fixed. Leave it alone until all the bugs are fixed in the version being used.,
"Why isn't the test results able to graph with previous test results so you can easily see changes! It's basic but not totally updated only what Fran sees! Immunization is example of incomplete data! Flu shots, covid shoot ect... E the incomplete history!",
Very convenient and easy to use,
"I can't even log in. Email notification ""you have an important notification"" Server error. ""Please type the security code"" Server error. Refresh the app to try again Server error, Server error, server error. If you're going to make me go though an app for my medical services would it kill you to make the app function? I've seen more stable programs by 5th graders using Scratch.",
"The mychart app works great for me. I view my labwork and upcoming appointments, even request refills of medications. My only problem is when it asks if the recommended treatment is working, the only choices are yes or no. Often the recommended treatment has been denied by insurance or not happened yet. I worry that my caregivers are evaluated on my responses, so just no would not be fair.",
I love being able to get my test results and being able to read and send messages to my doctor or the nurse. It shows my upcoming schedule appointments. I love my chart!!!!! I could go on and on. I can get a link to video chat with my doctor. Which is called a virtual visit. Give it a try!!!!! All your lab work is stored in my chart so u can compare lab work.,
"This technology is great. I don't have to try and recall every issue discussed at appointments. And what to be done, other referrals, numbers, etc. All. Appear here in a nice, concise package. Thank you.",
"It just works. Super handy to see all kinds of my test show up here. Bloodwork, PCRs, and more just appears. Sometimes I need to visit the website to view certain results, but that's uncommon.",
App was working great then out of nowhere it asked for my password to login. I use biometrics and it won't allow me to until I resign back in... I don't remember my password so I have been trying to reset that and now its saying an email will be sent to me bur for like 2 weeks straight I can not get an email to reset my password. So I am now locked out. Stupid....,
"Keep you very informed on issues of your health. The time and effort they put into getting back to you on results from tests, lab work and medicine.",
"It's a pretty decent app for the patient. The service on the medicinal side needs work it's like the company that fail in so they slap a ""Business"" label and up-charge the the business client. You need to make the side easier (don't lie, I seen it at work) if the doctor came properly use it then they won't use it and I have medical professionals that won't message me because how tedious it the system is on their end.",
"Great an informative App!! All your medical information,test results,message your Doctor's...EVERYTHNG!!",
I have a medically complex child who has dr's across two different hospital systems with all his lab work being done in another hospital system. This app is essential in keeping all the information together and linked. Lab results post usually within the hour. We have had 2 hospitalizations while using my chart and updates to his chart post to me immediately. I have all of his dr's in my pocket at all times with the messaging system. I'll never not use this app.,
Very convenient with appointments reminders,
Quick and convenient to use.,
"Fantastic app. I can communicate with my doctor, set up appointments, get prescription refills, ask questions and get timely answers, and importantly, review my own records and lab results the minute they become available. I can even ask questions about what I don't understand regarding the results and my doctor can respond. It's just so much easier than phoning and waiting for a callback. And there are no ads.",
Very useful and it's a blessing to have an app for people serious about their health. Wish that personalization was easier. Can't change profile pic.,
I would appreciate if the test results were in a sliding scale where it shows what that particular test results normal levels... I also go to MA general and thier results are shown in that fashion and so much easier to read and understand,
Easy to use and get information I need or want. Makes check in time quicker. Great App,
"I just downloaded, put in my username and password for UTSW, and keep getting a message that there's a newer version, must update before using! There's NO UPDATE! I just installed it 5 minutes ago! I have a Dr appt soon. I NEED this app for the appt. I'm in quarantine for COVID! I can't go to the office! However, I am uninstalling this app before I even got to use it! Very frustrating!",
"Probably half the time various functions fail, e.g., messaging or appointments.",
"It's very easy to use. Like being able to see all medications, phones numbers etc. As well, being able to message the clinic/doctor directly for non-emergency questions.",
Great to keep track of medical info.,
"My chart for me has worked very well. It's very informative about your doctor visits, medications et. Great for Contacting your doctor through My Charts messaging center and also making appointments with your doctor much easier and quicker than by phone, access to test results etc etc etc Great features altogether..love MyChart!",
"I Love being able to participate in my care in real time and I can read the reports of all my labs, xrays, office visits , operative and path reports. I can message my MD/staff and always have a response with in 24 hours. No being put on hold. I can make my own appointments with my GP and request med refills with a tap of the screen. This is the best app for patients.",
This app has made navigating medical issues and communicating with my doctors so much easier and less stressful. I also can easily pay medical bills through the app. Saves a lot of stress and time!,
"Not easy to use....tells me I need to update my information, which I do everytime I get on the app, and it never goes away. Also can't sync anything, just won't let me. Says can't sync now....just not a good app. Good idea, poor execution.",
"They have billed me several times and foolishly I paid because they threatened me if I didn't pay a large amount of money each month and in the long run they found out that the charges were false and they did return my money, but I do not trust these guys, they charged several different times needlessly and caused me so much stress to get my money back. They don't even warn you when you owe money just tell you when you're late and probably ruin your credit",
"Great app, makes you feel more connected with the health care provider. However in the age of Full HD mobile video a 4Mb file limit is a real constraint when sharing information with a consultant. Patients should not need to know how to edit, downscale etc to send a few seconds of video. Please work to remove this barrier.",
I love the easy connection with the doctors and teams and seing and downloading all my reports 10/10 wish every hospital used this because it life saving if you have an emergency you just go on the app download and email the prior report to the doctor you are at or hospital,
"Timely responses to messages sent regarding prescriptions, appointments, and general medical information.",
"I love having all my health info in one accessible, easy to use app. I wish all healthcare networks in my area used MyChart, as os so in many metropolitan areas. Then if I visit an out-of-network provider, I and all my providers will have easy access to the visit notes and results.",
"MyChart gives me a clear and concise picture of my health history. I can access lab results, keep track of appts, view visit notes, message my doctor, request refills, and see billing info. I wish my PCP group was connected to MyChart for a more comprehensive medical record. COPC uses another system that I have never been able to use.",
"I love being able to contact my physicians so easily for non urgent medical questions. I love having easy access to my test results and after visit notes, and I love getting notifications about upcoming appointments so I can put them on my calendar. This really is a great app!!!",
Very positive. Like having records. Like communicating with providers.,
"Love the convience of seeing my appointments new and past. Seeing my visit results. As well as billing. Present and past statements. I also am able to leave a question or comment, and a response is made in a timely manner. Oh yes, and the ability to see multiple medical facilities in one location. Thank you MY CHART companies.",
"What is the point of this app if it takes you online anyways? Difficult to naviagte and I am not illiterate when it comes to technology. Trying to reset p.w./username is useless, doesnt send anything. Eventhough I am registered with them. They pretty much force you to use this app and if you cant login or not tech savvy oh well. Need online help, called and no one is there for phone support? Well if its on the phone you can work from anywhere",
No ads! Wonderful streamlined with your medical records for smooth transitioning to new hospital and doctors,
"Really nice app for all health needs including prescriptions, scheduling, billing. Of course, the doctor's office staff need to be responsive and in a timely manner. St Elizabeth Physicians have been nothing but great to me! Very recommended!",
"Simple, however a very effective app to communicate with the setting of appts, procedures or just communicating with my Dr. and staff. I have to remind my wife bc we are old school that the My Chart app is available 24/7 and that it receives a quicker response to issues or questions rather than using the telephone process.",
"Updates reset my settings, ughh!! I am ok with updates, I am not ok with having to reset the fingerprint login. This is not a daily app I use, I just want it to work when I do use it, once a month or every other month.",
Fingerprint login no longer works. When I click schedule appointment the timer just goes forever before finally saying there is a server time out and I can never actually get to the page to make an appointment. I was also unable to reply to a message my physical therapist sent me.,
I like being able to get results of bloodwork without needing to wait for appointment. reminders for upcoming appointments helpful. list of meds taken very handy when seeing a new doctor or specialist. great app experience.,
Great. Easy to navigate to any alerts. Or information.,
"It would be very beneficial to make it an option to schedule an appointment with a doctor you've already seen. Why have a list at the top of the page of doctors as ""your team"" just to send an email, but have to go through way too much to schedule an appointment? Looking through the list of doctors and locations is very annoying when I want to see the same doctor at the same location!",
"User interface is great and it makes communication easy. However, messages disappear within days after they're viewed so it's not a good place to keep track of Health conversations.",
Set up was a breeze but unable to complete video call with provider due to camera and microphone not able to link. Even when all permissions were granted to the app. Waste of my time and my care provider.,
"It was a great app until it stopped working. Keep getting ""unable to connect to server"" message. Update: I was able to use it for a day and a half...then it stopped AGAIN! Consider this a zero star review.",
I have tried numerous times to download without success I get a red file with a black heart. Your inept it couldn't fix the problem. Only yell scream and became frustrated. After this experience with your support I will never use them again.,
"This app is great when all the providers use it. However, lately they don't seem to be using it.",
"not a bad app, but needs a lot of work, specifically the import of or export to other apps like help the inclusion of x-ray images and MRI results Include record of conversation or communication with drs , there is no way to find if a dr got my notes or to find what replies they did, or to find a record of inquiries sent. I cant always make appointments, they refer to a phone number on ridiculous phone systems. they always suggest local help, but invariably local help is clueless on what to do",
"Great app once it's set up, but that process is not straightforward. Particularly for families, there should be a function to add children into an existing account without exchanging a string of emails with a hospital.",
Sucks! Keeps asking me for username and password that worked 5 days ago now seems I have to go in and redo entire setup again. Seems everytime they update this app I have to do this and its super frustrating to setup in first place and I'm I no my way around technology but this is garbage and I'll uninstall and ask my doctors office to notify me by phone or email and I refuse using these My Chart apps because they are to unstable and cumbersome.,
Please fix. I don't know if it's the most recent update or what but I keep getting error messages information won't load its quite annoying. I've tried it with and without Wi-Fi and it's definitely not my phone as I have a 5g phone. Please fix!,
"Every since my OB told me to get this app, it doesn't work for me, at all. I been trying to sign up with each code I been assigned to and still can't get it. It keeps saying information is invalid etc. Because I been having issues with this app for a month now. I think it's time for me to uninstall it.",
"This app is great, when it works. Which is hardly ever. One day I can get on with no problem, the other 30 days of the month I can't get on it at all. Very dissatisfied with the app. The major problem is that this is the way that my health insurance insists on communicating. Get it together or get GHP something that actually works!!",
"Keeps giving errors, try again later, cannot request appointment, billing etc. Reloaded app. And it crashes. Bad app. Trying to access allegheny health network aka AHN. Of pittsburgh pa. Still giving errors. Cannot e check in, view billing, etc. Allegheny health network is my health system. This app sucks.",
"I have a Dell 2 in one that used to identify the MyChart in tablet mode but now, despite a message that it is compatible with my device, I now have to access it through the net. Not nearly as convenient as it was.",
I've uninstalled this app yet again. Any time I try to log in I enter my password it starts to load then closes the app sends me a notification telling me the app keeps closing. I've emailed the developer twice now and still no reply. I don't think I'll be using this app anymore..,
"Works great! I can make/cancel/reschedule appointments. I can request refills for prescriptions, and I can even video call my doctor. I get to see my test results before the doctor tells me. It's very easy to use. All my medical history and current information is available at the touch of a button. Makes life easier.",
"the app used to work great, but for the past month it hasn't let me do anything!! I can't look at my messages, labs or anything. I've tried uninstalling it and installing it again and still doesn't work!",
Not liking the new format.The light appearance of the text is difficult to read. Is there a way to darken the print? (i.e. more contrast) After looking more around this app I really do not like it at all! How can I change back to the previous app?,
I haven't been able to access my chart for over a week now. Keeps saying error. It's hard to get messages from & to your doctor during this coronavirus out break. Please fix. I even uninstalled & re-installed still doesn't work!!,
"The app constantly gives a ""server error"" message no matter what module I try to use. I cannot confirm my contact info within the app nor clear messages. I can't make appointments with it. It needs a lot of improvement.",
Love being able to send and receive any messages. Like paperless billing and being able to see all my labs and test results. Ads are always an aggravation...don't believe we need them here. It is so EASY to use! Thank you KU!,
"I liked the old version. Recently mine and my husbands billing amounts keep changing ramdomly. They don't match lexington hospital and thier provider's bill account balances. For examples: 1 of my hospital bance has been paid off within last 30 days but it shows I owe over $2,000 and now late. My husband has recently had surgery at Lexington Hospital. We just set up payment arrangments combining 4 of the physican billings from it within 4 days ago. His balance kept lowering no balance ramdomly.",
"The MyChart app has been fairly easy to use. I am able to request appts, refills on medications and send messages within seconds. I prefer using the app over calling bc there's is no hold time. No complaints, I haven't had any issues so far.",
Great to keep up with your doctors and appointments and testes,
"All of a sudden, on August 1, 2020, the app stopped working. I get emails from the hospital telling me to check new test results and I can't access them. I've sent an email, and now I wait, hopefully for some resolution Very disappointing.",
"It's a good app for sure, I am waiting for more options to choose from with providers. I'm sure that will be along soon. Its nice especially to be able to have everything in one spot! Taking care of family members in the near future will absolutely be made easier by this app.",
"I like the app, but think I used to be able to use my finger/touch instead of typing passwords etc., and now that is gone. Would like to be able to go back to that, as is easier and as secure.",
I HATE this app. The developers decided they won't support desktops for video calls. I have no idea who came up with this brilliant idea but it would be nice to have an option. If you can teleconference with your doctor in another way do it. The interface is ridiculous. What kind of moron would design an app compatible ONLY on mobile devices and not allow it to run on a desktop? AVOID IF YOU CAN!,
"Can't read a letter because words get cut off on the right and you cannot scroll. Also said that I have a to do, but nothing is there. Wasted an hour in the phone trying to determine what I need to schedule, a etc because the app has flaws. Don't push the app when it's this buggy!",
"I love having my medical and insurance information at the tips of my fingers. This is an excellent app. Everyone should be using it. You can schedule, cancel appointments, ask you doctor things, refill medications needed and review doctor visits and test results right away for piece of mind.",
Only bad thing is through my chart you can't and it doesn't allow you to choose whatever campus you want to use or make appointments at,
"There's no way to get back to the main screen (unless it is extremely well hidden) once you enter an area. My phone has no back button, which makes this app pretty useless. I have to go to the website instead.",
All of the nursing staff and Doctors were wonderful I couldn't ask for better support then what we received. Thank You for all your help and support that you all gave my grandson.,
Smooth and easy to use. Love it,
"On March 10 I sent a request for help with the app. I would get a error message, 'unable to contact servers'. My Chart requested the name of the medical group I was trying to contact. That was forwarded. I was told that IT from my medical group would contact me for resolution. Here it is April 3 a d I have heard nothing a d still get the same error message. With Covid-19 basically freezing the country, using an app to communicate would seem prudent. Guess NOT.",
"Until a few days ago I could graph my test results so I could look at trends over time. This is an invaluable tool. If it is broke, fix it. If you removed it, PUT IT BACK! Without this tool, the data is a lot less useful to me.",
Far too much useless info which no-one needs while info which IS needed is very difficult to find. Changes to arrangements made without warning or notification. A nightmare of tech-driven complexity without consideration of ordinary people forced to use it . Robin Whitby,
Very easy to use and convenient.,
I have tried down loading this app 6 times and it gets stuck on the add organization screen and it won't let you go anywhere. So all you have is a blank white screen. I tried to get it to work over a 8 month period.,
Worst app ever! Especially because it's being forced to use. Asking for your login doesn't result in an email (as promissed) but as soon as you login more then 4 times you're blocked without warning and you receive an email about it. To resolve you need to go to the hospital to regain access. Bank apps or visa apps use fingerprints or send your info to your house. This app really is a disgrace!,
"Excellent, keeps my records, appointments, medications, immunizations, appointment notes, everything medical - in one tidy and organized place. I can order refills, get test results, pay bills, communicate with my medical professionals and access it all for my whole family accross all the hospitals we have used in one place. Pretty darn perfect! Thanks devs! 👍",
I like having the ability to address specific concerns and receive prompt responses. Their quick responces have been helpful to me. I especially enjoy the ability to renew medications on line. I like being able to review test and lab results at a slower pace than an office visit allows. That allows me to take in what I have learned at my own pace. I can ask specific questions about my labs or other test results and feel confident in the answers I receive.,
"The ONLY problem I see is, often, there is nowhere to click to go fwd, home or back to get out of (as an example) a test result. I will immediately move review to 5☆ once I see solution happen Amazing, either way! Great app! (I, too, do dev/des work)",
I tried to do video appointment but I kept getting a message saying my data connection was interrupted when I had LTE/data connection. It would do this a few minutes after clicking begin visit. I use a Samsung Galaxy S9+.,
"I can’t login using my Mobile App. The error message says that my User Name Password combination is invalid, but it works on my PC. By resetting PW, I can use either the PC or cell but not both with the same PW. Does anyone else have this type of issue??? Update: just logged in on my cellphone using Edge Browser. App still doesn't work.",
"I hate apps. Everyone wants you to download their apps. It's alright, but nothing is ever updated. When I try to update something, it always goes back to where it was. The people associated with the Reading Hospital never update or keep it organized either. It's just another pain in my butt.",
"The inconvenience is beyond annoying cannot log in. All things are correct and I even uninstalled and reinstalled, I even changed password and still same message. This is on your end it keeps saying cannot connect to server and to try again later, it's been over 24hours and still no change. Please get this fixed asap, I need to be able to log on here and speak with doctor asap.",
Great reminders of needed tests and vaccinations and upcoming appointments. Great for looking up history of test results and reason for doctors visits. Test results show on scale with colors for normal area. Only wish is for a graph of a particular test like triglycerides over the years.,
"This makes keeping track of appointments and meds for me and my children in one place so that I can quickly pull up information when at appointments. I love this app. Now with COVID I don't have to carry my card because it also also you to create a digital card with a QR code as well, which is great for traveling.",
"Great way to communicate with Dr's and keep medical information organized. The only bad thing is it is constantly sending messages. I get 3 or 4 messages a day about the same appointment, it gets annoying signing in and there's nothing new in there",
"Unable to login At first I was using the Hope virtual app, it works perfectly there. However when I received the update to this app, I can never login no matter how many times I tried, even after with the recreate password.",
"One of my favorite apps,saves so much time,everything at your finger tip.Has saved me so much time knowing when you have appts. Settings up appts ,getting scripts &tests setup. Everyone you talk too is so willing to assist. Can't say enough about this site.",
"Extremely difficult to navigate. Very busy, location of important information not centrally located. You have to hunt and dig. I especially don't like that labs from outside providers can't be pulled in for my chart physicians to see.",
"I was told this app was the ONLY way to get my results, and I would have them within 5 or 6 hours. It has been 4 days, and nothing. All I needed or wanted was my results emailed to me. Not to download an unnecessary app, that doesn't deliver a simple test result.",
"Update Dec 2022 I have successfully downloaded the app and managed to log in. I have set up z pin. I like both the app and browser versions although I have issues with the way the software programmes are written in how blood results are released and I have to wonder if parienrs were involved in the design brief and if not, why not?",
"I like having all my test results available on it, and ordering medication is easy.",
I like the easy access to my health information. It's right at my fingertips if I need to retrieve a particular medication or recall an appointment date. Another nice feature is adding it to your calendar. Easy to use.,
Best app ever. All your health information in one place.,
"Love this app, only thing different I want is the ability to view actual EKG, and other imaging such as MRI, CT and X-rays via the app. Other than that, this app is incredibly useful for getting results.",
So frustrating im trying to get into my app and it keep saying can't connect to site or I get a blank page. Been trying for the pay 4 days. An email is received but no sign in option. This was a good app but now it's totally nonfunctional! Please fix,
"The opportunity to message your care team without hours on hold with a phone call. All of your appointments, your medical records and prescription list at your finger tips. You can even request refills. It is one of the best apps on my phone, hands down.",
"Easy to update and best tool to access easily my medical records, easy to request refill for my medications.",
Love how easy it is to navigate through the app and see your own lab results,
Easy to use. Two way communication with Drs. Keeps track of test results and upcoming appointments.,
"Exceptional app that allows many things to be done with appointments, medications, questions.",
Everyone is professional and expedite their service to me. Keep up the great work 👍🏾,
Love the MyChart app! Helps keep appointments and messages straight! A blessing!,
"Hard to log in. Keeps saying error. Wont go to any of features like echeck in, messages",
"I like this app. because ever since I downloaded it, I have been able to stay in touch with my doctor a lot easier than ever.",
It's very convenient for me to know when my appointments are and who with and also my tests results and I love it thanks for giving me peace of mind,
Great app. Saves a lot of phone calls and you can keep track of your health history,
"I went from never needing to see a doctor to needing to see all of them. This makes it super easy to get test results, add appts to my calendar, send messages to my medical team, schedule appts...next to making sure all of my doctors are in the same network this makes having an incurable, hereditary disease much less stressful.",
At first it seemed difficult to established an account but after persevering I finally did and everything works good now!,
It take me two times to log in it doesn't fo it the first time I have yo fo it again before I'm able to get into mychart,
I love this app it's so easy to get the care I need with out need to go into a doctor office all the time.,
Best app to keep up with everything your doctor's appointment your medications I would be lost without this app,
I simply love the convenience of being able to access all of my medical history and information with my cell phone.,
Pretty much useless I have letters and messages but can't open or read them so what's the point? I have found nothing to make me want to reccomend this to anyone else,
This app is very impersonal and it takes some offices over a week to respond and then others don't respond at all!,
Great and effective way to keep in touch with your doctors and receive advice or help aboutyour health/medications.,
"App always hangs. Specifically, no way to return from any submenu",
Great! Very easy to use and contact anyone if need! Used it for my son now and myself when I was pregnant,
"Easy access to my medical information, appointments, and billing.",
As described! Has everything I need to see or do with my health! Present & past. I love this app.,
"App works great and you can view test results, communicate with doctor offices, etc.",
I love all information you can see also I love the message feature you can ask questions. Very helpful,
Excellent way to stay on top of all your medical needs and records!,
"Every time I log in, I have to reset my password. Every time, which is becoming a pain.",
Can add or drlete meds as they change easily. Check in before visit is easy and saves time during visit. Your doctor visits are included both up-coming and past visits. Can contact office by email if you have any questions about your care!,
It's a wonderful app. U can message u doctor. Make appointments and u can even cancel them to .,
"It would be nice if the app had a ""search"" function in the Test Results.",
So easy and friendly to use. Better than the telephone!,
Messages won't open most of the time unless I am at the clinic. Very frustrating,
The app doesn't work half the time. It always say error try again later.,
It helps to have all medical records in one please and it is real easy to use,
"I really appreciate and enjoy this app. I'm a retired nurse, and it's nice to still be able to see what I need and other doctors' needs. Thank you very much 😊 bless you 🙏",

Great!!app.I enjoy using this to see all my medical records and doctors I have seen over time . 👍,
Love this. Great way to find your info and to keep in touch with your Doctor.,
I do not like electronic records of health or finances. Too easy to hack.,
A great idea but it can be slow and at times crash,
Having the option to use MyChart is a great tool for patients. I love it ❤️,
"This App is fantastic, easy-to-navigate through lots of information contact doctors easily and schedule appointments 2023",
Find it easy to use. Nice to see I can access past records when needed.,
Adding a patient (your child) to your file should not be this hard and it should be one log in for all accounts.,

You can update all of your personal history information, medications, allergies, & update your personal preferences like emergency contacts and family history. It's very secure & is a one stop place for most hospitals and Dr's offices so they can see everything, you can see almost everything (some of their notes) in 1 place!",
love using the MyChart app to access my health care information! It is excellent!,
Getting much better! The ability to use this app with finesse is steadily improving!,

I love my chart! Easy to use and very efficient!,
"I said it would be nice if patients could leave notes about nurses, surgeons, doctors,etc. A lot of them lie or omitt. To whomever answered back, are you sure you're not a doctor. Of course I can get in touch with them! It was better when everyone in the office couldn't see all your messages. That was on the last update. Even the kids at the desk can see.",

This My Chart app is a very patient friendly approach to medical care. I honestly do not know how I got by with out it.",
"This is a good app and it would get 5 stars, but it has a major major problem it doesn't allow you to print. Most apps even my banking app allows me to print my statements, but not MyChart powered by Epic. Like most people nowadays I've stopped using a desktop computer I conduct all my online business with my tablet or smartphone. Epic needs to add the ability to print. You can't even download letters or statements so they can be printed using Google Docs.",
"It provides so much more than just a ""medical app"", spewing out typically generic lines to help stupid individuals self-diagnose. This app does none of that. This keeps you personally in touch with the doctor and all their professional staff. From test results, medical procedures, vital medications and personal interactions. With the aid of this app, it has not just made our doctor visits more productive, it has made our doctor a member of our family.",
"I like the friendly way to review tests and upcoming appts, also the ease of making appointments.",
Good to schedule appointments and stuff.,
"It was fine until the recent update added a goal section. This goal was news to me. While it might be my doctors goal, it is not mine. Are you, not my doctor, pulling information off of a database and assuming it should be a goal of mine? Where are these goals coming from? Why can't I delete, correct, or add to this section? It's supposed to be MY goals afterall.",
"I'm unable to access my bill most of the time; if I click on 'View Details' or try to load my billing summary, I'm met with a spinner for about 10 seconds. Then, I receive a message about a server error occurring.",
"Easy to use, informative, and an easy way to communicate with my doctor and his nurse in non-emergency situations.",
"App is good for contacting some doctors, others don't bother to check it. Love the test results being entered quickly. Wish it would update properly for vaccines so it would get rid of the notices for vaccines I have already done. App needs serious updating so it tracks things better such as vaccines, prescriptions, test results, and allows for blood glucose readings to be imported for doctor's review.",
#1- Never worked to save my information nor did it allow me back in despite my using the right credentials. Disappointed and deleted. #2- No need for me to respond to developers as I only installed this to get in line for the Covid vaccine(s). Was able to schedule this on my own. So no thank you. As a retired IT professional I stand by my initial review.,
"If someone from the development team reads this, could you please explain how to set up the fingerprint login with a Samsung phone? Usually apps automatically do this with Samsung pass but I can't figure this out. Thank you! *Edit: Thank you for your response! I have it set up now.",
"Very easy to use, very user friendly and makes life easier. I remember to schedule appointments well after business hours and its so convenient to be able to schedule through the app.",
"Access is everything....I recently found out the hard way. I specifically look for services that use MyCart, because when you move, you can link records from your past providers. Recently had a life threatening incident and the previous providers didn't use MyChart, it was not obvious to the ER, what my pathology was. No MyChart, not interested...",
It's magical I was hospitalized and had access to all my tests immediately.,
Frustrating😡😡😡. Everytime I try to go make a payment it's telling me there was an error. I don't get it. What's the point of doing updates if it still doesn't work. It shouldn't matter what system your trying to log into it should just work. I like the convenience of not having to go to my Dr office & pay my bill when I have the option here. I might as well uninstall & continue to just call the 800 number on the bill. I installed it because the office suggested it. Fix it please,
All your medical information in one place and easy for you to view test results and communicate with your Dr./health care staff. You can also refill your prescriptions via the app. So much you can do from one single app! I personally love this app and think it's a great idea.,
"Amazing App, so easy to keep track of everything, including your results and keeping in touch with health professionals. It certainly makes the experience of visiting a hospital seamless!",
"Very disappointed with the bill payment change. It was so convenient now it is difficult and forget about our seniors. It can not always be about the bottom line. RHS has excelled in finance, now take a look at your customer base.",
My chart is great for interacting with the health records and health care providers. I just wish providers would delete out of date or inaccurate reminders... And I wish the developers would make it easier for them to do so,
Fantastic and very easy to use and its awesome to communicate with medical feild doctors and specialist and reading results are easy. Questions are answered in decent amount of time. Appointment request easy. Looking up other health information is great and easy to find. All around fantastic 😊,
Excellent medical chart app. I easily track appointments etc. I requested an appt with a new provider and got a call in less than an hour. The young lady was extremely helpful. I received notification in mychart confirming the appt.,
I constantly have to change my password. Please fix this glitch.,
"I like having my results, medication, and provider at my finger tips. I love MyChart!😊",
"It asked you to enter an activation code & your infromation, but when you do, it tells you that YOUR/MY information is incorrect & after 3 attempts the activation code is disabled due to too many failed attempts. This is a failer already and didn't meet my expectations. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If this had a minus zero rating, that's the rating I would give it. How can your personal information be invalid after 6 attempts!! I really don't get this app...",
The app is very easy and I love how all the health information is located in one centralized place. It's so much easier to send a message to the doctors than waiting on hold on the phone and you always get a reply within 24 hours during the week days. Update: This app is one of the easiest to navigate and the quick response from the doctor's offices is absolutely the best!!,
"This is the best app ever! Dealing with the doctor's office has never been easier... Being able to email with the doctor, make appointments. Medications can be renewed, the app makes it easy to see all my test results and the office can contact me versus having to go to the office... Excellent!",
"Love Love Love using this app for my husband and myself. I use it for everything from prescription refills, sending messages to our doctors and reminders for both our appointments. And the convenience of being able to have both of us on my app on my phone is awesome because I handle our appts and everything else...😌☺",
"I have successfully used My Chart app for many years, but within the last week or so, I cannot log into the app, due to a server connection error. It doesn't work with the biometric login, or the standard login-password.",
"Very well done, very easy to understand and follow and keep track of your personal medical information.",
"I love using my chart! Very convenient except for when you need to print a doctor's note if you had gone to the hospital and they forgot to give one, and/or if you've had a telemed video appointment/conference w/your doctor/s and need a doctor's note; you can't print one out. Other than that MyChart is a pretty good mobile application.",
"I have been involved with Ochsner's and MyChart for over two years. Use of this app has kept me and my care team updated and afforded us the ability to communicate, schedule appointments, manage medications, and provide feedback and test results. This is my most used app, and the most important tool I have in helping my care team make decisions about my health and treatments. If there was a way to rate this app 10 stars, I WOULD!",
"But first I thought it was good but the more I use it the more I see how bad the interface is garbage. It's hard to maneuver and it's hard to change from one position to another. With a all of resources that you have, I would have expected a much better and more user-friendly application interface. As far as I'm concerned you have completely failed.",
"Like the layout, plus easy to navigate. Also can link all my medical records in one place. Functions that make contact almost obsolete. So yes, I like the app!",
It was working great. It's been super glitch the last few days. I uninstalled it and re installed to see if it would fi it. I couldn't even reopen the app.,
"I've REALLY enjoyed using mychart. At one point I only had a phone that worked on wifi so I couldn't even make phone calls so Mt chart REALLY came in handy and it still does because I'd much rather be able to type a message in on herd than have to get on the phone, even now that I have one that works I'd still rather leave a message like this than have to call....thank you, Kayla Noel Sisk.",
"Great app, it allows me to have all of my important medical information such as appointments and medication at my fingertips. It also allows for direct communication to my doctor's and healthcare professionals without having to make an appointment or wait on hold on the phone.",
"My test results are ready to view quickly. It reduces anxiety not to need to wait for call back from a doctor or nurse. Then if I have any questions I can send an email without needing to open a different app or window. I appreciate that my questions are answered usually in 24 hours or less though I completely understand that it might take 48 hours. As to the next question on ads, I don't recall seeing any once I'm inside MyChart.",
Great app. Real easy to use. The communication from my doctor was easy to find. Test results and future appointments were very easy to navigate. Great job on the layout as well.,
"I had trouble with this app initially, but since I contacted MyChart directly about it and THEY reinstalled it for me, I 've had no problems at all. All of my medical information is there, the minute I leave the office, or I am discharged from the hospital, ALL of my medical notes are accessible for me to read at my leisure s and discretion.",
Can't use the app they've wiped out the biometric sign in information. I've written to them but have not received a response. Do not want to reset my password as I can still get on line to my acct using the saved password feature via chrome. I just can't use this lousy app.,
The app is extremely well designed with its friendly and intuitive user interface. I mostly use it as a convenient alternative to the web portal for scheduling appointments and viewing results.,
Excellent app love the update. This app allows access to medical records and test results as well as appointments in one central location. It makes managing and keeping on top of things s lot easier,
"Ever since the update I can't login on the app, keep having to go to the website. Super inconvenient. The app keeps telling me ""We can't log you in right now. Please try again."" No matter how many times I try again to login, same message keeps popping up.",
I love this app. It helps me keep track of all of my medical records from my phone. It links different hospitals in different states and I love the share anywhere option where I can hand my phone to my healthcare provider and she or he can see any testing or treatment that has been done at other facilities. A+ from me,
"It's not great but ok. Unfortunately it has been broken for a while now hence 1 star. Myhealth Records logs in but just stays stuck on a blank page. Logging in works fine on the website, just remember to X the recommendation to open in the app.",
"The new programming sucks. I have been using this app for a while to communicate with my doctor as a deaf client. Now I can not access my information on the app. What a ***huge*** barrier. I would not recommend this to my deaf and hard of hearing friends and family members. Sorry, but I will not go through the hassles of reaching out to Epic as I already have to much on my plate as a disabled person.",
would love contact information for providers to be included especially when new providers are added to a patients care. mark new content inside the tab so we know what is new and what has already been reviewed. and allow for to do list items to be marked as read or reviewed instead of staying in red as new items. some things arent relevant or cant be done even though they are recommended.,
"It's so convenient to make appointments, change appointments, ask questions.. everything all in one! I've been able to stay in healthy communication with the events of my mother's sickness. It has really been a distresser as no one is permitted to visit. My mother is in the hospital I'm able to stay update with information from the doctors. Each time they visit her they make a log and give short descriptions of what was done, she said, how she's feeling and her progression.",
"After 2 years of activation codes that didn't work, I was texted by a new doctor's office to set up My Chart in order to see her response to my call. Sadly this app is bad, a time waster, and the product relies on programmers and physicians knowing what they want and what they can do. Not made for the patient. Avoid as long as you can.",
"I really like using the MyChart app. I can see all of my upcoming appointments, access information from past appointments, view, update, and edit most of my information (insurance, address, etc), and message back and forth with all of my providers.",
"Would be helpful if the app allowed a user to set up multiple accounts. I manage health records for my entire family, but I cannot access anyone except for me using the app. (EDIT: thank you for the help! I wasn't sure that was an option through the app and wasn't finding answers online.)",
"It gives you access to message your team, and set up, reschedule or cancel appts without ever having to wait on the phone. It is really easy to use and it gives you updates on your health and summaries of the appt visit.",
"I love this app. It is so easy to keep up with my medical information, get my test results, send messages and check on upcoming appointments. A lot easier & faster than calling the Dr.'s office an appointment or simple question. My doctors' offices respond in an appropriate amount of time, usually less than 48 hours.",
Best thing ever for your medical information!,
"Forgets my correct password and keeps asking me to confirm information already confirmed. When I can log in, it's just confusing and not everyone uses it so you still end up calling someone to provide records and/or scheduling appointments. Waste of time.",
I have been using My Chart since the app. became available and I have to say that it makes all of my communication with my care team so much easier. My experiences with the My Chart app have been great.,
"I just tested positive for covid and App is worthless. The App only sent me to the CDC website. Did not provide any way to have an on-call doctor to get back to me with an assessment or recommendations. There was also no way to enter that I had tested positive for covid. At the very minimum I would have expected it to have check list of symptoms and recommend whether or not to seek additional treatment. Experiencing a cough, chest congestion, low oxygen level, shortness of breath, etc.",
I really like the convenience of the app. I contacted my Healthcare about the family share option not being available as advertised. They have not changed nor responded. The app is great. My Healthcare not allowing the family share is annoying.,
"Using the My Chart app is a great time saver and a real convenience I use nearly every day since I have been diagnosed. Not only can I see my test results so that I am prepared for my next visit, but I can also do a precheck in. With precheck in, I just go to the receptionist and give her my name and I have already answered all those pesky questions they have to ask before every visit. I can also leave a message for my doctor, or request a refill. That's convenience!",
Everything is so easy to navigate. Having everything in one place makes appointments and communication less chaotic. I appreciate having results on hand and feeling more involved in my medical care.,
Yes l love that l am able to download Mt chart and login to schedule appointments ans look at my test results without having to wait. Wonderful app to have,
"Almost anything I need regarding my healthcare - contacting my doctors, a calendar of my appointments past & future, appointment notes, phone numbers, list of medications, prescription refills to doctor, etc., etc. is all there on my chart. This app is extremely helpful.",
I love that i have access to my meds on line and test results and any questions i may have.,
Rarely works. Server errors. SLOW. 1 star is 1 too many.,
I get my information much quicker then if I had to make a call,
"This app is totally outstanding, so easy to use and allows for hassle free access to all appointments, labs, messaging Dr's and keeping you informed of your health summary and important information. Highly recommend my chart to all people using this for access to all their health concerns and issues. Easy and precise. Mr Mitchell Magee. My chart user. Uva health.",
I like MyChart app. I recommend you to use it to be informed about your health. Take steps to keep healthy.,
"I've been liking the app the big plus it has been saving me time filling out paperwork each time I had the appointment s the app is very thorough has all my information on my health very good app! I am pleased in the beginning it was very confusing years ago but now it is more user friendly not to many apps are in my opinion, but this one is! Thank you!",
"80% of the times i use the app, the only message i can retrieve is ""An error has occurred on the server, please try again later "" Now I'd give you a zero if i could. How am I supposed to keep track of my medical NECESSITIES if all i ever get from this app is an error????And if i have to settle this with my provider, why do i need this lame app?? OK they asked me to review again. Now instead of 80% of the time, it's more like 95 to 100% of the time all I get is an error message.",
Amazing for someone who always loses documents and forgets medical history. I absolutely love it!!,
"First! I feel I have the best doctor there! Dr. Cleeves is amazingly AWESOME! Secondly, I can find all my information in one place, no need to call for documentations. The message response is nice. I can talk directly to my doctor whenever needed. Prescriptions can be requested, appointments can be scheduled, even specialty doctors. I have all my medical history there if and when needed. Great app!",
"I would like to express frustration with the lack of ways to ask for help in MyChart, not from the medical community, but from EPIC. If you use FSA dollars for reimbursement you have until the end of March to submit claims. It is kind of a laborious and annoying process, so a lot of people tackle this in one sitting at the end of the session. However, all evidence of one's payments disappear at the end of the calendar year. There is no feature to show what you spent in the previous year.",
"Very user friendly, it always to send messages to the doctor, to make and change appointments, etc... It gives us tests results at a click and allows us to ask questions. Thank you!",
"So quick, & relatively easy to use. Well organized for fast, hassle free access to all of my Health information. Also great tool for making immediate appointments or getting in touch with your doctor or nurse in a timely matter. I recomend that any Oschner patients should download this free app. It will prove most helpful to them.",
Very helpful. Super user friendly. It makes setting appointments so easy. I'm also able to contact my doctor and they get back as soon as possible. I would definitely say that this app is life changing,
"I enjoy having access to my test results in a timely manner. I am not such a fan of missing important messages because I might not see an email telling me to check my chart. Also, I tried recently to enter the date of my Covid Booster,,but it went under flu shot. I cannot see how to correct this.",
I love My Chart ! So convient.. I use it all the time with any questions or concerns I have . It enables me to stay in touch with my medical team at any time which is so reassuring. It's also great to keep track of my appointments and test results..I wouldn't want to be without it,
"I love sending a message for advice, appointments, and prescription information to my doctor, and usually getting a response from someone on the staff if not my doctor the same day. Plus having access to test results really helps you understand your health and healthcare. This app provides an amazing service for patients all over to have access and peace of mind to their healthcare.",
This works well. Sometimes I can't find what I'm in need of but I think that's operator error. Everything in one place. If all of my providers would schedule through this app it would make things easier.,
"This app doesn't work. It will say I have a new message or result and when u click it, it just says error and doesn't let me see it. I have to try it several times before it finally works. And it doesn't need updated at all.",
"Since I got my chart on my phone it's been so easy to make appointments, Request medications I need, get test results and communicate with my Dr and nurses and care team . I highly recommend this app it's very useful and easy to use. It made things so much easier on me. .love it 🧑‍⚕️🧑‍⚕️🚑🏥💊💉**ps**also I can keep track of all my shots and it tells me when it's time for new ones . And it tells you when u are due for tests and appointments (example) breast exams pap test etc",
"I think the my chart is a great tool for managing records, appointments, and communications, regarding our health. I am much more ""in the know"" with my chart, then I ever was in the past. I would recommend using it.",
My favorite thing about this is that I am able to get on a waiting list for earlier appointments and I am notified of openings that I am eligible to claim. If you have a longer time available to get into the office then you can always get on the waiting list. All through the mychart. Your appointments have a great way to add to your calendar too. I never missed any appointments.,
"Great App, except got one thing. In the message part, you need an option that is ""general"". There have been several times what I needed did not fit into any of the options available. Thank You",
I like being able to communicated with my doctor threw text. I typically get a fast response. I can keep up with my appointments as well as test results and more. I really like this form of communication with my health care providers.,
I love this app. It is simple to use and it's very convenient.,
Do cool...no more paperwork to fill out when you go in ...easy to understand...since Medical words are a different language...💓💓💓,
"Great app, useful for telehealth with my Dr. Called this morning to see if I could squeeze in a quick appointment with my Dr. Who is a very very busy man. The Dr. was full but he made room for me, spoke for 10 minutes, he told me I needed to go the ER right away, and potentially saved my life. All because of this app. Downsides. Sometimes the medication renewals/refills are not sent to the Dr. Even though you filled out the forms and all. Always check your email after filling out form!",
"Apologies aren't accepted by me. This app has given me more headaches than I need, causing me to TRY to get to my Dr. for headache relief prescription. There is definitely a problem with the Server, as I'm reminded constantly. There is also a HUGE problem with Epic. I am confined to home, and this damned APP is totally useless. This has been going on for months, nothing gets done to repair the Damned APP. REPAIR THE DAMNED APP!!!",
This app is wonderful. The only way It could be better is all all doctors were on it,
Responding to or creating messages has been a pain lately. It takes several attempts to even load the messaging part of the app. It also has taken me several attempts to load the test results and this is using wifi so it's not my connection that's the issue.,
Like many other reviewers my experience of this app is largely positive. Have hit a bit of a snag though as my medication list is not quite correct and neither the gastroenterologist I had a telephone appointment with nor the pharmacy at UCLH knew how to go about amending it. Perhaps MyChart could teach medical professionals how aspects of the app work.,
Can't login anymore. Nothing ez about new login. Had me verify info randomly then said I couldn't be verified. Giving negative review despite years of patiently Ignoring non-intuitive UI with zero navigation keys making you start entire chains over if the info you wanted forks and also the absurd char. limit that has me sending my Dr. unprofessional multi-part msgs instead of 1 if/when discussing complex issues aka normal health related phenomena. Endless coding issues and now totally broken :(,
Terrible. Signed in. Looked at my stuff. That's it. Unable to sign in after that. Either via biometric or entering username and password. Edit. Moved to 3* am able to get in today. But biometric still not working. Very useful once in.,
I love using Mychart! It is so convenient to have your complete health care at your fingertips. Being able to message your doctors and getting responses usually back within a day is wonderful. Having all your future appointments and getting test results quickly and in one place is a plus. I highly recommend Mychart to anyone who is interested in monitoring your own health.,
"This app would be a 5 star rating if it would actually work correctly, especially since all this Covid19 bull malarkey has been going on, with MyChart video visits I've done with my drs it has probably only worked correctly without glitches maybe 25% of the time!!! It's quite ridiculous because my drs has to call me by phone instead to finish our visit... I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times I'm sick of it!!! It's just seriously annoying, so please FIX THESE PROBLEMS... :'[",
"So so, I don't like there isn't a wet wipe after the Ego procedure. I could access a bathroom but I have leave the office undress. Just provide a wet wipe with th dry wipes. This way we will have an option. We're just told it just water based and left with that. My question would be how many times have the technology been preformed on they. (Walk a mile in my shoes) old analogy. Sincerely,",
"It rarely works. Even with using your own fingerprint it won't open, and a constant ERROR pop-up happens. Password? ERROR. It's incredibly aggravating, especially in this already calamitous year.",
"It's very difficult to accomplish anything on this app. Can't schedule an appointment, any where in the hospital. It's basically a detailed health summary. You still have to call for everything. That's why it's a 3. You can't DO anything. The medical team doesn't even read the messages, or just won't act on anything they read. Good information though.",
This is a wonderfully efficient/effective way to communicate with our doctors' offices.,
"The app can remind you of a doctor's appointment, but it can't manage to tell you when you have labs due",
"Apparently you don't offer support? When trying to log in, I get ""Terms and Conditions could not be loaded at this time. Please try again later."" I can only press OK, then am taken back to the login screen. I am not asked to accept any terms and conditions when I log in on the website. Edit: after almost an hour on a support loop, the very poorly trained person I spoke to said the fix is... wait and hope they update the app. It's just broken and they know it. No joke... they need to get sued.",
It was Friendly kind and Very courteous there was true professional service were Excellent!!,
I can never sign in. Even though I know my password it says I got the wrong password. When I hit forgot password need help whatever it tries going to somewhere then says sorry problems with the server try back later so I get a notice that I need to check my chart but I can't check my chart because he won't let me check my chart and this is not the first time this is a continuous thing this app absolutely sucks and I'm worried about what test results they're talking about but I can't find them .,
"Love using it. I just don't like having to pay for my insurance portion before I can be seen for a new issue, that's why I have not been in nor paid for what the insurance was delayed on paying all because the insurance had an ""update"" on their system and decided not to submit payment to the clinic.. not clinics fault for insurance being incompetent. But it does cause me to cancel appt because I can't pay insurance portion and they take forever to pay for an appt that was in Jan and it's aug",
"Really useful, essential for coordinating family care, tracking test results and managing appointments.",
"I enjoy knowing that I have good doctors from First Health Center that will take the time to listen and helping me get better with my health,and knowing they care about me health care and trying to get me the care I need. Thanks from all of y'all's at First Health Center.",
MyChart it's an excellent tool. I have not had any problems since I've been using the app it is a positive way to communicate with their healthcare team thank you epic for creating this tool you did an excellent job creating this tool like most apps it doesn't have those ads and pop-ups I really love that about my chart app thank you epic for me so creative,
"new user ...love it so far. New Edit : So, I've been on this app for a little more than a month and have had multiple doctors appointments and multiple questions for providers through this app.......IT IS AMAZING. This app makes the doctors visit experience 100% convenient and efficient. There was occasions where my doctor wasn't sure about results of a test and I referenced the app so doctor can see results....super efficient",
Would give this app a 0 if I could. Tried repeatedly to make an account and it would not accept my SS. (Why do i have to give that anyway? Why not just a username and password like a normal app?) Annoying that it prompts you to use it to check in before every appt when you can just do so once reaching the office? Now you want to charge for messaging? Glad i never used this because i've now deleted it from my phone and won't be using it ever.,
"This app is so easy to use, and so much more convenient than using my laptop, which I never thought I would say. I love being able to message my doctor (Dr Peterson) or her nurse with a question, concern, or problem; they always respond back to me in a very timely manner. I'm sorry to see others having a problem with this app when it works so good for me.",
"A brilliant app,so useful for keeping all my all my information in order and up to date,",
"Since having the MyCare/MyChart app, it has saved a lot of added stress with getting hold of medical Information for myself and members of my family. It is so easy to use. From letters from the hospital, notes written about your visits to recieving blood test results or the e-check in ability, it truly makes a huge difference. More hospitals should adopt this way of working, not only for the patients but to give the staff more time to concentrate on real work, not needless admin.",
We need you to sign this document but the document has an error and will not load is the message I get and then it disappears never to be signed later. Oh how about you schedual your next appointment? Oh never mind it can't do that either. What a joke if an app. I think I will just call the office and hopefully talk to a human there and sign papers in person,
"This is a horrible app. It is almost impossible to make any of the ""topics"" work, and it tried to get me to connect someone else's records to my account. Unfortunately, if your doctor's conglomerate uses it, you have NO CHOICE IF YOU EVER WANT TO CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR AGAIN!!!!! I would change doctors in five minutes flat if I could find one who does not use this app or a similar one, and I love my doctor, whom I have seen for about twenty years!!!! This app is THAT BAD!!!! Actually zero stars!",
"The patient portal makes it much easier to keep track of appointments, exams, testing, payments... everything. I love in person contact whenever possible but the portal helps keep me organized.",
Works really well. Kerps me organized and on time. Always have an updatedst of meds with me and get notices for appointments. Test results are wuickly available which alliws me to do my own research and keep notes in separate app to ask my doctor questions. Payment portion though does not work for me. Otherwise an amazing app. Thank you.,
"I love My Chart. I'm able to check my results to labs and imaging results before my doctor even calls me with results. Knowing that the doctor is busy I'm still anxious to get results to ease my anxiety. My chart gives me that access with ease. I can refer back to my doctors notes if I forget something said in the appointment. My chart is easy to navigate, and that's a good thing",
Very convenient and helpful app. Awesome way to keep in touch with my doctors and get questions answered when needed. Works great on my phone but continously crashes on my laptop. Once that is fixed will definitely up it to 5 🌟,
"All my information is gone now. When I open this app, instead of a keypad to enter my PIN, it aays to enter my provider name and my country. But it doesn't work and nothing ever loads. I uninstalled then reinstalled the app and still, nothing. Please fix asap.",
"Good way to keep up with your health, but everyone has some type of flaws...",
Update: I was just raving and now test results won't load. Very disappointed I love this app. It makes it easier to keep track of appointments and test results. You can message your Dr to ask questions. Also able to schedule appointments,
"Developers need to allow patients to update their own health records, adding test results, etc. without relying on a ""provider"" to do it. Patients need the ability to remove/change erroneous information in their charts also. Allow for linking dental records for myself and my children. Create MyChartCentral/Lucy account from within the app",
"it would be a great app IF everything worked like it should. Nearly every time I click on one of the tabs, it tries to load and then tells me there was an error. It's getting old real quick!",
love being able to read my office visit summary within the same day. Wish that the test and summary had a way to print out for my own record keeping. P/W protected but Iprefer the easier method of passcode with numbers. if you have question the message board is available and nurse or Dr. answer quickly within 24 hr. Paperwork can be filled out prior to visit which is another plus. App is just convenient overall. nice.,
"I love the ease out access to my doctors, meds, refills, treat results, appointments, notes from doctors.... There are so many other additional activities you can accomplish on UCHART. I recommend UM and all their services The staff is amazing, the immediate service they provide for all your needs.... I can go on. They are a great overall provided for primary and specialists needs. I hope you found this review useful. I can't contain myself from giving them referrals to my friends and families.",
Great tool to keep in touch with my providers everyone is so attentive,
fairly easy to use. Need to be able to access all data and notes from treatment team. Imaging doesnt load would be nice to have it load and those notes also available.,
"I use this app for almost all of my communications and contact with my physicians. This includes, making appointments, requesting refills, tracking current medictations & medical or billing questions, and having virtual visits. Three of my hospital systems and affiliated physicians use the app. I wish all my providers were on it but I make a point not to let that drive my health care choices. We have enough evil monopolies, propaganda and mind control thanks to big tech already, remember that!",
It is the easiest way to get my questions answered...easy way to fill my prescription..,
Great way to keep track of all my medical appointments.,
"PIA app, an excuse for your providers to dodge your phone calls. But, BONUS: you can access scary positive bad test results even before your doctor sees them!!! It's best if these results are posted to my chart on a Friday afternoon when your doctor is gone for the week so you can ruminate horrified all by yourself til Monday morning!!!!!!",
Their amazing and I love how the doctor gets back to you fast. The staff are great very friendly,
You set the bar high for easy to use website and app. Seriously the most user friendly site to use. Easy to navigate. Easy to message your doctor. Quick and enjoyable way to pay your bill (never thought Id say that...but it is). Whether its for a medical company or not...you need to set up apps and websites for all companies!!,
Is wonderful but have room for improvement. I will like to pick what pharmacy I want to use for a specific Medication. And also I like to auto check in using geo fencing. And receive a text message when check in is done. That will be a huge improvement.,
Doesn't load hardly anything like message test results and everything else I absolutely hate everything about it,
"The techs constantly improve this app. About sharing any of your other medical offices on here hasnt worked for me because the current staff always seems to change the past facts to fit the current narative. Plus there are documents that all the doctors stick on here that you can read here and no where else. Like your biography, stuff that is really none of their business is in their system.",
The app is nice and easy to navigate. It would be nice if the app allowed us to put in the vaccines we have gotten into the system if we got them from someone else like I got my COVID vaccines and Flu shot from CVS but I have Vidant as my main health provider. Also having it easy to set up an appointment for things like a gynecologist.,
"I love this app. I take care of most things through this app and you can have a video appointment to see a doctor, get refills and make appointments. This app is so convenient and time saving, its unreal. Thank you so much for the care of your patients, so much so that you created this app.",
"Better than the web interface primarily due to more stable auth sessions and easier reauth, but still largely frustrating and clearly designed around a distorted set of imperatives. Basically, the app must first and foremost offer notices and require compliance designed to reduce liabilities for its custodians and the organizations using it. This foundational issue leads to time wasting design, difficult to reduce communication overhead (eg non-dismissable messages), and constant visual clutter.",
"I absolutely love having this app! It truly makes my life easier and saves time, instead of waiting on hold to schedule appointments, or waiting for a call for test results, it can now all be done in one place one this app on the go!!!",
Email function rarely works on the app. Server error among other issues. My app is up to date and my phone has no issues with other apps. Desktop site outperformes the app for most basic tasks.,
"Most of my organizations are not supported. Of the one that is, most of my doctors are invisible including my GP. eCheck in is useless. Some Medical records and all Vaccination records don't show up. Difficult to navigate. Many features only available via web browser, making it pointless to have an app.",
I use this app all the time. It is beyond handy. I would recommend it. There are some items that are easier to look at when at a computer but that is same with most apps. This is for sure an app I love having!,
"Works just fine. I am a senior , and only very recently got my First Smartphone!!! MYCHART took me awhile to get used to--- the real issue was getting up to speed on the Smartphone generally-- Montefiore support was very helpful.",
"I've used MyChart for I believe 7 years now , I absolutely love being able to schedule/cancel/ refill prescriptions and communicate with my doctor's this way .. I have a disability which keeps me from being able to communicate and even like to talk on the phone or in person with people... This way I get to see my test results and further understand certain things. I'm very grateful for this option 😁",
"Just started using this, but I have test results and it went show then to me, keeps telling me I need to sign up for fairview or some other stuff. Why do I need to do all of that when I should be able to see all my test results on MyChart. This needs to be fixed. This is a silly issue to have.",
I love the fact that I can get information before the doctors do. Helps me to prepare for what they are/are not going to tell me!,
This was a great app until I couldn't add my new cc to be able to pay for my office vist. Something is always changing. A lot of unnecessary and useless updates. If your bored maybe you should fix what really needs fixing. I'm sure there's other things on app that is being over looked for updates. Thanks career point.,
Its realy nice to be able to see all your results and information plus its really easy to use,
"The most recent updates from Google Play has cause many of my apps to stop working. Mychart is one of them. I need to get in there. And I recently saved my payment info there. Feeling a bit sketchy about it all now. Other than that, I think it's great.",
"No way to print lab results other than taking a screen shot, and the screen shot doesn't have my name. Worthless for what I needed. No way to delete old insurance info. They sent claim to old insurance. Stupid app.",
"This app is Great!! It is so handy to have , I absolutely love this app! My boyfriend was admitted into the hospital & I was so worried , I could not stay with him this time , I could keep in touch by phone but how would I know what was being done? then I heard of the app I tried it out and it's AMAZING! So helpful in so many ways!! It was a Big relief lifted off of me. This is an Awesome app I couldn't ask for anything better to keep me updated on everything medical issues, tests done & results",
I love it. It's great to get your test results before your Dr. gives them to you. What a great idea.,
"I've been so grateful for this feature of the U of U experience. Easy to navigate and understand, nice to be able to communicate with my healthcare team without being on hold. 😜😁 It's so pleasant having the option to be able to work with everyone there and if you ever need IT to talk you through anything technical, they're so patient and kind. I'm so pleased with the whole U of U kit + caboodle. Thank you a b'jillion. Have a wonderful day.",
"I really like this app getting the results of my test even before the doctor gets them is great. Never had any problems with the app, works great for me. Plus being able to message my doctors is great also they always get right back to me.",
"This is the most useless app I have ever tried to use. It tells me that I have a message that I need to read, but I can't find it or down load it. Sure hope it isn't important. Certainly, there must be a better program that can be developed. If you read the comments, ll appears that there are far more 1 stars votes than 4 or 5 stars!",
Best app for my children's doctor visits. Let's me see all their results a day or two after getting lab work done. Breaks it all down by numbers and shows you where your child's results fall on whether it's normal range or in a high range. They show you a summary of the doctor visit with your childs diagnosis plus their weight and blood pressure results. Very ideal and a great way to share information with parents. Love that my child's Dr uses this app. Very informative 👏,
"Why ruin an app that was working well with redesigned??? The app now wants me to upgrade. I then go to my app store and there is no update or upgrade. FIX THIS ASAP!!! Many of us rely on this app daily or weekly to communicate with their doctor's. Especially those of us with severe disease we need a functioning ""My Chart"" app!",
Mychart has made it very easy to view my records check appointments and so on. Love this app,
"I have used ""My Chart"" successfully for the previous three years! My Doctors communicate via MY Chart so I'm always up to date on my health. I, too, go to My Chart with any requests and/or updates! I've found it extremely helpful and, time-saving for me and, I believe also for my Doctors! It has been a real asset in coordinating the great! care I've had at OHSU! Thanks to all! Nancy. Dec. 12, 2021",
"I love how I am able to view results of any tests or lab work done because I'm usually able to view it sooner than when I get a call from my doctor with the results. That definitely helps my anxiety especially when tests are done on a Friday, it is usually available for me to view by time the weekend is even up. I also like how many things can be done on MyChart. You can review any of the notes from your doctor's visit in your file. Results from ultrasounds, CT scans etc as well on MyChart.",
"The swirl app when it does load it comes up Sorry unknown error has occurred please try later. Shows everything but won't open anything, unknown error again! Go ahead and say your sorry to hear this, that's not going to do any good now is it? Just fix your Junk App! Uninstalled",
Fantastic app for managing illnesses & medical plan. Keeping track of appts and future treatment plans.,
"I love using MyChart to keep track of my upcoming appointments, accessing notes of my past visits or reading test results. I also enjoy the ease of scheduling an appointment or asking a question. I find this very user friendly and a great resource!",
A fantastic app! Very deep and very thorough. Also very handy.Bravo!!!,
"The check-in procedure is a pain in the butt, and I don't think the doctor's office uses it anyway. Reply to developer - how about a button that says there are no changes since last time, and another that allows you to indicate its just: 1) a routine checkup, or 2) routine follow-up on labs.",
"I downloaded this to use the check in for appointment feature but they want and will not activate this feature of you set location information to be handed out ""only when the app is active"". There should be a choice of all the time or when the app is active and allow this feature base on both those selection options not just all the time",
I don't like the upcoming dates for appointments and testing. This to me is useless because I wasn't informed about these from the doctor office. Takes up alot of room on my phone for things my doctor hasn't actually ordered. Then I am due for a Mammogram and no where on the list with a contact number for me to call and schedule an appointment. It is very time consuming to go through these one AR a time and the ones I try to delete just stay on here.,
Easy and very convenient 👌,
"So convenient! I utilize the app with four digit sign in short cut. Have results of tests, messages, office visit notes and summaries, upcoming visit reminders, and e-sign in at my fingertips no mater where I am. Grateful for the simple way to communicate. Thank you!!!",
"Very efficient. Access to records instantly, seems to be secure, and there's also the ability to connect your patient information from multiple organizations if you've been seen by more than one.",
"Very easy to navigate. Everything you need for your appointments is right in this app!! You have access to your tests, medical history and can check in for your appointments right here.",
Runs wonderful and everything is categorized and easy to find. Wonderful way to keep up with my doctors and other importances. Clean and no ads which is kinda helpful. Feel very comfortable with this!,
It's a awesome app way better than talking to a nurse or a person in the doctor's office that seems to have absolutely no time nor interest in hearing what a patient my have to say.. easy to use only issue is sometimes hard to sign in or updates make it where u cannot sign in at all and never informs u to update password so you most people don't know what to do. Needs more reasons why people may cancel appts. Needs more online doctor visits..,
I love to be able to communicate to my doctor office. This is a great app,
"I love this app! As someone who has multiple health issues, the app makes it so I don't have to call the clinic as often or wait around for a callback. I can quickly order all of my Rx's, message my doctors, look at test results, check in, fill in surveys, make appointments, etc. I get messages when my Rx's are ready & when I need rechecks, lab tests or vaccines -the app even told me when I qualified for every Covid vaccine doses & it was easy to make the appointments right on the app.",
"CONSTANTLY getting canceled appointments and rescheduled appointment notifications in Mychart and messages to my phone. Who is changing my appointments without my consent??? Same times, but still this is a HUGE PROBLEM and it NEEDS TO STOP!!!! A VERY important ultrasound eas supposed to happen, but someone changed that with my OB appointment and it's VERY concerning and highly illegal for someone to do that witj MY RECORD!!! New update: billing me for paid bills with evidence of payment. SSM 🖕",
"Each of my doctor's use a different app. This is average.Difficult to upload photos clear enough for doc to see clearly. That's very frustrating, have used other apps with other docs, I can honestly say I've used better AND worst!",
"I have 2 doctors at 2 different clinics in the same small city. Both clinics use Epic Systems for charting, medications, appointments, etc. However, neither doctor can see my test results from each other without going through a very complicated and limited access time. This is a pain in the arse. I hate Epic Systems! It can't even work right with its own system!",
I had stage III colorectal cancer and could not imagine going through all the treatments and visits without this app. It is A+ and so easy to navigate and rescues stress in ways that most would never believe.,
It is great that I am able to pull the chart right up and see all appointments and also the summaries. Think it is a wonderful tool especially being disabled it really helps. I would give it an A+,
"Absolute Garbage. It was good, but they have eliminated so many helpful features and left us with a shell of what it used to be. Now it's nothing more than a place holder. It's too bad they don't think about the user when they change or eliminate features.",
Great that all my providers can access it to,
"I love MyChart !! It is wonderful to have access to all your medical records, appointments, test results, and diagnosis at anytime you want them no matter where you are. And if you forget anything, you have access to look up whatever you forget! And if you have a question, you can email your doctor rather than try to reach anyone on the phone. It has definitely changed the way I feel about dealing with doctors and having to keep track of my medical records!!",
Makes your life much easier when you can see all your information,
This app none stop bugging me for information and e-check in multiple times for the same appointment.,
"This app is hugely helpful. It's so easy to communicate with my doctor to answer quick questions. It's also really nice to have all of my health data, appt and prescription information, test results, etc., all in one place. It's very reliable and makes things very easy.",
"Great app. The great thing is that I can see my test results as soon as they are available. Therefore, at my next dr. appointment I am ready with my comments/questions based on the results. Also great as a appointments reminder. It is a very efficient tool for Heath Care.",
It used to be a good app until May 6th! My husband has stage 4 metastatic RCC and May 5th I had to take him to er. His brain was bleeding from the cancer. Since his release it's like the app is frozen in time! Hospice starts tomorrow and they can't find the info they need. The developer is aware of this but nothing has changed! He was just released yesterday from bleeding in small intestine and we can't see anything about the emergency surgery or anything! This is unacceptable and needs fixed AS,
Until recently I was very happy with it. Been having difficulty trying to make monthly payment. I did call support and was informed they have been having a problem with it and we're working on the problem. Very nice response. I do like the app and hope the matter is rectified soon.,
"As of 9, May the app constantly stops working when trying to access billing or messages. This is not the right time for this Looks like someone else is having the same problem.",
I like this app. It has been very helpful with appointments and medication refills.,
This app works well and is very convenient.,
"This app is basically only good for a text or following up and getting appointment information, it will not let you upload any pictures of your current situation to show to your physicians basically I don't see the point. Garbage!",
Everytime I log in this app says I need certain routine medical care which my doctor says I'm not due for. I have a billing notification that won't go away even though I have a zero balance due. It's hard to tell what actually needs to be done with my Healthcare when none of the notifications are correct.,
"Prior to the recent update, I had no issues. Lately; however, I can't login without ""server errors"" directing me to try again later. Not only is this annoying, it hinders my checkins for Zoom medical appointments! Pleaae fix this issue!!!!!",
"Easy to use and navigate! I appreciate the ability to quickly contact my care team members, view my health history, test results and provider notes, and to switch between organizations at the my leisure. Love the ease of requesting refills!",
"The application is very useful. However, it has a serious flaw in my opinion. Not sure if it complies with HIPPA fully. If I give access to another person, he/she can see my data. But, If this person gives access to a third party, this third party has access to my data as well! I think that's a violation of privacy provisions in HIPPA.",
Incredibly efficient. Every medical professional should use this system.,
"I love this app! It is so convenient, easy to navigate and helps get your issues addressed in a timely manner. Whether it's regarding an appointment, or medication renewals, it is fast and efficient.",
"I have challenges cause MS, made alittle easier....ty",
App works just fine for me no problems at all,
I like it...makes it alot easier for me !,
Very good information. You can get your test results before the clinic calls you.,
I can download into my phone. I've tried twice...,
Some test I have to Google to understand. The rest is good.,
I find my chart hard to navigate.,
Please add the X-Rays so we can see what Dr sees too. Thank you,
This is Helpful being able to keep in contact with Doctor & personal data.,
Easy to use and helpful.,
Easy to navigate.,
Great Can find answers to information you might have forgotten.,
It's a Very good app that has many features to help,
Can't get past sign in. Using phone. guess what ??? No everyone has a computer,
Love being able to access all my family information in one spot.,
I like my chart because it helps me remember my appointments.,
Easy to use. Very helpful,
Very helpful and easy to use.,
"I like this sight, it is pretty user friendly.",
The app is very user-friendly.,
"My chart is excellent at delivering test results the following day, Hospital appointments and you can refer to test results as far back as you first began to use MyChart, be careful not to use it as a diagnostic tool leave that for the professionals",
"Works well, with out glitches.",
Easy to navigate,
It very helpful and convenient,
"I 🤍 This App! It's Very Convenient to use. I can Check in as I pull into the parking lot for Appts. Check messages from my Dr's. Request Appts & Refills, View Test Results, See Scheduled Appts. It also has a section telling you what kinds of Exams & Annual Tests such as Colonoscopy, Mammograms, Etc your Due For. Best of All you can link Multiple Healthcare Networks & Your Entire Medical History. All of my Dr's Use It! I REALLY FIND IT VERY HANDY!",
Very courteous and professional,
Hard to navigate.,
It's the BEST way to communicate with my doctor!,
I love using my chart. It's easy access for my whole family and we don't need to move around here and there for out test results or appointment reminders or any sort of stuffs. Best part is we can add as many medical groups as we want. Love it,
"It's so convenient, I love it!!!!",
"I would rate the app higher except I'm so annoyed and irritated that there are notifications I can never get rid of. ""Update Information""""Paperless Billing""""Diabetic Eye Test"" I'VE UPDATED, I DON'T WANT OR CARE ABOUT PAPERLESS BILLING AND I'VE DONE THE EYE TEST!!! I don't see any way to dismiss the notification, and if the drs office is supposed to, THEY AREN'T! Please give the patients the ability to dismiss the notifications.",
I I haven't talked to anyone yet I'm in the hospital I will call them later. In the morning I have nothing at this moment I can't log into the portion of my account down below I keep trying so I'll try to get too the end and we'll see what happens I can't get in I keep trying I still can't get in I can't go on don't have anything else to say.,
Details about visits and test results readily available. Easy to request follow up with my doctors.,
The staff is so friendly and helpful.,
Very useful and easy to use.,
Nothing for adventhealth. Although they sent me an email saying i can access my kids chart through this,
Extremely easy to use,
Super easy to use,
Exceptional and so very convenient,
Long ways to go to make it useful. Something simple like print test results with graphs would be nice. Looking at it and taking multiple screen shots are not today's technology.,
Very satisfied with no problems yet,
Wonderful app that keeps my medical appointments and medical records in one place for easy access. The app is easy to use and navigate. It is great for communicating with my doctors' offices and for requesting referrals & medication refills.,
Taking 6 months to diagnose my rare disease and during a year of treatments MyChart kept me informed and on track.,
The whole staff was very professional,
Takes so so so long to loaded. But is very important to me.,
Great app. It is a great help to alot of people.,
It's an awesome app and easy to use.,
I have control over my health and I am able to ask a question without having to make an appointment which would cause me to ignore symptoms but now I know my health plan.,
"Love the MyChart app, it's easy to see all your info right in front of you, plus getting test results etc from your Dr so quickly makes the burden of waiting disappear. Easy to read n use, very impressive. I've told all my family n friends about this app. Go try it....👍",
Everything I need and easy to use!!!!,
An excellent tool for managing one's complete medical records.,
IT'S A WONDERFUL APP I LOVE IT LET'S ME KNOW MY RESULTS BEFORE THE DOCTOR DOES AMAZING,
Wonderful app to have and very helpful.,
I one loved it now I'm fighting to see my results as it just says error,
Perfect app everything you need in one app,
"Works great, very convenient!",
The only thing I usually don't do is make an appointment. I would rather speak to a person,
Great app! I get more information here than my pcp,
"Bad experience, I can't see all my records.",
"I do like this app, very easy and convenient, but it has not let me log on through the app for like 2 weeks. Either with the code or my sign in information. Also it'd be great if there were more available medical facilities you could link. Or track your medical history via your insurance history",
It's easy to keep up with my medical history. Love it,
"I want to be able to give every healthcare provider unlimited access to every healthcare record of me that exists anywhere. I don't want to provide individual permissions to each one, I want a centralized place where any Dr. anywhere can see any treatment I've ever had. - Sometimes MyChart works fairly well because that specific provider has tuned the functions. Other providers' MyChart site/app barely works, I have to log in again... And it's The Standard for medical providers everywhere.",
"So many errors no means to correct them. Not a single organization I've linked has a means of correcting information that is incorrect regarding your medical history. No place to call or email, no form, nothing. Bad enough so many places force us to use mychart, at least there could be a means of correcting mistakes.",
"I had to call for help with MyChart & Mae said she worked for Bon Secours, however, she took me through a circle of nonsense, delete this, add that, etc.., & still did not fix the issues before passing the buck. In times past, MyChart ppl knew their expertise, but it has dwindled away since then. I am not pleased at all. She should just state she does not know how to get it to work. Time was wasted, & to no avail, nothing.. Very disappointing..smh.",
Easy to.maneuver around. Dr.'s are quick to respond. I find this app so much better than calling the office as they are so busy & you get put on hold. I love the app. It has all of your health information ri right in one spot for you to see.,
I downloaded this but it is full of bugs.. doesn't load anything quickly or at all. I can't enter in new info or easily navigate the app. I just use mobile web browser to get the job done instead.,
"So far my experience with this has been dismal. For example, I can't get message to anyone unless I submit it as a complaint. There should be a general email box. I believe that there is probably a lack of training at my provider's office as well.",
"I like my information being at my finger tips. I have noticed though my allergies are no where to be found. It is something that I feel should be included. Also when your in the app there is no area to find help, that option is only prior to signing in.",
"It's okay, disappointed that it crashes often. My 1st use with the virtual visit with my Dr. it crashed twice so a real bother. Don't expect to be able to access everything in the app as you can with My Chart online .",
Everything is easy to find and use. The app is easy to navigate in general. It is also super convienente to have all your results at your disposal and to be able to message your Dr on one app.,
"This App, though not alwaysthe most user-friendly, has made my medical life so easy to track. I can access every blood test, operation notes, kids' vaccinations, husband's history, all in one place. And, we are all in different states and yet the systems all speak to one another. THANK YOU to the team who created this.",
"I absolutely love using MyChart. I don't know how I ever managed my Healthcare without it. I can send messages to my doctor, request prescription Refills, see my test results and make appointments. I was able to see my x-ray results before an ER doctor even came in to talk to me about them. It's a brilliant and helpful app.",
"I've been running into errors while trying to open the app or read messages that comes from doctors. Hasn't been this way up until two weeks ago now I'm just irritated idk if it's an update happening but it doesn't say so on my end, just to try again later",
"You need this app! This is how one stays pro-active on their health, and the care they need. Getting my reports asap is important to me. There are also some links to explain test if needed. No need to wait on a phone, you make doctors appointments with a few options. MyChart gives you access to your test and diagnostics that give you the tools to understand how to be pro-active in your health care.",
"Had a zoom visit today. Was very clear but had to switch to my cellphone due to the volume wasn't working. Recieved messages promptly. All over great experience. I do have a virtual visit tomorrow 12/1/21 @ 11am, hopefully that will go well on my tablet but I do have my phone for back up.",
This app is great. If you have several clinics that use it; you can have full access to your medical information. More often than not I'll know results of tests before the doctor tells me and sometimes before they've even had a chance to review them. There's a direct message option that offers real time updates not necessarily requiring a visit.,
Very easy to work app,
"Really enjoy the App. Keeps everything organized, pay bills ,order prescription. A big help ..... very helpful. Also allows you to receive all your test results and to store them for future reference. Great app ❤️",
I love being able to see my test results myself and read Doctors notes at my leisure.,
I've had a very good experience with this app and My Chart. One never has to wait on results or someone to call. Results are downloaded in a reasonable amount of time. It's definitely a valuable resource.,
I believe MyChart is the best way to keep up with test results and Dr's comments. It is very useful when seeing other Dr's and not tell exactly what test results are and the visit summary. I may get it wrong or forget something. With this I just open MyChart and let's the Dr's read it for themselves. No problems with interpretation. Great tool for my health care.,
"Love being able to get results without waiting for a phone call. The fact you can converse back and forth again, without making a phone call during business hours!",
"Never been happier about any other app. Love it I finally get to see my chart. X-rays. CT scan what have you.. it's there with images and notes from the doctor. What doctor where and when your appointments are. Reminders and contactless registering, scheduling, messages to your doctor with him alot of time texting you back ASAP All in the MyChart App, on my phone. Life is better.",
This is the best use of technology in my life. It's an incredible way to interact with your medical team so easily and quickly.,
"This medical review format is by far the best communication source for expedient information, records, documentation, questions, answers, and test result references, with various ""real time"" tool buttons for choices, preferences, and direct responses for seemingly all our medical correspondences with physicians, staff, admin and departments within a reasonable matter of time is without a doubt, simply absolutely amazing. Thanks, Epic Systems, and applause to Houston Methodist for choosing it.",
I have used this app for along time. Recently once an app't is scheduled it only shows the next one in line. I generally have several scheduled. As I can't see them know I have been making conflicting app'ts. To much stuff that is not needed. No longer a useful tool.,
"Literally the worst app for making appointments. It's nice and runs smooth but no matter what I try it would not let me make an appointment. It just says ""you aren't in life threatening conditions. You should look for this and that or call an ambulance"" so basically it's useless for making appointments",
"Great app when communicating with more then 1 provider. Provided they are a supported organization. They update the app (I think it should happen more then they do, but i know thats not reality). App is stable on Android Samsung Note 10+, running Android 12, N975USQS7HVCD.",
"This my chart app I use for all my medical appointments is awesome. I can check the results of my vitals every month for the past 5 years and view the notes and summary that are actually entered by the nurse and doctor..... But most of all I can message my doctor and get a direct answer from her same day which saves time and money. If you're not using the My Chart app which works with all kinds of health networks and pharmacies, then you are cheating yourself out of better medical care.",
"It was complicated to set up the video chat at first but I had to keep reading over the directions several times. I felt very anxious about getting the video chat up and running. With prayer and help from Christ Jesus, Father God and the Holy Spirit and my spouse the video chat began to actually work through prayer and patience. It is now working well but another problem has arisen and that is the Zoom video chat. We could not acces Zoom because of the down load of the Google installation.",
Love the app. Gives me all my medical information at the tip on my fingers. Only problem I have lately is that it doesn't pop on my phone any more. It always showed me automatically when something was posted. Lately I only find out when I get an email. Not sure it is the app or my phone.,
"Slow, cluttered interface. More troubling, it is kind of creepy that hospital personnel can tell when you've looked at your own records on the app. That seems like a privacy concern.",
"We all visit multiple organizations even in a year. It's crazy that for every health organization, user has to create a new account. This means I won't have access to my data in a unified place. This is made for companies not for users. Shame that it could have been much better. Maybe a central account for user to aggregate all data.",
Love the app but I constantly get notifications to review and revise my contact information. I've checked and there's nothing wrong with the information.!! Very frustrating!,
"Good communication between doctors and self. Good and easy to order refills.. I wanted to download this again so I could add hubby's MyChart separately on my phone, instead of having to change usernames, depending on whose tests we wanted to see. But once downloaded it just says open, be 😄",
"I absolutely love this app. I had so many appointments while I was pregnant and this app helped me keep track of all of my appointments and medications. Plus, it made it so much easier to get in touch with my doctor with any questions or concerns I had. Definitely the most useful app on my phone. I've never had a single issue with it.",
"New update: The billing info page is lovely, except: It doesnt provide an address mailing of payment.... Also, Insurance companies require: payee name, address, invoice #, & account #, if you can't provide that, my HSA won't allow me to pay you! Please fix asap. My doctors are waiting to be paid. Perhaps a scanned copy of the bill could be made available ?",
"I use the MyChart app to keep in contact with all my physicians. I also do my scheduling of appts with the app. Lastly, I receive my monthly statement through the MyChart app. My only issue is that the billing statements ARE NOT visible to those I have chosen to give full viewing permission.",
Great place to find all your medical information.,
I love the ability to communicate with my care providers!!!,
"It was working great for years, now suddenly it's lost all of the providers I had setup through it, and nothing shows up when searching. Completely unusable now & very frustrating!",
"App seems quite good, but appears to be blocked when in any NHS Hospital. All other apps work perfectly, so the blockage must be intentional. Mystifying!! Thank you for your remarks, but feel that you have not understood my review. I was commenting on several NHS Trusts that do support your app. (Manchester University, Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, are two examples.)",
"Very convenient to check messages and see test results or talk with your doc, MyChart rock! Thank you, thank you, good night Seattle. **music eclectically plays in the background then suddenly stops and the crowd goes wild**",
It's a very good app I can schedule and cancel any appts and request any refills. And leave messages for my doctor. It's very easy to use and I can see my test results which is very convenient.,
"Incredibly incompetent. I have notifications for a message and when I log in there's nothing to find. Also, I have multiple messages that are ignored and sometimes messages that I have sent to the doctor vaporize. I'll be changing doctors that use this ""Mychart"" app",
"Horrible app, the old application that planned parenthood used was so much easier and better for women and men.",
"Only wish ALL doctors & Pharmacy's & Canadian hospitals used this, as a mandatory app for less confusion and faster access.",
"I like being able to message my providers. And have them answer me quickly and coordinate care. However the cancel appointment button doesn't work well and I still have to call the office to make sure it was canceled and the therapist and office knows, otherwise it is a no show. Alison Kistner",
Love it 💕 its give you all the information that u need.,
"I love it. Love the fact that its easy to use for a non tech person like my self. It is easy to communicate and ask for refills without having to call amd put on hold. Just dont like that old stuff from months ago is still there, it doesnt go away.",
"Every time I try to open a chart are a update I get a error and it closes so I never see what it is I need to update, I know it's very helpful when it works, but not working. (There is a big improvement on this app.) Very good 👋",
"I love this app. I can schedule appointments, confirm or cancel appointments, read results of tests, talk with health care physician between appointments, and pay and view statements. It's also easy to use.",
For the love of my sanity why does this app only recognize my username some of the time and then tell me its incorrect!!!!! Then tells me my password is incorrect when it is not and oooooo boy do you have to jump through hoops to change it or even get an email for it. If i could id throw this app in somebodys face because its flawedddd. Now i can say if i log on through the website its hit or miss but i havent been able to use this app to check my chart even though.,
Very helpful app to have for all you're medical appointments and medical needs and information. It is so convenient to use for setting up appointments and scheduling issues also when work and Minnesota weather make it hard to get to in person visit mychart app is able to do video visit with your doctor or nurse. You can also connect other clinics and hospitals to the app to have all your medical information in one place. 5 stars I highly recommend 👌,
Hopefully using MyChart reduces the workload and phone traffic for clinic employees. It takes a little practice to become accustomed to but provides ease and privacy to the patient. I love being able to ask a question in the app and getting a reply within three days. MyChart makes me feel more in touch with my own Healthcare. KUDOS!,
"Virtual appt with my Dr this morning. The video and sound showed it was working, but when my doctor spoke I saw her name only highlight for a split second at the end of what looked like each sentence, but then nothing. She looked at me like it was my fault. She tried unplugging her earbuds/mic, but all I heard was a loud click. We'd done this before a year ago with no issue. Support said only the Dr's office could do a test video call and they said they weren't given instruction how to. 🫤",
Very informative and you're able to send the appointment information to your calendar which is a HUGE help,
Too dang many notifications for same thing.,
"Was working wonderfully until the last couple of days when I receive an error stating that the app can't communicate with the server and won't let me sign in. Strange, because when I try to sign in to my provider on the web and not through the app, I can? Epic, thoughts on this?",
"I am very pleased with the simplicity, and connectivity of the App. I can see all of my medical appointments on my linked providers. I appreciate the ability to communicate with providers quickly through the App, and to see when they last saw the note.",
Horrible App! Constant errors! I have to try opening it 4 plus times before it actually lets me log on. Then when ever I click on my files or info it gives me another error another 3-7 times before that file loads. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE APP! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!,
"Very easy to get to important health documents and can make appointments, see results ect..",
"Love that I can contact my Dr's through this, no more waiting on the phone. Have never had an issue with getting responses back from all my Dr's. I get test results back through mycharts as soon as they are entered. Refills for prescriptions is so easy, do it all with mycharts. I am a huge fan of this app, highly recommend for people who have to interact with Dr's on a regular basis, especially multiple Dr's",
"Overall l really like this app., but the change in ordering prescriptions, calling pharmacy instead of ordering online, is not a time saver at all. Before everything was done in the app med folder. Now l have to go to app to request ""no refill"" Rx, then call in the Rx #'s for refill. All done on my phone in med folder. l am fully aware that changes are generally done for a reason and sometimes the package that has to be bought to get what management needs is not what the patient needs.",
"This has allowed my knowledge of my health information and history to be accessible and clear. I review every appointment to revisit doctor notes, see test results, and manage upcoming appointments. (I like to review with a clear mind when not trying to absorb everything in the 30 min visit). Aligns all providers and care teams. Effective, efficient, well informed.",
"Have been using this app to communicate questions, concerns, medication refills and keeping track of past and future appts. Each doctor or their nurses get back in a short period of time. You can even attach pictures or copies of documents. Your list of prescribed medications are at your finger tips whenever needed. A description of your last appointments, showing not only the chief complaint, but more importantly, the doctors answer and advise and any meds they prescribed at the visit.",
"Can't install! It requires a plugin as well as a system installation for laptops, where it doesn't work on Chromebooks. Somehow the Android app is not configured properly to install on a chromebook either, which is just a matter of badly specifying the system requirements in manifest files. Edit: does not work in chrome on Chromebook, or on a Mac either",
"Convoluted method of getting simple test result. I was unable to get my test results. I was only offered a device, that has been inactive for several years, as my receiving device for the test results. Just send me an email with the results. Why do I have to jump through hoops to get a simple result? This test reporting is an abomination. Did this get exported from China along with the virus?",
It's a headache and you can't add your insurance to it so you get an estimate of a prepay due before appointment. You can't add your children to your profile by simply adding their information you have to have special forms and sign them. But the app doesn't work when you have your email ap open and you can't exit out of the ap or it will ask you to verify urself but won't send the code to email if both apps are open. So you have to have a laptop or computer to fully set it up.,
its easy to use and has great features. only drawback is getting unnecessary reminders for vaccines/screening removed. However you can hide them for a period of time.,
Great experience It makes it so much easier to get results especially in the ER I get them before the doctor tells me . I'm able to make appointments easy instead of being on hold and there's a wait list option. I can send pictures and messages to my doctor's and connect other hospitals as long as they provide you account info codes so everything is at one place and also allows your doctor access your information and you can show them on your phone as well. Easy peasy love this app!!!,
I love the MyChart app it makes it so easy to access my records and to see everything I need to see without being at my doctor's office and now it makes it easier to share records with other offices and there's no interruption with any ads or anything it is perfect,
"Best way to connect to all your physicians in one app. You can upload pictures and get copies of the letters sent on your behalf as well. When you need vital information for meds and medical conditions and how it's being treated or even request refills, medication lists your care teams. And it makes you seem more technology adept",
"This app makes it easy to see everything done or scheduled to be done. Wish it had pictures uploaded with test results so you can see the same images the doctors see. Also, the ability to communicate with doctors and nurses without having to sit on hold. Also, access to medical information is readily available.",
I very much appreciate having all my medical information in one place accessable to me 24)7. It is extremely nice to see any and all great results quickly and easily understood. My only issue has been occasional difficulty with e check in.,
Been trying for months to be able to make payments on this app the only options are to go back or cancel !! If I do either I lose all my credit card info I just put in there!! I have call people too !!,
Previously rated and apparently removed. We need to be able to update the upcoming or procedures with dates and a file attachment to include the reports for outside facilities. Endless Mountains Health Systems of Montrose pa needs to get on board as well. I did try to send email as requested but it immediately crashed with send.,
"Haven't seen ads at all but it keeps you Informed of everything relavent as well as let's you make notes for doctor, message doctor, request refills on medication, set appointments and even let's you electronically sign papers before you even go to the appointment, saving you time from doing these things upon arrival. Probably one of my most useful apps",
"The app is great to check for appt times and test results. However, you will not be able to schedule appts through the app if you are a patient that has Medicaid as your insurance. The schedules are blocked and you will have to call to have the operator leave a message for the provider's assistant to call you back and schedule your appointment.",
Easy to use. It's a great way to schedule or change appointment times/dates. I can see test results as soon as they are available. I can see visit summaries. I can send refill requests. All of this from my phone.,
I wish I never updated the orevious version worked so much better. Updates to records take forever and thats if you can even sign on. Error with every sign in attempt or any navigating. Im trying to check new results and it keeps giving error. What is going on?,
I love MyChart! It's so convenient and makes it very easy to contact my doctor and review the after visit summaries. I love that everything I need to access is in one location. It's always available if i have to see a specialist and provide medical history. Thanks so much for this app.,
Aphasia is one of my many disabilities. I am very hard to understand not only because my speech patterns but the more stressful the situation or how I'm being treated 100% makes it so much worse and most of the time I'm just not understood. And it leaves me stressed depressed and terribly angry. Also during the stressful times I will not be able to read a sentence in its correct pattern I will hear what people say that's grammatically incorrect and and or the sentences are just completely back,
"WORST APP, NOT AT ALL USEFUL. If the app is inisting to change/cancel appointments by phone then what is the use of online App?? 1.Could not cancel or reschedule the appointment with the provider, all we can do is to call them which never connects. 2.There is no way to connect to the provider directly. Just send no person message and wait for mercy. 3.Calls are deliberately kept on hold,no person to attend, waited for a hour and are getting disconnected Trash App....Please don't rate high.",
"I so appreciate this MyChart app. Reports quick test results in detail, tracks up-coming appointments, lists and tics off ""to do"" screenings and health recommendations and reports acct balances. I especially like the e-checkin feature and the fact that I can announce my arrival with the click of a button. Love using it and sharing the test info/visit summaries with my wife who is a nurse and asks more question than I can usually answer after a doctor visit--now I just open the app and show her.",
"The intent and premis of the system is OK but it's only as good as the information entered into the system by the doctors, nurses, technicians, etc. So far I find that it falls short in that regard. A lot of my information is missing, including doctor reports, peocedures, and test results.",
Doesn't reconcile terrible hospitals not getting your logins correct. I have two overlapping accounts that a hospital accidentally made so my chart is useless. Hospital blames app. App blames hospital,
It's great for communicating with the clinic team,
I have been using the MyChart app since my doctor introduced it to me. It allows me to keep track of all my office visits as well as my labs. It's only a touch away and that's a super convenience me. I can pre register before my appt and pay my copay right through the app. Thank you MyChart for making managing my health care a whole lot easier. Kathy P.,
Love having all my health & medical information at my fingertips. Being able to check in on the app for in office appointments is super convenient. Being able to access & view test results is also extremely helpful.,
"My chart makes life easier for me. I can send messages to my doctors and get a quick response and am able to get in to see my doctor on the same day. I always have access to all my meds list, test results, appointments and all my ailments. Great app, thanks for making my life easier.",
It's still new to me but so far easy to understand and use.,
"I absolutely LOVE being able to check my test results, make appointments, message my Dr. And view charts. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this resource",
I half to give it one star but I wouldn't. I think is away for people you don't want to get your info can. I don't trust it. I can't get to my prescriptions. My doctors notes. The whole app is junk. Can't schedule an appointment either they just told me it was fixed nothing has changed. Only thing that works is when my appointments are and where. Does nothing like the people that are telling me it's fixed,
"The app is still well developed, and is snappy and smooth. But... I noticed that with the Duck Duck Go app tracking protection, that there are trackers from Google that are being blocked. These tracking attempts are looking for many different types of data. Such as, location, full name, GPS coordinates, email address, zip code, and ECT. Privacy should be a number 1 concern with medical apps... Even the EBTedge app for SNAP benefits doesn't have trackers violating your privacy...",
Retirement dates should have option to enter a year or select a year. When a person retired 10 years ago you have to scroll to over 100 screens to reach your date.,
"Excellent medical app, easy to use and up to date information quickly.",
"Generally great, and easy to use. Annoying that I must always use 2-step authentication on my personal PC, despite my request, filled out each time, to not have to do so.",
I'm glad it exists but the implementation is pretty bad. I have accounts with multiple providers for multiple people (myself and my children) but the notification that there's a new message doesn't indicate which provider or which person the notification is for.,
"My doctor and medical staff are always available. I'm i67 and beginning to lose my memory. I have called them a few times because I couldn't remember if I taken my pills or not. They told me what to do, or patched me through to Poison Control. Also the virtual visits are a tremendous help to me because I can keep my favorite doctor, Dr Kerr, even though I moved away from Orem to Salt Lake City. This app is super easy to use!",
"Works ok, but app can be annoyingly slow at times",
"it has been a great app until last update. now I van not use my fingerprint. i can set it up and it might work one time, then next it will not work and turns off the setting. please fix this. I will raise my rating",
Love this app! I use several hospitals & providers and having them be able to connect and share info in one place has made my life so much easier. No more faxing files or waiting for results and appointments can be made right in the app.,
"Good app,well designed. Like that there is biometric login. One problem I noticed is that appointments don't show what the appointment is for. I think that would be a nice added feature.",
I am so grateful to have access to all my medical records and information. It's such a blessing!,
"Somewhat convenient, but feels like an unfinished app. Quite a few functions lead you to a website when pressed, instead of being available within the app. Please finish developing the app.",
"I totally love MyChart, I can find out anything I want to know about tests, meds, etc. I also love the fact that I can make and/or change appointments without being on hold with the doctor's office. Amazing app!!!!!",
"Honestly the only App I use faithfully and to it's full potential besides the apps pertaining to paying vendors for home bills. TRUE. My Chart makes communication with my physician more simpler , it's private and I wouldn't be in the great physical and phycological shape I'm in with out it.",
"UPDATE: Still not right. SOMEONE, Epic or UVA, needs to automatically email a confirmation of the prescription request AND a record of previous requests. I will be without an important med for 3 days because while I THOUGHT I requested a refill, evidently it didn't make it into the system AND THERE WAS NO WAY (that I knew of) to check the status, no confirmation.",
"What is wrong with this app? It worked fine. Just tried logging in and NOW, it asks where I get my health care and I CAN'T GET PAST THAT SCREEN. SOOO, it doesn't work at all and all my previous records don't show up...needs a severe overhaul...",
Always quicks and efficient,
Love the My Chart app that helps me keep up with me.,
"Very helpful app, very easy to use",
Unique. Always put me on know of my scheduled appointments or any other requirement of the hospital,
Easy to use . Great job,
Very helpful and informative!,
As today still can not log into the app. 1 week,
"My Chart is an excellent choice to get the best of the best... Doctor Patient relations. I love the fact I do not have to wait for next office visit to view the status of my healthcare, and lab results....Amen to My Chart",
All in one stop shop. This app is amazing,
Always says error with the server,
Very helpful to go back review and ask questions,
"The best app for finding out Drs appointments, test results, and much more",
Easy to navigate.,
Terrible when you can't speak to your family doctor ! This causes mistakes in ordering prescriptions ! Older people have problems with this !!,
I like how I can get in touch with my providers and ask them questions without having to play phone tag with them.,
Easy to navigate,
The app has several functions that do not work,
I love this app but I can't log into it when will Will it be back up again,
Excellent services overall satisfaction was guaranteed.,
1)Sometimes difficult to navigate. 2)For the past several months lab orders have not shown under Upcoming Tests and Procedures...through early June 2022 they did. This is a BIG issue if you proactively manage your healthcare. If lab orders are not viewable how is someone to know how/whether to prep prior to lab work. For thus reason alone I've given this app a poor rating. 3)Messaging is not optimal with the way messages are segregated. One has to 'dig' for messages at times.,
Works great to get results fast,
Awesome - very promp and helpful.,
I have found this application to be very helpful and informative.,
"Now it doesn't work, keeps saying internal error.",
Sometimes hard to find prescription information or converse in chat with a live person.,
"MyChart empowers me! Immedate access to visit information, test results and communications makes me the best informed patient possible. Thank you, MyChart!",
My healthcare place is not listed. An email suggested I install this app.,
Easy to navigate.,
So cool how I got my records right in the palm of my hand. Thanks MyCharts ur the best,
"Love MyChart: especially being able to send messages to doctors, check test results & check for referral authorizations.",
Nice to have a little more training on the app,
"Loving having My Chart! Easy to Speak with my Healthcare team, refill Medication and Check tests.",
"This app is only getting better over time. I was hospitalized earlier this month and I was seeing my test results (blood and urine tests mostly) as soon as our even before my doctors were. I could pull them up and discuss them in real time. In general, I schedule appointments and add them directly to my Google calendar, check in for my appointments, email my doctors, and verify my immunizations via this app. It hasn't let me down yet.",
Love it. Very useful and easy to use,
Easy to use. very helpful.,
Easy and helpful to use,
This is the best app! It's so easy to read.,
All are with high quality,
Life saver helps you keep in touch with your doctor and stay updated on your info in 1 app,
Amazing app!!!!Easy to use!!!,
Good place make and good professional,
I've found it to be very helpful and useful.,
"Only draw back here is you message your doctor and never get a reply back as stated you will. This has happened a few times now, so I'm not happy over this..",
Easy to use love the app.,
I had an appointment today and the app kept closing.,
It needs to have a widget for appointments that are coming up,
Easy to use! Best app on my phone!,
I love my chart appt it's a great tool.,
Great way to contact and recap of what you went over with the Dr,
Very useful and easy to use,
I absolutely love mychart so convenient with my schedule.,
So nice to know what's going on without waiting forever for the next office visit. Love having all my information in one place,
"I like that I can talk with my medical staff and get my refills on my meds, or if there is an issue, I can contact my Dr",
I love the convenience of MyChart!,
Convenient isn't the best word!,
"Great app, very convenient. Love it and would recommend it to anyone. Never had any problems.",
Easy-to-use allowed to follow what's going on was beneficial to me,
"Its a lot in the beginning, in the end it makes life so much easier",
"I love that you can pay your bills, look up things, and text your doctor.",
Yes it would nice to see all my stuff including pace pathway immanuel,
Enjoy not having to wait to speak to the medical provider and/or nurse.,
"Cleveland clinic is one of the best in Florida. I love the peace and personalizes service I get from my providers. Dr. T Jose, Dr. Pimalova, Dr. Alvarez and Dr. Braun are all great. They talk to me clearly, answer all my questions during visits and through messaging via Mychart. Dr. Roger Alvarez( pulmonologist) is the best. I trust and follow him any where. I have been his patient for years and wouldn't trade.",
Very helpful in managing some of my doctors,
Everything I need to know from my physician is there eazy to communicate with the Doctor,
Helpful and concise,
Easy to reach my doctor and make appointments,
Love the ease of use.,
Love this app. Keeps me updated on everything I need.,
never could get signed up or no one got to us on the phone. ugh,
Fairly easy to use,
"This app is easy but needs serious adjustments to accommodate people with disabilities. Like there's no way to record a message for your doctor. You HAVE to type it out. You can't record & upload videos either. Just attach a max of 3 images. There's no translator to help out immigrants/non-native speakers of English who want to describe their pain/medical concerns but can't find the words or dont know how to explain themselves fully. If you want s.th. fixed, good luck finding who to contact.",
Good but would like to add BEDFORD SOUTH WING HOSPITAL,
Dismal. I'm not laughing at all. You know all personal medical info can now be hacked. This app enables businesses to use your medical info,
Very convenient and professional I love it 😀,
Love the easyness of the site,
Set it up and still can't get in That's after I set it up.,
Easy and quick,
Very easy to keep in touch with my doctors,
Very slow to connect,
Mychart is awesome. I love being able to communicate with my Dr directly.,
Easy and fast,
I'm not a patient person so when I can't even sign up an account for the app and the app doesn't tell me what other information they need for me to sign up then I'm uninstalling. This shouldn't be confusing. The app is flawed because it's not informative of what you actually need to sign up. Without the silly confirmation code I never got in the first place.,
"From a patient perspective, this is terrible. Never up to date with medical information, loses information on medications that were provided, and care team is never aligned even after appointments are logged in service. There is no way for a patient to contact Epic MyChart support or provide feedback to what is clearly on MyChart to resolve If you are a care provider, please ask for a demo from the patient perspective so you can see how terrible this tool is. I'm not a fool around technology; I can't imagine what the experience must be for clients with less experience trying to navigate. Expect more!",
I keep getting this message for the past 2days. When trying to log in. There was a problem communicating with the server please try again later. I have not been able to log in. Is the server down? Ok i just sent the email. I will update my review as soon as matter is resolved. Thank you for your timely response.,
"App won't verify my phone number. It keeps saying that it will text me a code but never does. Several things, including previous test results, require you to load the webpage which defeats the purpose of having an app.",
"I really like the access that the app provides. I haven't figured out how to access my chart at other healthcare systems such as UW Health. If there is a way to get access or combine them, it would really be beneficial.",
I absolutely love the fact that I can access all of mine and my children's medical records when ever I need to and the app is so easy to navigate as well. I also really like that I can see appointment reminders at all times so that we don't forget and miss appointments.,
"It is a great time saver, at least with my Doctor. She responds promptly, and app provides lot of info that would take a long time to gather telephonically. Can order refills effortlessly. One of the most efficient apps I have (of over 200).",
"I have been using MyChart for a few years. It took a while to sort out details, but it works great now. Easy to communicate with providers, schedule appointments and view test results. Also, MyChart can link with other systems that use My Chart. Eg: I have accounts with Reliant and CVS and information from both are shared. Highly recommended.",
"Love using the app. So easy to check results, and schedule appointments",
The app is oriented to making interactions convenient and secure for the providers. It is very limited in the ability to communicate or share data from a member/patient such as bulk load vitals or documents. Limited to the messaging within the app and a couple of pictures. Not helpful when trying to share critical datasets with my provider.,
MyChart app is very easy to navigate and use. I appreciate being able to have access to my test results and records. Also the upcoming visit information is a good way of keeping track of appointments.,
"I signed up as required by two of my doctors and for that it has been an ok portal. BUT terrible coordination with participating companies like CVS. My Chart invites me to sign up with CVS and makes me go through the whole f******g process before it becomes apparent that of the 50 CVS clinics to choose from, the one I use is NOT in this list. BIG waste of time and big aggravation. This is so backwards but could be easy to fix. Hope this post helps to make that happen for other users.",
"Extremely useful for update data,messages,calender",
"I love this app! It is extremely helpful and informative. Calling them quick and easy, but this is even faster and more helpful since you can get your test results without having to wait on the phone while they are looked up.",
"Even though I have my sons account attached to my own, I am unable to see upcoming and past appointments, I cannot see the list of doctors, I cannot see vaccines, it's basically a blank screen, I cannot even request appointments or refills. I have to call for any information and even then I have to drive to an office to sign a form to get a limited list of what I need. Why even offer an account for minors if the LEGAL PARENT isn't allowed to access ANYTHING.",
"It is frustrating the amount of excess information hanging around my home page. Example: you have 5 msgs. I click on msgs - #1 I only see 2 msgs, and #2 back to my home page it still says I have 2 msgs. Its the same with notifications. All I want to see on my home page are - current appointments, my bill and contact info. I received my covid vaccine elsewhere, but I keep seeing ""you haven't scheduled your vaccine,"" but I should be able to enter that info too.",
"good app BUT only if you are in the states. I can't access it if I am out of the country, which I am often, thats one of the main times you would need to message your doctor!!! or check test results if you don't want to spend tons of money to keep calling the office go check. please fix this!",
"App works great, issue im having is some test results will just load and load until it throws an error or even worse it closes the entire app. This doesnt happen with all test results only some.",
"There is a quicker response time and easier than playing ""phone tag"" with your physician. Also you can make sure you say everything you want to say before sending the message so you don't forget something. On a phone call you sometimes feel rushed and forget things. This app is the way to go!!!!",
Don't trust this app. I've tried getting my COVID-19 test results and you find out afterwards you have to download and set up account for multiple times and at the end of two days and doing an account 57 times it won't let me access anything and I can't get my results of test. These apps are what's wrong and chances why more infection. Jump thru hoops for absolutely not a God Damn Thing being resolved and no contact info given. But they sure want your info upfront. So they can get paid. Liars,
"This app is great, I enjoy using it. Yakima Farmworks clinic is great and they are very helpful.",
"Easy to use, especially during these times where the medical offices tend to be so busy that you cannot reach a live person. Quick responses. Even the mychartplus check-in works well. You can get detailed results for all of your tests before you get it from your doctor. There's no waiting. Highly recommend.",
"I always like using the My Chart, as it let's you talk directly with your doctor and you have access to your medical records, i.e., test results as soon as they are available without having to wait for them to arrive via U.S. Postal (mail). It is a very convenient tool to have access to any time.",
Absolutely ridiculous to work with. If somebody enters your personal information incorrectly you can't access results. When you call to get technical help they will fix the clerical error and you will be asked to create another account instead of merging the info. They offer to transfer you to somebody who can email results and you will be disconnected each time. This is worthless.,
"When entering address for my ICOE needs a search function for the state & county so we don't have to scroll a long list. when entering phone number you shouldnt make Home phone # required because most people don't have that. The dashes should automatically go in. When upcoming lab work is required, have a note on the lab work if we should be fasting, fasting liquid & solid or solid only, & for how long. email function i can no longer tell if it's been read.",
"This app is soooo convenient! My Drs office is a 45 min drive (Great Doctor) so its worth the drive but I love that I can just do a video call and get my medication! I also love that mychart keeps you updated on everything, you can use mychart to send in refill requests on your medications so u skip all the phone calls, this app has so much to offer!!! Thank you so much mychart this was genius!!!",
No problems. Great app.,
"Not that easy to navigate and sometimes seems useless to use. I have tried setting up appointments through my chart and it has never worked, I always have to call.",
"I have used this app, for years, and Love it and swear by it. I do wish there was a list, of all PC persons not just the ones I have seen, and the ability to remove any I no longer use.",
"Very easy to access, and it has everything I need to carry with me. as far as my contact information goes for my healthcare team and also my medical reports are all in one place to show my other doctors for follow up appointment. It is by far the best clinical app I have seen",
"I like that I can see my test results and view upcoming appointments. I'm still learning how to use other tools on this app like obtaining my medical records. I ended up accidentally downloading my medical records four times, and when I check who has viewed my medical records I see a long list of my name because I kept going into it trying to figure out how to obtain my records. However most of it is straight forward. I can make appointments with providers, view my list of medications, and etc.",
"NEGATIVE 1,OOO ⭐'s!!!! This app USED to be pretty good... UNTIL it forced me to ""update it"".... Now it SUCKS DONKEY BALLS!!!! It takes forever to load, ALWAYS has ""problems"" connecting with the servers, etc.! I HATE when I'm forced to update an app, and it makes the app not work!!!! UGH You guys at Epic should have left the app alone!! PLEASE FIX IT OR PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS!!!!!",
Is this what they call caring for me and easing my way. Tech support is useless and always reporting its not their issue or department. Unwilling to connect with providers outside Providence or review incorrect records. Support will simply refer you to your provider for corrections on the MyChart system which of course they cannot access. Come on Providence we can do better than this. What if I were a real patient (I am by the way) what must our patients think of us? Please start providing accu,
"I find this app extremely convenient in keeping track of my health records, doctor visit summaries, test results etc. It's much easier to use the app than it is to log onto the web each time I need to check in. It's like having my doctor's office in my pocket.",
"I absolutely LOVE this app! 99.9% of my contact with ANY of my doctors happens through MyChart. I don't have to sit on hold or wait for someone to answer the phone, I simply send any request I have through the app! I've had no issues with any aspect of the MyChart app. Best app EVER, period!!",
"I seriously cannot log in anymore. I loved this app. Ever since they updated though, it won't let me log in to check for appointments or send a message to my doctor. Please fix it! The only reason I'm leaving a one star rating is because the stupid thing won't let me in.",
"Cant make appointments on this app anymore due to the stupid covid virus. I dont think a virus should stop you from making an appointment with your Dr on the app. I downloaded this app specifically to make appointments with my Dr, due to the fact I have no working phone to call the Dr's office with to make an appointment. Ok not only can i not make appointments now but i cant view any of the chouces they give you to click on. For example, medications, letters and notes.",
It is easy to navigate and everything you need is at your fingertips,
"I've never had anything bad happen with this app, in fact I love it!",
"I have never had any issues with this app, works every time and is very convenient for keeping up with appointments, sending messages to Drs , echeck-ins , etc . Love it !",
"I love the app, it is very convenient. I am only leaving out one star because the app gave me the option link to a different hospital from another state which was awesome in and of itself but I haven't yet figured out a way to merge the medical history from one to another.",
Mychart only works sometimes it almost never works properly. You always have to change passwords constantly in order for it to log in. I do not recommend this app. Very disappointed with it.,
So easy to use and I love all the features you can access.,
"I'm Robert Murray and I'm a Google guide I have over a million views, I'm sure I have a lot more experience writing reviews than most people. It's quite amazing how most reviews that I've read while maybe inserting a small compliment up front always ends up complaining about something without offan a cure. This Application relieves a lot of stress and worry of the patients. It relieves the entire medical team of having to deal with the patient's worries and stress. Very well done!!!",
Love how I get results on the chart before my provider even calls me. Also had to get a new phone and was able to reinstall app with no problem. That's a big plus for those of us of a certain age.,
"This app has made it severely convenient for me to talk to my doctors, surgeons, request refills, everything. See my results. I love this app. If your doctors office offers the use of this app, I would highly recommend it.",
"It was working really good then within the past week I can't check my medications, my messages , I can't even leave a message because it keeps saying error. What do I do. I keep getting emails saying I need to refill my medications but I can't even open the page to see the list. Please help!!!!",
"Stop alerting that a bill is due only 3 days after it was issued (its not ""due"") and giving alerts saying my appointments are scheduled for x time which is 15min earlier than the appointment. Tell me when my appointment actually is, I'm capable of showing up early for checkin.",
No. This app is a nightmare. This company wants to get paid however if I need to do a screenshot of the payment it doesn't allow me to process. Also if a patient paid rhe balances down is impossible for a statement to be send out to see all the services has being paid. Please if you can stay away from anyone that is associated with this company your better off 😡,
"1. On My devices MyChart always says I can substitute a pin for a password, but it hardly ever works. 2. On my pc I always check the box to skip 2 factor authentication but 2 factor authentication is always required all the time. MyChart is a real hassle to use!",
"I get emails stating different features are now available on the app, but when I open it nothing has changed. It won't let me pay bills or schedule appointments. Pretty useless other than looking at past test results.",
"This is the app used by my healthcare provider, but I am unable to find its name or logo during the first step of its setup routine. My primary physician's nurse told me that I am not alone with this problem as others have mentioned they can't use this app for the same reason. Update. The link provided on the provider's website is to this app. Their member support confirms this is the app they currently use, that they are aware of the problem and that they are working on a solution.",
If you have doctor appointments and blood tests. It's a must have app ! Very easy to use ! With all the information you need !,
MyChart is everything I need to know about my health information at my fingertips 24 hours a day. I have the ability to communicate with all of my BJC health care professionals through this app. I can link my health care related organizations like CVS to this app. MyChart is the wave of the future and should serve as an exemplary model for all health care institutions.,
"This app rocks and if you want the results of a test before the doctor even knows it, GET THIS APP!!! It's easy to navigate and is a lot quicker than the telephone call to get prescriptions, to ask the doctor or nurse questions about anything, to make an appointment, etc. I repeat myself, but GET THIS APP.",
"It's wonderful to have all of your appointments and doctors in one portal but the billing is a pain, sometimes it doesn't go through and forget looking back at what you paid out of pocket. Under billing you get NOTHING! Hope this is rectified sooner than later...",
I used to love this app. So it used to be 10 stars for me. But the new layout is awful. I hate to be all negative but I liked the basic layout. And now u click menu and there's like 30+ items to choose from. I have christ and mercy. Christ chart layout changed first and I was like no I hate it. Now mercy has this awful layout now too. I work for a company that is constantly updating and changing the app and website and its like the developers dont use the app themselves and do whatever they want,
"Insists that it needs ""allow all the time"" location access before it will allow me to press the ""I'm here"" button to check in. There's no possible justification for that ask, ""while using the app"" is more than sufficient for this feature. I no longer trust this app or Epic to collect only the necessary information or to secure it appropriately, the developer is either incompetent and truly believes they need this permission, or is unethically collecting data they have no legitimate need for. Run",
It's better to keep a password diary than to expect this application feature to work when you need it to!,
logged in one time through the app with my email and password and now I can't get it to go back to logging in with my passcode . How do I change it back to the login with the passcode? I have looked through all of your documentation and tried just about everything and I cannot get it to go back . I wrote to the email address you include and it's not valid. I didn't want to uninstall and install the app.,
"I truly am enjoying this app. It is awesome it allows me to communicate with my doctors and nurses, who respond promptly with. And I have access to my records etc. This app to me saves much time and frustration that is usually associated with hospitals and doctor offices. I don't have to despise doc visits anymore, as long as I follow the prompts that are given with app and from the doctors office to cut wait times",
"Love it, I can keep up with my things.",
MyChart is a great way to interact with my Dr. not only setting up appointments but accessing all my test results present and past. Great app that is easy to navigate and has always worked flawlessly.,
I love being able to get into my Chart without having to go thru my email,
"It's been all bad I can't view important documents, diagnosis information, nor does customer service respond to my concerned questions .. 1 time in 8 months, 1 month ago... I don't get notifications of upcoming appts. The entire app has too much useless extras. I hate it !!",
"Very quick at updating your results and appointments/letters, etc. Almost immediate.",
"I love using My Chart I can see test results right away, my history is there if I need to see it.",
Is very resourceful and pretty easy to read I like it,
Excellent app for all my appointments,
"MyChart has been a very helpful resource for me. It's been so much easier for my being able to review results, scheduling appointments, and getting in touch with my specialists when needed.",
"The app constantly updates and the department at uhealth is very diligent maintaining and enhancing its features. Overall, this is a great tool to patients that one to connect and have access to their medical information, appointments, doctors, medications, etc.",
"Works brilliantly dealing with the hospital I'm linked to, but access via to it for my GP appears to be a total no-go🙄",
This app has made my life regarding my husbands appts n test results so very easy and up to date. The ONLY reason I didnt give all 5 stars is because there have been very many times i have wanted to message this one particular and i absolutely can not figure out how to begin a fresh message and send it. That is our ONLY issue. Thankyou,
Getting repeat reminders for oxygen and temperature readings is annoying as i don't have a sensor or thermometer. It'd be good if you could make these optional/ able to turn off reminders for them.,
"This app makes it easier to get an important message to my doctor. It's also easy to see my test results, make appointments, and refill my meds. I'm very happy with the app. I just hope the developers don't start making changes to it. It makes it difficult for older people to use it. It's fine just the way it is. Thank you",
"Very easy to use overall. My only complaint is that I can't upload a file larger than 1 MB through the app, making it difficult to send compiled files (Ex. Scanned paper medical records).",
"Just a INCREDIBLE app, just INCREDIBLE! The power that it gives to physically challenged and mentally ill patient is very humbling experience. The augmentation of human body and machine adaptation, is a wonderful concept for the future application of the medical field. Thank you MyChart!",
"MyChart app is great! It makes it easy to look up your results. I take care of my elderly mother and as POA I was able to track all her appointments, test results and medications she is receiving. It is great for when she is hospitalized I can see what care she is receiving since results are immediately loaded to her records.",
App is excellent if you have a family member admitted to inpatient. Lab results and chart updates are available as soon as they are input into the system. Helps to alleviate a lot of worry about the status of your loved one.,
"This is a great program. Makes it easier to see info and everything relevant to visiting doctors at multiple places or single place easy to handle. Thank you for the update. Really helps, especially during this rough time. Great app.",
I Do Not want my picture displayed on my chart. I did not ask for it or did not display it. Please remove it ASAP,
App is easy to use. Making appointments through the app is a breeze. I like paying my co pay before I get there. Get results quick and easy. This app helps you take control of your visit. Every once in a while someone gets it right. Well done.,
"Much better since it first came out. Logging on was a nightmare at first. I gave up on it until one of the nurses told me it was much better! I definitely like having my info at my fingertips since I have several chronic conditions that require swift action whenever possible. Thank You, Grey Kaminski",
"Since signing up with My Chart it has saved a lot of time. Also I am reminded of appointments, I usually put my appointment cards up for safe keeping it was so good I would forget where I put it. All of my meds are listed and easy to request a refill. The best is getting in touch with my doctor is so easy.",
My Chart is one of the most convenient and helpful apps I use. I appreciate being able to view my labs and visit summaries. The quick turn around time for results is outstanding.,
Like the app a lot and use it often I think it has a few problems as far as updating the charts and lab results. It needs work but they made some good upgrades already.,
"Upon trying to update my chart information I keep receiving a notice stating can not connect to servicer error, try again later. Also, the need to remember passwords or to receive a text or email to log on is Not user friendly for the aged who can't remember passwords Or has 5000 Passwords to Multiple other Accounts. I'm done, Over Passwords, oh Wait, that Was one of my Passwords, I Forgot to What Account?! DUH!!! 🤨",
I enjoy exploring and using the app very usefully and helpful.,
"ALWAYS a pain in the a**. About 90% of the time I have to re-sign up. It sure recognizes my info to send me texts out the ying-yang, but generally not enough to sign me in to view the full message.",
Everything was going well with the app until today! When I click on it to open it's blank with a spinning circle! I can't even open it up using Google! What's going on with it? I have appointments with specialists that I didn't put into my calendar because I relied on the app so much!,
"Easy to use and navigate, and has a central repository for my info from various providers. However, there is always ""an error"" when I try to log in, and the only way to get in is to create a new password each and every time. It's very frustrating.",
"Awesome because I can see everything for my account. But my son and I have different doctors. I don't see a way to add or switch between multiple account besides logging out and logging in to the other one. So maybe not great for a family, single person use is great though.",
"This is so convenient, simple, and quick I love this App.",
"The app has a server connection issue with my hospitals bill pay. The issue has lasted more than a year and the ""solution"" is for me to log into the hospitals bill pay from the hospital webpage instead of through the app. If I have to constantly contact the hospital anyway, what is the point of the app?",
Horrible experience at first kept getting error messages when trying to read a reply from my dr's office so I could not read it for two days only to learn that they want me to go to an er out quickly care as my doctor will not even look at my records for weeks. Now I updated my app thinking it will improve but now it won't connect to my organization much less read my messages. All I keep getting is a greyed out saying can't connect to organization try again.,
"I LOVE, LOVE ❤️ LOVE #MyChart and the fact that it's accurate, up-to-date, and complete information about my health at the point of care. It has enabled me quick access to my records for more coordinated, efficient care I am Securely sharing electronic information with my Dr's, hospitals, & other clinicians as they are with me. I think it reduces medical errors and provides safer care, improving patient and provider interaction and communication, as well as health care convenience. I LOVE IT ❤",
"Mychart gives all the information needed. However, the notifications sent to email could be a little more specific. More information so you know where to look on the app would be helpful.",
Most frustrating app i have ever used! Despite being signed in and actively using the app to navigate and use its services it will sign you out without warning and not save your draft or anything you have been working on. This has cost me.three hours.of time wasted just this week and for them to intentionally have a timer to sign you out when you are actively using the app makes no #$% sense. Do yourself a favor and avoid hours of useless frustration by avoiding this app altogether!!!,
"I get repeated messages, notes, & letters, some beneficial some not, but mainly I can't send a message which means I have to call the office & wait forever. The Good part is I can have my appointments go into my calendar & the address which is also linked to Google Maps, but I supposed if I had a decent doctor I might have a better review to which I have tried changing & they keep sending me back to the same office different doctor but still worthless.",
I love to be able to get on my chart so I can keep up with appointments and blood test,
"My Chart App. Awesome 👍 U can see everything Medical were your concerned, in this app. It's Great!!",
"Biometric login only works sometimes, pain to go from one org to another. You have to login again when going between the organizations you have an account with. -retired software engineer. You fixed it. Works great now. Oops, there are still paths from one org to another that require an additional login. This affects ALL users, not just me!",
"I'd be lost without this. With my disabilities, memory is a great concern and this app and program keeps me on the right path. Thank you for caring and having such a great team and system.",
"I really like this app, its very organized and uses imagine charts to show you where your block work should be! The security feels secure, its requires you to enter a code through email or text. I am enjoying this app in the end.",
"The app allows you to pay your copays online, but does not handle the case where you have reached your out of pocket limit for the year. It forces you to either pay (and get refunded) or choose the pay in person choice and tell the check in person you don't have a copay. I took away a star for that.",
I like having all of my medical information available to me at a glance. App is very easy to use. Love it!,
"I love this app because I can message the doctor's office anytime and they always get back with me. If I need to call them but it's off hours I can message them and they will message me back. Also it helps me keep track of my health and shows me my test results as soon as they're ready, usually before I hear from the doctor.",
Aug 6 2022.. This app don't work right anymore..I Uninstaller it ..reinstall stalled it and it's worse..this app was easy to use at first..now it's not user friendly.. Plus it causes my phone to overheat real bad ..no other app does this..you all keep making this one harder to load ..use..navigate..not happy so I uninstalled it until its user friendly again!! I would be happier with this app of it had a way to contact medical case management..however it doesnt..plus it doesn't always work right,
"Some features on this app work great. However, it keeps prompting me to ""verify"" my phone number. I request the code for verification and wait. And wait. And wait. I request a new code. It sends it again, this time with a prompt to ""wait a few minutes"" before requesting a new code. I've been waiting days. Still no code.",
"This was very a helpful app that I successfully used for a long time...but recently it won't open messages or billing. I don't know what happened to it, it not working is causing all kinds of problems.",
Love this place . The people that work there are very friendly. And make you feel welcome,
It's a splendid piece of technology that just work,
Great overall app and way to communicate with your entire care team all in one place. The more I use this app the more I'm getting out of it. I've noticed my Dr.s and team are also becoming much more MyChart savvy which has streamlined the flow of communication and care. Few bugs here and there otherwise I'd have rated it a 5 of 5!,
"The worst ever, no response from the doctors when leaving a message, it's missing information that I add access to on (Follow my Health- app). I liked using the (Follow My Health) app better, my chart is useless and definitely isn't helpful when trying to contact your doctors and trying to schedule appointments and getting referrals. Please delete (MyChart app), and give me back full access to (Follow My Health).",
This. We version is much worse. Nor intuitive. Doesn't fit screen well. Now history on test results. Too little information on screen. Thanks for adding finger print login.,
This new my AHS connect is really awesome! Imagine getting your test results in real time!!,
This app does not ask or double check with the person that appointment is being canceled when they didn't cancel it they went to open it but for some reason it got canceled you need to make it more sure that it's harder to cancel appointment like double checking are you sure you want to cancel on it because two or three appointments got canceled when I went to open them from the screen I go to open it and I see canceled I want it confirmed before it actually gets canceled to save a lot of troubl,
Very excellent tool and easy to manage and you get quick answer for many questions.,
The ability to have access to test results and leave a message for my doctor to respond to my questions is very helpful and easy to use,
Love my chart except for the messaging part never works on my phone. Super frustrating.,
I absolutely love this app!... It's the greatest thing that's happened in the medical 🌎. I'm able to see all me and my family's medical records also able to schedule and cancel appointments. Best part is being able to message our physicians directly and get responses in timely manner. I'd give 10 stars if I could!,
"I really like this app. No calling and waiting. Can speak to my Doctor. Convenient. Easy to view for you when you have mri's and other test ran. Can also make balsoa appointments, even cancel and reschedul²e. Very well made app. Easy to get all of your Novant test results, In one easy convenience.",
"Very easy to read oh, really nice website easy to follow even if you're not sufficient in technology it's a great website. you can always go into your portal after you saw your doctor and follow up in your head or with your significant other what you discussed at the appointment. I think it's the best technology that has come along in the medical field",
"Useful app, but deleting messages is a chore. Please add a multi-selection option.",
A Great efficient and non time consuming method to check into your medical records both current and from all prior and past visits and appointments. Quick and complete access to my entire past 15 yrs medical history. I highly recommend the mobile version of My Chart for tele-conferencing a visit between a health provider and thier patient for most all medical care and personal health needs. It is an excellent means to connect and stay healthy in our busy lifestyles.,
"Awesome app. It makes scheduling appointments with doctors easy and I can look up my test results the same day and if I don't understand my test results I can always talk to my doctor or to a doctor about my test results,I can also reschedule doctor appointment if need be. All in all it's the best app I've ever come across.",
Terrible experience. This platform offering ample opportunity to be more thoroughly treated and my treatment has significantly decreased and/or becomes ignored. Supremely disappointed.,
"I'm not good using a computer or smartphone, but I am able to navigate through this program. Thanks! I love getting my test results and other info, plus communications from multiple doctors and labs.",
"So close. The app has the list of ""to dos/reminders"" that you can't check off. What's more, some of the dates are inaccurate as they date back to 1976 and 1967. Seems like it has potential.",
Easy to register and user friendly,
"I appreciate being able to see my Doctors after visit notes. Plus all my lab results. Not to mention how simple it is to send my Doctors notes when I have questions. Let's not leave out the ease of refilling prescriptions, scheduling appointments. MyChart is informative, easy-to-use and I highly recommend it.",
Great Clinic full of compassionate and dedicaded staff.,
"Now that it's in full swing, it's very helpful. You can keep track of appointments, tests, and procedures. You can also view your test results, which allows you time to prepare questions for your doctor. And you can fill out all necessary paperwork and even check in ahead of time, which makes things faster and more efficient at the doctor's office. It's a great app and has helped me immensely.",
Wish there was a way to combine charts for the family. I book and handle all medical care for family. We should be able to add other charts from same network to the app. I could at least switch back and forth between patient for organization.,
I really enjoy the convenience of using this app because anything I need is at my fingertips and for my convenience. It makes contacting my doctor very easy canceling my doctor's appointment and having my information available for me. I cannot see anything else other than I love it and I'm enjoying using it.,
"Runs well. I've had some problems getting attachments from my provider, but overall it makes things so much easier from billing to obtaining test results to getting questions answered.",
"Still like the app. My only wish is that finding some reports to print was easier, and getting to my personal information to edit as well. But overall, it's still a great app.",
"I loved the app until recently. I cannot use it.It keeps telling me to download an updated version of the app. PLEASE fix this, I miss this app! I would have given it 5 stars but now I cannot even sign in and use it due to the problem I just described. Where do I get support for this issue?",
"This app covers a multitude of activities and is very easy to use! I applaud the team that came up with it! It saves me many hours of organizing, planning and ordering medications. It's very much a time saver, thank you! And it's well organized!",
"As far as technology goes, it's the next best thing to being there. As far as trying to figure out what my test results say, not so much. However, I have a great medical team that actually has an amazing ""bedside"" manner and all the patients in the world for them to sit down with me and explain results to me.",
"Since they migrated the patient portal to my charts, a lot of my info was lost from my other doctor, along with my existing issues, such as adhd and anxiety disorder as well as all my family history. These are very important things that they should assure are never lost from a patient record and always should be there for review at any given time. My chart also, is not as user friendly as patient portal either",
Very wonderful and informative!!! Keeps me on track with my health care!,
Clear and easy to use! All my info is in there all the time and results are updated instantly! Love being able to schedule appointments within the app too. Majorly improved and take helpful.,
I could not manage without this app.. ty for creating it.. its a lifesaver at times.. I and disabled and to be able to check-in without hassle from the parking lot of my dr.app.. is awesome!! Plus I can see my results and messages with my doctor not to mention virtual visit.. if it had a 10 star option I would gladly give it!!!!,
"Great tool to help keep you on track with all your medical appointments, test results and much more.",
"Very easy to comprehend, use. Glad that I can send a message to my medical provider without having to hold on a phone to my ear for long awaited minutes. When they are able to respond all I have to do is check my chart. Love it!",
This app is super for keeping all med info at your fingertips. And contacting your providers too. Some things are a bit hard to find but it is getting easier.,
"It's simple to use, easy access to medication refills, questions, concerns. Immediate access to appt review, test results. I Love having complete control of all medical needs at touch of a finger!",
"What a time saver, so efficient to be able to chat with my ""provider"" without the hassle ( illness exposure) of an in person visit.Great help making certain both of us are ""on the same page"" sharing detailed information, a great comfort in accuracy.",
Whats wrong with this app? All the institutions aren't available and I'm not even able to login (instead of choosing an institution - I already have a login from the website itself- and am registered with two institutions that I cant find on the app!!) What is going on and how is this not being addressed??,
"No. I'm sorry. This app still fails. If you type the wrong code in at login, it won't recognize anything you type after that. You get into a wrong password loop. Back to the drawing board. Please don't release until you fix. Bad coding job guys. TEST before releasing. :-(",
"Stellar information. Impressive lay out, that's easy to read. I was hospitalized recently and finding results in My Chart was helpful. Unless you're a proper professional, I reccomend taking notes and getting clarity from your doctor. Never presume to understand the anything charted in MY CHART, without medically trained person to assist you.",
"Once again you made the patient app. Complicated. It was screwed up, then easy now you have to install the video app. Which takes up storage. Some people have to pay for storage, ya know. You can't update other apps without making room (Uninstalling apps) just more problems, again",
"2 stars due to *severe* security issues... Epic/MyChart have an obligation to their customers to provide the strongest security possible. Right now, that is not the case. 2FA is limited to SMS or email, both of which have profound security issues. I strongly urge Epic to institute Multi-Factor Authentication utilizing options like U2F/WebAuthn/FIDO2 physical keys (eg Yubikey), TOTP/HOTP apps (eg Authy, Google Authenticator, etc), etc, along with compulsory biometrics as available.",
"To begin with, My Chart is a WONDERFUL IDEA!! So glad someone finally made a system where all your doctors/surgeons/nurses, anyone involved with your medical care could get all the information they need w/o asking you. It's all right there in one place! All my doctors/nurses/support staff at UTSW have been superb!! Really love them. Such great people! ♥️",
"It was terrible! Went in for a covid test, supposed to call me and let me know if positive, or was to be listed on this app. Was positive and did not hit the app till 2 days later. That's a great way to keep the public safe.. USE ""MY CHART"" EVERYTHING IS SO MUCH BETTER! I believe is as only good as the people that built it......",
this app works the same as the my chart website. that makes it really easy to get around where you need to go. however I need to open up the app that I just installed from Google play but they can't contact the server for the app. I did have the app on my phone but somehow I can't find it,
There are no ads,
It has been SO convenient! I can communicate with my doctor's and my therapist and request refills. It is a blessing it has made my life so much easier! Also I can view all my test results and all the information my health care team puts in my chart. And If I don't understand like my test results (I'm not a doctor lol) all I have to do is send my physician a message and she will explain it all to me! I highly recommend this app to everyone! I was ify about it at first my self but I'm so happy!,
I enjoy being able to set an appointment through the app and to be able to speak to someone. Calling over the phone sometimes can take longer for a response so this is more efficient. Love it!,
"Issue Resolved!! I actually went to the app to show my husband what was going on ... And OMG it was totally restored to what it's supposed to be! I didn't have to do anything at all!! Thank you, and I apologize for the 1⭐ rating. I have updated it to 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐'s it deserves!!! I honestly don't know what I would do without MyChart.",
"My chart is hands down one of the best apps I have downloaded. It tells you everything you need to no plus has allot more cool features like you can message anybody in the hospital or facility, you can see all ur tests results immediately & over all it's a great app!!",
"I hope this works better than the webpage login for a computer, that page takes forever to load, and I have fast internet, I have Cox's Gigablast speed, hope this works, the web page is useless until you can get the login page to load, once logged in it's fine. You get a 5 star, I'll edit if needed.",
MyChart application is an excellent tool for helping to maintain my medical needs and coordinate care amongst my various specialists. Using the email to a message just to my doctors is convenient and also saves time with making phone calls and being on hold. I love the MyChart app!,
"I think this app is very difficult to use! There are so many choices & its very confusing. For instance if I need to share this info with another provider, its not clear what they need to access & if I press dismiss & want to go back to it later, is it still accessible?",
I love this app. I have been in the room waiting for the doctor after having a test run and I get the results on my app before the doctor gets back to my room. I use Norton for all my medical issues and having all my doctors input into the same app make dealing with my multiple specialist so much easier,
I love using the app. It's easy and you can find what you need. My one gripe is not being able to generate and print a list of medications. Each new place I go I need to submit this. Can that improvement be made to the app? It sure would make me happy!,
"Mychart gives me access to all the information I need to follow my progress. All test results , appointments etc. Doesn't rely on printed letters arriving on time Easy to use, I really like it.",
"Have to use this to get covid results. Cannot log in as it won't recognize the password I just used to create the account. Reset requires my SSN which, humorously, was never requested anywhere in account creation. Guess we'll have to guess at test results. Wife also took 20 minutes to finally get her account created and accessed. Very poor app for this critical of a need.",
Wonderful...Saves hours and days of time!!,
"While its nice that this mostly works, it is clearly half baked and has errors and CX all the time. Just trying to pay my bill fails when trying to look at the invoice. This is clearly an app which isnt exactly being built by people who onow how to build apps.",
The best app ever. All my appointments at my fingertips.,
"Really excellent app, great 'one stop shop' to get a 'snapshot' view of where you are exactly in your hospital journey at any time, all in one place, in your pocket with you always.",
Awesome! Great tool to have and use! I would be lost without it! It's great if you have to make other plans or appointments. Just make sure you add your appointments to your calendar. Your all set to schedule your personal plans.,
"Love the app easy to get around in and as well easy to understand what is what, don't have to click on 10 things to get to ur med list or contact info or to message doctors. Wish it could link the logins all together so there is not multiple different ways to have to login with user names, passwords, or biometric scan. But due to that not being all to blame on the app alone, it's also due to the hospitals or clinics that ur accessing through the app. It has its login protocol as well. (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤5⭐",
"Very good program, easy to see your appointments, schedule tests and contact your doctor.",
The best platform for managing your appointments and messages with your doctors without having to talk over the phone or face-to-face,
Most the time I can't log in unless I do it under a text message. Though I do love that I'm able to see all of my appointments. Would be nice if we didn't have to call in to make appointments and could just do it online or over the app. It's difficult for some to make phone calls.,
"It really is a super handy app and being able to have conversations with my doctor and nurses is much more convenient then calling or going in. Also, having access to previous results and paying all in the same spot has been wonderful.",
Excellent makes life easier.,
"It's a pretty good app, but two issues so far. 1. It keeps asking me to update or confirm my phone number and email, but I already confirmed them. 2. When I try to attach a file, the app keeps freezing.",
"According to your own people you're having a problem with sending a code to my phone number. We started this on the first of November this MyChart is a program with lots of bugs. You sold our Medical people a faulty program, you should have fixed it first not cause everybody problems and say we're working out the bugs. I have yet to see one program work correctly from the beginning. You just seem to manage to keep changing it and I'm sure charging more money that flows down to the patients charg",
Was told I was pregnant for sure but no baby had formed (miscarriage) they said there was no yolk in my sac that it was empty and My results were on my chart at 11Pm. For me to read alone 😔 and this was after an ultrasound earlier in the day. I Waited for a phone call the next day and I never received one so ended up calling the doctors office at 11 AM to see why no one had contacted me yet! They said they had no idea. I was very upset that I had to find out this way!,
"The app seems to have improved over the years, but this new nonsense requiring you to get text or email confirmations in addition to biometrics EVERY DAY is patently absurd. Requiring me to confirm via text after already confirming my identity via biometrics needs to go, stat.",
"Easy to use and a great way to see whats going on with tests, emails with questions, just a good all around app. Has never crashed on me and i have had it for a Many years now THE STAFF AT CLINIC ARE AMAZING TOO!",
"I've absolutely never had a problem with this app so I find it surprising that people complain. If you need an urgent appointment, you should be calling your doctor, not using the app. Not all doctor offices use MyChart, so if you have a ton of doctors, you can't connect them all. It's very simple once you get use to using it",
"I have nearly 128 gb of storage available on my Samsung smart phone, but in downloading this app, it somehow will not download onto my phone. I download the app from Google Play. Conversely, when I use my synchronized laptop computer to download this app onto my smart phone, it apparently works smoothly, and indicates that the app is installed. However, upon being informed that the app is installed on my Android phone, I cannot locate the app at all.",
Easy to use and simple.,
"Pretty awesome app overall, easy to use UI and love the messaging feature!",
DON'T LIKE recent update. The purpose of using the mobile app is to not use the desktop/laptop. The recent update don't even have my provider (UT Southwestern Medical Center) as a choice. Wasting precious time try to get to a desktop/laptop so that I can login. Unhappy with recent update.,
"Why on earth did they make the PIN entry buttons so small in the recent update? They do realize who the typical hospital clientele is, right? Whatever the reason was, it's a solution in need of a problem. Don't fix what isn't broken. Restore the square PIN entry that isn't so trivial to misinput on like they other sane app in existence. 4 attempts remaining. 4 attempts remaining. There was absolutely no reason to shrink these buttons to be too small for adult fingers.",
I liked this app before but now I cant login with my fingerprint. I have to enter my credentials EVERYTIME I HAVE TO LOGIN!!! That is so annoying especially since when I set it up like that before. Once that issue is fixed then maybe more stars,
"This app is not working since you remodeled it. I can't schedule appointments, can't send messages to my doctors! 😡 I will not contact the developers! Just FIX IT. I'm not the only one having problems. I would give NO stars. This app is worthless now!",
Not user friendly. Problems processing payments in app because certain functions not displaying in frames. Also lots of irrelevant messages and it frequently takes me outside of app to links to sign back in while prompting me to download and use the app which I already am using! Wants me to update good information but no function orompt to save visible in frame! If I am already signed into app why should I have to go sign in with web browser ?,
"5 stars for the app’s purpose and reliability. It's a great source to be able to communicate with doctors, review test results, monitor medications; however, I would like it if the following options were included when sending messages: 1) save draft 2) confirm before send 3) unsend 4) see the message you're replying to (like in the previous messaging forum).",
Absolutely love this app. All of my doctor visits can be scheduled and I can receive information from my doctors.,
Works information is easy to find,
This system sucks. They give personal access to 12 year olds who can't even schedule their own appointments or take themselves to appointments. The message center since the update you can't tell what message is what and you can't delete multiple messages at one time. Overall not happy with Mychart at all.,
"I really like this app. I contact my doctors, get refills, and schedule appointments. There is never a reason for me to have to call the office. Of course, your doctor(s) must actually use the app in order to experience it the way it's intended. I wish I could schedule lab work, but it's not an option.",
Easy to use. It's a great way to communicate to care providers. They get right back to me since I started using this app.,
"It was great until this last month. It now takes forever, If it does at all, to log in on data. Does fine with wifi. On data most of the time it will not log in at all.",
Not as easy as the old system Not getting my blood work results or much other info I entered my covid shots plus screen shot of vax info which has disappeared and shows I've not had any shots So to say I'm not happy with the system would be an understatement!!!,
I used the old version of this app and it was wonderful. Now THE NEW AND SUPPOSED TO BE IMPROVED APP won't work in my Android Phone.!😣 I keep getting the same error message....Can not connect to the server...try again later. I did! I tried over and OVER! NO LUCK! THIS APP SUCKS!😝😢😭,
"Helps to reorder meds and make appointments. It is a look into the future, now you are told when your next appointment is due and you now enter the info in my chart. No other human interaction.",
My chart it a life changing app that restores confidence in another ave in communication. I'm laten deaf so picking up the phone isn't an option. With mychart I can communicate effectively . Love mychart life is good,
"What a hassle!! App didn't work so I waited on hold for 23 minutes, then it did work but then I get an email saying a new device was linked to my acct so call customer svc. Tried but got a message saying it was closed. Will never ever get Covid test at cvs again! Plus, when u give the app a bad review, they blame it on the place u got the test. Problem was the app",
Aside from network interference it's a great way to have an appointment thank you,
Provides an up to date connection. I've used it for years and it saves so much time. Allows me to check my tests and compare previous results. Emailing the doctor or checking your after visit summary work great. I've rarely called my provider since beginning using mychart. No long waits on hold.,
Having this app makes my life so much easier! It shows all upcoming/past Drs office visits...it also lets you to do your check in before your even at the Drs office for your scheduled appt! You can have msgs/correspondence between yourself and the Dr/Ofc staff. You can request refills on your medications. I could go on and on about all of the wonderful things this app has to offer!,
Worked smoothly for me until the last update. Now most of the functions simply lock up requiring that I exit the app. Even the backup function does not work. I cannot accomplish anything within the app. Please fix ASAP.,
More work needed--some items redirect from app to web browser and content not formatted for easy viewing (have to scroll side to side quite a bit). Info available is not very useful. This provides enough info to say you have a patient portal but isn't worth the time to login.,
I live in another country so I don't use the app often. It was easy to port to a new phone and setup a new provider. It does ask for a number that isn't available. That should be eliminated because most seniors are not tech savvy.,
"Always a problem getting in to my chart. Once in, I do OK. I have to reset my password 99% of the time I open it. It takes me more time to get in to my chart than it takes to check results.",
It was easy to use and super great. But now nothing will load. And I can't even reschedule appointments and look into details of my appointments and read notes and look at the charts of recent appointments.,
"Not much use for anything more than being notified of upcoming visits to hospital etc. I have tried sending messages but this does not seem to work. Health monitoring should be a 2 way system, but this only favours the NHS side. I need to be able to contact my carers (doctors, nurses) and this app doesn't give me that.",
I have had thisbapp on my phone but never really cared to use it until recently and OMG i must say this is the best app ever... I can look into my records anytime i want and communicate with my providers via message which is actually better than having to call the office at times. I get immediate response back... also i get to view my lab works way before i have my next appointment. This is awesome !,
This app is extremely easy to use. It is a great means to track appointments and test results within the Ottawa Hospital network. I like that I receive e-mail notifications when there are new notifications in MyChart,
"Just a pretty useful app. I like having my medical stuff all connected. I can view test results, prescriptions, summaries of appointments, and send and receive messages from doctors.",
I love using mychart. When your admitted into the hospital it gives you an estimated discharge date plus it gives you all the times you have to take meds. I like the fact that I get my test results in before I see the Dr. I give it 4 stars because sometimes it takes forever to load. Other than that it's great.,
Finally having access to med records is fantastic! Plus being able to access parents records is a blessing.,
"It's too bad more people don't use the app, that the scheduling options for lab work don't include the drive-thru clinic in Decatur. I certainly don't need to schedule anything in O'Fallon.",
"MyChart has been an excellent way for me to keep up with all of my medications, test results and understanding what the results mean. MyChart provide a range in which your test results should be and what it means if they aren't in those ranges. It allow me to communicate with my doctor 24/7 via the portal with all of my questions so I don't have to remember what I wanted to ask while on the spot for the brief moments the doctor may be in the room. MyChart allows so much more!!",
The app is convenient to make appointments and for basic information. I have been unable to link my account to my providers. I have received an error message for two months.,
"I am Mark's caregiver, and just started using this app, but it has been great for keeping me off the conversation end of the phone, making it a delight to have! It's also the best way to get earlier appointments through the wait list! I, personally, LOVE all the doctors Mark has at Loma Linda...Mark does too!",
I've been using MyChart with Bethesda Clinic for years and it has worked great! And Dr. Fallert is an excellent MD!,
"I love MyChart, it keeps me on track and up to date on all my appointments with Doctors/specialists, tests and sends me the results and notes of each visit, test and procedures, it helps me understand what's going on and helps me learn. I have multiple diseases and an LP Shunt so this also saves me time by not having to fill anything out at appointments. I just wish all my other Doctors outside of the Ottawa Hopitals used MyChart as well, it makes life a lot easier!",
Like not having to call all the time to scheduled doctors appointments or pay medical bills of co-pays or whatever the case may be it's a great app.,
"Works well. Easiest way of communicating with your doctor, looking at test results, requesting med refills and just about anything related to dealing with your PCP. Very easy to use and everyone should have this. It's really that good 👍...",
Always happy with my visits.All questions answered. On a scale from 1 to 10.At 10+,
"This is a very usable app - It's super convenient to have all this information in one location. It does take a little bit of time to become proficient, so don't give y Up.",
"Absolute garbage. It's inconvenient and disorganized. It blocks copy and paste and screenshots, it doesn't give you any ownership or portability over your medical records. Epic is an awful company and this is just as bad as their charting software.",
"Nice to b able 2 have everything all at ur fingertips, but the past cpl months i havent been able 2 view messages that are listed as new(actually 3-4 wks old- unseen yet!), i tried 2day 2 send a message 4 a refill, but unable to even get in to any messages still, also haven't been able to view last months messages in here, whats going on?",
"Not perfect, but reliable. Takes at least 30 sec to access info, usually a minute or so. Very annoying when one is in a hurry.",
"Excellent communication ap. Great for short text to your provider team. Great for after visit review of Dr notes. Great for seeing your test results displayed in a 'range-chart' so you can relate to those test results. Read the interpretation of x-rays, Catscans, MRIs etc. Make appointments or cancel appointments. 4 thumbs up!",
It provides immediate CARDIO MEMS results and all test results quickly. I also have it as a backup calendar for appointments. I find it extremely beneficial in maintaining my health.,
"At last, a central repository where all medical records and information are kept up to date. East to use and a great value add.",
This here is the place. Although it would be great if other clinics could get linked not just hospitals too. I'm at a clinic and all those records i need here. Frustrating??? When You have to get file records & you have tip go in so many directions and places. This app ROCKS best app for communication with Dr's schedule appts. Thank you,
I decided to switch to another organization within the app and it doesn't recognize my u/n and p/w. This was like a day after I signed up. I keep hitting forgot u/n & p/w option but it sends nothing to my email. I am so very disappointed in this app. If it's fixed I'll update my review.,
"It seems to have some glitches, but all in all it's great! All your info on what you have had done, & your appointments are right there, plus you can directly message any doctor you go to. That alone is outstanding as in my lifetime I have found it near impossible to directly contact any doctor. Great job on this app.",
System down it seemed like a week or which delayed prescriptions that were important!!! I was unable to access system and rating was done after system became available again. Therefore by time Epic Systems Corp was able to communicate back with me the system was operable so no need for me to contact anyone else regarding!,
"Reasonably good, multiple providers info. Different ones present the information differently, which can be confusing. But without this app we wouldn't have access to the info so easily.",
"One of the finer apps! It's really nice to have all your Medical Records, Lab Reports, appointments & reminders all in one place. You even have the ability to review after visit notes from your doctor within minutes of walking out the clinic doors.The other awesome options include logging in to other Health Care Providers and Hospitals with only a click or two and all your medical information is available for Aurora Health Care, Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin, MERCY etc.",
"Good to actually see your test results when the doctor never calls you back to tell you. Also great for appointment scheduling, physician contact, history back to when I was born, medications you can't remember the name of, etc. Lots of good features but not perfect",
"Absolutely awful. There was an an appointment that I supposedly canceled. I Absolutely would not have done this. I don't know if it's the app's fault or the clinic's, but they're should be a fail safe for cancelling an appointment. I would love to see proof that I canceled the appointment as I think the provider canceled it. This in an unacceptable inconvenience.",
"This past few weeks I have had one problem after another logging onto my portal, changing my password and gaining access to the different options. I have no idea what has changed at EPIC but this is very frustrating and has left me without access to my doctors and hospital after having surgery with complications. Help me!",
"Love that I can connect with doctor, appointment, and files, but it is somewhat glitchy in the forms area, messanger, and ability to send files back and forth. But overall good app.",
"I've used mychart to track my medical history, conditions, tests and communications with my doctors for several years. I love that all of my information is in one place. I wish all medical facilities used this app. I probably would not pick a doctor's office that did not use it.",
Very functional and very timely. Messages go out quickly and received the same. You can look at past vaccinations and other medical procedures right at your fingertips!,
I get incredible amounts of information from this app. All your records at your fingertips.,
"Garbage. Loaded with unnecessary info boxes and there is no way to delete your account. If the data pertains to me, I have the right to control who gets access and retention.",
"Good app, easy to use. It would be nice if the past, present apts and messages were color coded. Would make it easier for our elderly patients to differentiate between their apts and messages.",
"I have Mychart for several health providers that I access on my PC, but I cannot connect them through the app. I have no idea why this would be the case, but it's very inconvenient. When I can access all of my health organizations that use MyChart, I'll add more stars.",
"I like being able to see a lot of things or ask a question, but I'd love to see a ""notes"" section where we as the patient could make a note of things we want to discuss with our doctor at a specific appointment so we don't forget when we're there. Maybe like, on the actual appointment details page have a ""comments"" box or something that the doctor can see when we actually arrive to our appointment.",
This app is losing functionality within the Epic system. frustrating. There is no support line that medical networks can offer patients to troubleshoot issues. All they can do is give you a new login or password.,
Awesome app to keep up with your healthcare,
"Terrible, I always get error messages and it rarely works.",
It's been easy to use. It's nice being able to pull up my results smoothly and be able to review things as needed. I like being able to see estimates and pay my bills through the app as well.,
App no longer works. I cannot log in at all. It just spins for 10 minutes then says my chart can't log you in right now. Does this with biometrics and using a password. The website works just fine,
"App used to work, worked great too, until now, App states it is no longer supported by My Health Online, need to update the app. Only problem, there is no update... Back to using web page, as I now have to remove this app. O well it worked very well for yrs, upgrades and all, well this time the app is junk, app total waste of time....",
"Love this I can stay in contact with my health, appointments, lab results, Dr's review, up and coming vaccines.",
Other than having to continually reset password it's good,
App is unusable. Stuck trying to find organization.,
"I started using the mychart app earlier this year. With my HCP, it has been very helpful, useful and easy. Being able to contact my doctor about a non medical issue and getting a response back from the doctor means so much to me. Highly recommended!!",
I have wanted to be Dr. Cuevo's patient since my first visit with her a few years back when I was seen by her randomly for an issue I was having. She diagnosed the problem with a snap of a finger and we got it taken care of with some medication. It took me a few years but I was able to become a patient finally and really enjoy her. She's a fantastic Doctor with great bedside manner if you will. I would recommend her to anyone. She definately knows her stuff and can't say anything bad 5 Stars!!!,
Great app to communicate with my Doctors. I do have one issue that the app keeps requesting my health history when I've already done so. It should ask me if ít needs updating so I can quickly register for my upcoming appointment. I did not find a place in the app for feedback so I had to resort to communicate via the rating app.,
Just started to use very helpful can review test results can check in when u get there very interesting all good 👍,
"I'm not able to access account through the app and the site itself I can only access each time if I choose forgot pw- though I set it for the same pw each time. I'm annoyed I was told I had no choice but to get my test results through a created account- and then accessing it seems to have bugs. Once I get my results, I'm not using the account again and will likely choose a competing pharmacy next time",
"Love seeing reports, test results and communicating with providers. Frustrated with not being able to delete providers not seen in years. Overall excellent app!",
Very easy to use and very useful!,
"App does not show medications or vaccination data even though I have added that data (twice) via webpage login (intially through the MyHDR questionare). Today was given tasks (all completed- one of which included updating all medication & vaccination data, which is still indicating none provided pn the app) app appears to have logged that those tasks are complete. Lot of effort to enter all the information yet none retained by the app...pretty useless since supppsed to be supporting me.",
"I love using MyChart... It's so easy, organized, very informational... I have no problem checking my upcoming appointments. I can read my test results as soon as they pop up. And if I have questions about them I can ask what I want to know. I can also message my doctor's/care team whenever needed instead of Going thru the stress of making an appointment and everything that goes along with it.",
"It's a great platform to consolidate all my medical matters in one app. Wished more medical groups subscribe to it. For example, while most of UCSF are on it, UCSF Dental is not. Overall, MyChart helps me manage my health care easily.",
This tool is amazing!! I'm able to review my test results shortly after tests are completed and can come back and look at them after I've had time to think about what I read and work on next steps. Having this information let's me get ready for my next doctor appointment. Thank you for making this tool available and making it so easy to use!!,
This is the absolute best thing anyone could have come up with. It is so much easier to access all my information. Love it.,
Would like place to view instructions for tests. I tend to misplace paper copy. Also sometimes hard to find notes from appointments. Not clear on menu. That's why 4 stars.,
Very easy and convenient.,
"The app generally sucks as much as the browser version does. And prescriptions need to be easily accessible. May just be the way N. GA Health has configured and implemented it, but it makes the system look rinky-dink.",
I enjoy being able to get test results as soon as they're available. Being able to check in prior to appointment is wonderful along with being able to communicate with my doctors via my chart is great. I have recommended UCLA Medical Center to any and everyone that ask about a great medical facility.,
This app let's me keep track of all upcoming appointments with all of my doctors. Love it!,
"Pretty user friendly. Easy to navigate and to read. I wish they had a diagnosis list/tab/icon where diagnoses are shown and the patient or user can click on them and learn more about what's going on with the diagnosis what it means, etc.",
My Chart makes it easier to talk with your pcp because you can send messages with questions instead of having to wait until your appointment to ask. I haven't used any of the on line care yet so I can't say about that but I do like having that option.,
"App needs a lot of improvements such as allowing users to not have to choose between using a password or passcode, stop sending a single message multiple times and users should be able to make corrections to their information without having to visit the website (a previous feature that needs to be restored)",
"Great potential, but falls short. Can't view billing properly, can't even send a complaint or question in messaging as u can't access the send button in certain windows.",
"Continually getting ""there was a problem communicating with the server"" Web portal works fine. Clearing cache, clearing user data, and uninstalling app and reinstalling did not solve problem. Appears they just broke their app.",
It keeps me on track for appointments and I'm able to see past appointments and Dr notes,
The app doesnt appear on my phone screen. I went back to the Play Store and it says open or uninstall. If I click open I can view it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem still exists. Who wants to keep coming back to the Play Store to open the app? I can just go to my Hospital website And login from there.,
"By far the most complicated registration for anything I've ever seen. It's like the devs have never used or seen a sign up form in their lives. Seriously, it shouldn't be this difficult. Edit: Using the activation code the hospital gave me just keeps coming back with an error ""invalid activation code."" How can under armor create a better app than someone handling our confidential health information?",
Information entered is incorrectly noted My doctor's office entered 3 missed appointments. The information is incorrectly entered. Then I am told that it can not be changed. What kind of app is this when the doctor's office can not change misinformation? I just began to use this app and it does not give me the doctor's report. I don't like this at all. I am very much dissatisfied with this app. I do not recommend this app. It is awful...very awful to say the least. 😡 Only God knows.,
"I absolutely love MyChart! I've been using it for about 10 yrs and pray it never goes away. Having access to my records, tests, updates, appointments and sending messages to my doctor doesn't get any better than this. I have all I need in one place",
"Pretty good but still needs improvement. I can't see all my test results, it only shows the headers and not the content. Also, it won't let me schedule an appointment with some of my doctors.",
The app works fairly well. It's needs to be more adaptive. Some things need fixed but it appears the trchnicians who are suppose to be able to cannot figure it out. Other than I like using it.,
"Used MyChart with another organization in our area we use for specialized care and really wanted the option of being able to have it with the organization we received primary care from so our various teams could coordinate better. Now our primary care organization has switched to Epic and Epic My Chart and has made things very easy. On top of that My Chart is so very user friendly, compared to just about every other patient portal we have ever used, and we have used many.",
"Ok this is great for medical charts for your doctors or to the hospital. It let me get my negative covid test and show it to my drs. Also drug tests and more. The only issue I have is it's very hard to keep up with family members like they say and why would anyone besides a parent want that? Medical stuff is very private, also getting things printed is so annoying I just transfer and use other apps for that. Otherwise it works great!",
"This app is quite handy but, full page may not display on your device. Be sure to scroll to bottom of each page, especially if making an appointment or sending a message. It is NOT automatic.",
"MyChart is great & adds convenience to the healthcare experience. Access records from any provider or network that uses EPIC & MyChart. Schedule appointments, review testing & lab results, request prescription refills, send messages, & pay bills. Review notes, summaries, & test results going back years, which eliminates the need to keep physical records. Makes me wish all of my providers would use this system.",
"I really appreciate being able to see all my results and notes easily. Schedule appointments, get on wait lists and communicate quickly with my providers. It takes some of the stress out of managing my chronic illnesses and navigating Healthcare.",
"Love everything about this app EXCEPT - DON'T LINK TO MY MERCY - YOU WILL REGRET IT! Linking accounts is a great idea, but apparently bugs have not been worked out yet. Both Apps are great independant of each other, linked they both have problems.",
"This app was wonderful until this EPiC whatever it is took over. I absolutely loved the app I had on my old phone. I needed a refill and before that was an option now it's only medical advice or customer service. So I sent it to customer service only to get , please message your provider. The prescription option isn't available anymore 😔 like I want to waste my time sending multiple messages. I absolutely hate this new app🤬. Before it even gave me a list of my Drs and sending messages to them",
"Won't let me in. I haven't been able to get in for over a month. Called tech support, uninstalled, changed password, cleared cache. Apparently, he told me I stumped him. So...thanks? I can still get in through the website, but the app used to be more convenient.",
"The apps Easy to use keeps appointments in order . Calendar reminds you of up coming appointments to your phone. Logs you into video visit. You can Read doc's notes on your last visits, or keep up to date with your medical information that goes directly to the hospital no more fill out paperwork It's a decent companion for your hospital/ needs.",
"I love this app!!! It helps remind me of upcoming appts. that I could have possibly missed otherwise, and I can view my test results almost immediately instead of waiting for the office to call,or wait until my follow-up appointment. I also appreciate the ""Ask The Dr."" feature,where I can text him/her, or the very capable staff with a question or concern I have and know they will respond at their earliest convenience. Thank you so much for creating this format.Keeps us all in the know.",
"Information does NOT pass well between organizations. Even though I've confirmed the appointment and have done an E-check In, I still get a text msg demanding I respond w/yes. If I don't within 1 minute, I receive an automated phone call also again requesting confirmation. Odds are I still get a phone call from a human asking for confirmation as well. Why do I have to login get a msg telling me I have new information that I need to login AGAIN to actually read said information, but I am not",
"Usually easy and intuitive though sometimes it doesn't work as advertised (e.g., in the section to edit profile or communication preferences, there is no ""save"" button)",
This app is one of the rare apps that actually do what it says it's going to do and it is easy to use and maneuver your way around. There's not a pop up every 2 seconds in fact I don't recall seeing one on here. Thank you for the great app Developer (s),
"Easy to understand, and so effective, I love it!",
"Telehealth video quality in terrible (using Wifi, new phone, Gigabit fiber connect). It's like a game of charades. Tried joining the call 4x with my doc, this app is all but useless. Use a phone call instead of this app.",
As someone with a chronic illness that requires regular medical stuff this app 8s a game changer.,
This app is absolutely amazing. I have no problems contacting doctors and if the doctors are not available another staff member will be. It has been a blessing to be able to contact my son's doctors with everything he's been thru. Someone is always there. Honestly I give thanks to the people who work in children's everyone has been amazing and the app has been super supportive for not only my my son but the whole family as well.,
"Best and easiest app I have to use, GREAT app. Makes life easier when you have to deal with a lot of medical issues and you don't have to battle with your technology. Grady is always on top of it, and it's choice to use MyChart is superb.",
"I used to love this app. Depended on it for well over a year with no issues. bow I got the s10e, and only half the options work. I cant access email, at all.",
Specific to Portland Clinic: Glad they fixed a bug that broke ability to pay by card. Same problem on Window 10 (hopefully fixed as well). Otherwise pretty reliable and useful app.,
"After calling for support to get my account back on, I was litterally told that I had to take an in home colon test before they could bring up my account. My doctor never asked this. How is this a thing????",
"Genius app! It is very helpful for people like me that have so many health issues that see many doctors and have many tests done. It keeps records from years ago that I even forgot I did back then. Thank you so much for this very helpful app, it truly makes my life easier. God bless ❤️",
Very helpful and knowledgeable,
"It would be great if you could pay your bills through the app. The option to do so is there, but there is also some type of bug in the app that prevents you from actually paying your bill. Highly annoying.",
"Very user friendly and informative. I love that you can message doctors, change appointments, e-check in, pay balances, see xray images and lab results and patient documents from providers. Overall a great app.",
"My chart was much better before the last changes! My test results are not current, listing of providers changed. Over all I feel the history of my health records has been effected in a negative way",
App is easy to use. It amazes me how quickly it is updated. My visit summary was posted even while I was still in my appointment. The staff are very responsive to messages sent thru the app.,
"This is a terrible app not at all friendly to its users. There is no easy way to either find old information or enter new information - unless, of course, it is the provider who should be entering that, in which case, there ought to be a HELP file which explains all of this.",
I was surprised on how easy to use this was. As a senior citizen I have limited experience with computers and software however this one is simple and easy to follow directions. I like that I can get information as needed very quickly.,
I feel like I would enjoy it more if I knew how to navigate it and use it it's just I see all of the options and ways that this can't help me and for some reason I can't figure it out. Every time I want to know more information about anything specific I can't seem to figure out how specifically use this app to finish and get to an end result help I have a cognitive disorder so maybe that's just it. Maybe you should have like an information center to like help teach you how to navigate,
They changed my password June 7th. Called help desk where I was told I had to set up a new MyChart. Lost all of my visits and results. What's the point of having it? Literally lost everything including billing. Was waiting on a test result and couldn't gain access. Found an email June 7th saying they changed my password. Why?,
To many bugs in software. Many times it switches language to Spanish and get locked up? Also the data gets corrupted with my information being corrupted by misinformation. Software is not reliable,
"I really like this app normally, but I tried to get in because I have a message from a doctor and I can't get it open anymore. I can't even attempt to log in. I get stuck at the loading screen and it tells me to check if I have an internet connection and I know I do because all of the other internet reliant apps on my phone are fine. Please fix this. I'm really frustrated.",
This app tells me my information right away! I love it!,
"MyChart is amazing and has made managing my health care much easier. I can communicate with all of my providers within the system. It is much better and easier to use than the athena health portal, which is a mess when more than one provider is involved.",
I have three different apps for three different medical associations and my chart is the champ. I use it with two out of four services without fail everything I want to know is on my chart. Doctor's visits and lab tests pop up does fast is humanly possible. If I can't remember the results of something MyChart is the place to go.,
"I LOVE THIS APP! 1. Who doesn't have a cell phone. 2. If you make and see a doctor. If you relate to these two questions, then you should get this app. Schedule appointments with your doctor, you can ask queations. Test results, upcoming appointments. Even let's you know if you are overdue for check-ups, &/or immunizations. I love how everything is at my finger tips. Thank you to the creator(s) of my chart. Love This App.",
"Since the most recent update 7 hours ago, the app is no longer usable. I keep getting 404 errors, errors saying accounts can't be accessed, and even errors saying no information is available. I just used this app yesterday to message my physician and now I can't even check to see if she responded because the app refuses to load anything.",
"Always crashes, not user friendly, and way too much going on, needs to be simplified, and tested rigorously on different phones and platforms to fix bugs. 0/10",
"Just one big complaint. The app is spamming us with an erroneous appointment reminder. Epic and the hospital blame each other - so I blame them both. Lots of good. But if they overlook the bug, I'm willing to overlook the good stuff.",
"Allows me to quickly send and receive messages with my healthcare providers, and view (most) test and lab results. My only complaint is that I can't screenshot on mobile, which means it's harder to keep my own records in case I lose access to my portal.",
Love this app! Being able to be proactive and complete paperwork prior to surgery really helped with the stress and anxiety of it all. And having all the information in one place is convenient.,
"The app is so dumb. I go to the app to ask a simple question, but instead of letting you ask a question, it sends you in a circle and doesn't let you send a message. What it the point of the message tab, if I can't send a message. SO DUMB AND POINTLESS!!!",
I like MyChart. You have alot of info at your finger tips.. idk if the app itself has a notification button or not.. but if not you can always go thru your settings on phone to include in the notifications your phone can receive.. I love it actually 😊,
Easy-to-use & get a hold of your doctor. What I mean by that is they answered their messages within 24 hours. You can use it for refill of prescriptions. I would highly recommend signing up for your MyChart if you haven't already. It's saved a lot of time with certain things & as usual there are somethings that are just easier to talk to a person. But for the most part this is a great middleman.,
Its ok. Not great. It has consistant issues connecting to my other Hospitals/labs. Its terribly glitchy too. And its really not user friendly. A very large learning curve for anyone over 50 yrs. I've spent MONTHS trying to teach my hubby. My parents won't even bother with it. It's muh at best.,
Very helpful. I can see upcoming visit and tests also results from past visits,
"Very very helpful. Sometimes appointment letters arrive after appointment date but mychart always gives you plenty of notice on time. Also very helpful in keeping track of past & future appointments, summaries and comments from consultants. Useful for sending non urgent emails direct to hospital.",
"UPDATE: App still completely non functional and ZERO response from Epic support. Original: App is broken. It's not letting me log into anything. Whenever I do I quickly see a quick before it blanks out and says ""Terms and Conditions Could Not Be Loaded At This Time. Please Try Again Later."" Ive been trying for a month now. The website works so it's not my Medical Provider's problem. Only the app does not work.",
"Basically, you can't be sure what you will get. Fir example, I sign in to OrthoCarolina, check appointments, and I see an upcoming Novant Health sppt. But an appt I made an hr. ago with Ortho doesn't appear. It's always something different ... the same thing just happened on Atrium MyChart: both the Novant appt and an Atrium lab appt (nothing for Ortho) I have recreated the Ortho signin many times ...",
"It is an easy app to utilize and enjoy it very much. Able to stay up-to-date on meds, appointments, test results and communicate directly with non emergency questions. Since I do not have any medical background, I am able to share my situation with family members who are in the medical profession. I encourage everyone to use it.",
What a helpful app! The best part is communicating with doctors when you need to. Having access to my meds to an outside source is wonderful. I've not had any problems with this app. I recommend this.,
Been using this since May and like it. I deducted one star however because the upload feature fails to retrieve my insurance cards scan. It always says the file is too big and I don't know what else to do in that regard.,
"I really think this app is very helpful. I took my son to his pediatric cardiologist yesterday to perform a stress test 12/23/22 and afterwards he had lab drawn. It is Christmas Eve and I was able to see his results as quick as the day after. I thank GOD his numbers were in normal range. Without this app, I wouldn't have had access to these results which could of had me stressing until Monday. I love it and it's the honest truth.",
"Fabulous! This app is amazing. I can contact my medical providers so easily. Handle appointments. An all my test results are right there on my portal, usually the same day I have them. It's amazing I appreciate this app so much . An I appreciate my providers giving me this serve and the peace of mind it offers .",
"Navigating thru My Chart is very easy. This is the best and I have three. I can communicate, see test results, sync with my calendar upcoming appts. Thank you.",
It is very helpful in keeping up with test &appointments . I like the fact that you can send a message . The only thing I'm having a problem with I can't seem to be able to get the app for my chart. I got an Amazon HD 10 PLUS,
"Remove eCheck-in as an option. One is greeted by a sign asking if MyChart was used to check in followed by the instruction to please sign in at the front desk upon arrival. I was also asked to fill out a questionnaire for an upcoming, regularly scheduled appointment with one of the questions asking if the reason for my appointment was because of an injury accident. The appointment had been scheduled 90 days in advance. I stopped answering questions right there",
"This app is fantastic! I can communicate with doctors from several different organizations. I receive timely replies from my doctors about numerous inquiries as well as refills for meds, follow questions about tests, immediate access to test results and many other things. It really helps me with my healthcare connection to my medical providers.",
"This app is handy and helpful, but it has at least one nonsensical limitation. The patient can send an email to his/her doctor and can even attach a file... but attachments are limited to photos or videos. This make NO SENSE AT ALL. Why can't a patient attach a document such as a pdf?",
"I love this app, very easy to access and use.",
"This is the worst app ever! Trying to get results, see messages, or edit my email address, all result with ""An error has occurred"" message. How is anything supposed to get accomplished!",
"Inconsistent use of preferred name. Uses legal name when originating a message to your provider. Uses legal name when generating an automatic reminder about checkups. If your preferred name is not the same as your legal name, be advised. Many options are not available in the app, and require going to the website. Sometimes it asks before redirecting you.",
"I love the convenience of MyChart. As we age it helps to have a app to help remind of discussions with our doctors, and to see our med chart too. This is a clever app, and great for setting up apts. and to see when you last had or need a future medical test. Thank you MyChart. I truly like this app. Sincerely, Redeyed48.",
Very efficient. Surprised at how many features the app truly has for just a medical info app. I dont even have to check in anymore it does that when I pull up to the location. Super easy to use also.,
"Great tool for seeing results and contacting medical facilities, but even with permission to talk to each other, it will not let my multiple mychart accounts share with each other. At one time it did, then it stopped.",
"The servers are always down. I can't pay my bill, check in, or anything",
It is very easy to use and makes communication w/ the provider effortless.,
"Very easy to navigate. I love being able to track everything I need, send messages to any of our medical providers, and make appointments for my kids and for myself all in one easy app.",
"I had this app since Nov 2021, was fine until few weeks ago. I tried opening it could got couldn't communicate with the server. I called your help desk numerous times NO HELP THEY TOLD ME MY PHONE. Really well I called Verizon they did tests on my phone cleaned it to the fact GOT THE SAME MESSAGE. But if I go thru your website BINGO I got in. WHY HAVE A PATIENT PORTAL WHEN THE PATIENT CAN'T GET INTO IT. I have a 92 year old mother that I need access to her info.PLEASE FIX",
"Log in issues. The app was fine until it took away the option to log in with my fingerprint, and kept giving me an error message saying that it had trouble communicating with the server.",
"I love MyChart. I can use it for everything. E-check in makes it easy to go over all your info before getting to the Dr office so you don't have to fill anything out in the office. You can go over insurance, you can message the dr, see test results, schedule appointments, see your after visit summary, request medication refills. It is easy to navigate. Just all around wonderful. Highly recommend!",
"I understand the chaos having an uploading documents feature may cause; however, having a one time code option available for important stuff would be optimum and graciously welcomed. Signed, Stranded in the country",
"I can only do positive stats. I think on a scale 1-5, Cleveland Clinic is-17. I sent a message on 2/17/23. They responded on 2/20/23. My MRI got cancelled because they didn't send notes on time...2 weeks was not enough time... They are too busy. That's why my appointment was at 8:30 but 9:30 I was still waiting. MyChart is just the messenger, but the message is bad. And my experience with other local hospital was as bad. Medicine is a business and MyChart helps that, not precisely healthcare.",
Information is not easy to access. When I choose any subject all it does is buffer then a message appears saying please try again later. This happens on a daily basis.,
Since getting MyChart. I don't ever want to be without it. It has been a blessing in every respect.😀,
"Love this app. I don't need paperwork because all information from any doctor appointments, surgical procedures, test results are right here at my fingertips. I can add future appointments to my calendar with one click. Keep up the great work!",
"I am incredibly pleased with this application. I appreciate the ease of use and the layout of the application. I have essential information about my medical care at my finger tips. I'm able to observe future appointments, I can view former appointments as well. I can pay my copay, fill out the typical paperwork in advance. Great application and I highly recommend it.",
"I really enjoy the features on the portal, and appreciate that ucla actually has people employed to update the information. My complaint with the app is the fact that I can't add any doctor I want, and that it isn't compatible with my other portals .",
This app was working perfectly fine until now. I have been unable to contact my doctors or email them. It keeps giving me a notice saying the server received an invalid response while acting as a gateway or proxy. What is going on with the system? I need answers immediately 😡😡,
"Great app, I love having all of my medical information in one place that I can access at any time.",
"When I click add to calendar it's only bringing up the Google Calendar app, bypassing my settings which should force it to ask for the calendar app I want to use. I'm guessing it's the way the link is constructed.",
"Great to have all my medical history and medications in one spot. It is a very secure app, not even allowing you to take screen shots of any info. You can link multiple places and only have to use one sign in. A definite must have for anyone.",
"I just deleted the app because it was constantly cycling. I plan to put the app back on my phone. If it doesn't work properly, I will contact the developers. From 5 stars down to 3 stars! So many of my Providers use this app. It is very convenient to have so much in one app.",
"I use it daily to communicate with my and my son's various docs. But 9/10 times it has various ""communication errors"" now and I end up having to call the office to schedule appointments or talk to them when before all I needed was to us the app. Almost useless now.",
"So easy and convenient to keep track of all your doctor appointments, bills, set up appointments, email your Dr for concerns..so much more. All spectrum health visits can be seen in one location. It's great",
"Overall this app is good. However, I find it cumbersome to delete messages, letters and reminders in the app from the main home screen. I wish there were an easier way to do that.",
"This myChrt has got to be the best ever. It helps you understand your lab results, and if you don't understand anything the providers are just a message away. I recommend getting and using this app. Saves time and is a stress reliever! 😍",
This app is so much helpful since you can not ever get a direct phone line to our family office. The automated phone service is not always a great thing. I know I always have trouble getting to the correct option on automated service. I can always get a message to our family Doctor and his nurses. The Chillicothe office is a top notch office. To all who work in Chillicothe office thank you very a great job.,
"I don't know what I would do without MyChart. It helps me keep track of all my appointments, and I love being able to ask doctors questions. Very good app. Only complaint is the merging of various different health systems is difficult.",
"I love ❤️ Mychart it helps me to know about my appt, and results on Mychart you can send alls of my doctors a messaged or asking for refills and also scheduling 📅 appt. and begin paperless good 👍 job 👏 I.T. in technology thank you 😊 Shand's",
"This has allowed me to keep all of my doctors on the same page and I get test results faster. Believe me with my complicated health issues that is a VERY GOOD thing!! Appointments are easy to make, questions are easy to ask, and prescriptions are easy to request refills ( from my Dr.s) for. This has been a life saver🤗",
"I downloaded the app, but everytime i enter my health organization, it only says Thanks for your Submission. And then nothing. I cant seem to access the app, just only that screen. And im waiting for my results since july 10th. I have contacted you guys, and no response.",
"App won't let me get past the 'Select an Organization' screen. It doesn't show any organizations or allow you to select or search for any. This app used to be great, now it doesn't work at all.",
"Excellent app , keeps you informed about what's happening.",
10/10 recommend. If you feel like your left in the dark after a doctor's visit you should get this app you can see doctor's notes and after visit summaries all of your test results are here before your next doctor's visit. I'm able to communicate set up appointments and request refills for prescriptions all in app. This app is a whole game changer.,
"The app worked great, all my doctor appointments and payments were going great. All of a sudden I can sign in but immediately the app closes. I can't pay my bills or see my appointments. Please fix the glitches!!!",
Excellent access to communicate with PCP & staff.,

"I've been using My Chart since it was first offered with great success. None of the crashing, glitches noted in other reviews. Just had my first Zoom MD meeting this morning and was quite pleased. Since when do you get to drink coffee while waiting/meeting with your physician? Getting test results is also a great feature. Generally get faster responses from messages thru My Chart than calling conventionally.",

Very convenient and helpful and I love this app,
"Your records are at your fingertips, love it!",
It is great to keep up with all my appointments and to communicate with all my doctors. I do wish that once you have blood work/test done that it would go away from the reminder. I guess it will pop up until it expires.. overall great app.,
Very helpful for scheduling appointments and seeing tests results,
Difficult to navigate.,
"Horrible!!! Usually works, today, it completely sucks!!!!",
"You get used to something, and you change it all the time, and I am getting tried of talking to a computer and all we want to know when and where Dr. Karen Teston funeral will be because she was not just our doctor she was my friend and why would you take her nurse from us Lori knew all of us so she would be able to get us paired with a new one since she has been there for a really long time and I don't understand how you could do that to her because if you need someone who knows us would be bet",

"I enjoy MyChart, it keeps me honest with my appointments",
Great app. Very user friendly ❤️,
The fact that I am able to see my an my family medical records is great!,
"On April 19,2023 5⭐ thanks for good reply. Updated today I'm giving 1 ⭐ cause i not see my past appointments also when i went to my son's account i see the one from July 18. Why y'all remove the one he went to thomasville, NC hospital on the July 18th. Stop i not ask y'all remove anything off our accounts from past visits. to add to this we not even remove/delete nothing cause my son not understanding how do that & me i never deleted/remove nothing from there. I really disappointed y'all 😭",
I love using this app. No problems so far.,
Can't get on my app not good service,
Great for keeping track of everything,
There are no ads,
It's a great way to contact my Dr and see results from test and visits,
I love it. Very easy to use.,
I love mychart. I need to ad my grandson Ashton Barker. Can you assist me with that.,
Thank you. It really helps me keep up with my appointment s and nedications,
Why do I have type in my password every single time!? There was the option to use a pin and the password remember but now I have to type in everything so now I have to spend tomorrow reseting everything to the same password (even though they all have different requirements) because I have to type it every time. It's not like I have the option to not use it and download something different so if I want to know my results I have to jump through ridiculous hoops.,
Great app. It gets the paperwork work out of the way ahead of time...,
"Very good app..secure private...and absolutely love having access to my doctors and past visits with one simple app..I can set appointments , message my doctors, even have video visits if needed ..plus I am able to have access to my daughter and husband's records as well all in one place",
I love Mychart!!! Being able to effortlessly connect with my medical team is so convenient! Scheduling/Rescheduling & keeping track of appointments is super easy! I love having access to all my medical records and lab results as soon as they're available!! No more anticipation while waiting for a call!,
"Can't even login to this app. Every time I try to login it says terms and conditions could not be loaded, please try again - and kicks me out back to login screen. From browser it works fine though. Update: seems to be working now after clearing application cache.",
I used to love this app until it updated and now it won't accept my user name or password and I've changed them twice already with no difference. What happened to logging in with a pin? That was so much easier and convenient,
"It keeps changing and I feel, right now, is less easy to use than previously but hopefully they'll incorporate some of the previous non-desktop-like features that are better for mobile phones!",
Great app. Is nice knowing I can get a hold of doctors at anytime.,
"Some functions are good, others are maddening. Trying to schedule a nurse-only appt for an injection. Not an option. Can't send a message to the Dr. as her name doesn't show as one of my providers. If you don't fit into the specific categories for messages or appointments you're SOL.",
"I just began to use My Chart.its easy to use. You can check your appointments, Lab results, Medications refilled, Cancelation of Appointments. If need to. In case you forget to write your information down. There's a reminder on MyChart, Thank You.",
"even tho I had a password it wouldnt let me into my chart without a number code. every time I left screen to get it, by the time I tried to log back in, the number was no longer good as I had to start all over again, endless back n forth. nothing but headache so I uninstalled it. Can you offer any help?",
"Hard to navigate and difficult to find things on, the search function doesn't give you what you're looking for. And you cant schedule an appointment with a provider if youve never seen them before which makes making first visits difficult",
This is my go to app for managing my medical care. I linked all of my providers from different healthcare systems and can see scheduled and past appointments in one place. Also I can see my after visit summaries and test results. The app also allows you to send and receive messages to my doctors.,
"Excellent app! I love that I have all my health information in a clear, consice layout. I like having access to my information without having to jump through hoops. It's very user friendly.",
"I have a difficult time finding the information I am looking for. Some information you have to go through several options to find info. Billing info is not at your fingertips, for example. The option says ""Billing"" but you have to go through so much for info.",
"this app is very helpful in keeping track of appointments and reminders for recommended tests and vaccinations. You can also see your lab results, and it keeps a list of all of your medications. I just wish that you were able to see imaging results.",
I love this app - it helps me be an active participant in my health-care.,
"Expected more!!! I have 4 children and can truly only get full access to my youngest info because he is under 10 years old. This is a huge inconvenience because if I am out the NY Health and Hospital System or in another state and have an emergency I can only access the most basic info my older children like allergies and imunization. I cant access health issues, medications, appointments nor test results. Extremely disappointed.",
I get reminders for supposedly late tests and vaccinations that I have already received. I have had them; my doctor knows I have had them. But MyChart seemingly won't listen to anyone and may be too hard even for my doctor's office to update. I'm really sick of having to try to correct information on MyChart all the time.,
The DR LISTON TO ME THAT WAS NICE .EVERY ONE WAS VERY NICE AFTER I GIT OUT OF HOSPITAL I AM STILL GONING FEELING BETTER,
"I navigate my elderly parents healthcare and it is incredibly challenging to navigate as neither have doctors that use MyChart. I spend 5-10 hours a week on their healthcare with several files to track their info. Arrghh. For my medical, I schedule appointments, review tests, message doctors and pay all through the MyChart app. It makes my medical so easy.",
So very happy I have this app. It keeps me and when my appointment so what time? They are and health is always important.,
"So convenient, especially as a parent. Easily message nurses, review appointment notes, schedule or reschedule anytime, and lists medications with request refill options.",
"It used to be a good app. I have been using this app for years now, and I avoid it today. The recent updates to the messaging system have rendered this app unusable. Try going to the developer website and cannot send in comments. Pathetic, they took a useful app and made communication more difficult.",
"It's great, the only thing is that the checking gets very tedious when you have multiple appointments in the week, like physical therapy. You have to answer so many questions every time, I just wish it was some other way for people with multiple appointments at week.",
The app is very easy to use. I can submit refill requests and schedule appt. I wish i could schedule mammograms through the app but they require you to call. Love the app.,
It would be a good app unfortunately when you attempt to find answers using messaging you won't receive any response. I've attempt multiple times since the beginning of November with no success.,
"Received an email that I have a message from MyChart. But it will not let me log in. I enter my pass code and get an error message. I tried logging in from the website and received the same error message. Worked great for over 4 years, now nothing. Back to calling and being on hold forever. Sigh.....",
I love the app..I like being able to look at my results,
Everything with this app is great. But I just got a notice in the mail I have a 25 dollar past due balance about to go to collections from Thompson hospital and this bill is no where on my app. My brother in law got the same bill. All of my app balances are paid up to date. For UofR and Thompson.,
I've used MyChart for several years now and have come to appreciate the service and rely on it. Making appts and contacting my physicians within the system is so easy and time saving. I also like having my list of medications at the touch of a finger and having my medical history available at anytime. My team of doctors is caring and available.,
Very easy to use the app. Love how all my information is all in one place,
"The app read fantastic. Loved everything about it. Suddenly it won't even open. Just says ""couldn't load terms and conditions. Please try again later. "" please fix! Otherwise give stars!",
"This is a fantastic example of the medical fields putting their best foot forward in adopting such a user-friendly app, that truly allows the us to take a very active role in our health care. The mychart app really sets the bar hight in utitlizing digtal options and convenience",
I'm so glad to have been able to use this app so that I can access all of my healthcare physicians in one spot with having numerous disorders sometimes getting in contact with doctors and knowing which medications interact and knowing what labs or which can be really really tedious and really overwhelming but having this app I can see my test results so I feel interactive and I feel like I'm in charge of my health my body and my life I would recommend this app to anybody and it's user friendly,
Easy to use and clean layout,
"Very useful tool. I use it regularly to keep in contact with my doctors. It's much better than trying to call and leaving a message. This way, you can ensure you get the entire message to the right person. Plus, all my diagnostic information is right in front of me any time I need it. Very effective at keeping me updated and informed.",
Works great. Needs more features for viewing and asking questions about labs and questions about the results in each link but I still like it. Love the message part get quicker response's thru the app.,
I love having so many things all in one place for my medical things,
Love being able to read my medical reports and history wherever and whenever. What more is needed?,
I appreciate the ability of sharing resul ints between several doctors of tests and lab results-- until they don't. I would have given a 5 rating to this app but lately it has become unreliable and medical history form hangs up not letting me post updates.,
"It's been very helpful to allow my PMD and my work comp physicians to have access to medical records. In the past I would have the burden of getting copies of records and/or pay for copies to exchange between physicians. A few individuals I've known, have lost their lives due to this lack of access or exchange of vital health information. Thank you for developing this application!!!",
"Finally, after years, don't know why I didn't do this sooner. Can't yet recommend suggestions. Expansive coverage & access to all aspects of medical areas = very helpful. Already checked blood test results at Quest from five days ago. Thanks again to all USF Health personnel, always friendly, thorough & efficient.",
"Amazing, user friendly and explainable It not only allows me to keep up to date with my upcoming appointments it allows me to look back on what days my passed appointmenst were. as well as scheduled upcoming appointments. appointments soand make all my needs met this is a terrific platform for me and I'm very gratefpul. It allows you to have one single version of the truth in real time allowing me to be able to see who my doctor is for upcoming appointment doctor's assistant and anyone involved",
I received a notification of a developer response to my one star review. Guess what...This app IS SO BAD you can't even find or read a response from the developer. This is my second and last post. My Chart is full of errors regarding my medical information. Its impossible to use with any degree of common sense. Also... using a patients medical records as a vehicle for advertising is disgusting. I will be deleting your app this week.,
"User friendly, very handy app to view all the information regarding visit, test results, due dates etc",
I love being able to know when my test results are available to view. Everyone should be able to have access to their medical records like this. It is also nice to be able to communicate with your doctor(s) without having to sit on hold for hours to have a single question answered. I just wish that the app had what the website does with showing your current test results compared to past results. That is very important to me and I hope you add it soon!!,
"Great day in the morning!!!,it's great to be able to access and review my file, make appointments, get my meds refilled, know my Dr's plan for keeping me Healthy, and so much more. I appreciate this apps use, towards keeping me active and in the best Health possible. My Chart is my future in motion. Very innovative and helpful app for my continuing Health.",
"Absolutely horrible. This app used to be great. Now no matter what I do, i get ""server error"" messges and ""something went wrong"" messages. Don't waste your time unitl they fix the bugs.",
I find it so convenient to have my medical information including appointments available all in one place.,
"Communication with my docs without phone calls is a perfect option. I can write every question, prescription refill and message my med team directly. All medical information available in a couple of clicks. User friendly. Edit: 06/24/22 Fixed spelling",
I have more than a year trying to get through this app so I can connect all my hospitals in one site but with this is impossible. I'm trying to register and every time they tell me that the information does not match. Can you please 🙏 send me a pin number so I can try to register. It is important because I can make my appointment here and I don't have to call or wait on line there.,
"My chart is a very convient way to communicate with my providers and keeps things organized. It lists all doctor visits, after visits summaries, medications, upcoming visits, test results to name a majority. I love the easy accessibility to my care team and keeps all info in one spot. Love my ""My Chart.""",
"Was going to give this app a 5 star, however twice this week I have had a notification that I have a new message or information but when I open the app, there is nothing new on there, also one thing the app designers need to keep in mind is that although I get almost everything on the app, I don't get my consultants letters on it to view",
My-DH with this App is far more user friendly. It makes it easier to find what your looking for and accessing more of your patient information. The bowser version is clumsy but this is much smoother.,
"It's a ""GREAT APP"" I use this alot of times because it's faster and better this way you can not get HUNG UP ON. 😀 That's a PET PEEVE of mine being on hold then they pick up the phone and then not answer just ""SIMPLY HANG UP ON U"" ""THEN GUESS WHAT IT HAPPENED AGAIN TODAY"" after 45 minutes BEING ON HOLD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. 👌🏻 It's very easy to use as well..GOD BLESS & GOOD LUCK ♧♧",
Can't make appt. with a specialist. Have to call directly to the specialist. Hard to look back on messages . Still having problems.,
MyChart works great for me. I love how I can see Dr's response/ interpretation of test/ diagnosis without having to receive a phone call or schedule an appointment. I have only been using it for 2 months but it is great.,
The organization of information and its ability to be located and accessed is poorly designed. Instructions for upcoming tests such as sent as letter from physicians can't be exported to personal email for printing a hardcopy. Overall a poorly thought out interface from a human factors perspective,
"Mychart helps me to stay on track with my appointments, and also I like having the ability to schedule and reschedule appointments. Having access to my medical records is huge!",
"App developers, I used your applications for several healthcare facilities including Providence OR, via EPIC/ Legacy I had a cyber security compromise 2022 which originated in The Dalles OR area,After the last incident my medical records have been modified, dates changed and many other problems. I contacted the facility using the support numbers provided by the Hospitals and office staff. The application is very useful, however your developers and support with this has not been helpful.",
"Good!! If it didn't have to involve getting an infusion, it would have been a perfect visit. It also involved getting stuck more than once for my IV, which is not the fault of the nurse that I have really bad veins. I still had a good visit. I do really like this group of physicians. I met Dr Mignone first in 2017 at Memorial Hospital. I'm very glad that that happened. I've been with them and other HCA FL physicians and ancillary facilities ever since. It has been much better medical treatment",
"Great app for managing your medical visits, communication and information.",
"I love being able to communicate with my doctor without having to call or have an appointment being able to update my personal information, getting to view my test results, medications, request refills, and schedule appointments, not just for me but for my kids as well. The best app ever",
"This a great experience. If forget anything and I need to go back on notes or pay a bill, everything is in one location. I feel that every doctor's office's should be required to go through this app. Thank you",
Great tool for patient care BUT would appreciate that current drug list would auto synch with other listed providers so they all have same info. Would like to add all providers but have forgotten or lost PW's .... Would be great to have symtem do the research and synch accounts.,
"This app is a a new roll out. At first glance, it does offer a lot BUT NONE OF MY PROVIDERS are visible anymore for me to message and schedule appointments. It is AS FRUSTRSTING AS MY 2.5HRS+ Dr's office visit b/c of the ""NEW SYSTEM"". Thoroughly unhappy. Do not roll out until the app can meet needs and patient scheduling is adjusted!!!!",
Love it! It's so easy to send messages to my doctor's or inquire about refills or appointments. The only thing that would make it better would be to be able to login with Biometrics like my fingerprint,
"MyChart was long overdo . This app is amazing. Keeping track of my appointments and my care, both in n out the hospital is just truly amazing. Love this app!",
"The one app I can get all of my medical information in one place.*UPDATE* For those of you who have issues with the timelieness of the app please take into consideration that there are doctors, nurses, techs, transcribers & record keepers. The developer of this app has put heart, soul, and damn near every organization that you can possibly think of or use. And to the one man who likened the timelieness of his providers slow pace to that of greed why as humansdo we always go there?think on ityall",
"Records keep disappearing, can't access things when needed, can't print from the phone app. Lots of issues. Customer support very limited",
"Terrible... All I want to do is register & sign into my chart....to access my medical information & contact doctors on line. The print out instructions seem so simple. When I began the online process, AFTER I HAVE ALL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION, all these offers came up. Of which I could not only get out of, but also did not understand. I still have not been able to set user name nor pass word. I do not have all day to play w/ this app nor do I want to continusly give out my personal information.",
I like this app but I never know when I receive messages from my drs about appointments. I didn't know one of my drs had sent a referral to be seen back in 2022. Just seen it 2 weeks ago. Thanks.,
Lifeline to my physicians. I use this app all too often. I message through it. Get refills. See lab results. I'd be lost without this app.,
My chart is a great app. It keeps me up to date on everything from my doctor office. I love being able to just go to my chart and leave a message for my doctor and get a quick response.,
"Absolutely the best! Now, The Christ Hospital is talking about switching to their own version. I don't want this to happen because that will be a step backward because I use many different doctors who have different hospital affiliates. With MyChart I have access to all my records in one place and can be shared with all my doctors. I have already seen the mistakes by Christ Hospital doctors not being informed of my conditions because they refuse to look at my UC doctor diagnosis.",
It works as needed. I dislike having to verify every time I use the app on my phone and computer even though I click 'dont verify this device next time ',
"MyChart is a helpful resource. However, there needs to be an update access for vaccinations and wellness which may be administered at another facility.",
"I get 88% of everything I need to know about my healthcare from this app. My doctor has the rest of the info. This app syncs with every visit & you can ask questions, send messages, test results, & get a ton of updates! I love this app. It has become vital to my care.",
I really like my charts. It's easy to understand. If it wasn't I wouldn't be on here leaving a review. It saves so much time because you don't have to be put on hold with the dr 's office. It also reminds you of different appointments you need to make. It's just a great app to have.,
"I used to love this app on my old Pixel 2, but on my new Pixel 6 there's no way to go back to a previous screen when reviewing test results so I have to force stop every single time. Not so useful now.",
Unable to verify mobile number although they have it and use it.,
"I like that you can add multiple medical places and it's easy to jump from one to another. And you can get on your families accounts too. It's so easy to reach out to your medical team, send a message, send documents/photos, and set up appointments.",
Very convenient easy to use and help me keep up with my health data and appointments 😊,
Find this app very hard to use.Can find no info on letters from doctors. Thinking of deleting altogether,
"I think this is an awesome platform to have during a pandemic process. However this does impact those that are less acclimated to a digital platform and need a more hands on approach. This platform does streamline the medical process but it removes the face to face and quality care and comfort aspect that most medical industry advertise. I use this platform when seeking medical attention, but I hope they will continue to support the face to face, hands on, and phone aspect in the medical process",
I have multiple sclerosis and this is the best way to stay in contact with my doctors! Best app ever!,
Absolutely amazing app. I have never felt more comfortable when it comes to my healthcare.,
My real problem with my chart is even though I've talked with the technicians in person and on the phone I still can't connect with my main doctor. There is a doctor in the same office that I see that I can connect with and passes along information as needed. I just really hate that I can't talk to my actual doctor it has to be like secondhand. Also none of my other doctors use this so this is like the third different platform to talk with doctors that I have.,
"I love being able to communicate with my medical professionals on my time and they can get back to me on their time. Sometimes it is inconvenient, because of I might want something right now, but if it's that bad I can wait and call office or call 911. I still love this app.",
"I do like how this app is get up so easy to navigate. It has just what I need to access for my medical chart. Test results, messages, appointments, etc. I'll use it til the day I die. 10/10 recommend",
"WORST APP EVER!!!! IF I COULD HAVE, I WOULD HAVE GIVE ZERO STARS!! When I go to Google Play Store it tells me the app is Installed, yet when I click on it, it INSISTS I have to INSTALL IT!! Desperately trying to send information via the app to my surgeon, but the app WILL NOT ACCEPT my user name or password (and I KNOW they are CORRECT). Tried the ""forgotten username"" & ""forgotten password"", said I would receive email. TWO HOURS AND COUNTING, STILL NO DAMN EMAIL!!! But then again, what did I expect? The treatment at the hospital was appalling, so of course they are going to use a useless app!!",
"I don't know how I could have kept track of my recent scourge of appointments and tests without MyChart. So easy to use. All encompassing. Could be better I keeping track of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, etc, but still does a pretty good job.",
"I put off downloading this app forever. My sister told me about it last year I think. I finally downloaded it 2 months ago. Now, I am on it all the time. I love the ease and convenience of scheduling appointments or communicating with my providers.",
I would give it a higher rating cuz it's pretty awesome to get to see your test results and stuff like that immediately as soon as everybody else is aware as well however it doesn't give you explanations of what each test is or what each result as you have to like looked abbreviations up online and stuff which takes a lot of time. Id rate it 5-stars if they they put the abbreviations in layman terms.,
"It's really convenient to use and keeps all of my info in one place. A bit of a hassle setting it up -but it is highly sensitive information, so I totally get it. Once that's done, everything else is a breeze.",
"Love this app. Making appointments, getting prescription refills, seeing & understanding lab results, confirming appointments-all so easy to do. I love the convenience of e check in. The only negative I have is the home screen messages are not kept current. My husband had both covid vaccine doses & his booster yet it continues to say he needs to schedule his first dose.",
Very helpful as a patient. Great ease of access to lab results and after visit summaries. Good means to send non-emergent questions to the treatment team. I'm also a physician and use Epic medical records and can attest to the excellent cross system capabilities.,
"Horrible, signed up once, so I thought and it wouldnt recognize my user Id and password. Tried resetting both and the app keeps refreshing to the same screen asking for the same info. Horrible.",
The information isn't correct ALOT of times. I have physically watched my care givers enter information and the app doesn't accept their changes. The notifications pop up even if you turn them off when you know your health but they insist on send you immunization bs when you NOW you have a compromised immune system and CAN'T get vaccinated. YET insist on reminding/saying your over due. As if to try to portray you as a non compliant patient so you get denied claims. My caregivers are the BEST!,
"I like that you're able to see health record, medications ,appointments etc whenever needed also able to text doctors if need to for questions also has reminders for your appointments. Very easy app to use I also love that you could add your children to it as well.",
Excellent app up to date care...,
"Sometime in the last few months I've lost the ability to see the information for my child. I'm only able to access my stuff. Also, I can't find any type of help or support button within the app to address this issue. Very frustrated.",
"This app is a great idea , but unfortunately very cumbersome, frequent server error messages when trying to access crucial information. No help files, no tech support live chat, no contact info anywhere in the app. I hate this app. that I'm forced to use .",
This app was great until today! Now I can't email providers or find past appointment details. Almost everything I click tries to sendme to a web browser rather than keeping me in the app. This is the worst update I can imagine.,
"Works great, easy to communicate, make and change appointments.",
"This app is awesome, everything medical at my finger tips, appointments, meds, messaging, covid vaccine status and info. The only thing it doesn't do is have access to my pharmacy. I'm sure that's coming in the future.",
"Phenomenal care. My virtual visit with PA Stephen King could not have been any better. He was incredibly efficient, competent and direct without being cold or uncaring. I felt as if I was in the most competent care available and there was no extra time wasted on advertisements or unnecessary garbage as most companies have. This company makes everything from billing to referrals an absolute breeze I couldn't believe it when I was finished with my appointment that everything was totally fulfilled",
"There is no connectivity. Get all the hospitals using MyChart connected. This app should be controlled entirely by the developers not individual health care systems. I have cancer AND a worn out artificial joint & consequently am being seen by 2 different Drs. associated with 2 different hospitals. Both hospitals have MyChart, but I can only receive notifications from one of them. I can't be switching between servers all the time.",
"Great way to keep up with appointments, get medical test results and be able to communicate with physicians. I am not technically savy at all, but this is a simple, user friendly app!!",
The Best Doctor's Office I have ever had. The Staff are very professional and polite.Also the MyChart app works great for me,
I like the app. I tried to save my payment information and when you give the payment method a nickname the submit button gets covered up. I just updated it but I can't try again until I have to make a payment,
I have enough health issues that see multiple doctors. My Chart gives me access to all my test and lab results as well as my updated medication list. I converse with my primary care physician and get timely answers to my questions. Very helpful tool if you have multiple medical issues to track (disclosure: All of my physicians are in the same medical group).,
Using it is simple. Great way to keep track of all medical info for my kids and I. Love the ability to screen shot. The only thing that I would change is to have the ability to print directly from the app.,
I absolutly love this MyChart app. It brings me so much closer to the nurses and i get questions answered quickly. I can get appointments and cancel without having to call and wait and wait and may not even get through. I also get reminders of appointments. Just love it.,
Love this app. I couldn't keep up with my appointments or where they are if it wasn't for my chart. It keeps me notified when I am ready to put in a request at the pharmacy. I cant say enough good things about the way the way the app help keeps me on track with so much of my health care.,
Reminders of appt. Test results that I can review myself....list of health issues and medications as well as being able to submit information prior to appointments as easy as opening my phone. This app is wonderful. Thank you,
I've forgotten my password 2x this app makes it easy to reset it. I like having my COVID card on there,
"Great way to view medical tests, results, doctors notes, appointments, upcoming tests/procedures and appointment scheduling, prescribed medications, etc.. Fairly easy to navigate through the various pages. This type of communication program should be a standard for most medical facilities.",
"Horrible!! This app was recommended by CVS to track progress on a covid test. Only NYC providers are listed for the state of NY. There are other medical facilities outside of NYC. Not only that, the app doesn't recognize user names and passwords. Waste of time and am letting CVS know. Hopefully they'll find an app that actually works.",
"The mobile version is somewhat limited, but good enough for on the go use. The desktop version understandably is more comprehensive and user friendly.",
"Very easy to use. Can easily make appointments, can email question that are answered quickly, see lab results when they are posted, see past appointments you've had and more that I haven't explored yet!",
I love being able to send my doctor a message directly and I know I'll get a response fairly quickly. I can see all my test results in one area and ask questions if needed. I can pay my co-pays and schedule appointments all in one app. Makes it so much easier with a large amount of information all in one app.,
"Gives access to medical records, such as test results, but not complete physician notes. However, not being able to delete out of date system messages is annoying; they clutter the page unnecessarily.",
I'm new to this app and it looks very convenient. I took a start away because I have gotten results I need explaining and no one responds. Says I have to wait 48hrs and it's been such. I don't see a way to contact someone about results. When I need answers ASAP.,
"I kept on getting notification from mychart that i have new message. When i tried to log in one of organizations, i kept on getting server error and the other one dont have any new messages. This happens after recent update. Please fix this since its the only way i can access my info.",
"I tried downloading this app, but every time I tried to log in, it told me ""contents can not be autofilled"" even if I had typed it. I could not log in because of this; so I uninstalled the app and will continue to use the web version until this is fixed.",
Great to be able to communicate with my provider via the apps email. It's easier for the provider or their nurse to respond to your concerns. Plus it'd wonderful to be able to see your test results and be able to ask questions or concerns about those tests. I'm so glad Carilion Health System has it.,
This is without a doubt the most difficult site I have ever tried to sign into. Nearly every time I try to sign in I'm told my password is incorrect when I know it is what I gave it the last time I tried. So much is tiny print I have to spend time making the print larger. We are going to get me signed in. I won't give up. The whole site is a huge nightmare.,
Too many glitches I have to keep retrying to get into whatever it is that I want to get into. I enjoy of having access to my health records etc I just feel like it could be a little easier without retrying 50 million times.,
It doesn't show that you have notifications like everything else once you click on it you can see that you have mail I wish they would end up showing that you have a message or something so you don't have to check it everyday twice a day,
"What's wrong with your app. All of a sudden I can't log in to my account. It keeps saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."" I was literally just logged into my account after getting my password changed and was able to log in and when I came back after being off the app for a while, it's saying I can't log in. What's going on?!?",
I do not like this app they cannot correct the fact that they cannot download information from University Hospital on me. They also do not have a way to separate the past visits from the coming up visit it gets very freaking confusing. I just had two visits this month in the past week. I only have one visit coming up in the next week and one visit coming up at the end of the month show all of the old visits are ahead of them. Call tech support and they don't know what the hell they're doing,
This is surprisingly efficient. I didn't expect immediate blood work results or the option to schedule appointments and fill out forms without even going in. This app ended up being a good time saver.,
What worked in the past doesn't anymore. Recent update slowed it down to a crawl. Everything you try comes back as a server error. Re-instally doesn't help. App is now useless.,
"Never works anymore, about the last year! Before that it was great----just lugubriously slow!",
No ads great app,
"Please make it possible to make a screenshot, I just want to share it to the mother of my children so she knows when the appointment is. Now it's impossible to share meetings, as the required info is missing from mails and not shareable",
MyChart contains inaccurate information. I contacted healthcare provider and they provided written confirmation that they are not able to input said information. I received message from Epic that they do not input information into app. So if I know I didn't enter it & healthcare provider didn't enter it & MyChart/Epic didn't enter it it appears the security is compromised. And No no one but me has access to my account information and my passwords are complicated & secure. They don't respond to e,
"Very handy. Really good to contact provider and see test results and prescriptions. Fair design. Messages do not disappear after taking an action on them, very annoying.",
"I like MyChart, because I am able see my results from an appointment. I can also reschedule or cancel an appointment if need be. I can pay the balance on my bill if I want to. I can see the notes and recommendations from my doctor about my appointments. Their are so many positives with this app!!",
it's very handy to get messages from my doctor to make appointments to see my present and past operations vaccinations it reminds me when one is due I really like the app or to give it a five-star rating but it's really slow but yeah I would recommend it for anybody that wants to keep track of their medical history so thank you and be kind to yourself better yet be kind to someone else,
"Had to end up calling and still not successful with this app for Parkland anyway. I'm done trying, I will do it the old fashion way: cause now its a headache. Uninstalled!!! Not getting any more of my time. This app doesn't even deserve a full star and maybe not even half. So I say good luck or wait till someone hacks it.",
Easy to use. Makes keeping up with all my appointments 100 times easier. The online check in makes getting into my appointments dramatically faster. It keeps me updated with all the on going changes in Healthcare.,
"I enjoy the convenience of the app. However, my messages, and prescription refill requests, go unanswered even though messages show ""read"" in the message center.",
Great app when it works. No longer able to open on Android.,
"BEWARE! Do not pay bills through app, some bills disappear after paying and if you call they cannot help getting them to display. Program is poor. Someone at work lost bills also. I can see a bill from 2020 but not one I just paid.",
Copy/paste is disabled. Such a bad decision for no reason.,
"It is excellent! ""My Chart"" gives all the information I need about my health.",
"Doesn't work offline, needs password and verification code EVERY time you open the app, super annoying to use and navigate. I only use it because I there is no other option and would give it zero stars if it was possible.",
"I love using My Chart, it's fast, easy and very convenient.They always get back to you within 24 hours, so much faster than using the phone also love this app because when I was unable to get to the doctors we did live chat I recommend My Chat to everyone it's a fast easy way to get test results and to get refills on your and leave messages to your",
The only benefit is tracking appointments and lab results. You cannot schedule an appointment through the app although it makes you think you can. There is also no summary from the doctor following the visit. Very limited use of otherwise a powerfull tool.,
Super frustrating to try to navigate. Trying to add my kids but won't let me. And then I got a new phone but I can't transfer over as I don't remember my password and I receive nothing when I request forgot my password. The hours of the records department is only open till 230 which is frustrating,
"As a patient I'm not able to access x-ray, MRI & CAT images. I can't leave messages for my doctors. I can't use the codes to add my other doctors to this chart. One of my doctors downloaded MRI, x-ray & CAT images in this system and it purged it the first time and the second time I can't view the images. When I try clicking on it to view it takes me to NIH child cancers of the spine, brain and nervous system. I hate this app.",
"I am using this app trying to sync my records from my different providers and it's not working, I can just see one office, it's very difficult don't have access to the most recent medical records .",
It helps keep my appointments and tells me when I have an appointment,
My Chart has been one of the best patient portals I have ever dealt with. It allows contact with my physicians whenever I have a question and allows them to contact me with any concerns they may have. I am able to see results of tests and labs. It keeps a record of all of my medical information in one spot that I can access whenever I need it.,
I really like the My Chart app. I have access to my info. I use it all the time. Good job.,
"I'm always using mychart to help me with reminders, appointment and test results. Very handy, but they should be a little faster about posting information to be reviewed. But they do a good job overall.",
Very detailed information on test results and notes. Love checking in and giving my detailed history for my doctors!,
"Easy-Peasy! I love using this app! All my medical info in one place, I can ask questions of any of my physicians and not have to wait. I can pre-register for my appointment and save time at check-in. I can view and pay my bills with just a few touches on my phone! Like I said, EASY-PEASY!!!",
I love my my chart I use it for all my doctor's appointments make an appointment refills I do I've asked anyone who is a patient at UNF Health to always use my chart,
I absolutely love this app. Being able to pull up all my info about my health is a blessing. Seeing my test results with my own eyes anytime I want without disturbing anyone in the office is awesome. It helps me stay motivated for better health and involved in my treatment... Thank you,
"Absolutely love this app. I can access my chart records, view my test results from blood work to a MRI report from the emergency room. Has an updated medication list. Plus a way to send and receive a message from your doctor or nursing staff. I enjoyed the ability to review my lad work and educate myself about it.",
"My Chart is convenient and user friendly when paying for office visits prior to your appointment, altering them when you've arrived at the clinic, scheduling or changing appointments, and posting appointments on your personal calendar. Messages can be sent and received to your doctor, your summary visits can be seen in the app along with helpful information about your list of medications, doctors, covid, injections needed, and more. My Chart is an app with even more features, use it and see.",
Not a Happy camper Had problem login in because I forgot username and password so I called to reset. The guy was pleasant and gave me temporary password untill I made new one ok that's done. But...now they want to verify email address and phone number and I put it in but I can't get any verification codes to phone number or email... Help. Why????? Do they make all this so complicated,
"I’ve been trying to set up a My Chart with a new provider FOR 3 HOURS. Nothing works, I put in my name, birthdate, and the last four of my SS. Information wrong. Once or 4 times I had to put my whole SS number in order didn’t like that at all. Then the server couldn’t connect, its showing right there. I’m going to take this provider down. I have the paperwork here. Would have liked to see what they wrote. How do I uninstall it? I lost my phone and of all things my Henry Ford Chart was locked from too many failed attempts. I was on my way home at the time. No one tried to get into my bank or credit cards, just my medical, fishy, no?????",
Better to have one condolidated test sheet/report which shows all test results with test date sequence so that we can see change in test results over years(test names on the rows and test dates will be in the column format). Each new test should be included into the Test sheet so that we can see both evolution of same test and also other tests so that we can get better idea and also can print it and take to doctor appointments.,
"I find the presentation confusing to keep items separate when looking at items with groupings, i.e., vaccinations I ha e had and ones that I need. But overall I do not find it easy to figure what has been entered and what is missing and needed. Also, the Proof of Covid Vaccine page sh I understand be easily printable.",
Very helpful in keeping updated on my healthcare needs,
"The app is very user friendly and easy to use. You get a large variety of medical providers, so it's useful wherever you go for keeping track of records, test results and medications even if you move around.",
"I don't like this whole digital/computer system, it's confusing, I can't write my questions and get answers in a timely manner and the check in system is annoying. Certain questions should not have to be repeated every time you check in.",
"I had fallen ill and I needed medical attention. I needed a doctor's note for time I would miss from work. But due to the possibility that I may have had covid, the doctor's office staff would only send me a doctor's note via this app to where I could email it to my employer from there. So they did but I couldn't send it to my employer because the app had a security feature that prevented that. Now whenever I try to open the doctor's note the app shuts down! I do not recommend this app!",
Mychart is a worthless app. I signed up for a covid test thru CVS. The text exchange with CVS to see my results told me to sign up with Mychart. Signing up was initially no problem but as I progressed thru the app it wanted my healthcare company then login with them. The app would not let me see my results until I logged in with my provider. I just want to see if the test is positive or negative. Mychart is the worst app ever. Now I have to schedule another covid test. Totally unacceptable. DO,
"I keep getting a ""can't connect to server. Try again later"" message. Have deleted the app and reinstalled it and still doesn't work. I will try it again after it updates again. If it doesn't work after that I will just delete it and use the website.",
I have not had a problem with this app until recently when I thought I was paying my insurance monthly but apparently only 1 of payments went through now I haven't been NOT covered for 5 months & no one contacted me! idk why or how my payments didn't go through but they need to fix that.,
For the most part A great tool for the patient as well as physician... You can learn alot about the doctors you have seen through what they put in their notes as well as summary...But word of advice Always go over details in your chart Look for missing information Look for changes that shouldn't have been taken out or are missing... Especially allergies and intolerances to medications or anything else... Have had issue and still do with past meds being deleted or missing from my allergies,
Forgot when your appointment is? Look in mychart. Forgot address? Look in MyChart Forgot suite # LOOK in MyChart. This app has made all my doc visits so much easier. Want to see your test results? Yep it's in MyChart. Need to cancel an appointment or make one? Go to MyChart. I can't believe it took medical professionals so long to make this app. Absolutely amazing changed my life no more anxiety over missing doctor visits,
"Kind of a waste of time, doing questionnaires and pre check in if the exact same questions are asked again when you come in office. Seems like a lot of busy work that is unnecessary. Don't know if the app is wasting my time or if the office is. 🤔 as soon as I find out, one be deleted.",
"Awesome App!, I love it because I can keep track of all of my meds, doc appointments, medical history, lab results, etc and message my doctor(s).",
"Cool ... but I don't know how to link other hospitals and ish yo??? Also, a follow up comment to the question below. Lately, confusion and my attention span seems to be negatively effected by aggressive and overwhelming to the point that it can effect my health and life in an unproductive manner. So I'm glad loads of advertisement aren't consuming the attention my health deserves and Is vital to heal and continue to remain healthy with the complexity of the situation feeds prolonged healthing.",
"Super Easy to use, extra convenient..",
I feel Dr Groves has my best interest when it comes to my health. and my chart app makes it easy to communicate,
This app is great. It helps me track my appointments and health so much!,
"Will not let me log in, which is extremely problematic after it sends me texts alerting me to new messages, tests, etc. from my provider. This app is utterly useless if you can't login.",
"Like all new apps there's little documentation. But, it's much improved. This iteration is more user-friendly and gives more complete information. All in all as a retired programmer how to give it a five.",
"Every time I try to open messages or test results or anything, it comes up with an error, and I can never seem to get where I need to go. I can never see my messages, test results, etc..",
"I like this App it provides me with a good overview of Doctor Visits and Test Results. I find it very easy to use. I feel an app like this is long overdue! Instead of having a different Patient Portal for each Doctor, I only have to go to 1 site to get any needed information from most of my Doctors. I also like that it allows you to send and receive messages from my Doctors. Most Doctors in the RWJ Barnabas Health System use it and some from the Hackensack Meridian Health Care do.",
"Doesn't work for anything other than looking at my appointments and sometimes sending messages. Any other option you choose says ""there's a communication issue....."". The app is a cool concept if it'd actually work....",
A good site for sure that is very user friendly to understand.,
Very helpful for tracking Dr. Appt. and medication refills and getting test results in a timely matter.,
"Love being able to view results, schedule appt's, and contact my providers via mychart, it is so convenient. I feel confident in the privacy and confidentiality of the app and recommend it to anyone.",
Absolutely wonderful. Everything is at my finger tips. Labs are available in less than 24 hours. Appointments and visit notes are posted... and easy to navigate too,
Very confusing! Difficult deleting messages-think you logged out and I havened. Just so many little things. Boom! You log in to my chart and everything has changed very upsetting at times.,
This app is so helpful and easy to navigate and communicate with our care providers. I love that I have all my family's medical information neat and organized in the palm of my hand. I have to say my favorite thing about this app is having access to test results as soon as they are available. Now I don't have to worry about writing down an keeping track of everything because it's all on my phone if I need it.,
"Primarily all the data they collect, am NO fan of their epic software, clumsy and needlessly complex. That said, they collect data, most of which is really none of their business ""financial and 8 others"" what's that supposed to mean? What ""8 others""? As stated by their moto, "" make money"" says all one needs to know.",
"Worst app ever. It does not work on my laptop. I can sign in on my cell phone, but not through the app. When I try to log in on the app or on my laptop, it says I have reached the maximum attempts and need to reset my PW - which DOES NOT WORK. I clearly have the correct login b/c I am on the site on my cell. This needs a serious overhaul",
"Makes communication with my providers 100% easier. When picking a provider, ahn was picked for many reasons but mycart was one of them. It makes me feel included in my care with easy access to my records.",
"Used to work, now it doesn't. Won't accept my password, username, or email; when I open the app, it has a banner at the bottom advertising the app, and it keeps navigating to a page advertising the app. THE SAME APP I OPENED.",
"Horrible, do they really pay attention?!! I have tried to schedule an appointment multiple times through their app with no success. I ended up having to call and schedule it over the phone. Why have it as a option if you are never going to schedule it online?",
"A wonderful, great, reliable app. I love this because i can look up my own information vs waiting for my Dr to call me. It is super easy to use as well. There is ways to see your results, make a appointment, check your records. I highly recommend this app.",
"Has been very helpful in keeping my track of my whole family's medical care. Appointments, bills, prescriptions, even direct to doctor messaging! If only a complete log of all of my statements was accessible. I went paperless because of MyChart, but can't always find a statement needed for FSA payment claims.",
The app w/My Chart is very convenient. It's Locations are helpful.,
Awesome. So helpful. I highly recommend using this.,
"My Chart makes things so much easier to keep in contact with my care team, see all results, make appointments, do video appointments, and refill medications. I like it a lot. It also helps my family and other offices be able to know what's going on with me when needed.",
Can't compare my past results like it used to do. I have to scroll all the way down and look at past results individually. Not user friendly when updated.,
"Absolutely love it! It's easy to navigate and it's beyond helpful to keep track of appointments and paperwork, request appointments, communicating with you doctor and health care team. Would give more then 5 if I could",
I enjoy the app and like that I can access my info anytime/anywhere. However my doctor or primary care person is with Martin's Point. I would like to be able to enter my immunizations and/or screening tests (lab work etc) to have a more complete up to date record.,
"Cannot even get to my PeaceHealth charge anymore, maybe the developers should spend a little more time checking it out before they use it as an app for the whole medical facility. Can't get to my appointments even though they send me an email and want me to e assign in to my appointment. Won't allow you to do that. Was a waste of money for PeaceHealth to even pay the developer for this app. I hope there's somebody at PeaceHealth that is actually reading these reviews and trying to fix the issue",
"The MyChart is so easy to use! For someone who has anxiety not having constant phone call reminders or having to call for appointments, meds, or cancellations makes it so much easier for me and alot less stressful!",
"Absolutely love my chart! All of my health information upcoming appointments, history, notes, medications and doctors contacts all-in-one place. My chart was probably one of the best things put into place for patients.",
"Great experience. So easy, accurate and dependable. Fast easy way to get test results, renew prescriptions, view upcoming appointments and more. I also have it linked with other hospitals and doctors outside of the CH system.",
All of a sudden I can no longer log in to the app even though my log in credentials work fine if I'm trying to access my health care organizations myChart via a Web browser. It keeps telling me there was a problem.,
"This is a great app. It is very functional and informative. One major improvement would be to have an anti-glare mode, some call it a dark mode, for people who have vision issues, like me.",
I ues this app for the eazy smart exzam ( virtual visits) but every few months they update it and the smart exzam is no long is drectly conected to the my chart portal (so its no longer uesable) or they deleat your insurence informashion ( besides that 1 part ) this app helps keep track of everything thats important i really love uesing this app ( i just wish the smart exzam issue would get fix all ready since i ues it alot :/ ),
I like the ease of messages and appointment reminder. Dislike the precheck-in. The app ask you about your reason for visit. Then goes through the 20 pages of medical history every time your tying to pre check. It should ask what your current visit is for and symptoms. Not your medical history if you have already put it in.,
"Makes everything from renewing your prescriptions to making appointments so much easier! No waiting on hold on the phone anymore! Plus, everything is done in excellent timing. Love this app!",
"Convenient, but, when sending a message, the text field is non-scrollable. So, inexplicably, you can't readily review what you have written. Please fix this.",
Easy to see messages and test results when posted! Can leave messages and get responses when phone usage isn't available or convenient. I appreciate it's ease and convenience.,
"I love being able to message my Dr, and view my test results.",
Great at letting me view anything other than Billing; trying to access Billing will fail or crash the app 90% of the time. I've reinstalled 3 times and the issue persists.,
"Makes messaging/receiving messages easier, by far. Everything in one app!",
"Worst app I have ever had to deal with. Constantly having to reset passwords, calling tech people who never answer. Geisinger insists on using it for communication with patients and then wonders why patients give bad surveys for them because their communication is the absolute worst. Even had an employee of Geisinger tell me her own mother couldn't log on. Horrible. Can't access blood test results and appts because even the PC version doesn't work.",
I love how easy it is to get in touch with my provider. Much better than waiting for a return phone call. I wish there was a way to print a message or note from MyChart. It would be great if I could either print from the app or send something like a letter from my provider to my email. I had to get my provider to write me a note for work that I had to go pick up in order to get the letter. My job said they wouldn't look it up and they wanted a paper letter.,
Terrible UI that makes me have to log in over and over as it kicks me out. This is the same for every organization. Also seems that my information in a mix of many different providers that aren't connected. Half wonder if that's a HIPPA violation considering the lack of a RoI. They did not have this information until the switch to mychart happened. QUIT TELLING ME THAT THE APP YOU DEVELOPED ONLY SUCKS BECAUSE OF THE PROVIDER RATHER THAN YOUR POORLY DEVELOPED APP.,
I was having difficulty this afternoon. It was asking me to find my organization. When I tried to find it is said that it didn't exist when the app was working perfectly fine this morning. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall it to have it go back to normal. I don't understand that kind of update that yall had to do to it.,
"I like having a place to go where I can have some other kind of engagement with my Doctor's other than just going in for a visit! I can refill my prescriptions, schedule an appointment or reschedule an appointment, ask questions, get answers to my questions, remind my doctor's of missing medications and etc. It's great to be able to pretty much be able to do everything all in one place!",
"The app has a lot of good attributes, but the inability to disable email notifications is oversight of epic failure. My phone just about explodes when I get a message.",
Very easy to look up different categories on the app. Navigating through My Chart is well put together! Never had any issues looking for specific health problems for myself to address!,
"I really like the app. From appointments to to test results, all your information is right there. If you don't know what something means you can find that out in app too. This app has a lot of great features and information. I gave 4 stars because there is always room for improvement",
Love that I can go on and see the results of my test. Or go on to review notes from physician. Sometimes it's hard to remember everything that was said at the time. Love that I can just go on to see when appointments are scheduled or schedule appointments. Also that I can send messages to my physician. Very helpful when keeping up with everyone's appointments.,
This program is the best thing I've found for communicating with all of my Doctors since I use Baptist health for everything I can and for setting up appointment's and test so easy I always get answers in a very timely manner I'm 63 did not use to communicate only to see Doctors results for visit and test results now that I've used it to communicate with Doctors and set up test I need I'll always go to My chart I think it's awesome I love it!!!,
The app keeps me organized when it comes to medical appointments and is user friendly. I really like seeing the results of my blood work before going to see my doctor. This app allows pre-check-in before I enter the office which speeds up the process. I highly recommend this app.,
Really unhappy that the app. No longer allows patients to scheduled lab appointments. Some of my physicians don't use my chart. NOW I have Try and call to schedule a lab appointment Phone line is always Very Busy and you Can't get thru!!!! 😒 so annoyed!!! I have to schedule labs every 3 months!!,
"Lost biometric login with latest update. With the latest update there is no way to use the biometric login with the app. It's trivial but it works my nerves. As someone who has to check the app multiple times a day, this adds up.",
"The app is very useful for tracking appointments, managing co-pays, receiving messages from health care teams, and housing patient information. There are some sync issues between the app and the health providers' system and the document upload on the patient side could use some improvements.",
"My after visit summary should NOT include my next appointment or that I am over due for vaccinations or papsmears! Smh. I need this info as proof that I have been screened for Covid-19 and awaiting results but 3ven if I didn't it's unessasary. The app is messy with info thrown everywhere and you can't delete or ""dismiss"" all of it, only selected things. App needs more organization and to be cleaned up.",
Tried creating an account so I can get my covid results but it is impossible. Sends you to the web and then you don't get a chance to setup name or password but that's what it asks for. Absolutely the WORST app of any sort I have ever seen. You should be ashamed of yourselves for putting this garbage out.,
While most of the limitations of the application are attributes of what a particular Healthcare organization allows in using the product. Some use it as fully featured as available. Its major limitations are in the limited file upload to images only. No data uploading is allowed. One org I use only uses it for appointment notifications and reminders. Limits of use may be on the side of the provider.,
Amazing what information is at your fingertips as long as you make sure you keep your phone secure. 😉🔐 I really appreciated the notifications and ease of accepting earlier appointments within the app. I also appreciated linking multiple health care providers in one app.,
"This app is great. It is like having your health care in the palm of your hand. If you want your test results before you see your doctor, or see x-rays, scans . Then they or here. Appointment reminders or visit summaries. They are here. Need a Urgent care ? Find one here and you can also check in here. Pay a bill right here. Get records? You can also get here. Almost anything imaginable you can do right at your fingertips!!!",
"You can't add your child or anyone else to the same app when setting up appointments. Other than that, it's a good app. The DeveloperJust needs to do some adjustments to the app and it will be awesome.",
"Excellent tool, I would definitely recommend using this app.",
"Great access to lab results only a couple hours after the test sample was taken. Also, I was able to make an advance appointment for next year's annual wellness exam with the doctor I wanted to see and haven't been able to get in with for a couple years. Great App!",
"MC is ""perfectly inefficient"" & creates many more problems than it solves! MANY more issues than listed here: 1. Message function severely limited, 300 characters. Get real. 2. Messaging prev allowed 3 attachments, 3 Meg total limit. Ridiculous. Now, allows NO attachments. Going backwards ! 3. MC does not list entire ""Healthcare Team"". Docs, nurses, support staff missing. 4. EPIC DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS! NOTE: This review is character limited. I could go on and on.",
"App is okay, I gave it 4 stars, app would be much much better if one were able to sync the appointments calendar with the Google calendar. Is that possible and I'm just not noticing how to do it? If not, it would be something for you to consider. Thanks!",
"Too difficult to access. I have had to update my password every time I open this app. Now, I can't even access it with my verification code. This app is utter garbage. I will never use it again even if the problem is fixed. Good riddance.",
Registration is failing every time with some captcha error. I suspect below comment is not helpful.,
"Absolutely love this app. What a fantastic advancement in Healthcare. So simple to use and a brilliant way to communicate with care providers. My only complaint would be bulk notification dumps by providers regarding covid vaccinations! We get enough misinformation, we don't need bias opinions from the board of directors that were forced on them by the CDC from the political affiliations of choice. I'd rather trust those who care for me directly than continue to be told I need to get my jab!",
"One of my children sees a therapist and because of that I do not see the bill on mychart and so I am not able to pay it with mychart. Good thing I still get a paper bill because otherwise I wouldn't know what was owes. I have called tech support, spent hours trying to figure it out and I have been told there is nothing that can be done. It is a hassle waiting on the phone to talk to someone to pay the bill and because I tend to remember about paying after service hours.",
"This app is a life saver it's so convenient and a great time saver! I love it since I am able to access my medical information also had them link my daughter's medical chart with my account which is so helpful since it allows me access medical letters, documents, lab/tests results which if her school needs documentation I am able to access it and take screen shots if necessary. Plus you can link other health centers into your account such as MGH/BMC. Also able to email your doctors as well.",
"Can't log in when outside the USA. Does not allow password saving as an option. Might be a clean design but if it's not fully functional, it's not very useful.",
"I signed up because my doctor's office insisted. I noted my username and password. The next day I cannot sign in - changed user name, still cannot sign in. Tried to change the password and the message was that I used the wrong code number. I HAD BOTH THE CODE AND THE SIGN IN PAGE PULLED UP ON THE SCREEN!! THE NUMBERS WERE THE SAME! Just like everything else associated with El Rio Health, nothing works...",
"I L❤️ve, L❤️ve, L❤️ve..... THIS APP>> it's super easy to use & personalize, & I'm able to send messages to directly communicate with my doctor's. And that's 💯% extremely important to me. + I can directly request medication refills, talk about concerns with my health!! Let them kno of any changes and etc. Every Dr needs to use MyChart!! It's extremely beneficial.",
"I find this app to b e the easiest one to work with. It works well with coordinating with calendar, quick access to appts., test results, apps. Messages to and from Dr's. and tele visits.",
great app but unfortunately I'm not able to sign in anymore with fingerprint after upgrading to Android 10 on my Pixel 3A. I tried disabling an unregistering device and re-signing up for fingerprint and I get an error which I've sent to the developers.,
This version of my chart (IMHO) STINKS. The prior version was much easier to navigate AND I noticed that now there is no option for getting your hospital records any longer. Gee...I wonder why.,
"We have a son with a rare disease, this app comes in handy for communication with his metabolic specialists . You can send pictures to assist with medical updates such as medication and or a diagnosis that may need to he added to the his Chart. Very handy for referencing allergies to food and or medications and or for references on diagnostics and testing. It is a must have. I really wish the creators would allow this to be compatible with Samsung DEX",
"MyChart is useful for adults, but does have a learning curve for the facilities that use it. Some can't figure out how to set it up correctly. My biggest beef is that it disallows use from age 12 to 18. My state puts limits at age 13,but MyChart hides info at age 12. The only info that is protected from HIPAA is info related to sexual and behavioral health, but MyChart blocks *all* info. This is a problem when you have a child with disabilities or high needs.",
"Absolutely LOVE it. Can make appointments, can refill medication and can leave messages for your doctor and communicate back and forth and much much more. Once you get the hang of all that u can do on this app., You won't need anything else!",
I wish all my physicians used MyChart or one that is compatible with it. I live being able to communicate with my doctors & their care teams via MyChart messages. There is a dusclaimer that a response may take up to 3 days: my experience is tgat i usually ger a response the next day. Messaging is just one of the personal functions if the app. There is much more good about it. I highly recommend.,
My MyChart app is the best because all I have to do is open it and show it to my Dr and they have all they need to know about me and if they are in the system their self's all they have to do is open the their own systems are there I am.. It benefit's doctors and nurses and everyone.. It also keeps you from having to keep track of your records because it's in the Palm of your hands and it's safe!!!!!,
"Good way to be informed about your healthcare, test results and other information. I would recommend that the developers create an appointment calendar that self creates as doctor appointments are confirmation as to the appointment date and time. My appointments have gotten mixed up if they are acknowledged and then disappear because certain departments appointments do and others don't, I have learned, and make it appear that some don't exist at all.",
This application has been a great tool for managing my health.,
I find it difficult to identify new messages/info from previously viewed. And nearly impossible to change or cancel Apts. And email notifications only say I have new messages not what is new. So I have to search for what's new.,
"My chart, is the best thing ever, I cannot express, how good it feels to have my medical records at arms reach, not to mention, the ability to see all test results, as soon as they out.",
The app is wonderful. You get to read all the misinformation your doctors put in your chart. You get to confirm that the doctor read your message within hours of receiving your message but never responded . It's fabulous for finally being able to hold the medical providers accountable.,
"I can finally get in touch with my doctors through the messages option which is awesome. Now that they have switched & are with carilion, unfortunately many things have change to the big corporation ways like they do, but this is a good thing because I can actually contact them again. I just wish they didn't have to leave the neighborhood setting they were in because that feel is gone too. But I love all my doctors regardless I don't think they will change. I pray .",
This app would be really great....except I keep getting connection errors. I have a very good wifi connection so that is not the issue. I will update my comment when this issue is corrected.,
"This app doesn't allow me to stop reminders. It sends me a reminder every working day, and interrupts my working hours as well. I prefer to control what reminders I need, not what the app thinks I need. If I could rate a negative star, it would 5 negatives. Prefer my dr to talk to me so that I can ask questions and get an answer",
"Installed on my cell phone. Refuses to log into my health care portal and keeps displaying "" Version Problem. A new version of Mychart is available. Please download and install it before continuing."" Well I downloaded the app today 10\14\2020 and cannot find any way to update the app.",
I updated my insurance information and even included photos of the card as asked for in the app. The update apparently not happen because the doctor's office called saying I had no insurance on file. I went back into the app and discovered the old insurance was still in there and the new insurance was not added.,
"I love the fact that within the app and with my original log-in I can switch between facilities/organizations with just a click. No re-signing in. I can switch from University Hospital to the UT doctors at the Marc where I previously went some 8years ago and still see Dr's names, medications, blood work results and testing that was done. I can even still message those Doctors.",
A little confusing but very helpful. I love the fact that I can easily go between my daughter's profile and mine. But it would be amazing if I could somehow connect it or download other medical records.,
I find My Chart visually confusing and providers leave messages/make appointments without notifying me. Suggestion: send an automatic email to the patient's personal email clearly stating in the subject line that they have a new appointment or have new message in My Chart.,
"This app is incredible! It makes you information ready and portable on my phone. It has so many other benefits to help you regarding most of your health matters with access to your primary care doctor, specialists, labwork results and your prescriptions as well. I have to say thank you to the creators, they simplified access to our own personal health records.",
Have had no trouble accessing and enjoy being able to see my recent information. Thank You,
My chart only goes back to June 2022 in my hosp? Nothing prior to that I was told. Epic says any clinician in the world will have access to it? What good is that when half your chart is missing? Even within 1 hospital where is the MRI cut finger etc. Epic is missing the point by saying link accounts the data is not there from my main hosp. Whos at fault here the hosp or epic or both? I plan to have my account and data removed from the app.,
"I dont like the accounting customization that has been done to #Epic #MyChart. It has been customized to force payment amounts that you dont officially authorize. Then Henry Ford wont refund if you owe money. So i dont use the app for paying my bill as i cant trust that it wont take what im actually entering. I authorized 49 dollars and some change. They took 900 from my debit. I confirmed $49.36. But since i owed them money..."" its their policy"" to just take what they want. Nope, i cant do that",
"Great way to get access to your pcp without waiting on hold forever. I have my kids and my appointments all in 1 place, I can make, change or cancel them quickly with any doctor we see in our network. You can get your test results much faster and send questions about them and usually get answers the same day. It really is the best.",
"I love using this app because it greatly decreases the wiait time at my doctor. Also very informative and allows me to keep track of appointments, past and present, and allows me to pull up notes on all of my visits.",
It's nice being able to see all of the info and test results but really wish you could set up an appointment. Never shows availability. Annoying.,
"Easy to use, keeps me updated on all my doctors appointments and test results",
It makes it so easy to access all your health information and to be able to speak to your doctor or request medication refills.,
"At 72 this app is greatly appreciated. I receive test results sometimes within hours, I communicate on a regular basis with my Dr's. and it provides me with all updated future appts. It also provides links to my hospital information. I'm not sure how it could be any better.",
"Nice having everything in one place for easy reference, but 1. Wish it was compatible with Healow which is what my current doctors use so 2. When I keep getting reminders about getting a Pap or vaccination or colonoscopy it is annoying because I can't just put in the date it was done.",
"Why would I allow an app for medical purposes to get into my sd card , read all my stuff, change things, etc... now I'm worried that they will use the user name n password I created for some other reason because I will not agree to there terms. No way to delete them till you agree. Nnnooooo. I need whatever information I put in this app deleted completely including username and password, not to be kept and used for their own purposes. I will get my own records from dr. when I need them.",
"I ABSOLUTELY love MyChart!!! It is the best and quickest way by far to get a message to your Dr or their assistant! I haven't had very good luck as far as scheduling any appointments through the app though. In my opinion if you need an appointment, just call in!!",
It is difficult to use and does not show who primary care Dr is,
"I didn't find any support number or text in the app, so I am posting here. I get a ""server error"" when trying to perform certain functions like schedule an evisit or fill out pre-evisit form. This has occurred over multiple logins. What should I do to fix this? Normally I love this app.",
I find the app very useful and convenient however the fact that it will not let me use biometric login saying that my password has changed is frustrating. I have tried everything and it still doesn't work.,
Very transparent and detailed enjoy enabling all details of my health at the touch of a botton. Keep up the good work 👏 . I would only like to get responses in the time they recommend.,
"First of all, it's easy to navigate through MyChart. Everything that needs to be done can be done prior to arriving to my Doctors office. 2. The response time is great! 3. The reminders are awesome: what, when, where and how. THANK YOU FOR MyChart!!",
Used it to get my covid test results. User friendly and easy to maintain. Annoying at first if you don't set up the automatic sign it but I appreciate it because of the security.,
Moved to different state and all my records move with this app. Very happy.,
I like that all the information in regards to doctor appointments and results are readily available.,
"Very useful and you have control on appointments, paperwork and Dr communication.",
"Easily allows me to interact with my medical record, schedule visits, and receive updates",
"Excellent app to stay connected with my medical records, appointments, and medications.",
"I love being able to check on myChart for appointments, medicine renewals and messages from my doctor's!",
"Messages to doctors don't seem to make it to the doctors, very frustrating",

MyChart is an awesome app. I'm informed of appointments and test results.,
I saved alot of waiting around on paper work and scedualing. I like it.,
Will not ever let me login. I can only login on a web browser. This app is pointless,
"This used to be a great app, but after the update. My medical provider is no longer on it, so I can't even use it.",
It was good until they took away the skill to talk to your Doctor through the app.,
"Nothing but error messages doesn't matter if I'm trying to see med list, send a message, or see an appointment",
I am not sure why it took me so long to join but I finally committed myself to the app and I love it!!!! Everything at a glance on your phone!!!,
Very easy to use. Fast medication refills without having to call doctor's office.,
"My experience has been good easy to learn app, and it works fine.",
It's nice to have all my info secure in one place where others aren't able to see it.,
Unc my chart seems to lack communication at different times when trying to communicate with medical doctors or specialists,
I love using MyChart I can see all my results before it gets to my doctor. All my info is right there for me to see,
Easy to use accurate information. Haven't seen an ad yet.,
This is very convenient and I can Message with questions and look at my test results.,

Very easy app I love that you can read your test results set appt. Love it,
First time using I was a little overwhelmed but now I find myself breezing through with ease and love ❤ love to get my information in writing.,

It's much easier to handle all medical needs here. Everything is at the tip of your fingers,
Good info to have. I wish it could be monitored better it takes several days to get a response sometimes,

"This is by far the best app. It would be great to have the option to view actual progress notes from the date of visit and not just the vital summary because it would be helpful, especially for those who can't remember what was discussed fully in the office",
So easy to navigate and use and everything is on there in case you forget something,
"Super easy to use, can schedule appointments in minutes.",
So far so good. Helpful lil app that helps me keep track of all my results & apts.,
It is so convenient and you can connect with your physician easier than calling or going to his or her office,
I am so grateful to have access to all of the medical information concerning my personal health. The fine details of the care I am provided are here for me to read and assist me in formulating specific actions on my part I should take in order to participate in and contribute to my recovery and management of my illnesses. Another beneficial feature of this app is the ability to share all of your records with family members who can monitor your progress by adding them to the app.,
Most Wonderful Doctors and Nurses ever and administration. Explains everything carefully and gets you in the back in and out really fast. Takes time to explain things and really listens and understands their patients.,
"When using the MyChart for one hospital is fabulas, everything is at your hand if needed to show another dr on my team! ..Yet I have tried to link another hospital to obtain the test results it has given me issues..Will not link them together nor will let me set up the 2nd account..",

"Great app. Tracks everything. I have a TBI, THIS app helps me to remember my appointments.",
Cannot for the life of me find where to pay a bill on MyChart. Very frustrating.,
Information not retained; history disappeared. Does not inspire confidence.,
Very easy way to navigate for children's health,
Every I receive notification i click on the app and there is no notification,
I encountered a few bugs before the new changes. It's excellent now.,
There is no way to go back to the first page or any other page. I have to log out then log back in to look at another test result. This is unacceptable.,
Easy to get quick information before an appointment.,
So helpful to have all my child's information in my hand and a great way to keep in contact with GOSH,
Decent to see reminders and results. Sometimes delayed,
Unable to pay my bill online. The field for the credit card number doesn't exist and I cannot enter the number on the payment section.,
The app is very handy and whoever came up with the idea did a wonderful job and I love it,
Pretty good app. Just 4 stars because the learning curve is a pain.,
The app has made managing my health care so much easier so happy I finally started using it,

The app is very easy to use even if you are a senior. Lol 😆,
"Makes it easier to keep up with my health problems, medical appointments and contact my Dr's",

My Chart is great. It keeps you in better touch with your Dr's and others.,
It's so easy to do everything schedule appointments get refills anything you need,
Easy to use and get test results quickly.,

"I love this App, it's so helpful. I'm on multiple prescriptions and Dr Bossie and Her Staff Help what ever the question or issue is!!! A+++ :)Thank you",
Unable to remove inaccurate information. The inaccurate information is very dangerous to my health.,
This app makes it easier to communicate with our care provider,
"Very complete with patients, helpful and understanding",
Not enough information about all doctor visits and results.,
The app is easy to use. Most doctors respond quickly.,
I really like this app because it's a great way to keep in touch with my drs and their staff. It helps remind me of upcoming appointments and tests. It gives me the results of tests I had run. I definitely recommend this app! It's easy to use!!,
Easy to use. Very informative about me and mine.,

Great! Everything in one place and a great way to communicate with my doctor.,
Very easy to use and more convenient to contact ur doctor.,
Makes life a lot easier when you have your information right at your finger tips.,
Awesome & completely great for all your medical information.,
"This app can never connect to it's servers. 90% of the time I cannot retrieve my important and time sensitive health information. How is it that massive healthcare companies cannot have a competent piece of software built. This has been this way for years! Desktop website has the exact same problem. App company blames the hospital, hospital blames the app company. No one offering any solutions.",
Overall this app is barely functional And extremely annoying. There is little to no privacy control over your information. I have deleted it for these reasons and now they want me to load it again. It's better to get paper hard copy from your doctor do not use this app. As far as a rating goes I would give it a Negative 10 Mostly because of the ridiculous advertising that comes with It. A medical app should not have any advertising,
"Very convenient to have all records at your fingertips. However, I do feel like the e check in feature is not used by all providers.",
Good for appointment reminders and for fast access to blood results,
This has been a reliable source for communication and records with health care providers.,
Nice to be able to have results in one place when you see other doctors and there is a lot of handy information if you go past results to see them. Also nice for a trusted family member to have access to all of your records in one place should an emergency occur. Great idea MyChart!!👍,
"MyChart has given me one on one communication with all of my physicians and timely responses. It has also given me access to look at my own records, medications, appointments that I was able to easily review time and time again. I feel connected using MyChart; and I'm even able to 'printout' most of the pages I need as reference.",
"I love mychart but........there are a lot of instances that an error code will pop up and read"" we're sorry, an error occurred. Please try again later."" Happens frequently everytime I use the app",
"I love being able to manage doctors appointments, medication refills, messaging doctors and other medical staff about my care, seeing test results from from the lab as well as any images taken, along with being able to see the doctor notes in an after visit review. There are many different things that can be done with this app It's the best!",
"I love it! Never have to worry about missing an appointment. Never have to worry about receiving refills for my medication or test results. Also, if I forget my Dr.'s instructions I can look it up under the physicians notes or visit summary. It is very helpful really do love it!",
"I find this app user unfriendly, frustrating, and despite the best efforts of help desk and IT professionals, difficult for clinicians to share their own and access others' information. I have recently been treated at three different hospitals, one of which uses MyChart, another MyChart Plus, and the third an unrelated patient portal. I find it is difficult to switch MyChart providers consistently, as that screen appears only intermittently. Rx & clinical redundancy is tedious & time consuming.",
"I received communication from my surgeon but then went to find it after reading the first time, I could not locate it again. I searched messages and letters. It was important and I wish I had downloaded it at the time. I tried using the link from my email but it doesn't take you to the message once you have looked at it.",
"Love the app considering it helps me keep track of my up and coming Dr appointments, and the exact location. Besides, if I need to ask questions afterwards, I can send a message and get a response quickly, without having to play phone tag or wait nearly all day for a call back",
I have been using this app. On a daily basis since my cancer diagnosis. It's been a tool that truly does what it suppose to. I love it.,
"This app is incredibly helpful, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. It also limits the amount of timing I usually have to spend in the doctors office. I suffer from chronic join by inflation, the doctors home know why. I could be becoming inflated from other patients, it someone I'm the doctors office/ out something in the hospital. Needles to say, it is a lot healthier for me to have appointments via the MyChart and my doctor has been handling this amazingly well. I fully recommend my PCP.",
I really really like the My Chart app! It makes a lot of things super easy like check-ins for doctor appointments. Getting test results. As well as lots of other information! I use it for myself and my dad! I love it!,
"Easy to use!!! I am receiving prenatal care and am a high risk pregnancy, so I'm visiting the doctor's office often. This app ensures I'm always informed on my test results as soon as they come in, As well as appointment reminders and messages from my doctor. This app has made making/cancelling doctor's visits so simple and easy. There's so many useful features and everyone who visits a doctor regularly and takes prescription medications should have this app.",
"Great app with a lot of powerful capabilities. Request refills, access records, schedule appointments, answer questionnaires, communicate with your health team, link information between different healthcare institutions, do video calls, see lab results in near real-time. It can even check you into an appointment if setup correctly.",
"Great way to keep track of everything in one place, appointments, refills, records, and it all runs smoothly. great job on this one.",
"I love my chart, I can keep track of my appointments better. See when they are so I don't miss them. See as well as receive information about my doctors. Get information about the appointment. Ask questions share information with the doctor get answers to questions! I feel this app is a great tool for the patient as well as the doctors. Every office should be set up this way. Thank you.",
"Recently changed insurance providers, and now every time I try to log in it says there's an issue with the biometrics and wants me to put in my password. But then it says my password is wrong and makes me reset it. This has happened 4 times in just the last 24 hours.",
Being able to see notes and send your chart is super helpful. Had an ER visit and would have had to wait almost 4 hours for results. Instead I got the CT and MRI results as they were completed and was able to relax a little knowing nothing severe had been seen.,
"Love MyChart! The fastest and easiest way to communicate with my doctors with non-emergency inquiries, record of test results, medications, etc. I also really like that any scheduled a appointments go in MyChart and are able to transfer to my calendar! Super handy!!!",
"To much scrolling, to much hand motion, need audio",
Garbage... I already have online log in and am able to.log in on my laptop and through my Chrome browser on my phone...but the App keeps saying incorrect log in...reset password...which I should not have to. Uninstalled it and been successfully using login on my Chrome browser on my phone and laptop. Much easier and have no dramas.,
"1 - overall University Health is (I don't want to overdo it...) THE BEST MEDICAL GROUP/COMPANY IN THE UNIVERSE and anyone who disagrees is an alcoholic! Lol so giving a low rating is not going to happen, but this app literally gives you what feels like Dr. level access to your info, finally an app that has all my medical info including future appointments, in one area! If you are not about this app, maybe you're not in need of it, but the minute you use it, you will be bout it!",
"Love the features in this app. The ability to see test results/ notes from providers, communicate in a less intrusive way has increased my ability to be compliant with recommendations and stay focused on my health goals.",
"I was trying to pay my bill using the MyChart app on my android phone and it would not allow me too. It kept saying that captcha was not working correctly. I emailed a screenshot for you to see to MyChart support. I also see the list of approved browser's, but I would think that the app would work for payment.",
"Hey Epic, stick to breaking your garbage games and leave making important software to the professionals! None of your links to viewing statements work as they're all dead. I'm subcribing back to paper billing because I can't see my statements! I'm sorry that may have been a bit too harsh. What I should have said was that I was confused to as of why important features in this software weren't working properly, but then I saw that it had been developed by Epic. What else should I expect?",
"Its 9\12\20, I 1st gave 1 Star in 04\19, I rate it USELESS!thought this app was to take place if logging into my health online for Harvard Vanguard.? i can't sign in. it doesn't have option to ""SHOW"" password & it keeps telling me I'm wrong. Then it doesn't have option to ""remember my login"" nor does it allow me choice to say "" forgot password "" . so this app is useless to me. I still need to log into my health via chrome on my Android to get medical info this app was designed for. 😥",
"When trying to log in, my password was getting erased by your system, bet it on the app or on the website. I ended up changing the password and it worked. I still don't know what caused this issue, but all is well now. Thanks.",
"Well organized information and easy access to records. It would be more helpful if you could integrate all doctors regardless of what group they are affiliated with and it was all linked as one set of information including the pharmacy, emergency, quick care, and traditional doctors and alternative therapies.",
"It's quick and easy to use. It's also full of good info regarding your health and it's easier to talk to your physician/doctor,/surgeon/nurse practitioner when you have questions about actual data you can read as opposed to just thinking and speaking in layman's terms. You can also send a message to the people at your general practitioners office. Very handy.",
The best system in the medical field its so easy to use. You can find any doctors you want. You can chat with your doctor asking questions regarding your health .and you will get the answer fast You can check your appointments on this apps Go on the waiting list .check your medications. Pay your bills and so many more things all in one system ( mychart),
"Great app. Very organized,precise, and prompt. Test results, Doctors, appointments, everything is positively great. It's very easy to use too. This app is a key to health information about self!! And more!!",
"I absolutely love my chart! No sitting on hold, tests results are in as soon as they get done, setting up and rescheduling appts. is easy and messages to my Dr.s and their responses are fast and everything about me is filed. I can't do without it!",
It sucks. I can't get in. Hate it.,
"I love the app for quick easy access to appointments, check in for appointments, updates on office visits & test results. Clear & concise of billing but not easy to maneuver and pay.",
Very informative.. Seems easy & accurate¡!!,
Works good and provides a good deal of information about my health care.,
The app has all my information send puts it at my fingertips. It is easy to access and navigate. It says up to date and makes it easy to communicate with my Healthcare team.,
"Very user friendly, easy to navigate, layout and content is straight forward and sufficient. I was able to login using existing username and p/w, read messages, send a reply message, and logout in five minutes. Excellent experience! 😊",
"I use MyChart all the time and love it. There are changes I would like to see like being able to remove past docs from my message and care team list and being able to mark a message ""for physician only"" so that private things between my doctor and myself aren't read by nurses and staff I don't even know.",
"I love this app! It is extremely easy to use and understand. Test results, appointments, messages from your care team, and so much more are all right there in the app for your convenience. Highly recommend!",
The app is extremely helpful for keeping track of medical records and appointments. It is also great if doctors reply to messages and follow up to medical reports promptly. Some are better than others at doing this.,
I enjoy the app because it clearly tells me about what the Dr's and test results are. I wish the app also would have a link to a full explanation (layman's) of each test results. Such as what the scores of test means. In danger or out of it. Just make it in clear non-medical terms.,
"This app facilitates further disassociation between healthcare providers and their patients. My doctor's office routinely relies on things being in the app, ""check the app,"" ""you can do it through the app."" I'm not a fan.",
"I absolutely love the MyChart app. I have all my health information available when needed. I can also submit questions and receive answers from the doctors' offices through a message without making a phone call, get test results, refill prescriptions, and so much more. Give a try, you'll love it too!",
App Doesn't allow virtual visits. I have missed 2 appts now because of it. It shows connecting and eventually errors out. Luckily I've had nice doctors that wait and let me log in via a computer instead but why offer a service on your app that isn't available?,
"Extremely helpful. I use this instead of a calendar to keep up with my appointments, knowing they're always accurate. My doctors and I can easily message back and forth. I love it.",
"I was so excited that all of my COVID Info was in mychart, info neatly organized for travelling out of the country. The only problem I had- once out of the country, I could never get mychart opened. I just happened to go the day the requirements were no longer necessary and they didn't need either testing or vax records.",
"Very easy to use. Get good useful information. Mychart much easier to use, I can get direct information without needing to describe problem two or three times to different people.",
"It will not load properly after uninstalling and reinstalling. I need crucial info and it wouldnt allow me in despite changing my password three times. So frustrating, what a waste of time.",
"MyChart enables a patient to see his/her total health status in one place. It also allows the patient to communicate with their Doctors or health care professionals. Unfortunately independent practices are not integrated into the system. For instance my PCP, my hematologist, my skin doctor and my orthopedic Doctor are independents and their participation would be beneficial to all providers as well as the patient.",
It would be nice if you had a pain n symptoms journal so the doctor understood alil better by patient tracking it threw the app.,
"Omg ten starship! This app let's me email with my dr, make apointments all my medical info is at my fingertips, my test are there sometimes same day, but available in days, it let's me connect with my other drs from other systems if they are linkable. I just sign in with my personal code and within seconds I'm right there looking at what I need. Also it's speed is outstanding no buffering. I wish everything else in my life worked so good lol.",
"Great app, easy to use.",
This is the best app I've ever used. If you want to keep in contact with your doctor then this is the app for you. very easy to navigate. easy to connect all medical services on this one app. buy a blood pressure cuff and monitor your BP and if your BP is consistently high your doctor will message you fast without you instigating correspondence. plus this app allows you to contact your health provider through in app messenger. also having your whoever come up with is ideal app thank you.....,
I love this app. Easy to use and keeps all your information at your finger tips.,
"New changes cause the app to become unstable and crash. My insurance and pharmacy information disappeared. The app is designed by a third party and they gaslight you and blow off complaints about its instability. This is not a video game, it's a medical app - it needs to work.",
App is very easy to use. Can't explain the reassurance it gives a person having a way to message your doctor from the app. Very convenient to schedule appointments.,
"An extraordinarily easy and effective way to stay current with your medical history, including prescriptions and procedures. A reassuring way to have access to your doctor and medical staff. This is, by far, the easiest app to use and navigate, providing medical peace of mind.",
"So easy and helpful, I personally love it.",
"This app is crappy. First, it doesn't include any demo graphics such as weight, bp, or temp. Now here is the worst part. I made a payment through the app . It applied it to the incorrect facility. I was not logged into the other facility yet, it still sent the payment to facility B instead of facility A.",
Easy to use once you get the hang of it. Very organized.,
Helpful easy to use,
"The only way this app could be better, is if one could copy and paste, or screenshot for other Doctors. I have 3 total but it's always difficult to get all the info to all 3 on a timely manner.",
Poor app. Can't pay a bill online. No link to do so. No search functionality. No ability to ask a billing question. I'm only free in the evening. Daytime help phone numbers are worthless.,
I love this app so easy to have view of my test results appointments and order my medicine love it,
"I think it's an amazing app that's current, up to date and the ability to message my Dr's staff to get answers in a prompt manner. I'm able to see appointments, labs and so much more. Even pay my bill.",
Great way to keep medical organized. Easy to message providers and ask questions about tests. The ability to send appointments to my calendar is wonderful. I use my teen's login for full access,
"Great app to use. I can easily get in touch with my doctors, pay bills and order refills. Just learn the app and it's easy. Also send pictures for any problem I am having without leaving my home.",
"My Chart by Epic works great & always protects your privacy. Try the two step text login or even faster use the biometric fingerprint. MyKelseyMyChart is so easy to use you can text your docs, request refills, book check ups, see all your labs & test results, review & pay bills. All in one advanced app.",
"Very easy to use/accurate, timely",
"I do not care for my chart. I'm old: have dementia and much prefer talking to humans rather than texting to robots. I do not download and print documents. I do not own a printer. asking me every time I have an appt to fill in the blanks taxes my synapses; when each time I go to an appt @the Doctor, same questions are repeated.",
"Excellent app. Easy to use. Very convenient. All appointments, test results, and communications with medical staff right at your fingertips.",
I absolutely love MyChart!! It has been so easy to navigate & so helpful in keeping me connected to my care team. I encourage all my friends & family to download the app. It's been a huge help for me!,
Good application in regards to keeping up to date with your information however could be better especially for those like myself who have had miscarriages - the constant update confirmations telling you about results which no longer matter could be looked into. Everytime I get a notification I am expecting to see something in regards to new findings and not to be given updates for tests which were done pre miscarriage. Is there a way IA could be used to detect need to know info for the user?,
Great it allows to do multiple task and scheduling,
"It's a good app and I wish all hospitals would have it but, I know it is very expensive for the hopitals/clinics. Hope you guys make it affordable for everyone. It would be wonderful if we as patients never had to bring files and hospitals never had to look and call all other hospitals.",
Its the app will not accept myinfo keeps telling telling me it is not correct yet nothing has changed,
"Had biopsy test and didn't get any result on this app. I called a physician friend who was able to go in the system and gave me the result. A week later the physician taking the biopsy called me with the result, still nothing is posted on the app, only the follow up appointment they gave me. Useless when you are waiting anxiously for tests reports",
Keep adding new features please! The web version and the app have some differences in that some features work better on the website and not so much on the app. I really like the in hospital stay feature! Keep improving!,
"With such an overwhelming task needed from beginning to end for my upcoming heart surgery, the MyChart app was my most helpful tool that made it all manageable. The information provided for scheduling, sharing of results, doctor orders and everything to do with the surgery was easily desplay thanks to this app.",
"I find mychart mostly easy to use, it can feel a bit complicated to navigate around. Nothing overwhelming, it just keeps me from giving 5 stars.",
Super convenient and easy to use,
"Since I used this app., everythings turned to easy and clear information. I could see all of history of my visits, test results, medications... it is very convenience. I highly recommend it to any one as it is very helpful. Great app.",
"I like this app because I'm not that computer savvy and I found it very user friendly. I got labs and tests etc back and I could actually talk to my physician with all of my questions and concerns and most times my Dr. (not an assistant answered back), usually that same day or the next. It is awesome to have access to my doctor. Healthcare in the olden days made contact with your physician after an appointment next to impossible. If I can work this program anyone can. Great job TCHC!",
"My Chart allows me to keep up to date on whatever is pending, scheduled, or needed, which is a great help to me. It also allows me, Doctors, and Staff, to communicate, if there are questions, issues, or concerns.",
Very helpful caring and very professional.,
This app is indispensable to me to keep track of all my appointments and communications with my doctors for I have several of them. It is easy to download forms and documents such as medical excuses for taking medical leave from my job for example.,
"Terrible - they were supposed to port everything over from our medical system a month ago and we still have NO medications on our portals and NO way to communicate with our physicians on MyChart. I sat on hold for an hour and a half to try to reach my medical team last week and gave up - the doctors, nurses and staff are so overwhelmed by the number of phone calls because the MyChart system has been such a failure. I used to be able to communicate with my doctor easily via a portal. Sad.",
"Easy to navigate and get results, messages etc. Would be better if it was easier to link up to other medical practices and clinics, but thinkcthey are working on that.",
"The ""improvements"" to the app are actually removing useful features, e.g. Test results used to be able to be viewed comparatively to prior results in either numeric or graph form. This is no longer the case!",
"It really helps to check when your appointments are and where they are at. It's great to see my test results so quickly as well. Highly recommend. My only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was, is that not all my physicians and or facilities or not all on the same my chart.",
Great app to connect digitally with my PCP! Also I'm getting medical test results and after visit reviews from my PCP and the hospital. There are many other features available that I haven't used yet. Can't go wrong if you're PCP and hospitals use this app for general patient connections!,
I've been using the mychart app for a few years now and I love it. Of course it has glitches here and there with login issues but I love the fact that all of my info is right there for me to see. I even get to see any test results as soon as they come in before a doctor even gives me a call about them.,
"There is an issue with linking CVS Covid results to my existing MyChart account. I put in my user id & password and screen will not allow you to go any further. Only option is ""Cancel"". If I go back and clink the link in the CVS email, I only get an Error message. The test results still don't show in my MyChart Account!",
My Chart is GREAT 👍 an excellent and very informative way to keep up-to-date information about your health and payments! I absolutely love this app!!,
"I hate this app, I got it for my son and his specialist, every time I have to schedule and appointment it always says there is a server error. I can see results fine but I can't schedule anything. I cannot stress enough how much I loathe MyChart. Avoid it if you can!",
Having problems with it not letting me log in while off of wi-fi anyone else have that problem,
"My experience using this app is great, because it gives me access to my health informations . This app is of course Without doubt a good way to help me keep track of my upcoming appointments. It is wonderful to know my health informations is easy to be access by any doctor I visit . This app is great it is very helpful for the health care providers , it allows them quick access to their patients health history.This app is keeping the health care team inform about patient health care.",
"I love using MyChart. It's easy to use, helps with communicating with your doctors. Having your records, medication lists, etc.. Without MyChart, I'd have to do what we all had to do before internet, which would be a long process.",
"I doubted it in the beginning....(I DONT LIKE CHANGE). BUT, it has been very Helpful to me.",
"I started trying to install this app Saturday. It is now Thursday the following week and no joy. This is continuing to show ""pending"". I submitted a trouble ticket to the Epic team. Maybe, to be fair, I should wait until they respond, but at this point I am so frustrated. I will investigate changing this rating if I am given a timely response to fix this install problem and the app actually works. M. Pearson",
Just started chemo for non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Between the nurses taking blood samples at my house one doctor in charge of my treatments. And another doctor taking care of my liver. Having all my info in one place is a life saver. I get calls and messages all the time now. The nurses and clerks update my info extremely fast.. so I never miss information.,
Allows relatively efficient means of contacting health care services and scheduling appointments. The app could use some work but it's better than nothing.,
"It's very reassuring to have this app. I can look up test results, sign documents, and see films from CT Scans and other films. Very helpful.",
"My Chart is a good idea for the patient to have this app on their cell phone, cause when the doctors are busy and they don't have time to call the patient and give them their results. Now they can go to my chart on their phone and read the results there self. I think this is a excellent idea. God Bless All. Happy Holidays",
Great care and service!,
"I don't have any issues using the app it works great, but it has an extreme drain on my phone battery, it literally drained over 50% in ten minutes while on and over 60% while off, once I uninstalled the app the battery drain went away!",
"This app is useless. When you call customer service,you get caught in an endless loop of hitting the same numbers, it just keeps repeating. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! And the developer just tells everyone to email them. Same standard answer to everyone. SO DISAPPOINTED in this app!!!.... I give the app an F! Much better before the update!",
"Tried to open the app to read a message. Instead, the app blocked me, said there were too many attempts to access the account and I need to resubmit something. This was my first time opening it today. Yesterday, and previously, I had no problem. I had to uninstall it.",
"God forbid the user is an Elder with bad EYESITE! If the patient has the phone font size very big, they won't be able to see some of the info toward the end of the page (e.g.: Submit button at the bottom of the page where you enter your payment info)!. Please fix, Not all people have Huge phone screens!!",
It has been great and very accessible,
"Many of the patients using this app have poor vision or other accessibility needs, and yet there is no dark theme whatsoever, to say nothing of a high-contrast theme. Development on this app is understandably slow, as the staff reads the feedback, but, does not forward it to their own programmer for review and improvement.",
"Seems to be very glitchy, seems server issue is the go to message ""server having problems try back later"" sorta useless while trying to show a health provider past results.. Other than that seems like would be a good app.",
Just downloaded this app today. I have tried a couple of healthcare apps already and this one is far superior. Very user friendly with lots of perks. Makes keeping in touch with your healthcare provider almost instantaneous.,
"Care Team incomplete. Pharmacy list extremely limited. Message system cumbersome and addressees limited. I had to go to my clinic for a refill and to set appt due to the app's inabilities. The app is in blocks of information, yet information seems limited. But one is forced to use MyChart to electronically interact with healthcare system.",
I gave it a 2 because it's not usual friendly. If you get a note from the dietitian or trainer the notes disappear after you read them so if you need to refer back to it you can't. Please do something about that.,
"I really love being able to review my doctors' treatment notes online vs on paper because papers get lost. I've also had online services connected to the insurance I had at the time; consequently, when I changed jobs the medical history was no longer accessible. I also love being able to share my medical history with other physicians who may not be familiar with my Healthcare. Also helpful is that my family and I will always have full access to my medical history.",
"I absolutely hate this app. My wife has to have it for her doctors but can not install on her phone, her laptop, my laptop or any other device we own EXEPT MY PHONE! Please tell my why you make an app that no one can use unless they have certain devices? I can not leave my phone with her while I'm at work to do her visits. I HAVE TO WORK!",
"I dislike this app very much. The information is incomplete. The messages are not dated. A complete breakdown of the bill is not provided. Pay close attention when paying bills on this app, because the amount is not always correct.",
Horrible website and associated app. Majority of the time I can't even log in. I get a pop up saying problem with communicating with server. Try again later. Problem has been getting worse and worse. I haven't been able to log in past 2 days of MULTIPLE attempts.,
"LOVE having all my medical information, history, follow-up, and test results in one place! Send messages, make/cancel appointments--couldn't be easier or more convenient",
"It's very easy to use and helps me keep track of everything, also being able to quickly message my doctor is awesome, I'm able to easily look at test results and ask questions, I can manage my family's accounts as well, this app is wonderful",
"This app is a total POS. It won't load past appointments, can't schedule appointments, it is useless. You'd think as a app that is important to a person's health would just work. Don't bother with it.",
"I'm liking it so far. It is easy to navigate but I'm also tech savvy. My grandmother and parents would have trouble with this. I have always felt that having a central database for your medical records would save a lot of energy and stress, and this is as good as it can get.",
This app has a bunch of options that can't even be used. Like the video visit. And there are no pictures of the x-rays that are taken. Only a description of the x-rays. It has a link to schedule an appointment and that does not work either. It's kinda useless for people. It's only seams to help the Dr's,
"I love this app. I love being able to communicate with the medical professionals, without having to sit on hold on a telephone forever. The medical professionals, typically get back to me within hours (Id assume this is based on the exact medical professional group you utilize). I love being able to see my test results as well.",
It is convenient and easy to use I like and to know when my next appointment is,
"I dislike this app very much. I have tried several times to log on with no success. I have changed my password to no avail. I AM TIRED OF TRYING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERTHING HAS TO BE CONSTANLY CHANGED. Why can it not be left alone. When things works, leave it alone.",
I have alot of medical issues and need to check on appointments and results. I put have my log in problem. My name and password that is use for this ñ application doesn't work. The last few times it has worked and now it doesn't. Its very frustrating.,
"Very easy to use. No need to wait for call backs and missed calls. All info is documented for future use if needed. All around great app. I haven't seen any ads, not 1!!",
My Chart is truly awesome. I can reach out to my Dr. with a simple text. No need to schedule an appointment for refills. Just text the request. Transferring Medical information has never been easier. Two Thumbs up to the creator of this awesome app!!!,
Good except for one major issue. My healthcare provider office in Kirkland WA declined me care because I wouldn't provide them with my social security number when I checked in. They said that it was required to get me into the mychart system on their end. This can't be right since they provide service to many people who don't have ss# I was able to install and set up my account without providing the ss#,
"WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS APP???!!!!! Everytime I try to log on it won't allow it. I've gotten help 2 with tech services, changed password twice. What in the world??!! This is supposed to be so convenient for contacting doctors but IT IS NOT!!!!",
For most things this app works well. However if your provider doesn't check messages on it frequently it could be frustrating. Also it doesn't help much for requesting refills of your prescriptions.,
"This site has really helped me to remember my upcoming appointments, I have short term memory loss so this is a very helpful app. I forget to take my meds to other doc appointments so having all my meds listed on here with all the info that my doc my need. I just love it and highly recommend it!",
"The app is super easy to use. I like the updated version. I really appreciate being able to access all of my health records in one convenient place, including my covid vaccination.",
My only gripe is that I pay my bill and it keeps telling me I haven't. I've double paid in the past because of it. An app that sends notifications that my bill is due should be more accurate.,
It is unusable. Used to work great but with each update got worse...now this one completely destroyed it. No option to log on just to go to some web page that has nothing to do with it.,
"If you need help with anything (login issues, etc) you have to call the number of the hospital. And that number leads you to a voicemail inbox that's full and so you can't even expect a call back. You need to have a 24/7 support line or online chat help support. Not just a hospital number that has a voicemail whose inbox is full! I was lucky I got through to speak to someone else through some other extension code (Mackenzie Health Richmond Hill) who was able to help me out.",
Easy to use health app (even for a senior) for my hospital's patient records for me. Intuitive and simple menus with big icons and text. Very helpful.,
"Was a four 🌟 ⭐ star but since the last update it keep glitching. Now everything i click says error and won't let me see my anything 😔. Tried checking my phone and here for updates, restarting my phone and even unistalled and re added it but still won't work. I need help because I heavily rely on mychart.",
"I like using the app to reference tests, to communicate with primary care dr and to schedule appts. . However it would be of great benefit to be able to communicate and schefule appts with my other dts that are part of metotus. Such as cardiac, pulmonary etc.",
"Just started with MyChart, but so far, so good.",
"It was working great but for some reason after the last update, I can barely access anything. Parts like scheduling an appointment or doing an e visit just take me to a blank screen where nothing ever loads.",
Nice to have when hardcopy records are (unless required) more time consuming to retrieve. Also having the results & visit into almost immediately is an awesome to be able to use app that way.,
They are overboard with their security. Blocking autofill from secured devices is idiocy. Changes in the application cause total havoc. They do not seem to have their users in mind at all. The latency on finding the new uid and PWD that they have changed you to is horrendous. I do know epic is one of the top three medical software companies and it is SHOCKING! Both email for uid and text for PWD. Your suck beyond belief!,
I love that I can keep track of everything..,
The accessibility is wonderful and easy to use,
"This app is very helpful. It's so nice to be able to send a message to my doctor at any time. You can also request refills. You're able to review lab results and messages from your doctor regarding your x-ray, MRI CT or PET scan. You can also request to make a an appointment. Just a very useful APP.",
"Its good for very basic messaging and diagnostic information sharing. Not a fan of the messaging system. Not enough ""help"". If a doctor isn't on your care team then I found it impossible to message any other doctor or financial dept . But my GP used MyHealth and Chart is light years ahead of that.",
My chart is very Easy to navigate. Everyone is so helpful if I have any problems. My emails are returned within in the same day if I message in the mornings. If after hour I get a reply or call around 8am. My request appointments get schedule the same day must of the time. can review my medicine history without looking for papers and being environment safe.,
Lost perscriptive glasses Could not get the clinic to send me a copy of my latest test done 6 months earlier. They told me to go to Mychart and find it. The only one posted was form 2018. I didn't realize my husband had printed out the only one available. Computer glasses! I NEED to get my distance glasses replaced as I lost them. I am leaving the country in a week. I CANNOT contct the Dr there as she doesn't accept return messages. MyChart has seriously failed to be of ANY help.,
Auto responses that do not apply to the messages. Multiple and inconsistent responses to refill request. Refill sent. Refill denied. Refill denied. Refill sent. Doctors no longer at the facility still listed as my PCP. Still waiting for responses to messages sent days ago.,
Very good serviced this time .wonderful serviced,
This app is very helpful especially with communicating with your doctors.,
"Swift, easy and precise.",
"Absolutely love this app. Super easy and convenient to use. Great way to keep up with medication refills, upcoming appointments, and even send a question.",
"Just not working correctly. I followed all instructions to create a new account and password but it keeps saying "" not enough characters being used. The app will not let me complete my sign up process. Not good at all!",
Really helpful. I can send newscasts to my or my husband's doctor anytime and they respond within 48 hours. It helps us stay in top of our health.,
I absolutely love this app. It really helps me stay up to date with appts as well as allows me to see lab results etc. Makes communicating with my Drs and their staff incredibly easy. No more calling and sitting on hold only to get VM,
"I want to give 5 stars, but, I know that this app can change the test results being posted 24 hours after TO being posted in real time. Other hospitals, like Ochsner post all test results in real time. You don't have to wait. I don't like that about this app. Everything else is fine.",
I enjoy MyChart it's very useful and it helps me keep up with my medical information. It's easy for me to check when I had a previous appointment as well as check my medicine. Plus it's easy for providers to access my files if they use MyChart as well.,
"Like many others this App has been great, however recently the fingerprint and log in isn't working and I'm having to use the online Web page. I'm no longer getting notifications of appointments and letters and the app keeps crashing.",
"I'm so frustrated with this app. It won't load anything properly, everything keeps timing out. I just installed this thing to manage medical needs and it won't work. Super upsetting. Had me link provider's accounts but then that stalled everything else up. So I can only partially use it. -_-",
"Hospital stays, nurses, doctors, and menu items are fantastic! However, I'm very disappointed with the Accounting Department. I've received too many bills for copays that have been paid and/or copays that should not have been billed.",
"I can't login!!! I can login on the website, but, can't login on the app. I'm getting this error message: There was a problem communicating with server. ""Please try again later."" I've been getting this error all day. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I'm still getting this error. I have a video appointment with my doctor on Monday. Please fix this error.",
"About 90% of the time when I try to access test results, appointment summaries, etc I get ""an error occurred on the server. Please try again later"". Very, very frustrating.",
What a dreadful app. It's ugly. You have to enter information multiple times in order for it to take. It is alarmingly easy to get stuck in a dead end since there is no back button. Just a horrible experience.,
8/5 braindead app STILL broken 7/29...July 25 2022 app has been down for days - same worthless - please try later. No one paying attention. June 2021 App STILL not ready for prime time. No way to securely log out either from front page or even on the menu (sic). Can't open / download a PDF .. Seriously! broken - can't send messages to Dr office (all messages go to billing! Seriously!) Can no longer request prescription renewal. What use is this thing? Did anyone bother to test it before release?,
"Still cannot login. And no, it's not the system I use. My phone is updated with the latest internet sources. And before you give that copy and paste BS about each provider blah blah blah... I'm with Piedmont. Seems the common denominator is this new company Epic and their BS takeover of the app. 0 stars.",
"Excellent app to keep track of your health. I do all that I need to do on the app, order medications, message my doctors, check test results everything! I enjoy it and it's easy to navigate.",
"Installed this app and went to use it and it wouldn't recognize my password and when I went to reset it it would recognize my user name! Not off yo a good start, to say the least!! Update: I have since tried it again and managed to get on this time.",
Very user friendly accurate and great resource.,
"App doesn't remember the device no matter how many times you tell it to save it for login. And no, this is not about saving password, this is about using byometrics and revalidating the device with the pin in the email EVERY single time.",
"It would be nice if it worked. Multiple attempts at trying to start a video visit resulted in the app crashing or logging me out. It'll work on an iPhone, but not an android.",
"App still doesn't consistently work correctly. Times that medication refill requests, pre visit updates and the like can't be done. Stuff that has already been completed not updated. Example: I had my first Covid shot through my employer in March 2021 ( J & J) and the booster through my pharmacy in November 2021. My PCP was notified of both. Stupid app says my Covid vaccine is past due.",
Hard to understand Drs notes + information at times,
"I love MyChart, so convenient and easy to use!",
It's easy to find what you want & need. Everything I've ever needed to find is in the menu. Easy to maneuver. Colors are pleasant. Definitely worth spreading the word about. Thank you.,
Works most of the time. It has an issue at startup the screen keeps flashing until you cont hitting the back button the it will restart. Needs to be updated.,
"Easy to use. All providers, appointments, medications, tests, and results in the same place.",
"I like this APP, but would ""LOVE"" it if the user/ patient had the option to message the medical provider who is treating the user/patient while in the hospital. Currently, the user can message a care provider about test result questions from within the App while they're in the hospital, but the message will not go to staff providing the hospital care. Instead, the question goes to an option of the user/patient existing providers who are NOT treating them - while they are hospitalized.",
"I love Cone Health MyChart. It makes communicating with my medical team so much easier. I love being able to request appointments, medication refills, and see lab results and after visit summaries and notes. Taking care of your health is of the upmost importance and this is a great tool to help you do that.",
I love the ability to message my child's Healthcare team and have an answer in 24hrs instead of being put on hold all day long. I also love that all the after visit paper work is there for me to read. Another thing is that i can see available appointments and pick one instead of having to call.,
Informative and detailed....nice to have so much information available and with being able to search with Google assistance to understand terminologies at hand which weren't possible before ...patients can always access procedures done on my chart to be sent to smart phone or computer.... Overall a great tool....highly appreciated,
I love how you can link all your participans health care places to one app,
Love being able to see all my stuff and ask questions .,
The way this is set up now I cannot graph my test results this makes me very sad! I was always able to graph and log and look at my test results whether they went up down or otherwise and needed attention now I can no longer do that! Maybe I missed that class.,
"THE BEST HEALTHCARE TOOL EVER. Well, for information, that is! You can wait 25-30 minutes on the phone because EVERYONE in Healthcare is understaffed OR you can send a quick message through mychart & (at least my providers) receive a response within an hour or so, depending on the urgency of the request. Best way to request refills, too! Highly HIGHLY recommend this download. Take the 10 or 15 minutes to complete your profile properly & you're good to go.",
Very well organized and easy to navigate through,
"The MY Chart support team cannot update the MY Chart information. I asked them to remove doctors and medical staff, I no longer see and they said they were unable to do it. I asked them to add a doctor I do see and they could not do that either. Over 3 years since I've seen some of these medical people! Some on list I never even saw!",
"This app is easy to use. All my allergies to medications and my current medications are all in one place. Check-in for doctors appointments are fast and easy, especially for the receptionists. They always thank me for checking-in using the app.",
"One stop shop! If your like me with some times multiple appts. And doctors you need this app, all of your appts., doctors, test results are in one spot, this app is one of the best out there! Easy, effective and efficient i love this app!",
"Love them on the app helps keeps track of all you and your family members health. You can write you dr, you can make appointments. You get reminded, you will always have your medical records and everything right at your fingertips. As a mom life is always on the go everyday. life can a little lest stress with this app it have the address and Google maps to help make sure you get to your appointment on time.",
"Trying to schedule a visit. Goes to a screen asking me the reason. A button pops up with Mammogram as the only option. Pressing that button brings up a message saying that male patients need to work with their provider. Been happening since at least November, '22.",
I've been using MyChart for a few years now.. I love using it.. I do wish I could link my dignity health doctors to it. That would be nice.. have all my doctor communication in one place.. :) Anyway it's a great thing.. now having one for a child can be tricky but the help center can help set that up for ya..,
"Used to work. Now, like countless others, I just can't log in because it says there was a problem communicating with the server. Still works fine if I go to the website, but the app is completely broken and it seems that these idiots don't give a damn. Support is useless.",
This app is very helpful in keeping up with my appointments and viewing my visit reports.,
this app is not working on my chromebook but works on my cell. why ? ive uninstalled and reinstalled a few times and still not working..the app is great on my phone for fast stuff but now that we are dealing with this covo19 stuff i really need this app to work on my comp. soooo whats the issue is there something im doing wrong on my end or is their an issue with the app ??,
"I enjoy this app because I can check on appointments, lab results, vaccinations etc. This can even be used to confirm appointments & check in by phone when my cell is detected at my doctor's office. I love this app. All doctor's offices should have this. Thanks for the great app.",
I like comparing past blood test results. the website had that option. but lately the website won't even let me stay logged in. so I decided to try this app. well so much for that. only let me see the last blood results. if it doesn't improve I will be in installing it.... soon....,
"Great app except that when attempting to electronically sign a form for updated information changes in my profile, it asks for my birthdate, I cannot manually input the date and a calendar pops ups with TODAY'S DATE instead. In order the input my birthday I would have to scroll month by month by month from December 2020 all the way back to July 1966 the month I was born? Seriously? Please fix this obvious programming mistake and allow my phone keyboard to pop up instead of a calendar.",
"Easy to use, and very customer friendly",
I double check everything. Its not always enough information. But you just told me that may be restrictions on the content or the size of the content. I can't go quickly from the Rx page to appointments this is inconvenient at best. Related information would be nice to have in hand.,
"Not sure what's happened recently, but I can no longer attach images to messages with my provider as of about two months ago. Incredibly frustrating.",
"Gotta say, I've been loving MyChart. It makes it so easy for my doctors and I to manage my prescriptions, get refills same-day without talking to anyone, viewing my health reports before my doctor even has a chance to review them and explain them to me in plain-speak. I have access to multiple healthcare providers (like an outpatient visit to an out of state UrgentCare or their state's equivalent). I think every hospital and healthcare provider should be using this. Great job, Epic.",
"Used to really like this app now its nothing but a hassle for one specific reason. Anytime I try to load labs, after visit summaries, or messages I get ""An error has occurred. Please try again later."" Never had that issue before now I can't get into anything.",
"It is very handy. I do most of my health related inquiries, requests, etc., through it. Two issues that need improvement: - reply response to e-mail inquiries is slow. - I still am unable to get the system to update my vaccination record.",
"Super convenient, & useful. I like your able to msg your doctor & office directly, schedule, confirm, cancel appts & don't have to call to wait on hold. Most dislike that u have to call MyChart customer serv. and go through a whole thing just to add a new child to ur account. Overall the convenience is worth it for sure..",
"Everything I need to help manage my health, communicate, or simply stay informed at my fingertips when using this app! I'm most appreciative and happy 😊 Without the bothersome ads!",
Love the convenience and the options I have on line.,
"Love the app very helpful and easy to use. You get to see your test results, Make appointments, See your next appointment, Cancel or Check into your appointments has alot of things you can check on your appointments and health also chat with your doctor if you have any questions. If you have children you can also see their health records. Very usefull. Recomend to everyone 100% great.",
Had to reinstall and in doing so the newest version does not allow me to see past lab results or the graph. This is a loss of valuable data in my circumstances.,
"I like being able to check reports. I have had problems accessing 2 hospitals, Henry Ford Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. At the beginning I had both but a year later I am unable to access Beaumont. I also care for 2 other people. 1 person got dropped off. These 2 features need to be fixed.",
"I use this on a daily basis, just had some important bloodwork done and have been waiting for the results. All of a sudden it won't let me log in and says my fingerprint settings have been changed. I havent changed anything... It won't even let me log in on the site. What is the problem here??",
"I would give MyChart a 5-Star rating if they could consistently provide access between the three university healthcare systems where I am a patient. I link the programs so that each institution can access information from the other healthcare teams. About 3 months go by , and one institution nootifies me that they have lost access to recent tests and summary reports from the other institutions. Fix that, and I'll be happy to say, ""Way to go!I'll post 5 stars. Until then, 2 stars!",
App slow to respond. Instructions not always well formed.,
"Serves A Purpose, but very difficult to use. Plus there are several my charts, you would think the medical industry was smart enough to have all my charts as one.",
"Would be brilliant as has all my appointment and letters from the hospital. However, it doesn't work on the NHS WiFi so once you are in hospital and have no signal it's completely useless. Then I need a copy of the letter which is only on the app!",
"Very difficult to sign up and use. With or without activation code, no difference, it did not work. Besides, why you created an app that will redirect users to external browser in order to use some of the features?",
"well my medical information is well put & can do any modifications as needed, you really can't get lost w/this + when it's time for a video meeting w/ur doctor & staff, it's simple & if not simple then the staff can help you get online, what more can i say for a service that's really simple! 🤷🏾‍♂️ this is how it should be! but i only gave 4🌟's cause i used it 1 time + i have many more visits to go.. i hope you wasn't expecting a short survey? i guess this means im a real person!?!- yes i am",
I love MyChart now that I've quit forgetting my password!,
Convenient and Quick. I can review my medical information before seeing the doctor and generate questions to take to my appointment.,
"Finger print and pin login no longer works. It is turned on in settings. It doesn't show up at login. My device does support it, till a recent update I had no issues",
"Great except it wont sync my Swedish records with other organizations, even though it syncs others with Swedish. My UW doctors have no access to my swedish records. Also, they should add a feature to sinc smart watches (Samsung, Apple and Fitbit)",
"A great app, I use it whenever I need to communicate with my providers, it's easy to use. You get your health info and test results right away, I like that. You can message your doctor, ect so it's convenient too",
"I've been in hospital for over a month and use this constantly! the only wishful feature would be medications, when you took them and what you have available. I would say it would save time in the long run. but love getting all my results here!",
Recently had a gallbladder surgery and everything went smoothly and I was able to get everything taken care of. The people who took care of me were great and compassionate and courteous.,
"I absolutely love this app! Being an hour away, it's so much easier to leave a message, & get a faster response, than waiting on hold. I also use it to see what my test results are, & what I need to schedule for.",
My medications keep getting removed from the medication list. I'm still taking them and everytime I have to tell them to put it back on the list it takes me more time to get a refill on medications Im suppose to be taking. For an app suppose to help handle your health and such thats a really bad thing to keep glitching on.,
"UPDATE: WORKS GREAT NOW.......trouble linking hospital systems. i downloaded app and created account beaumont system. then i went online and created an Henry Ford system acct. i linked the two systems from the Henry Ford account. but when i went to the app, i thought both systems would be there. the only info I'm getting in the app is the Beaumont system i installed when downloading the app. i don't see anywhere on the app that i could use to link the two hosp systems. not useful to",
"Use it all the time. Even after I moved and changed doctors and medical affiliations, I was able to provide my new doctors with information not contained in my records. This turned out to be a huge help in a new diagnosis. Everything from my medical history is in one place. And, I can see it. I highly recommend this.",
"Excellent! it works, and it's quick and easy to use.",
"Its a great way to keep up with appointments, but making appointments is difficult, lots of Errors on the app, but I believe its because they're working on it! hopefully it will be fixed soon",
"Very easy to navigate, nice how fast you can get lab/procedure results. For some reason the alert that I have a message/result doesn't disappear after after I check it...",
"I absolutely love this app! It's so convenient, I love that I can schedule appointments and if there is not a date available for when I requested, they will just send me a message and get me set up. I like that you can see all of your test results and previous appointments.",
I am pleased to have access to my health information at my fingertips. My information is updated almost instantly and so my follow-up information is there for my review. It also helps me keep on track for my appointments and make sure my calendar is up to date with everything that I need to do and everywhere I need to be. My chart is an excellent resource in my opinion.,
"I love this app, especially because I see multiple specialists at a university medical system and so all my providers have access to test results, medical history, surgical procedures and medications. I can message my physicians directly, schedule appointments and even discuss errors in a clinician's notes with a member of quality assurance or talk to a billing department staff or pharmacist through this app. No advertising.",
"I love this app!! It helps me to keep track of all of my appointments so I don't have to worry about forgetting them! Plus, you can add it all to your calendar to remind you when and where! It has several other features that are great too so it's well worth the download!",
"I can make and cancel appointments.. order refills from the pharmacy, and pay my hospital bill...all in one place!! This app is informative and convenient. It's very easy to use as well. Thank you.",
"I enjoyed using MyChart very much, it gives me information about what's going on with my health.",
"I have been using this app for over a year and it's really easy. Also added my daughter on it and it's direct on what is her chat and mine. I like that you can schedule your own appointment, check how your appointment went and lab work. All around love it so far.",
"Great way to get results from tests quickly, renew prescriptions, and ask questions!",
"This is a cool app. I can send messages and get answers from my Doctors, my meds are available 24/7 to look up if I need, I can make appts and check results from tests I have taken. It's informative and keeps everything in order : ) Thanks for making all so easy : )",
MyChart is convenient to use.,
Very efficient way to view and transmit information about your health 👍🏿 !,
Very easy to use and helpful in keeping up with my care.,
Finally Google and Apple Pay! Great idea to have our vaccination readily available but needs a way for it to be scanned at businesses or airports. Like the fingerprint security & the amount of information we can access but the user interface is definitely not in accordance with Android developer design standards as defined by Google,
"After visit summaries when I have not attended an in office or telehealth appointment. Also, claiming I have spoken to someone in a doctor's office when it was not myself. Pharmacy that spoke to someone in a doctor's office pertaining to myself. This in turn comes back to me in my notes when I call in and an LVN, RN&/or PA claim that I called in about a med ECT & get snarky. Setting options for notifications still gets you multiple notification methods even though you've turned those off.",
Easy to use and very quick on test results.,
"Horrible app. Not updated information on my meds and procedures. They have meds listed for me from 2011 knee replacement and I cannot correct this. Also the meds I currently take aren't listed. Then...I get a message that I ""owe $175, view in app."" When I open it it says account balance ""0""!!! If it wasn't for Covid vaccinations I wouldn't use it and now that I have received my 2nd dose I will uninstall this useless site. PS somehow my granddaughter in Everett, WA was able to get me my 1st appt.",
"I've had Mychart for a few years and really like the convenience of this app. All of my personal doctors are on this app which makes it all so convenient. Sometimes, because of my age, I do have a difficult time knowing how to work the app but it's not hard to find the help I need.",
Excellent site. Allows me to keep up with appointments and tests. When I see a new Doctor I utilize it to help me remember all my medications. Love that my test results are posted. I am a retired Nurse Practitioner so I understand the results and take active role in my health care. My Chart gets ***** from me!,
"It helps reminds me of Dr's appointments, I can request to be seen by my doctor, I get lab results and I can submit medications refills I can have my primary Doctor return calls to me. It's such a great informative tool to have. Link your cell phone to my chart, everything you want to know is there. Thanks for making this app for all patients .",
Tried to answer questions and needed to put in birthday but calendar popped up and I would had click over 600 times to get to birth year(55 × 12) Easier if you just entered digits(4-6 clicks). Otherwise it great to keep track of your appointments,
"WHY DID YOU CHANGE IT, SO THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN NOW USE THE APP, THEY HAVE TO HAVE an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch? What's really going on? I've been talking to my doctor's for years on MyChart, now it's telling me a Newer Version of MyChart is available, where can I download the NEW VERSION? exactly. Something is going on, I work in Securities and I see it clear as day. 'Yale New Haven Health', that's the problem here.",
It works and is great for getting medical things done remotely,
This app makes everything so much easier. I can keep track of all my doctor appointments and I can also message my doctors if I need to. Plus I can see all my test results. I would be so lost if it wasn't for my chart. Absolutely love it.,
The app is not user friendly. Inable tondelet unwanted notifications from home screen. No direction for covid testing. Not helpful overall. Desktop version used to be much better,
Really good app...very helpful and much better than past versions. Sometimes hard to get set up or first sign in....if so get assistance from Doctors Office...they have some back door access and can assist with some trouble shooting.,
I've asked to get an activation code every time we've had a visit and never been able to get one. I'd also love the ability to request access to our kids records. The only reason I was able to see one of my kids records is because we got admitted and they called the onsite tech support to help.,
This app is super useful and very user friendly. I love being able to see what dates everything was on/will be on. And being able to book appointments through this app is wonderful too!,
"I would give this 0 if I could. I can't log in, even when i try and recover my username/ password. It just says that i will receive an email about my information but i never get it. Its so frustrating because i would like to reschedule an appointment. I also tried calling and i was put on hold for a very long time. Can i get any assistance? I hate how this was put together.",
I find it an easy way to reach my Dr when I have a quick question for her without having to go in to see her,
"In separate sections my vaccination status isn't updated, like the landing page. Then when I use the menu option for COVID-19, it shows my current info. It's the same organization. Please help!",
"I was sent an automation activation link for Gbmc but I had to download the app. Once I downloaded it, I was at the login with no information so when I request an activation code I get an email stating I'm already active so I can't receive one. So I then do forgotten password/username and I get no email. I then call the help desk and was told the systems down so they can't help!! Smh... For the month that I've had this app it's been no good to me!! Can't check no lab results at all!!",
It has simplified my life. With all information right at my fingertips.,
"I feel it's great to have it helps with not having to call for every little question we have 2 our Doctors. I'm also pretty sure it helps them a ton 2 lol bt my favorite part about havin it is bein able to know exactly all my Info & appt's, incase I go to the hospital an they have certain questions I dnt remember all I have to do is sign in an give them everything from tests to allergic reactions, to other problems I have ongoing, an tests I've had done recently. It's great 2 have the portal.",
"This type of portal should be available to every patient by all their Public Health units. Keeping track of appointments and reports is made so simple. Our medical info shouldn't be so secretive to ourselves. Of course we are not medical experts, but this certainly helps with certain aspects of self care.",
"It's a great way to make an appointment, pay your bill, and check your test results. I also use it to write notes to my doctor and get a response the next day. I can see what my prescriptions are, and request refills if necessary. It really is a great all coverage app and I use it all the time.",
I'm able to see results much quicker through the app. Appointment reminders are very helpful and also able to ask my doctor questions through the app. All of these are things are a huge plus.,
Easy to use until my data gets damaged and NO ONE knows how to fix it. UPDATE: Done trying to get this resolved. Tired of being redirected to some other resource to achieve a resolve. After some great assistance from MattS at BHSI. my issue is resolved and I once again rate 5 stars.,
"1/10/22: Only got auto-reply to email (WTH?!) Finally got Pin setup AGAIN to login on my own. Why can't Preferences stay same after update? I HATE UPDATES!! 12/30/21: tried to get into app this a.m. but it stays at the homepage! After 5min I get an Error message saying to check my connection! Uninstalled 2x so far, now trying on my laptop. Also, when u type a message, u can't see what ur typing now! On 3rd download, I can get in BUT now I have to enter my PW every time? What happened to the PIN?",
Love getting what records/results can but sure wish had more information and explained results more in depth and with more understanding of them. But love all can access on app! Great app but room to improve. Thank you.,
"Terrible experience since the last update. While I can easily login to my account with the app, unlike other recent user reports, no prior health records can be found whatsoever.",
This is a very handy app to have. Test results come back really fast.,
"I love that I can access our entire family's medical team all in one app and stay connected easily through appointments and communication. My only issue is with Froedert and MCW or it is with something in the set up of mychart. I had Aurora and froedert connected, but then i added childrens and it kicked me out of my aurora and froedert mychart access. I could re-login, but My family members were no longer connected and it has been a headace having to reconnect and fill out proxy forms again.",
"Excellent app, easy to use and very helpful.",
Very easy to read and medical history on hand I love it🥰,
"info gained through syst. is fantastic to share with out of system with PRMC and FW VAMC. Please add access to radiology reports and images. (????DOIC). FW VAMC is now able to provide both services. I think it a mistake to keep reviews PUBLIC or non-ananomous. What is to be gained by letting others that I am a patient at facility ""XYZ""",
Great if you want to just see your results and have letters uploaded rather then sent out. But don't waste your time trying to send a message or question because you just get ignored like you do with the 500 calls they don't answer and leave to go to a full inbox and emails they don't bother responding to,
This app is not user friendly. Very frustrating.,
"Update: I was able to sign it through the website. The app is now working beautifully. I have always loved this app, but the most recent update seems to have caused an issue. It gives me a 'there seems to be a problem. Please try again later.' every time I sign in.",
Always helpful and friendly to explain any questions. Efficient and process scripts very quickly. Very happy with all of the staff. I feel like an appreciated customer and not like just a number. Best service and Pharmacy in Danville.,
One stop health shopping. Brilliant. It does all the work for me. Better than a dozen manilla folders at home. If you aren't using this app you and your health are lacking. Go paperless. The environment will thank you.,
"Not user friendly impossible to access information and no way to get help.. I noticed there was info for me but could open it. This makes it useless and there is no number to call or nothing attached for ""help"".",
MyChart is great. But I would be better if it would have a place for the suite number inside the hospital. When I have an appointment the area changes... do I need to be in level B unit D? Or C11... or F10? Who knows. It's a guessing game and I often have to go down several different hallways before I find out where I need to be. If My chart would add the suite number so when I say I've arrived... it's not just at the hospital... I know which suite to go to as well. I have sent them suggestions,
"I save all my login information and none has verified by MyChart? Called and got a link sent, and they want an access code... well I don't have one. The run around is so frustrating and I really needed to get into my account.",
"I really enjoy this app. It is easy to use and very convenient. I love how I can message my doctor right from the app, I can keep up with all of my records and appointments, and my children's accounts can also be linked to mine so I can keep up with their stuff as well.",
Easy to use and I have everything right at my fingertips. I always know when my appts are and have the post visit notes. I can communicate with my dr and see all my prescriptions. It's so convenient.,
"I have 4 ""portals"" for my children and I have had to call tech support multiple times. I see 1 account when I log in and the other 3 I have no access to unless I get a ""code"" texted to my phone to log on to a different account that has my 3 other children. Funny part is that BOTG accounts are under the same email and password! It's confusing and frustrating when I'm told I already have proxy access but my credentials don't bring up ALL accts....",
"Very easy to use. To pay your bills and upcoming appointments that you might forget the date, and to also get refills on your meds. Highly recommend.",
The only thing I need is for all my doctors to input my visits each time. My colon check-up is not showing up on my chart. But I love being able to get most of my medical stuff in one app.,
I works clungy the old app was better. Takes too long to load doesnt save yyour password each time you log in is too much no fingerprint log in ect. Dont think this was ready to use.,
It's a convenient n effective way to communicate w your health provider. Does not allow screenshots and you cannot view visit notes more than 3 months old.,
This app is so easy to use. I love it. When I have a question to ask my doctor she responds right back. If I need to make a appointment. I can see what's opened and no need to stay on the phone for the next person. You can see your test results easy and fast. I would recommend anyone to use it. It's very convenient.,
It's a great thing to have all your medical files in one place. So convenient and it makes it easier to show other or share info in just a few easy steps,
It's been excellent up until this last month. Getting a lot of ERROR messages and not being able to check in or anything on the app.,
Best medical app anyone can have. I love the fact I can access all my records here when I need to recall visiting these locations. And also to remind me of my appointment.,
"Other than moving my scheduled appointment, it's been great. Taking time off work and driving 30 min to my appointment, just to find out it had been moved to the following week is not ok.",
"Nice to have this on my phone to keep up with my appointments and other items related to myself. Being able to reschedule appointments, order medications, and check on any tests I have had done.",
"It's an awesome experience to communicate with doctors, make appointments and see test results quickly. I could not manage without it!!",
Totally awesome way to keep track of all your medical information. Five stars because it touches bases on every single point of medical history about oneself. Thank you. Keep up the good work,
Very help keeping track of all medical needs and gives results of any tests or problems. Simplified a record of all my health.,
Help to check all my medical information easily,
Fast and easy,
Best app for reading what your test results are and medical records of office visits. This app totally backs up everything that your doctor says and all results from previous tests. A must download.,
I've had good success in getting my information back and forth with my care team. Being able to contact them without being on hold or voice mail is nice.,
"Great App,you get your results immediately.",
"Extremely unintuitive, difficult to navigate",
"It works great for Oregon Health Science University however I tried to add Providence and it's not working. It won't even let me view my messages, see test results, or appointments. It notifies me of new test results or messages but I cannot open them.",
"Very quick and easy to checking for scheduled appointments, see lab results, or send questions/messages to health care providers. Outstanding app!🙏",
"This has been fantastic as I can keep track between mine and my family's communication, appointments and can even ask questions to my doctor without a call. This app makes having very busy days when I can't call to a doctor or get them on the phone right away so much better for my health.",
It is very buggy. Tells me to reconfirm my email but nothing happens the apps just gives error notice same when clicking summary tab. I wish they would provide a qr code that links to your vaccine history.,
"Great app! Wish all my doctors used it!!! I was at a Dr appointment and I was able to pull up my blood test results for her (she was having computer issues) She was so glad to see I had My Chart. Her words were ""Oh! I just love this app!"" Patients and Drs find it very helpful!!",
The app is okay. I like the app because you send messages to you health team if you have concerns about your health. It also helps me keep up with appointments that you can cancel and reschedule though the app.,
Great app for all Cleveland Clinic patients to not only make appointments but to see test results and total history of all things that one goes to the doctor for. You can also message your primary doctor directly for any needs. LOVE IT!!!,
"This makes it so easy for your physicians to already know alot about you. Also keeping you in the loop when test results are ready. To put icing on the cake, you don't have to call to make an appointment. Just pick up your phone and make the appointment right from the app. I truly love this app. Thanks MyChart!!!!",
Love love love it. Everything is right there for your convenience. No busy phone lines or waiting periods. Very quick responses as well. My chart is the best thing for the clinics as well for the clients.,
"It works quite well, but haven't been able to use fingerprint biometrics in some time. Tried to look for instructions or permissions within the app - so 3 stars instead of 4.",
This app has came in pretty great at times. Love seeing my test results instead of having to wait til my next visit. It's easy to navigate through the app and find what you need. Like that my meds are listed saves me alot of time.,
Excellent tool to participate in your care and an efficient tool for care providers.,
"This is a wonderful tool to have available. I like knowing that I can go into the app to look at my past records. Also, being able to send messages to my doctor(s) is a GREAT plus! Thanks much. (I WOULD like to update my photo, however!!! 😊)",
Feels like a lot of clutter when navigating through the app. Although this could be based on the organization the app is representing. Other than that no complaints.,
MyChart Is indispensable. It is so Critical to have all of your health records in one location and easily accessible. However resetting the long temp password they give you is a difficult.,
So far so good 👍 very helpful & clear,
I am getting letters a few hours past my appointments and sometimes a day later from my appointments reminding me that I have an appointment. These letters are pointless because the appointments are already over with. It's like setting my alarm to remind me to wake up for work 3 hours after I'm the real time I was to wake up. IT MAKES NO SENCE!!!! It is retarded. Get it. I hope so.,
This is really awful. The Doctor kept cutting in and out. There was a huge lag time during the call. It would be so much better if it could use my lap top. I think the connection would have been stronger. I was embarrassed to have to keep asking he doctor to repeat all of her questions. It made for a very frustrating visit.,
"On more than one occasion the app will not allow me to type into the subject line of an email, then will not permit the email to be sent with no subject line. This doesn't happen often but it's prevented me from using the app to communicate with medical staff more than once.",
"Seems to be one of the ways to request a refill from my doc without waiting on hold. I don't see all my records or blood work in here. Be nice to download my records without having to pay and sign medical release forms, just scan thumb print or biometric. Why haven't they got the Covid vaccination updated by the state yet? My photo is at a horrible angle looking up from the desk. They should know how to take a photo by now since you can't update a selfie 😜",
Great and easy.,
"Having this app has been a complete life saver for me and my family. Being able to keep track of past and future appointments, diagnosis, test results you name it. Even having the doctors or nurses reply back to me regarding my care is such a breeze using this app. LOVE IT!!!!!!",
Has worked great ever since I downloaded it and even was able to redownload it when I got a new phone. Also I had no problem with my username and password when I installed it on my new phone. I really like being able to talk to my doctor and request prescription medication without having to talk anyone at the doctor's office.,
It worked great until they updated it now I have to go to a office to see if they can help reinstall it and figure out all the things that got changed. Very annoyed it was perfectly fine before the update 🙄,
When a facility uses the app it is easy to manage appointments and see test results,
"It seems to be built with the best of intentions, but there are issues, like sharing with proxy. There are a ton of links to videos about inviting a proxy, but the app has no place to actually invite someone.",
"I love this app. It is so convenient and accessable to me. Unfortunately, my husband has forgotten his passcode. It concerns me greatly. I wish, for his health and care, that I could manager it for him. I just have no idea how to make that happen. Please let me know how I can do that for him. His memory has significant deficits.",
"It is fairly user friendly. But the ""no surprise"" billing always leaves me surprised. It does no t account for insurance. So,when I get my bill it is the first time I have seen what I owe.",
"This app is awesome. Don't have to worry about remembering my meds by name because I can look them up on this app as well as the appointments which I can send to my Google calendar. All procedures and visits, vaccines due, test results etc. My chart is my best friend. 😀",
This app makes things easy to access. You have all your medical records at a touch. You also can make doctor appointments and get refills with this app. It makes life just that much easier.,
"I used to love MyChart, cld rely on it 99% (nothing perfect). But now, everything gets recorded in different places and I can no longer be sure of my appts or what Ive done or need to do. I've had all my Covid vaccines, says I'm still due one, had my mammogram, MyChart says something else. Eversence Duly wanted to split off, my recordkeeping job has doubled, always having to switch from, MyChart to Duly to Palos and on and on. There shld b a way to combine ""my"" records in ""my"" app!",
"This app is very Informational and useful however Because my parent and my name are very similar, and we share a portal, The system continually confuses medications and schedules between the 2 people. So, if you have a similar lane with a loved one please make sure that you are not under the other person's name",
I can not use my finger print to sign on. I use to change to another doctors office without having to put a user name and password in. I have been trying to verify my phone number and for some reason I am not getting a code by text. I never had any problems until recently. I am very frustrated.,
Don't waste your time calling. I've had great success communicating with my doctor and filling prescriptions for me and my family through the app. I get quick responses for billing questions and appointment scheduling. Strongly recommend.,
"The only problem with this app is that no one responded back to my questions. When you make a mistake that decision is finally and no one ever gets back in contact with you. I accidentally cancelled my appointment for my eyes examine and when I tried to reschedule this appointment. It took me two months to just get answers and then only to be told that I would have to reschedule. Once I asked what other day or time, I was immediately told that someone who contacted me back. Well, that never happ",
"Keeps me in touch with my doctor at all times. My medicine, refills, appointments, test results, ect. I can even email the doctor or staff when the phone is not an option or off hours. It has been a great asset for better communication for me with my doctor's office.",
Makes everything so easy!,
"Easy to use. Able to send message to doctors, able to see if they have seem the message and get responses. Easy to request refills and keep up with appointments. Love the app.",
"You can schedule appointments, see test results and find information found in your permanent records. I gave it a 4 only because it doesn't have results of xrays or CT scans as my hospital made available in their previous app. Otherwise I would have given it a 5.",
I love it I just need to find my records from previous Doctors I noticed aren't on my charts a records,
"Makes it SO much easier to get in contact with my doctors! And I can review my results in real-time. When Dr. Offices are overwhelmed with calls, a quick message can get me a response a lot faster and in writing so it's easier to understand. Love using this app!",
With My Chart I've used this app both personally and professionally and I love it. It gives the patient more control over their to be able to see what the provider sees and is quicker to request refills. You can also see your COVID test results when they become available!,
Great to be able to access all medical info and dates,
Extremely helpful in general but especially if you have frequent appointments. It also makes contacting your doctor substantially easier though some doctors don't seem to have direct contact through myhealth unfortunately.,
"I'm trying to share access to my account with my wife. I can navigate to ""Who can see my records"" which gives me access to a YouTube video. The instruction in the video do not work on the app. I cannot find a screen where I can add a new user, and their device.",
"Love the Portal, I am never late or forget my appointments. Also, my dad lives in WV and the hospital there is Ruby and they use the same systems so I know when his appointments are and he can never not be truful to me about what the doctors say. Me in ND and Dad in WV this portal is life changing and puts my mind at peace.",
I love being able to see everything and makes it easier to ask questions.,
Great app! I use this app all the time to contact my doctors and read my test results. It's very patient friendly and easy to use. I also like how it reminds you of the incoming appointments.,
Awesome very informative and helpful,
"Very helpful, keeps you updated and makes sure you don't forget your appointment, etc. I just hate when you don't keep in contact with a doctor for a while, they take them out of the list for making an appointment, you'll have to call them smh.",
Very accurate and helpful,
I LOVE this app. It helps me manage all of my healthcare needs from doctors appointments to my prescriptions to whatever. It also makes it very easy to send messages directly to my primary care physician and her nurse as well as any one of the specialists I see. In addition it let's me know when it's time for any vaccinations I may need.,
"Works extremely well for messaging and for reviewing labs and appointments. Very intuitive. Rather than search under Health Summary to find Immunizations, would recommend a separate dedicated button on dashboard.",
Since what ever update happen the app no longer works. I have messages and I can't even get to them. The simple app of last works way better than this. How am I suppose to look at messages when the app and the website doesn't work.,
"I love it.It's very convenient, but sometimes a little confusing to navigate, or get a provider to update their information. But it comes in very handy,once you get the hang of it.",
Really very helpful and informative. I love the feature to add my appointments to my Google Calendar. I'm diabetic and also have some other issues so I also love getting my lab results an hour or so later...same with MRI & CT Scan results...for all of these I'm able to get the same information that my doctor will be getting.,
"Need to be fixed. Not showing all options and there's issues with messages as well as some work up reports, and other functions. as well.",
I love this chart. If it's not broken don't try to fix it!,
"I LOVE ❤ the My Chart app. Often times I get lab results and test results before my doctor even has a chance to call me. If it is a lab or test that I have frequently, I usually understand the results. If I have questions, I have nothing to worry about, because I know that my doctors office will be calling with the results and will answer any questions. I can also ask my doctor a question, schedule an appointment or request a medication refills all from the My Chart App. I give it 2 👍👍",
"This is a horrible stupid My Chart. It was great for a few years and now it changed. It will not show recent blood work, not show all testing at Cleveland Clinic Martin Memorial or Cleveland Clinic in Weston Florida. It shows nothing but one visit last year and all my tests an visits an so on are GONE. THIS APP DOES BULL. AND WHY WOULD IT CHANGE AND LET ALL YOUR TEST AND RESULTS BE GONE WHEN IT WAS ALWAYS THERE?",
"My Chart App is a solid performer. It's great to be able to access your records, medications, and test results. It's easy to contact your provider with questions or follow up. Outstanding!",
"Could not get the app to use the face camera for the teleconference, it would only activate the forward facing camera. Microphone was disabled. We had to talk by telephone while I held the camera facing the patient. Device became too hot to hold by the end of the ten to fifteen minute conference. S9",
"You have access to your medical records, do on line doctor appointments it works great for me.",
"This app needs lots of work. I made an appointment on the app, went to Geisinger in Bellefonte, they had no record of my appointment. A bunch other things happened with the messaging where I never received answers to simple questions about test results.",
MyChart is so neat you get to see everything that the doctors and nurses are doing for you and your appointment are right in front of you like I said it is really neat,
"I just wanna get my covid results, but when i try to make an account, it wont let me without a phone number, and i cannot put my phone number in, i type it into the space where it wants it and it just stays blank. If i cant even make an account i cant imagine the frustration after the 1st page.",
No tech support..just how to update password. SCANS test results not loaded into account on mychart correctly by staff.You have todownload another app to read .been a customer for 2 years. I think it is not working as designed . I like the way i can leave messages to staff or dr. I like how iget myblood work results right away. I dislike how even the patient support isnot able to help.,
Love the app but wish you could do things on both the phone and desktop. I hate that you can't see everything on your phone that you can see when you are on a computer. Otherwise it is a great app.,
"Love it, EXCEPT the number of new entries numbered under my photo on home page. Nothing tells me what is unseen except for tests, covid & visits. The number is always there but doesn't tell me what to open up. It is confusing.",
"I love the app it keeps me updated on appointments and test results. I just wish they have drop window to send message to the doctor/ doctor office, since it gets complicated when you are dealing with multiple doctors.",
"This My Chart App. has been Absolutely Amazing in keeping me connected to my Health Care Services. The App. is user friendly, collaborates multiple Healthcare providers, offers the most recent medical updates and in my experience the test results are often available prior to the Health Care Provider. I highly recommend.",
"Didn't know about the check-in option until recently. I checked in, and 5 mins later, I was getting called to the back.",
"Great app! It's awesome to have my medical info at my fingertips and contact my doctor anytime. I have to take off one star, though, because we can only have one provider in the app. We need to go to the web to see linked providers.",
"It is a perfect application and i use so many. Well organized. Complete data, easy to navigate. Love the new feature of using a pin to open it.",
"I give this app 5 stars because it's simple and it works. It's easy to choose your organization and the person whose chart you want to look at. Everything is literally there Visits, Meds, Messages etc",
"I love this app! I actually have gone out of my way to try & make sure that all of my Drs are through the Riverside group, so that they use MyChart. I just love that all of my medications are listed in this app, & I can easily order refills. All of my upcoming appointments for any of my Drs are here too. I can even send a message to my Dr, right through this app if I want. I also like how easy record sharing is between my Drs.",
It's nice that I can speak with the nurses and doctors thru this app.,
"The app is fast and convenient. However, it only shows me received emails and not sent. Option to delete emails is only one at a time.",
"I really like this app. It is very efficient and easy to use. This app will give you complete detailed list of your detailed medical history, bills and payment and appointments for many different health organizations. You have access to everything at your fingertips.",
It's a lot easier to keep track of your appointments and All your Lab work,
"Love love love! This app makes everything so much easier. From sharing my meds list. To asking a question without having the wait, or missing a call back. I really do appreciate all at ufhealth! I don't know what I'd do without each and every one of them. Nameste",
Good. I like that it keeps my records available for me to review,
Great way to keep track of test results and appointments,
"Love this app! You can link multiple doctors, hospitals, and even urgent care locations to one app. It'll show you upcoming appts, estimates, messages from doctors, and blood work. I can connect all doctors to one child's account, set up labs, payment plans, ask Qs, etc. Don't live without the convenience this app offers!",
"Mixed review; easy to use BUT endless emails and messages. Like, I have a 6mon follow up; I'm getting MULTIPLE notifications about an ""earlier appt slot"". I'm not on a wait list, so WHY the multiple messages??",
"MyChart is a great app to keep on top of your medical info and upcoming appointments. Montefiore Medical what's the sense of asking me me to precheckin on the app, have a barcode, only to have the same questions asked to me again when I arrive? It's cumulates in cost as time wasted for both patient and facility.",
"Love how it's great for multiple doctors. Went to the ER and received x-ray and CT results before the doctor was able to walk back in the room with them. Easy to update medications, insurance information, confirm appointments, message doctors, etc!",
"Makes keeping on top of your own health easier. Everything in one place. Communication with health care givers quick. I use it all the time. Makes me feel safe when I travel,easy to keep in touch with my health care workers. I would recommend it for everyone.",
The app was working at first and now i can't login. Keeps saying can't connect to server but my spouse can log me in on her phone. We have the same phone. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still didn't fix the issue .,
"Why can't I update information myself? I've had several of the vaccines, procedures that are on my homepage, but I cannot update the information myself. The doctors and or organizations providing the service are not part of MyChart network, therefore they show as overdue, which they are not. The individual user needs to be able to update his or her info to make this app useful.",
Love getting my test results instantly and the ease of making appointments.,
Nice app. I thought it was going to be stuffy and all medical-like but I was pleasantly surprised. Great options for confirming appointments and checking in early. I like that everything is kept in one place.,
"""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."" I've been getting that error every time I try to log in. Cleared cache and data and still getting that error. Reinstalled the app, still getting that error. Not sure what's going on...",
"Absolutely amazing app. Test results, upcoming appointments, pre-registration questionnaires all available. Can add appointments to your calendar. Finally an app for you about your health. Excellent!",

"Mychart is one of the best app that was discovered before mychart, sometimes u want your result but can not get it until ur next visit to the doctor but mychart let u see it and asked your doctor questions right away I LOVE IT!!! You can also compare results from all visits. Just want to say thank u tovwhoever came up with this app.",
"Amateurish in design, and there is no print option.",
I love using MyChart. It keeps all my information in one place. Just link them together and b seeam your account is awesome. I can make appointments and request refills and ask the office questions right there on that app. Probably get answered before we any call will get returned. I have been having issues with peoplw calling all the time j,
"I like being able to to connect MyChart for my primary doctor and my specialists in Iowa City. I can keep my medical records in one place and look everything up with ease. I still keep a folder with important info but not like I did for my late husband more than 20 years ago when I carried a large bag with several folders, , several notebooks just so I could keep all the info needed to keep his doctors informed of what was happening with all his doctors and tests! Love this!",
Excellent utility for patients and caregivers both,
"I absolutely love this app. I can see my lab work, keep up with appointments, see doctors notes about my visit. I can pre register through the app. It also sends reminders. Usually before the nurse comes back I already have my next appts on this app.. Just such a good app.",
"This app makes is so much easier to coordinate health care, especially since I'm coordinating for myself and two other family members. It is hard enough to be ill and seeing multiple doctors, but to be handling my care and the same level of care for 2 other people you love. MyChart is irreplaceable. Now if physicians were required mandatorily to use it.",
"Great app, simple and easy to use. Easy sign-in w/passcode, menu is well organized. easy to find all my information i.e.... upcoming visits, visit summary, medications, tests/results, etc.",
"The UX is HORRIBLE! Face unlock finally supported years later... but isn't the default! Many home page notifications can't be dismissed in the app, only in the browser.",
"Ever since the systems merged, I found a lifelong condition diagnosis missing. Now I either have to get and ROI form for that rheumatologist or get poked and prodded yet again. I shouldn't have to go through all this trouble just to again have my lifelong diagnosis back in my chart. Blame is on Jefferson Health and Conemaugh Health because they both had it in their charts and now it is lost since the merge! To respond to the response, I have. They're not doing anything about it.",
Very helpful for Information about my health and appointments.,
Used to be pretty good. Now too many server problems and not able to rely on it for updated info. Also several features do not function. It has a lot of potential,
"Its a government tool that works, the future of the technical health service field. Works as needed",
"The app would be great if the patient was able to update medical history, medications, etc. Only a physician can change or update and none of mine will because they don't want to step on another doctor's toes. So I have to hand each doctor my own page of corrected history and meds and tell them to ignore what's in MyChart. Unfortunately if I'm ever hospitalized and not able to tell someone the MyChart info is incorrect I will get many wrong medications that have been changed or discontinued.",
Very impressed indeed. It is very simple to navigate.,
"Love the app, but can't use the new ""authentication code""",
Great Dr. I always get the best care here. Dr. McCarty is always up to date with the latest developments and in his training to give you a better understanding of what is happening in your body. Keep up the great work doctor.,
"Will give five stars when you fix: The fact that I can get doctor's notes (excuses) through the app, but CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. I can't screenshot, can't share to email or text, can't share with anyone. What's the point of having them there, if I can't utilize them?",
"That app is great but would love a bookmark, starred, or highlight messages, in the message section. There was emails I was relying on during my bariatic journey and it was a bear trying to find them.",
Amazing app. I can read my life history here.,
"Good app, you can see and find most everything in your health records. For me it has been very easy to use especially when communicating with nurses, making appointments and making payments",
"MyChart used to be a good app but suddenly it won't load anything for me, I just keep getting server error everything I choose something an goes back to main screen. Couldn't get it to load and late for my video Dr appt. What's going in?",
Good experience so far. Can get immediate results from all of the tests.,
"Best patient portal thus far , flawless compared to others.",
I like this app.. It keeps me updated on my appointments and tests results .,
"Virtual appointments NEVER work! I have the hardest time when doing the Virtual visits. It just doesn't work my phone, I always have to contact technical support.",
"I love MyChart, It makes managing my families appointments so much easier. I can also communicate quickly with nursing staff when necessary. It is so easy to click and add appointments to my Google calendar as well!",
Good idea just make it work. Video chat crashes the app. Every. Single. Time. And if you're using a different app put the info in the appointment screen.,
"This is a great way to communicate directly with providers for scheduling appts., requesting prescription refills and to ask questions about your care. The providers are very responsive.",
Easy to navigate.. Helps me keep track of appts.,
"So handy! All the test results in one place, the ability to message doctors! The app sometimes gets weird and has ""server errors"" though, lately (jan 2022). Hope they fix that",
This is a great tool. Just wished that all the doctor or team who have seen you could remain on the fill. I only say this is to get the team to communicate or update charts in hospital. I am getting the back and forth and no food because someone(s) have not updates the files,
I love the way it works with the doctor in getting prescription refills.,
It has proven to be helpful and a vital part of my medical care,
"This is the best thing going right now! It makes your visits easy and convenient for the Dr staff as well as the patient, so that you can get the proper care needed. Also, the fact that I can view my medical chart and my exams and see the notes and everything, it's the best thing going so far..",
"The app is ok. I always have issues signing in. I am using the correct username and password and it does not recognize it. When I signed up, it did not provide me with a security questio so it will not let me reset my password.",
"This app is not user friendly. It also will not load pages for test results and messages. I always have to go on my laptop to get the information, which DEFEATS the purpose of having an app...",
Makes my life easier no long waits on the phone and easy refills on my meds,
"same problem as others, was extremely helpful and made life a lot easier. now it keeps saying a newer version is available and will not let me log in. it really was great. if there is a fix for this I'd love to know about it",
Won't accept password.  Just like many other reports on here.  Tech support is nothing more than 'I can reset your password' but no support for the actual app.   No comments on here from the devs since June despite all of the login / connection issues being reported.  Uninstalled.,
"Needs work. My chart isn't updated, the scheduling system is not loading consistently and it would be nice to be able to upload pdfs thru the messaging center.",
"I love the convenience of MyChart for appointments, reviewing instructions, being able to review labs and diagnoses at a glance. The only disappointment is sometimes I pre-checkin but have to answer all the same questions again at my appointment. Overall, GREAT APP.",
I have a great doctor that really takes care of me and make sure that on my messages he definitely responds quickly. This portal has truly helped me tremendously on a lot of things and I even find out things that I didn't know in this portal this is the best thing that title health could have done and I appreciate it knowing that just with one click we're able to see test results that we have taken I give them a five-star,
Lately I've had to go to the desktop to access my information. For some reason my credentials are not accepted on the app. 😔 Even after requesting password changes and so on.,
Good way to get info quickly and easily!,
"I love MyChart. I can schedule or cancel medical appointments, request medication refills and send an email to my doctor. It's a great tool for communicating with any physicians within Johns Hopkins Hospital Network that you have seen before. The MyChart App even allows you to make medical billing an co-payments. Its very friendly useable and it save times when you have access to your medical follow-up. You are able to read notes from your physician. It's really a great medical system.",
"I used to LOVE MyChart app because I could communicate with anyone in the facility I needed. However, now when I try to send a message, it asks me the type of message via visual prompt and then I get exactly THREE choices. Not my current doctor nor previous doctor. Help. If this is fixed, my rating will be five stars again.",
"What a great way to keep your medical record it is easy to view test results and to contact your doctor, view prescriptions, and see upcoming appointments with your doctor or specialist. More back surgeries in my future. At least it's easy to keep track of",
"I love being able to see the doctors notes, test results, billing, and messages all in one place. I can confirm my appointments and pay my copay in the same app. I wish all doctors and hospitals used it. It would make life so easy.",
"When I have a medical question, they usually replay on the same day. As long as it is before2:30 p.m.",
"Refuses correct login info every time. I know my username, password, ect. Even after resetting the info, this app never lets me in. I don't know what it's problem is, but it's wrong.",
Nice to have more than the standard 7 minute interaction with the Dr's office. Nice to have test results available for review and comparison. The only issue I have is I would like to have the ability to send pdf files to the Dr when he needs info that is pertinent to my care.,
Ad always prompt and courteous. And Dr. Pullen is the best 👌🏾,
very easy to use and very informative,
"This app allows me to view any and all test results from anything like blood work to MRI i have done that doctors do not take time to talk about. I had to have major spinal operation last week and because of this app i was able to read my own MRI, CT and Xray scan in order to look up on line and know excatly what was going on with me.",
"I'm so happy this app exists! It's so much more convenient. You can make appointments, cancel appointments, send messages to your doctor's! And it's super easy to navigate",
"MyChart is way easy to use and I can find all my info - meds, visits, notes from completed visits and have the ability to message my doctor, etc. at any time in the comfort of my home. I use it constantly.",
"when it works, I like it. But 90% of the time, i get an error msg saying the app cannot connect to the server. Tried un- an re-installing to no avail.",
"App is very helpful to communicate with physicians and to store test results, prescriptions, office visit summaries, etc. However your provider(s) may not be in their network. The fingerprint sign on does not work for me. Otherwise 5 stars.",
I had use it before but when you have a phone that can't store enough storage on it. So I've to delete it. But I decided to try once again and it downloaded. I thought it had a callander so I could add my appointments. I have two appointments one in April and one in June. How can I add these appointments so you know about my appointments?,
"I love being able to message my doctor's office with non-urgent medical questions, especially for my children. Finding results is easy. It's been great for both inpatient and outpatient encounters. I highly recommend.",
"It's so great to be able to set appointments, see test results, refill prescriptions, and message your medical doctor all at the quick tap of a button. All while at home.",
Good program . - had an issue ordering meds once as it took 2 weeks and me sending a message to get my order processed. No option to send reminder or find out why order was delayed. Sometimes the doctors take there time putting informatoin in Overall the program is well designed and easy to use.,
"Works fine sometimes, but often errors with ""an error occurred on the server"". Unable to complete many tasks, have to do it from a PC.",
"I appreciate MyChart and the ability I have when accessing my many appointments and medical services. The access to my medical records is wonderful considering I am battling cancer and want to keep up with everything. This is a vital tool for anyone whom has several medical appointments at different offices. MyChart allows me to add my appointments right to my calendar in my phone. I get my test results, CT scan results, anything right on my MyChart.-Susanna Hull",
Excellent App..don't have to wait long for results,
How about a button to click through and get directions to a doctor's office from your reminder. That would be cool. And a print and/or share option in the test results dialog.... And any other areas that house documents pertaining to one's health records.,
"Cumbersome and often illogical sequence/counterintuitive. Mychart, and medical companies that use it, is probably too big to get rid of it. Then create a system that is geared to the consumer or patient. Not to the medical professionals!",
"I have to say, it is a good App my records are in one place, i can communicate with my Physicians. Ask questions, Get responses!! Whoo hoo!!Request refills, see my results and Dr's notes right on the platform. Appt reminders, and who was the attending in a emergency room, or Urgent Care. Also look back at Lab results over the years. Very much a part of my keeping up with my care.",
"Never loads. I call and I'm on hold for 15 minutes. It tells me to use this app. The app keeps telling me an error has occurred. Can't send, cancel or scheduled messages or appointments.",
"Slow, slow, slow, and your app does not let a person put in the incorrect info not putting in the info. It cuts you off and tells you to put put something in that an authentic It's taken me 2 hrs to just get this in here just right",
There are some test results that tell me I cannot open in the app and that I need to download them. When I try to open them in my downloaded files it tells me there are no files. I do like the app for messaging quick questions to the physicians.,
"Data is frequently wrong! Not good when it's critical to your health. Hard to correct. No way to see sent messages, only received ones. No way to remind myself what I've told my doctor via the app. Surprisingly crude for an app from the largest health data records company.",
"Very helpful and resourceful, let's me know when I have an appointment and when my tests have come back, I can even write the doctor if I have concerns. Great platform and easy to navigate.",
Easy to make appointments and cancel and reschedule,
"It was okay. Now I do not get the summary after each visit that has the doctor's write up on the visit. Just shows vitals, medicines taking and general info about things that affect people in general. That might affect you. I use to get the notes my doctor makes about what we discussed and possible solutions. It does good on future appointments and testing. Gives test results that I don't understand. What happened to the way it was, e en a couple of months ago?",
"I have always loved the convenience of this app. I was astounded when I was recently hospitalized that this app automatically converted into an inpatient app. It told me who my nurse was each shift, I got all my tests results instantly, and it even showed me when my meds and tests were scheduled.",
This app has saved me so many times especially if I forget to write down appointments. I can see all my test results and don't have to wait days or a week to find them or from my OB/GYN. I've even asked questions and within 24 hours either my doctor or the nurses would answer me back. 5 stars for sure !!,
This app has made managing my Healthcare so easy. It is well though out and it is amazing how quickly results are available to view. Communicating with my providers is simple and I can do it from home.,
"The MyChart application is the best thing since sliced bread. 24/7 access to my medical records, billing, testing, and messaging makes managing my healthcare a breeze. You can request appointments, view doctors' notes from previous appointments, and view test results and imaging. If you are a patient of USF or TGH, this is a must-have application.",
"It is so wonderful & convenient to use MyChart. I like being able to see results from tests and dr notes on my visit. Also like to be able to leave messages for the dr, make appts. & see when I am due for tests.",
Since I can no longer drive and considering the risk of covid it is a blessing to be able to have video visits. And since some of my doctors are an hour or more away I am also saving on the cost of gas. Not to mention that I am able to go in at any time and review the notes from our discussions. At 67 I sometimes have problems remembering everything that we discussed. Very convenient. I don't spend hours on the road or sitting in waiting rooms. Love it !,
Works great for me! The only thing I don't like is I cannot pull up all my providers. I have some that I don't see (spine neurosurgeon and orthopedic doctor) super often; but they are still my providers and I would like to be able to access my files from them. They are both Kadlec providers.,
"My Dr went to jail last October.... I was waiting for results of many tests. I didn't have a provider for 5 months, so I had no results. Thanks to this app, I was able to find serious medical conditions. I now have a provider that can access my chart. Thank you Bunches!!!",
MyChart helps me remember my appointments and I can the information I need about my health. I can also see my test results when I need to see them. It keeps me on track with my health needs. It's the best app ever. Love it.,
"Cancelling a scheduled appointment does not work for me. When I click Cancel Appt, it pop up a window with the options of NOT NOW and PLACE CALL. I had to wait for 45 minutes to speak to a real person to cancel it finally.",
"I use this app for my medical appointments at UCLH and it works well and does the job. I gave it five stars as it does the job. Can't complain about it as it does all that I need (seeing results, reading letters and displaying appointment times plus sending it to my calendar).",
"Ok, so this happens to me all the freakin time....Once I get the hang of the current application, y'all update to something that is thought to be better, better for who? I'm not sure considering I'm constantly lost over and over again. Stop changing things. I do enjoy MyChart other than the above statement.",
"I can't get into my app, because it says I need the new version. It's been several days, and it's still downloading! I sent off a message, to tech support, 4 days ago. I still haven't heard back. I have a message, from my dr., regarding a blood test-- but I can't get it!",
Extremely satisfied with MyChart it's amazing all in one place and easy to access. I recommend all doctors to get this app to make it easy for pacients to access their record. I love it !,
"Garbage, can't even send a message. Don't know why my medical provider decided this was ever a good idea, I used to be able to send her messages directly, and now it's not even an option on here. Am extremely frustrated with the entire process and new set up.",
"I found this app NOT user friendly. My Doctor asked me to use it to communicate with him, sounds good but there is some sort of glitch as to how that is suppose work. Make an appointment he says, it tells me I am not in their system, wrong again. I am and my Doctor is. Medicine renewals, Doctor says use MyChart, won't let me get past my list of meds. What a deal. Ok now I should see a psychiatrist for anger management, but it won't let me ask for a referral. Go figure.",
"When receiving new bill amounts it would be nice to see an itemized reason instead of just an amount. I want to know why I am paying $800. I have to log into MyChart's website to do that, it would be great to have this app supply this functionality as well.",
Like MyChart but not MyChart app! I don't think this app is very user friendly. It does have some good functions to it but to get messages to & from my daughter's dr is difficult on the app. Everything is easier using MyChart on my computer vs the app! 100%,
"I'm sure in time it will improve. I love having this level of access to my health records! This app is clearly designed by amature(s). The app crashed if your authentication token has expired.🙄. Come on Epic, get your $#!t together. Software is supposed to be your business.",
"Grateful for this very informative & useful tool to stay in touch with my doctors during these difficult & complicated times. Everything one needs right at your fingertips, just one click away.",
"The app is an amazing tool, but I also think it depends on your doctors. I myself have an amazing team of doctors who utilize the app for their patients in an extremely awesome way.",
"I love using this app! I can message my doctor about any questions or concerns I have with quick response times, refill prescriptions and schedule appointments all in the app! Very convenient and easy to use.",
I enjoy this app. It has been very helpful finding out information early about my health.,
I like this app cause I can reach my drs. When I need to,
I love this app. Really help me to understand and keep track of my health.,
Easy to understand 😌,
"Easy to understand, if on yellow you know something 💛 wrong",
"This app has no usable back button, it keeps telling me it lost info and crashes, I have to close and restart just to get back to main menu. Main website on PC also does this.",
App won't let me log into mychart account. I have called my provider and reset my password. I can log into my account via Chrome web browser but I can't use the app? Says account diabled??? Provider says I am active. Everything looks good on there end.. I was using this app about a month ago. Now I can't even log on?,
Best app on my phone. Get all my test results fast. Dr appts. Listed. All information is readily available. Fast and easy to use. Very friendly app. Good job in its thoroughness and efficiency.,
Constant issues Doesn't remember user one time. Can't communicate with server another time. Finger print reader failure (app) Just can't count on this working... Truly frustrating.,
"This communication portal with my health care providers is super, and allows me to feel that I have 24/7 access to my providers without having to drive to the clinic for each need. I especially like it that I can attach photos of wounds, rashes, or swelling to my messages, for physician reference.",
"Great, easy to use",
"Easy to use, all my information is accessible to me.",
"Horrible app Horrible advice and direction on what i needed to do to get my test results. I did the drive thru covid test, cvs never sent me a link to this bs app. It's been going on 4 days now with no test results. My job is on the line with them. Luckily I got another appointment with MD Now, I will get results in two days. Cvs and minute clinic is a disgrace.",
"Ok experience. Would like for Messages to show a sent folder, so that patients can keep track of their communications to their medical providers, instead of just the messages they receive from them. Would also like to see medical notes from providers from office visits.",
"Very good. Gets a little glitchy when writing a message and can wipe it out if you make a mistake. Try writing message first in a memo app, Word doc or similar and then copy and paste into MyChart message.",
"The application Menu is somewhat confusing. It is difficult to moving around in it, although making and canceling appiontment is very easy, which why I gave it three stars.",
Thank you my chart Great Benefit to my health care!!!,
Very accessable and easy to see your upcoming appointments,
"Almost. Functional app w/ loads of info. Wish they would improve the UI and more importantly, LET THE PATIENT TAKE NOTES OF THEIR OWN. 🙃 Even if just a text section to write in & save. Please let me do this in one place. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾",
"This app allows me to complete forms, view lab results, schedule/reschedule appointments refilling prescritiptions therefore making it easier and much quicker than having to make call after call. I can use this app for all of my medical needs as all of my health providers use MY CHART. Great tool Rolo",
"Always up to Date imfomation , very easy to use . I am so Thankful all my Health imfomation, whenever I need it ! Thanks for always being so helpful !",
"Site only shows a very old Android phone which was destroyed. I now have an I-13 You can see I finally got to post.which I want to put the app into. As I type this information, never allows me to SUBMIT. I have used nearly 200 of the 500 site shows as maximum. The submit is still no highlighted not allowing me to proceed.",
"Unlike some folks, I have found this app to be extremely useful and wondered why it took me so long to start using it. I was a bit stymied for a few days figuring out how to download the latest update. App was not showing up in the Play store list.",
Easy to use and keeps you upto date,
"I have installed but every time I go to sign up and then click for the ""sign up form"" to get my activation number.. the app just spins .. it does nothing. I had high hopes but if I can't even get started, it's just another useless app",
This app makes it very easy for me to see when my next appointment is as well as check-in,
This app is a very handy way to keep track of my medical care. I like the ability to see my test results. The one issue I have with this app is that it is not possible to attach pdf files to messages to my doctor. I would like to be able to send my blood pressure readings to my doctor prior to visits.,
Love being able to see charts and test results before going back to Dr to discuss it,
"MyChart App makes it so easy to get results and faster. The app makes it easier to set up appointments, get medicine refilled and just to ask any Questions you need answered. I also love the video appointments.",
So easy to use and love the fact that I have access to my entire record.,
"I linked my main doctors, place where I have MRI & X-rays done, and hospital I go for Emergency treatments (also received Covid shots there). Makes it very easy to have all results in one place, that I can show to all my doctors. I'm going to check if my local pharmacy is available (received flu, shingles, tetanus & Covid Booster there). That would have ALL my records in one place. VERY useful & time saving app! Request prescriptions, ask doctors questions, see results of lab tests and x-rays!",
The My Chart is a blessing. I'm able to communicate with my doctor's without having to hold on the phone or have someone telling me what they think the doctor may or may not say or if they're available or not. The response to your messages are quick and so are the refills for medications. Best thing ever..... They even respond to any questions or concerns you have in a very timely manner. 6 plus stats...,
More often than not server errors occur and I get message to retry later,
This is a frustrating joke! I Started last night trying to establish an account. Still at it this morning. It just gets a a loop asking me to open an account! I've reset my password four times with no luck. No phone number to get help,
Easy to use! And as someone with short term memory loss I love that it helps keep track of EVERYTHING in one place!!! It even puts reminders in my calendar for me with out me have to do it!!!!,
My Chart is very helpful with all of my medical information as it's a one-stop shopping app. Very helpful with the appointment reminders as well since sometimes we may forget them.,
"When logging in, I need to use the Dutch DigId. When I logged in I get redirected back to the app but this fails when I have DuckDuckGo as default browser. If I switch to Google Chrome it works fine. In my opinion my default webbrowser should not impact the workings of a native mobile app.",
MyChart is a great app. It's a great aid to help you keep track of your Healthcare reports & be able to easily contact your providers when needed. I would recommend the app to any patients.,
Very helpful app. I like that I can make an appointment within the app and can view blood test results in there as well. It's easy to send a message to my doctor's office which is helpful as well.,
"Terrible. Upcoming Appointments becoming Past Appointments when they haven't even occurred, being unable to update my insurance until before the appointment and then not updating properly + billed without insurance. Cannot talk to humans. Frustrated entirely with American health industry, all a profit scheme with terrible service.",
My chart has worked for me it is a easy way to stay on top of your health and stay connected with your doctor's it's a tool that helps the patient and doctors stay linked I have no complaints and hope that they keep this app up and running thank u I recommend using this app,
Very easy to navigate. All my medical history right at my fingertips. Easily get ahold of my health care providers thru my chart. Renew medication thru the app.test results thru the app. It's great!,
"Very user-friendly and thorough, it contains a wealth of information. It allows you to ask questions and contact your doctors without having to search endlessly for contact info. I can also view x-rays and scans. Awesome patient portal!",
"Best app, it's amazing that I have access to my whole family's info, also being in contact with our providers, it is easy to use, with all options I can think of, no limitation on access, it is simply the best😍😍😍",
"Lacking in flexibility to view beyond in Hospital care & testing. Even research info cannot be seen, rendering it useless for any consideration for trials, etc.] Works well if only looking at in-Hospital service / treatment. Unable to bring my records from various physicians together to form a common comprehensive medical records repository and view. - thought it was the POINT of MyCharts - it's not! DOES NOT WORK FOR THAT! Even the simple card printout of your meds - does not work!",
"My chart worked great uhtil it updated. Now it will not let me into the video visit. It keeps directing me to to E Visit and I cannot get rid of this change. I am not going to fill out the personal data for an app I do not want, did it change because people are able to go to a few visits and yoy now want everyone to pay $35.00? Fix it so I can have Video visits again, which it what I signed uo for. This is to important to ignore.",
"Completely useless, I need access to Covid19 test results so I can share them with boss and go back to work, but the app doesn't allow me to screenshot my own info, none of which is sensitive, its only my name and a confirmation number. -My Response To Developer: That didn't work either.",
"Being able to schedule appointments and send messages back and forth with your actual care team, without having to make a single phone call, is fantastic. No waiting on hold, no ""let me transfer you"". I also like having access to the ""notes"" of my visits.",
Very easy to use and you get all of your test results,
"COVID 19 immunization info not available offline, requires data connection despite activation without login. Not useful feature if you are in Europe and need to show the vaccination when entering a restaurant. Screenshot feature is also inactivated as a possible workaround.",
MyChart has made it much easier to keep track of my appointments and medications.,
It's easy and understandable I love it has great features,
"It can be very confusing, now that you center well it even worse. I get notification constantly some of which are not needed. They the KISS method. Keep It Simple Stupid.",
"I love this app, much better than the IHC my health+ the only thing I don't like it you can't copy and paste, there are no explanations for what a test means, or why it was given, and I as the patient can not edit some of the information that is errornious. Other than that, 2 👍👍",
"Complex but useful, just not user friendly",
Cannot verify device so can't access records. Have tried for over 30 minutes to receive code via email but nothing. (Has worked before in browser but neither is working today. Not in junk mail.) Also nowhere to submit trouble ticket in case of this type of issue.,
"Great app, very helpful & there are new features often",
Ever since I started using MyChart I've learned so much about my health conditions.,
Not letting me in my account. Very poor application process.,
"You'll die using this app! The one GIANT problem is that every health care provider uses a different system or none at all. My Chart has a way to link to a few, mine wasn't listed. I refuse to sign up for all these because I'd have 50+ health provider apps by now! I had some and the doctor's office didn't seem to use it either! This is a nightmare for the patient, let alone an elderly patient. Either get together and figure out one app that everyone uses or just forget it. It is just a much more complicated way of trying to connect with your ONE doctor. Then you get to repeat this for each healthcare provider you see. It's not super simple to use and plan on spending quite a bit of time learning it. It would be easier if I could just use antiquated email my doctor's office. This seems to be set up so patients can start doing some administrative work for the providers because it's so chaotic. It would have potential, but this isn't going to work in the USA's current health care system. Most older people who see several doctors won't be able to use this. Ask yourself, will I be able to do this when I'm 80 or 90? After searching for how to give me proxy to my elderly mother's healthcare, I had to contact Epic through their corporate website. There is no link to tech support from Epic anywhere. Ends up I have to create another My Chart account for myself under my Mother's healthcare provider. All-in-all, not even close to being ready for prime time. Probably an impossibility in our fragmented health care system. I could have 50 My Chart accounts just trying to manage mine and my Mother's care. Information is never correct in this system for my 98 year old mother! It's better than nothing, but we are so far away from having any decent system. Anyone outside the ""Prohealth Care"" system that she sees, the info isn't put in her My Chart, so it's not even accurate for the doctors. Missing meds and melanoma diagnosis. YIKES! And I can't seem to accept an invitation. Too time-consuming to even try and use. Plus I have my own My Chart in another State that is significantly different to use. Also, a pita to keep having to click ""load More"" when trying to go back and read something from 2019. This needs so many, many, many improvements to really be useful. Do NOT rely on this for your health care! There are also very stupid mistakes in the design like not removing the ""Dr."" or ""nurse"" when sorting names of doctors. This is the ONLY ""Filter"", you can't sort by health issue or date or anything else. Is Epic doing ANY testing of this app/system? It's been around a long time and should be much better by now. It is not notifying me by email when I have a message!?! Yes, I have it set to email! ALSO, no way to contact EPIC when it doesn't work. The doctor's offices don't know. This is really, really bad and very scary that my 98 year Mother's life depends on this junk. Now finding medical errors in my My Chart! Messages show ME, not who I'm contacting. Incredible how poorly designed this is. It is really UNUSABLE for anyone with several health issues like EVERY OLD person out there! I cannot reply to a doctor through the broken messages system. I just cannot believe this junk is out there for healthcare! You'll die here! Update 1/11/2022: Response from My Chart...""You may experience a delayed response due to the recent increase in questions during the ongoing pandemic. If you have an appointment coming up within the next few days or a similar urgent request, please contact your physician’s office. "" What a useless piece of garbage. Also called My Chart support for Prohealth and basically was just told to call the doctors because My Chart doesn't work.",
This is the best app. ever. I can see up coming appointment. The report is often completed before I leave the doctor's office. I can see for myself my blood work before the doctor. No only that they are explained to me. Broke down so I can understand them. Love this app.,
"MyChart is the best and very helpful....Very impressive,have access to all my medical records. When you can't get through on the the telephone you can leave messages and they always respond. I can schedule appointments it makes everything much more convenient",
The only good thing is ability to email doctor. Viewing test results is ok but I cannot print them to show other providers. I cannot get in touch with technical team . All I get are incorrect pre written answers and forms asking for paper copies do not go through.,
"I use this app all the time. Great integration of all my medical records, easy to get in touch with my clinicians. Easy to make and change appointments. I also use it as my vaccine card.",
Easy to use and helpful when needing appointments,
They give notices that are meaningless . Like I would probably get my lab results before I was contacted by The physician but I haven't had a lab report reported on here since 2019. So why bother with lab results if they're not going to post them.,
"Excellent app! Easy to use, extremely well integrated to both current medical services and past. Very convenient, making my life easier to plan and coordinate!",
I love this app. Keeping up with my visits to the hospital and doctors appointments are very easy. I wish that all medical offices in our county used this so that we could have full access to our medical history and easily transfer information.,
Having a problem with loging into your link.,
"Every few minutes it logs me out and notes or responses I'm entering are deleted. Very frustrating. Also, no appar way to upload test results that labs have failed to upload.",
"I like that I can see test results, visit results etc",
It's easy to understand and it gives me options to check my billing and appointments. I like te option to send my physician messages that are not emergent. All in all a great app.,
The app takes you from the app & opens in a web browser without warning you. I don't like that. It should warn you because it's also automatically logging you into your account.,
"Love MyChart. I have no problem with using it to access my messages, test results, appointments. This is a great app! For me to give anything 5 stars is a rare thing because I believe nothing on this earth is perfect but MyChart is really close!",
"Outstanding app, very well made very intuitive easy to navigate simply outstanding. I usually do not even rate apps but I had to read this one because it was so well put together",
"Too confusing. Drs. Use med terms not lay English. Sometimes inaccurate appt. Dates. Drs. Don't seem to read & don't conctact patient even when further testing or new medication or appts. needed based on new tests. Can't tell if antone even read your questions, let alone answered. Very disappointing.",
This app provides me with all the tools to stay up to date. Appointments are easy to set and sharing my results from those appointments are as easy as clicking a button.,
"Absolutely essential! I am thankful beyond measure this app exists, it allows me complete access to all appointments, tests & results as well as the ability to share if I choose to. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
"If you fix this one little thing I'll come back and give it five stars, I'm only giving it one to get your attention because I think this is really important. Make it so when you send a message to your doctor, you can see the message that you sent, right now the only way to see a message that you sent, is if someone replies to your original message, otherwise you don't even know if it was sent, there's no indication that I can see. If you fix that, this thing is brilliant!",
Used to be great but it's really ridiculous. I just had my account deactivated after using it for 5 years because I don't have my social security number linked. I use the app to message my doctor and request refills on meds. They just deactivated it because I didn't have my social security linked. I called and the guy said I should be good to use it but it says max attempts allowed. Stupid that I have to have my SS linked when it's already been compromised once. Guess I'll ditch the app now.,
"Typical medical implementation...screwed up. Scheduling doesn't work. Doesn't integrate with other Epic providers to share info fully. COVID vaccines aren't shared so other Epic providers are pinging me to schedule boosters, while they have been received. Can't transfer vaccinated status to other electronic passports. Doctors think the most complicated systems are in the human body. Question- how much has the body actually changed since med school?",
"When I moved to south jersey and had to find all new doctors it became stressful. Once I started with appointments with my new physicians and started using my chart , the stress went away. The fact that I can have my health history at my finger tips is awesome. Great app.",
"There should be set times. For example, recently, there was no way to know when appointments were because, l had no way of when to expect the provider. All communication failed!Just so happen, they lucked out!",
I really don't like the change of layout at all! I can't easily find and schedule an appointment with a doctor I have seen before! Instead it shows me doctors that I don't want to make a visit with! I am very irritated and frustrated!,
"This app does a lot of things well, however if you don't agree with a response from the clinic or you need to clarify something, they don't allow you to respond. It says ""responses are not allowed to this message."" I got a response from a staff member stating I'd have to wait until my doctor returned in a week, when the on call MD intervened, responded and took care of the problem. I also tried to make a video appt through the app and got a clinic appt. Can't respond. I'm not happy this.",
"I am disappointed, and frustrated with this app and how difficult it is to get signed up. Literally over 16 hours with tech's, waiting for technicians and had to finally drive to meet with somebody who STILL couldn't help. Why release this?? Technicians say ABSOLUTELY not Android friendly. Do you get a kick back from Apple?,",
Love it. It reminds me when I have appointments and I can review my visits.,
"App has worked ok for most part. However, I keep getting notices to update my contact information. When I check the information it is correct, but notice continues. App will not send me reminders of my appointments (maybe related?).",
Keeps you completely informed the second it happens.,
"This app used to be great and so easy to find things, since up grade it takes me forever to find what I want.... and not all information is in the portal. The important things are missing like Dr follow up notes. They should put into on their finding, not just tell me my medication list... I truly hate this app.",
"Can't dismiss notifications easily or at all. Checked on the notification about updating my contact info and it tells me to go to the website and keeps the notification. Nothing to change in contact info, so why do I need to go to the website",
So far I'll have no problem with getting into the app.only One thing getting the Dang! Password setup crazy codes messup,
"So glad to have the MyChart app. It's a 1-stop shop for me with scheduling, followup, test results and notes all in one place. Makes communicating with my docs so much easier.",
Honestly wasn't expecting this app to be as good as it is. I can get all kinds of information like test results and stuff quickly and easily. It's also nice to schedule stuff like appointments with my primary.,
Super great to see all test results same time as Dr and with the notes included. Also great for seeing when Appts are or to schedule one. Can send messages to Dr for questions or renew prescriptions. A valuable tool for keeping track of one health. And can link all Dr and hospitals to one log in.,
I want to be constructive with my criticism but I just can't. This app is a joke. I have a degree in Information Systems and still find it difficult to navigate this app. The user interface is just plain awful. With how much money we pay for healthcare in this country you would think we'd be able to fund the development of a halfway decent app... But I guess not.,
App just is very difficult to use. Not every dr even uses this program. Some information is there for other drs to see and some information is not. It is still very hard for people with any kind of memory impairment to be able to go to a dr appointment and be confident that the dr has all the necessary information. Even an emergency room dr!!,
"Lame, it works until you need your username. I had a pin set up never used my username, I try to recover it with my e mail and it never works. So then you have to call during business hours and go through their steps to recover it on the phone. Not worth the effort for a mild convenience, fix your recovery to where I don't have to sit on hold for an hour.",
"Until a couple months ago the app worked great. Now, I can't send messages to my doctor nor can I see results from 2/20 forward. Without those 2 things, it's pretty useless",
"Its amazing. I love it for my kids. It's a little more difficult for an adult woman to make appointments on though, & I think there should be an option to message a front desk worker as well, sometimes there are questions needed for them & literally no one answers the phone for over 30 mins anytime you call the office on Fairchild in Danville. & it keeps telling me to verify my phone number & email, but does not send me a code at all for me to do so.",
Really love the app. I see my appointments as soon as I make them.,
Considering that it is a medical app there should be a place for the patient to give special instructions to the medical providers. You know something like a bio that tells a little bit about what the patient wants and needs. And we should be able to customize the home screen for the patient not for the doctors we should be able to choose what is important to us to see when we first open up the app.,
"Easy to use. Much better than when they first introducede to the app. Easy interface. Cancel and request appointments online. Check, records it's great.",
"Love some of the functionality, however for what it is the fact that it's so incredibly inept at handling the teen/parent logistics. I can't see their meds to refill and they can't refill from theirs. He even has shared his record with me and still no ability. Because of covid and they are overwhelmed and it's really awful to have to call 4A refill. But if you go to the pharmacy and you ask for refill they ask you to requested from your doctor. It's ridiculous.",
"My complaint has to do with the medicine refill part of this app. Epic is really bad about that. I have so many problems with refilling my medications. I'm glad I retired last year before the Epic software was introduced. I've heard nothing but bad reviews about it from Nurses that still work in the OR, Pharmacy, Surgeons etc. Useless software.",
"Very useful and convenient. Easy way to communicate with your doctors. Schedule, cancel and/or reschedule appointments. Use this app frequently. Very satisfied.",
"I need an easier way to switch between family members. Logging out and signing on with another account is cumbersome. The app should store the accounts for all people you need to manage. Do that and you'll get my 5. Other than that, the app is very good.",
My Chart worked but not well. Then it was fixed making it even worse. It's pretty worthless right now. Very difficult to navigate as well. Not good.,
I love it because I can keep track of mine and my husband doctor appointment and any scheduling that we have,
Very user friendly. I like that I am notified when any test results are in without having to wait around for a phone call or chase for answers. Appointments can be scheduled and cancelled with ease!,
"No support whatsoever. They handle your information by giving it to everyone causing so many possibilities of your info being stolen but we're forced to use it to get records now. Hope they never get breached, considering it's sign in on a company by company basis means our info is in more places with more vulnerabiliies.",
I tried to download this app on my android and I'd get finished loading my information then it would kick me back to start all over again. This would happen as I was trying to set up a new account. Very frustrating. Won't be using it again.,
Overall my experience has been positive with the exception of not being able to see the Absent appointments On my chart. There recently was a mistake made with my child's appointment settings and we were unaware that we were missing appointments. We were not notified untill we had to sign an appointment contract. Now for 6 months we will be living in fear of loosing his doctor that we love. I feel if this was brought to our attention earlier it could have been fixed.,
Never can sign in without resetting password. I’m really tired of this app. It’s unnecessary stress to get the information I need. It’s like having to take a cross town bus just to pick up a small package!,
"Love this app. Being someone that has about 5 doctors' appts a month, this app has simplified organizing my calendar and made it almost impossible for me to forget anything. Love the e-checkin feature and the notes section that becomes available after a visit.",
"Great way to interface with their services and to contact your care team. You can also view test results and other items. The best is contact with your care team since John's Hopkins phone system is terrible, you can never reach a care team member from phone.",
"I love this app, it will be a 5 star, but now, I did the upgrade and now is not even working.. I have 2 messages from my doctor and I can't even see them. I have tried everything, and nothing.. it looks like is loading all the time..",
"I've spent time on the phone, I have spent time redoing the password over and over and over, and yet I still can't login even though I switched organizations and made sure that it is 4 Minute Clinic for CVS. I am frustrated beyond belief. What makes it worse is there's no other option than this to find out the information for the test that I recently took. I am at my wit's end",
It is the best makes everything easy,
It's some what easy to use you should be able to email a doctor or doctors on here easier,
"Great to get your medical information when at other doctor offices. No need to call, or fax. Just log in!",
"This is my new Best Friend. Great app. I'm sickly and stay close to my doctor's twitch this app. Schedules plans. Appointment keeping. Messages with list of all doctor's you see as contacts Med list and refill request option. All automatically kept. Directions, address, number, Someone stop me. Get the App. Nurses.",
"Apparently they had an update. But they never BETA tested it. Androids phones can not log in. If you do find the work around, you will need to keep changing your password Evertime you want to log in !!!! Good job",
"This is a very informative app. It has all your information at the tip of your finger. It has mine since 2014. Only downside, it doesn't explain what your medications are used for. Example: why am I taking Keppra? Or what is the furosimide being used for. Other than that, it's as close to perfect as it can get. My recommendation: go download MyChart. Today.",
A wonderful app Ive been using it for a while now. My grandson and daughter's information is visible to me for making appointments etc. I can communicate with my doctors through the app as well. I think its very convenient. Easy to use too.,
"I hate this update!!! The old version of MyChart was way better. Now with this new version, I feel less connected with my doctors and my health has declined. This update made me develop a crystal meth addiction and feeling the desire to 🤯🔫. Thanks for nothing 🖕",
"I love this app. It's amazing to help keep track of my appointments, messages and medications. I love the ease of adding individuals to my chart so I can see their appointments as well.",
Terrible administrative tasks like paying a bill. I had 2 separate charges and the first worked perfectly the second wants my payment method which is already saved and won't accept a resubmission. Absolutely frustrating.,
I love how easy it makes doctor visits with kids,
"This app no longer works. Rebooted phone, Uninstalled/Reinstalled, and it still errors out. The error states that I have no network connection established. I've tried on wifi and off.",
This app really keeps me in the loop and the best I've used since my cancer diagnosis 5 years ago. But it also helps that the STAFF stay current and up to date on information that seems to be monitored at all times. Loving the app but also the people qhi make it happen everyday. Thank you to all of you!!,
"I absolutely love this APP and the fact that all of my Health information is on it..I only a few slight issues with it tho-1st.) Losing my information if my phone gets lost or left somewhere, 2nd.) Companies won't and don't accept anything from the APP cuz it's not printed out on paper for them to put in a employee's work file.",
"slow. wants to upgrade to another app? scheduling an appointment is NOT CONVENIENT at all. i can call and get ut done without any hazzles. whrn u get an appointment, it asks to add to calendar. well it buffered 20mins ahead of appointment, Why? I always managed to get 10mins before appt. now im 30mins ahead. STUPID App.",
Good does what it needs. Need to be able to do landscap mode for video as well and remove the splits camera on virtual meeting . Don't need to see myself outside of an optional popup,
"works great. however I would like to receive ALL my records when I download them,or just view them online.Other than that works just fine I'm able to sign myself in at my Dr. visit before I ever arrive which seems to have sped up my wait time.Yesterday for instance,my wife used her account to log us in and it only took 1.5 hr for the total visits.So yea,I would highly recommended for all to have. Thanks.",
App works well but billing section is no good. I can never find a proper bill to print for my reimbursement. I call and leave voicemail and comments in my chart for billing and never get a response. So this app and your communication is very poor.,
Im familar with my chart.. however im also familiar with an EASTER EGG and that if you have just one on your phone wich forvsom reason google is being more than funny with all the outdated Samsung blotware those eggs come with. The only thing you can do is back up to a resore point and factory reset your device so that your not signed into a session as an ftp client with a bunch of certificates from a shady web implementation (usually Android AUTO) Thank you Google for defending your produc,
"GONE are the days that only the Dr & some office staff were privy to what's going on with well...YOU! And only you can give permission for anyone else to see it ,( unless the courts decide diff..) You can set appointments, leave msgs for medical staff, have access to past appts and diagnoses, request copies of x-rays. Scans, Medical records....etc. So cool!",
I really like getting my results without having to bug anyone. I can ask question through messages and make appointments. It's great.,
Don't know if it's the hospital or this app but it doesn't save me any time. I'm still having to check in at a desk and wait first come first serve. Waste of time if you ask me.,
"I use this system for medical update and appointments reminder. I love the feedback for sent messages to my doctors and it give me vital information of my health. The only problem i had with it was during the Pademic, my doctor didn,t follow up with my concerns.",
I like knowing all results and scans,
This really really helps me stay on track withy health.😉Thanks MyChart!,
"Great ,easy to use very easy to get medical results",
"Will not let me log in or create a new account. When I select ""forgot username"" or ""forgot password"" it just says that ""an error has occurred"". It won't let me do anything! I've missed an appointment already and can't get ahold of them via app or phone!",
"I had to give this app 5 stars! Im 48 not to old not to young. This app has come a long way. It just makes life easier in so many ways, it has everything you need for your healthcare. You can order your perscriptions, send messages to your doctor,",
"MyChart, is sn excellent portal. This app makes communication with my Physicans in regards to concerns about medical concerns and/or medications. As well as scheduling appointments. MyChart is easy to navigate and keep up with test results such as, laboratory, specialty testing and requesting medication refills. Sceduling payments and viewing ststements which helps me understand charges. With MyChart, I am able to share my medical information with other Doctor's not enrolled in MyChart.",
"Great concept, just crashes too much. I like the layout, especially compared to the AHN website. Every time I try to open my medication list, I'm logged out.",
"Unable to sign into app. Says ""there was a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" I have been trying to sign in all day and keep getting the same error message. I even changed my password thinking that would help. It didn't. I got the same message. What is going on with this app? I have never had this happen before! 😬😳",
Im learning it and it seems that it can be useful.,
"Great app but PLEASE, MAKE IT SO WHEN ENTERING THE PASSWORD, WE ARE ABLE TO CLICK THE EYE SO WE CAN ENSURE WE ARE TYPING THE CORRECT PASSWORD! US INVIDUALS WITH VISION PROBLEMS CAN REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS. GETTING LOCKED OUT AFTER 3 TRIES IS NOT ONLY AN INCONVENIENCE BUTALSO INFURIATING TO SAY THE LEAST! THANK YOU!! OTHER WISE, GREAT APP! Developer-I have shared this password issue with Geisinget countless times and their excuse is ""we are working on a fix"" ""we plan to implement this.yea right!",
I love having this App cause it keeps me updated on all my shots and appointments. I even get to review all my doctors visits and labs. It even makes it easier for other doctors to see what's going on with me and to see all the meds that I am on. MyChart is a great app.,
"Too many unnecessary messages. Check in on line not needed for ever PT appt. A message that you have an appt for the walk in you just registered for is not needed, just annoying. Important reports do not show up in the system.",
"Everything is so easy, and I'm paper free. No more wasting paper on printing out my appointments! This is huge.",
I didn't sign up for electronic bill. Requested paperbill and Customer service was suppose to send never got it. Previous payment arrangement never got applied right my account ended up being set to collections. The app is still asking me to go paperless.,
It's an awesome app to have easy to navigate.,
Very amazing and reliable for confidential matters. Reliable to use at all times without delay and all the contents of the messages is always fantastic.,
"App seems okay in general, but missing some basic features. As an example, the is no reply function for e-visits to actually converse with a provider.",
"Great,,keeps me updated on my appts...",
"Excellent resource, handy to have info all in one place. Quickly accessible Covid shot list without going thru login is great idea. Only complaint is my primary care Doc visits don't show up, specialist visits are all there.",
"App allows you to pay your bill, but does not give the option to change the credit card information for your account...so not very convenient if you still need to call someone!...",
"Definitely a great way to find all your medical information easily and effortlessly. From the list of your medications, Dr reports, appointments with real time notifications. I could go on and on. But its really the only medical application you need to keep all your medical in one place.",
I love MyChart it is so informative and also so user friendly. It makes keeping communication with my care team at MD Anderson easy. The only thing is it needs to add where you can contact the different clinics schedulers through email for appointment questions or such. Other then that items perfect.,
"Depends on your healthcare system. Every organization has their app set up differently, the one I use has a very nice and user friendly layout that works perfectly for me",
"I use MyChart because it's helpful. I check it for my appointments and stay updated on medications. I can go over my complete visitation as often as I like, in case I need to add something. I can also make and cancel any future appointments.",
The notification system needs some serious work. I have a handful of facilities / medical organizations and a handful of family members. I have to guess what facility the notification is from and for which family member. Or go through all of them until I find out which one sent the notification.,
After increasing swipe sensitivity works ok.,
"Excellent tool for appointment scheduling, provider communication, test results and about anything to do with your medical records. Very easy to use. Highly recommend!",
Everything is scattered and hard to find.,
MyChart is easy to navigate with little effort. Ive been using ecare messaging until MyChart was made available & replaced ecare. I probably had an advantage by learning the ins & outs of ecare prior to MyChart. None the less it is a great app with tons of information at my finger tips. I love MyChart.,
"I love this app!! Absolutely wonderful!! I am able to see all of my test results and exam information. I have access to urine and all my blood work. It gives me updates on overdue exam dates. And so much more!!! Great system!! Please give it a try, you will find out so much about your health.",
most recent version tells me the fingerprint log-in option has expired upon every attempt to log-in. It will redirect me to settings to turn it on but the same thing happens upon next log-in. please fix.,
"All went super smooth. Until.....I went on my computer to download on my computer and it stated that I had it on my cell already. Smart ass is correct. But, it wouldn't let me download on to the computer. Anyone have any idea on how to correct this? Thanks in advance!!",
"I have seen the error message, ""An error has occurred on the server - Please try later"" probably 500 times over the past few weeks. I have wasted a huge amount of time trying to access test results and communicate with my doctors. PLEASE FIX WHATEVER IS WRONG WITH THE D@MNED SERVER ALREADY!",
"Love the app, never have problems with it. Got it when my husband was in the hospital, got results back from test instead of having to wait, which helped by knowing what to expect then I knew what the doctor was talking about and was better able to have questions ready for doctor. Also easy to look at bill and pay. And appointment reminders.",
"I used to use this app regularly, but haven't been able to log in for almost a month. All it says whenever I try is ""There was a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later"". I can log in on a website fine, but the app is currently useless.",
Pretty simple to use application it's nice to have all your health information at hand specially if you need to you know check your vaccination status and show somebody or you need to see how long it's been since you had your tetanus shot for example. It is also incredibly helpful to have your results of blood work or whatever labs done before having to have another doctor's appointment. Plus it's nice to be able to have your STD/STI and HIV test results at hand whenever.,
"I love this app! I'm a nurse practitioner and I like to see the results of my tests posted here. Often a doctor will say everything is normal, but that's not always the case. Even subtle changes can mean something. It's also easy to send an email to your doctor and easy to schedule an appointment.",
So far so good. I was happy to send a message directly to my doctors to ask about prescription refills. Done easily without any hassle or waiting on the phone. Also always concerned about my health it's nice to see the results and doctors notes. I can read them and make more sense out of it than verbally in person. Thank you,
"I have been using ""My Chart"" since I changed to Duke. I don't think I have ever run into any problems using and understanding the app. I love that I have close access to all my medical information. Honestly, I would ve. been lost without it.",
Very easy to use and schedule appointments.,
"This site is very helpful,helps keep track of medical situations. Also should that medical mishap surface again I can tell the doctor when and what medicine they prescribed. I also email my doctor via the site and receive a response in a timely manner. I can also research medical terms on the site as well. This is a great help with keeping up with your medical health.",
I love the my chart app easy to use keeps you updated on everything with your physicians . I highly recommend getting the app you can even do e check ins for appointments so you don't have to do it when you get to your appointment.,
Always a great experience with Novant! Great communication with Physicians as well as setting appointments made easy lab results come in pretty fast sometimes before the doctor sees it and I can do almost anything I need on this app.,
Can't set it up and I'm waiting for the whole day just to find it out,
"If i could give more stars i definitely would give them a thousand. I love texas children's and I definitely love having mychart I makes contacting the doctor and having all my child's medical info at hand so easy. I don't know what I would do without the app or without texas children doctors, they have been so helpful with my child's medical problems.",
"Bugs bugs fix your app. What good is it if it has ""server connection"" issues when i need to communicate with my doctor. All this started after a update on 11-8 and has not worked for spit since",
Whenever I get a notice to look on My Chart it makes me smile because I know that I can be reached by my care team and find out test results and any other recommendations they may have for me. It makes it easy to communicate with my doctors. I can also make appointments and keep track of of them. All of my medical records are readily available for me to view.,
"I'm in my 30d and was using this app for regular doctor visits anyway. This year, out of the blue, I was diagnosed with stage iv cancer. This app has been a huge blessing keeping up with appointments across organizations and bills and everything else. I love the app.",
"This app is genius ! Not only can you get a clear read on charts from multiple facility's, it also has alot of additional mini apps to track or remind yourself regarding health and living. Seems pretty secure , web wise.",
I have to say i really like having this app it has helped me in so many ways without it life would be so much more difficult being homeless and living on the streets without it because of this app i have been able to stay in close contact with my health care team there are a few glitches but but app dont have a few of those thank you for creating this app,
The only thing I would change is that the labs reports for urine cultures I would like to see the actual lab report. Other than that the app is great. Like looking at my results as they come in. I like being able to send a message as well.,
"It's really relieving to know I have my health in the palm of my hand..it don't help my angrily much, though. Lol",
"MyChart is a very good tool to have if you are on daily meds that can run out at different times during the month. It's just easier to send a message than calling and possibly being out on hold then having to explain who u are and what your bday is...etc...etc. But, sometimes you can easily get lcarried away and forget that these messages are being sent to medical professionals and not your friends.",
"I love MyChart it's so convenient for talking with my doctor instead having to go into the office for everything so many things can easily be handled through MyChart, I can access and test results ask for refills, so many things can be taken care of, to me and my family stay healthy. Love it!",
"Update:It's getting easier to get hold of my Dr. Now than over the phone! Thank you. Since you ""streamlined"" your new app. It's not saving to my homescreen and I have to go to the play store just to open it. And I can't send a photo to my Dr. This app is no good.",
Makes navigation and planning of your appointments easy an allows u to E check-in days before your appointments to get information to doctors quickly and priop to appointmens making it take much less time standing in line and gives Dr. Foreknowledge of existing criteria to pinpoint necessary topics.,
"Appreciate the medical organization I now have at my fingertips. This makes it so much easier for everyone. Most of all, the days of filling out new patient forms by hand for every new doctor visit are gone. My only wish is to find out how to correct occasional erroneous information....",
I can't schedule an appointment through the app anymore. It gives me one option for a different kind of specific screening appointment but that's not what I want to schedule. Just let me schedule a normal doctor's visit.,
"I need notifications from it, so I want the phone to beep when a doctor or staff sends me a direct message, but I would strongly prefer that it allowed me to set detailed preferences - instead of waking me up all the time to remind me of an appt that is DAYS away, or tell me I have a new test result: stuff that can definitely wait 'til the next morning.",
"It's very helpful for healthcare, but I noticed there was a character limit on the password field - this makes me suspicious that they're storing passwords in plaintext, since otherwise it wouldn't matter.",
Very user-friendly.,
I have an appointment with Dr Brignol Wednesday May 31 tomorrow at 11:00am & I'm trying very hard to use my My chart app this minute but no responses I even took a photo on my living room wall but don't know where to send it😭😭😭,
"I'm downloading again because of multiple ""server error"" messages and ""try again later."" In 4 minutes it's only downloaded 9%...In 10 minutes, only 20%. At this rate it will take 50 minutes to completely download the app...Yep, half an hour and it's at 49%.",
Very easy to use and to find information,
"The app has started crashing completely when certain buttons are clicked, such as the billing button.",
"Love MyChart. Keeps my health care providers at my fingertips, 24/7. Negative feature: when Covid-19 info was loaded, at last update, MyChart dropped my medication list. I depended on it to reorder medications. It also gave me info on the dosage and strength. Please put it back on and give me access.",
Love it. It's so easy and much faster than waiting on a call back from the doctor.,
"I've been using it for over a year, the issue I had is if I've logged in to my mom's chart I get notifications for her but not know who it's for. It just comes up as MyChart Med, Message, ECT... At first I had no idea what was going on I thought the app was messing up",
"I love My Chart. It saves office staff from getting so many calls that can be answered online. I adore being able to contact my Doctors and ask a question or get prescription refilled. I love being able to access my tests that I have run, instead of putting in a call to the office or wait until my scheduled office call. I might add I can schedule. Reschedule my doctor's appointments. I think My Chart is the greatest app and link for both my husband and myself. Thanks",
"It's the best thing since sliced bread! I absolutely love being able to message my doctor and having all my medically related info at my fingertips! Recently, I moved out of state and this app helped me find a place to start my way into finding a new Dr. here. No one could ever replace Janae Brown, she has been a gift to me!!! Just hope I find someone who can even come close to filling her shoes. She is by far, the most outstanding physicians in my life history!!! Be well and happy!",
"Constantly forgets my password, biometrics work for a while, then stops. Once you sign in it's great. I'm so surprised and disappointed it's so terrible at the sign in. Could be a great app, but for now might be the worst app I use.",
"Love having all of my info in one place, being able to manage appointments, send messages to my doctors, and see health info all in one convenient easy-to-use app! Very happy!",
This app is the best way to communicate with your pcp and Drs office! I have had nothing short of amazing communication with my Dr and his staff! I receive emails directly from my Dr within the day and most times within the hour of sending him an email. I am able to attach pictures if needed and set appointments so easily. I'm extremely impressed with this app!,
"I've had no problems with mychart I've gotten results as when doctors told me I'd get them sometimes same day results sometimes the next day. I've had no bugs, never been logged out for no reason, never had problems with my fingerprint or putting in my password. Love mychart and I'll continue using it",
"Definitely makes things easier... faster test results, graphs, messaging doctor's, etc. I can look up anything in my chart at anytime. I love this app!!",
"Great app, extremely useful. Everything in one place.",
I love this app. I get test results in a few hours and a detailed report of what was done at doctor's office.,
Very easy dependable and user friendly app,
Awesome and very professional,
"Chart never seems to update. My mother has been in the hospital for 4 days, I've been trying to keep updated on her condition, but there has been nothing updated at all. Either the hospital isn't updating her chart, or this app is broken.",
"Great app, have every function needed to communicate with my Dr. Setting appointment, request refills, view test results and dr notes. It's also very stable with no crashes or usage of battery or asks for weird permissions.",
"I appreciate having access to my labs, tests results, medication information, appointment details, and health care reminders. The ability to review information, ask questions , request refills, and schedule care, at my convenience from anywhere, saves time and costs. It's a great app.",
"This app is so convenient. Most of my doctors are on this app and it makes it so simple and easy because all my information including my medications, appointments, allergies, and more is conveniently located in one place.",
I had some difficulties in the beginning but over time I've come to appreciate this app more and more. It is definitely a timesaver and convenient on many stages! There's nothing bad I could say about this app!,
I find this app is useful and works great you have all your hospital records at your convenience as well as appointments in your able to contact your doctor while you're messaging and get a response quicker than weaving the message with the secretary to give to the doctor so I say it's extremely useful for anyone that wants to keep track of their medical records or transfer their records to a new doctor,
"I have done the update but now I can't do anything with this app. Can't do the e check ins I can't do the questionaires i can't do the messaging or letters this thing is almost useless, and it's not like I has a back up route of service like going through your email or something.",
This is such a good app.. any thing I need to know is all right here in one app..,
"Upgrade is not an improvement. It feels like a cheap website with annoying reminders inserted like advertisements. The two step verification is not helpful, simply annoying.",
"My Chart is awesome as can bypass long auto phone lines for easy access to appts & reschedule. Easy to navigate. Only downside I have found is that though doctors can be identified easily, you sometimes get messages from nursing staff that do not identify what OFFICE OR DR they are affiliated with.",
Used to love this app and info available on it. However they have changed it multiple times and it gets harder and harder to use or access information. Keep getting errors plus you can no longer make dr appts on app and now trouble receiving test results. 😡😡😡,
Most of the time I find it's easier and quicker to get ahold of a care provider through MyChart. I usually get a reply within a few hours. Plus it's also handy as an added reminder in case I forget info.,
"The app is very easy to use and you have everything at your fingertips ie health records, appointments, lab results etc. Great app for keeping track of your health.",
Very easy to use and I love having all of my information available to me. The transparency in my experience with my provider through this app gives me peace of mind and relieves my anxiety about going to the doctor. Highly highly recommend!,
Wonderful experience and the staff was carrying and nice 🙂,
"This used to be a great app, but after the last update it sucks! I no longer get a list of upcoming appointments. That was the main reason for me using this. I have memory issues due to head trama. I NEED that feature back.",
I Love this app. All the information9 about me can be looked up at any time. Lab work done after work... It still shows the results as soon as they're completed. Thank You so much for the excellent app.!!!! 😁😁💖💖💖💖💖,
There are many aspects of this app that are fantastic such as scheduling an appointment and being able to access lab test results. I would like to see a place where we can add personal notes or talking points. So when I have my next appointment I can refer to my notes about certain questions or concerns I would like to talk about.,
"Seems there is no way to edit the information yourself. Maybe if you only used one facility it might work better, but using multiple facilities you should be able to input some information like COVID-19 tests or vaccinations independently.",
"This is a very welcome game changer for managing my health data and communicating with my medical providers. Excellent app and process! In the data driven, connected world we live in this should be available from every medical provider in the US for their patients, full stop.",
"This app is incredible. You can see upcoming appointments, get test results as soon as they are available and best of all you can message your doctor and have your questions answered very quickly. A very powerful, convenient tool to help manage your health-care.",
This App is easy to use and such a help to my getting the best care.,
Having trouble with video appointments really need to correct my medication issue had to miss my appointment because I wasn't able to sign in. Very frustrated. Other announcement very good as in keeping up with my appointments medication lab work etc.,
I love it. It tells me everything I need from my Dr's.,
"Constant ability to keep in contact with my health team makes all the difference in my mind frame. Even though I don't bother them daily, it is good to see that they are watching my health and enhancing it.",
"I really like this app easy to use for most of your medical needs. But,if was so much easier before they changed everything. I really hate that. I have my husband's account but not mine of which it will not let me even when I did all that was asked of me so therefore I will not give 5 stars",
I love this app. The presentation of the results is straightforward. I would love to see a year over year charts for graphical representations of the test results. Great work.,
Useful in communicating data from Dr. . . In the area of test results: adding vetted links to medical terms could increase the usefulness of interpreting the results. Kind of like a dictionary for the term with useful educational links that dive deeply but are useful in forming clear questions to address medical terms and range results that are outside of normal or on the outer edge of healthy.,
I love mychart keeps my appointment in one place so I can't miss any,
"In the MyChart currently will not let me reply to messages because they errored out with error ""cannot reply to an expired message"" I used the MyChart website and it worked. I later tried to make a new message and it would let me select the medical professionals. Didn't send it to not send a duplicate.",
This is an excellent app. I can see all my testing results before my doctor gives them to me. My appointments are here. And I can read all of my scan results and get full information even if the doctor doesn't tell me about them. I highly recommend.,
"I find the use of this app easy to use and edit. However, I find the e-check in to be redundant. I still am required to verbally verify it all again at registration. 6 of 1 & half dozen of another 😊",
"A lot of messages get lost. Referral notifications are all dead ends - they all tell me I have a referral, but the app provides me no options to do anything to actually follow up on the referral.",
Dr Webster was patient and informative. He made me feel well heard and taken care of.... The app is awesome,
"I am a cancer patient, and I have memory issues from the chemotherapy. I take care of my mother who is an Alzheimer's patient. So I have two extremely important medical records to keep track of. With this app, I am able to see BOTH of our appointments (which helps keep our schedules from clashing), medications, messages and test results in one spot. Which to me, makes this an absolute Godsend.",
Terrible! Cannot get it to open and waiting for response from my primary care physician. Terrible app. Old one was much better! It worked this morning and this afternoon says it can't be found! And I can't event get the code response! 😣,
"I love that I get the opportunity to manage my medical chart and communicate with my Doctor and staff right here on this application that I can utilize and access so easily from the privacy of my own home. So easy to use! This application just walks you right through the steps to creating an online account, setting up user profile, and connecting yourself to your medical information and voila! You are in full control of your medical file!",
I love mychart. Always works and keeps me updated on appointments and test results. I I am having a problem signing in on my tablet. I use my Note 9 and it works perfect so I don't know what's wrong.,
"Great app. The schedule availability is not very accurate however, but I'm not sure if that's the manager's lack of maintenance. I scheduled an apt and soon after I received a call from the office saying the slot I yook wasn't available and the Dr. Wasn't in that day.",
I don't understand why I can't filter past visit notes by clinic or by type. I need to look back at surgeries and ER visits much more frequently than therapy notes but they're all jumbled together by date. There's no search option for type of service.,
Just brilliant and wish all care providers used this so notes and test results would be in one place rather than bits of paper and emails getting lost in the abyss of the NHS never to be see again. Makes everything easily accessible and very glad my hospital use the system!,
"Trash app. It crashes all the time, error messages are a common thing for when you want to view ANYTHING other than your bill.",
"Great app, simplifies appointments, gives access to a lot of key information, appointments, meds, paperwork. Lets you fill out questionairs to make upcoming appointments easier. A good app to download.",
"Love this app, you can take care of all medical needs in one place.",
"It's ok. I wish there was a calender function so I could take notes on how I'm feeling day by day. Like even on days when I'm super anxious or I'm throwing up a lot, or had trouble sleeping. Just a way to keep track of every day chronic symptoms.",
This app sucks now after the update. I can't check things I need to look over and the app used to be convenient until the update now it is more of a hassle than helpful to use the app. It was helpful before the update. If somethings not broke don't fix it.,
This app is a piece of JUNK!!! To keep their IT person employed they make many unnecessary changes which makes you relearn their system. It takes longer to sign in on this app than to sign in at the Dr office making you input repitious info that is in the system again and again. Just a waste of my time. Then they make you put in new passwords for each medical group which make the movement between providers cumbersome. Just a pile of 1s and 0s making a Junk program.,
"Love this to keep tabs on my appointments that I've s healed months in advance. Love that I could link my two health care systems together in one place plus pharmacy too so all providers can have the info they need! I also like the fact that I can review my lab results even before the doctor calls so I know if I need to take action and call him first. Messaging and refill requests also make it so much easier to contact my doctor directly without the runaround, hold time, and wait for callback.",
"I've never used an app that shows all the information needed about all of my visits, medications, upcoming appointments, and if I've missed any shots. It's been very useful since I've started seeing my new doctor.",
Not adapted for simple follow up visits or annual physical. The one size fits all... Doesn't. Good Way to frustrate patients and increase blood pressure.,
"Hello, I downloaded the mobile CVS health MyChart app to my android phone, but every time I try to open it I get a message ""Unfortunately, MyChart has stopped"". I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. How to do fix it? I need the mobile app for COVID test results travel purposes. Thank you",
This. Is the worst app I have ever had the misfortune to use. When checking test results you are unable to return to the list of test results to check another test. You must exit the app and signin again to view the next test result.,
"I love that I can connect all my information from all my doctors. I can pull up my medical records and medications 💊 😎. Best of all pay my bills and make adjustments when I need to. Set up appointments, do E-visits and speak to a nurse. Yes and request refills. My medical history at my fingertips. Just as it should be. Love it.",
"I do appreciate the ability to link accounts/profiles from different doctor's office(s). The interface has gotten better since I initially downloaded(10/2020), however there is still plenty of room for improvement.",
Used to love this app. It would tell me everything regarding my health and appointments. Now I cant even view my appointments or why one is requested by my doctor. I have so much stuff that I can't even view. And calling them is a joke. At this point finding a new doctor outside of UofU seems like a better option at this point.,
"Great medical app I feel as though me and my PA HAVE a closer relationship through mychart, I.e. quick medication refills, appointment updates, etc.... wish they would add a video chat feature on here so I wouldn't have to use a 3rd party app for FaceTime check ups love those save time, money for both parties patient, PA, SOCIAL DISTANCEING SITUATIONS, ETC.",
Makes arranging & paying for my multiple appointments easier.,
"This app allows me to do so many things from making appointments, ordering refill prescriptions, and things like emailing my clinic ARNP and staff pharmacist. I get lab results as soon as they are done, generally the same day as a lab visit. So very useful. Fantastic app, Epic. Thank you.",
Too many demands password as we do not fond password reverting back to placing code Very unfriendly user code system .cannot get my chart results .its nuts how this password system is set up.hard to go get code to bring it back to my chart for reset password. I have never used google system and that is why se have hard time placing code number .no way to get back to aly code to chang password . not a sequentual easy way to do this?,
"Unable to schedule new appointments from list of ordered procedures or from notices of procedures due. Can't request specific procedure, must try to find that in general lists, which doesn't have the requested procedures. Why keep sending reminders with ""click here"" only to be sent to a very general site as if you aren't there because of a specific reminder?",
Mostly this app is pretty good. There are times when I have had a difficult time finding what I was looking for. Not all information is current. It still has wellcare as my insurance which is not current. My insurance has changed.,
"Slow. Way too much info. Cluttered. Too many communications. Now it sez I can log in with a passcode. Am I not already doing that? Sure seems like it. What's the difference if I use letters, numbers, my own creation of that of someone else? It's like asking someone if they want to go around the planet to the east of to the west. Who cares?",
"I the way the app works is very poor. I had forgotten my password. And there is no typical ""forgot password""? Link on there. So I'm trying to message there support email, and i have got nothing for a few days. This is also a reason why my medication is being restriced so not impressed",
The app is fine. The only complaints I have is that I cannot change my profile picture which is from 2014. A lot has changed in 8yrs. And more color options. Thanks,
Not user friendly!! Advoid at all cost. I would honestly give 0 starThis app is a joke. No one knows how to use it staff include. It's beyond frustrating. 90% of the time you don't see anything like test results. And when you request an image result no one can tell you how to get it. The clinics will tell. You get it on the app and the when it don't show up after 10 days contact the support for teh app they tell. You to get it thru the clinic. This POS app is not worth the time of frustration.,
"All of your medical needs on one app! From scheduling appointments to requesting prescription refills, messaging your doctor and everything in between this app helps me get it done quickly and easily without being bothered with phone calls!",
Love 💖 this app! It makes everything so easy. Perfect 😊,
"Absolutely love this app and how I am to able to communicate with all of my doctor's. Get my medications refilled, see all my test and lab results, and make appointments with my doctor's and for test I need to have done. So much easier then being on the phone.",
"I love this app so much. Everything concerns my health that is done through labs,tests, proceduces,& etc. will appear in this app. It does not take but a few minutes and you can see your results.",
"Excelent,Doctors and their assistences are too good to the Pacients.Thanks God.",
"I think this is a great app. If you want to know anything from your visit with your primary doctor all you have to do is accessmyportfolio and you may see all the notes and even parts of your medical records,the medication you take,and the Aftercare summary you're doctor made. It's a great little app.",
Easy app to use my issue with the app it's super slow lagges and freeze's up some days i can't even login to the app that's an issue that needs to be fixed before I'll Give a 5 Star rating and a 5 star rating shouldn't be expected with the issues i deal with on the app it's very frustrating and aggravating because it's always something with the app lately,
The best medical communications between patient and healthcare provider in my opinon.... so far,
It's easy to use and to see all results in one place.,
"Easy to get your results, Easy to rech out to your doc",
"Overall a good app, both on both web and Android. The best part for me was when I moved and switched providers. Both wsed epic, so my history moved effortlessly.",
Love it. So easy to use.,
"I find this method of communicating with any person (especially) or organization EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Ninety percent of the time I get nowhere. It is impossible to even leave messages to a doctor with whom I have been connected about 25 years - and thought I still was - but maybe not! Nor can I find how to contact a person who has been managing my meds for a few years and thought still was - but, again, maybe not. I cannot even find her name under the office where she works, or worked, maybe.",
I like all the options it gives you. THE ONLY THING THAT IS NOT OK AT ALL IS THAT STAFF SEE YOUR MESSAGES AND THEY DO NOT REPLY. So that leaves you wondering if they are even forwarding the messages to the doctor. This is the reason I am giving a two star rate.,
This is an excellent app. It was very helpful when I was admitted to hospital while visiting Florida. When they started asking medical questions my family did not and was to sick to answer. My daughter gave the app and they were able find information they needed..,
"Thus far, I have had good luck using this app 🙂. However, for some reason, I lost the ability to use my thumbprint (biometrics) to log in and since I use complicated passwords for everything, logging in is a real chore. How do I get the ability to use my thumbprint restored?",
Good app.....can you connect to the Samsung watch too.,
"You're saying get with the support or the epic which I have and no one can figure it out. Very upsetting, then you have the Dr's or who ever in the office reading the messages but yet no one I mean no one returns any messages back I'm tired of playing games that no one can return seen messages. It can be an urgent issue and no one returns messages.",
"Don't waste your time, this app is absolutely terrible. I try to sign in and now it won't let me because the email, I have on file, which is my main email. Doesn't work, loved it until they must have redone, the app. Like I said, don't waste your time.",
Works well and keeps you informed. It would be great if on the appointment notifications there was an option to add to your personal calendar.,
It is very easy to understand and get the information I need for my health.,
"Good aop in just about all respects. You can schedule appointments, add them to your calendar, request refills on prescriptions and send inquiries to the Dr's office from within the same interface. If your Dr uses this it's a good idea to have and use it as well.",
"It's better now! Used to if you started a message and couldn't finish it, and returned to finish, the message was gone causing a start over...not good!",
"I love being able to see my test results before the doc has time to call me. Making appointments, refilling scripts, nurse/Dr communication, etc is so much better than waiting for a call back whenever they have time. I love this app!",
I do not mind using MyChart. The only problem I have is they have all my shot records out there and they are not complete. It seems like some people don't want to keep up with the program. I get confused as to what I am supposed to be getting done next sometimes. Nobody says hay look on MyChart under this to find your information or answer to your questions. You are just left on your on to figure it all out. We did not go to Medical school.,
I am beyond aggravated. I have attempted to sign into this app under Monument heath 1000 times and it never works. Just keeps telling me sign in info is wrong even when I was on the phone with tech support for this very issue and my information is working on line. Just not the app! So frustrating!,
"Still not working correctly. Scans or billing or any kind of download leaves you with either a 0 byte TIF file or no file at all. Please fix. Already sent an email to support, but haven't gotten a response other than the automated reply.",
"Easy to navigate, has the option to switch between different facilities, has all the information I need to monitor my care plan, medications, tests, etc.",
The app works great! But when the office 🏢 does not update the results of the visits and you really need them and they are not there then the app is defeating the purpose!,
Seamless information sharing in real time. Love this app!,
I am 67. This is way too difficult for me to understand. I get instructions in one place & then have to go to another place to implement them. Do you really think I will remember what I am supposed to do? I can't even remember to take my medicine. It was so much better when it was just Thomas Spann & you could walk in and see your doctor & call & talk to a person instead of punching buttons & getting nowhere. I like my doctor & I don't like the way you've put an electronic wall between us.,
"Initially, I admit being quite skeptical and annoyed by this system as change isn't something I automatically accept. However, I love being able to find out information from an after visit, refill a prescription, and communicate with my Healthcare provider without calling.",
I absolutely love this app. Talk about convenience. You can schedule and cancel appointments quickly. Also the video appointments are a breeze.,
Super easy to use. Easy to set up. Super easy for video messages. Quick and easy shortcuts. Plus my doctors are absolutely amazing.,
If you are hesitant to download this app I heard you to give it a try I was reluctant to use it myself but now that I have it I can't imagine life without it it organizes everything you can contact anyone on your care team get appointments test results it's a way to help take your medical care into your own hands I recommend it highly,
It has its conveniences. I like the non urgent medical questions.,
I just tried to add a third person to the app and am having trouble. It keeps saying the email address has to be verified but it won't send a code to the email address. I have tried it 5 times and it still won't work.,
"I'm 63 with a few medical conditions, therefore I deal with numerous procedures at various places around the State. I have numerous meds, and MyChart is truly an Amazing tool. I'm not very computer savvy, and don't like being on Hold for who knows how long. MyChart allows me to make appointments, gives me addresses and locations to where I need to be and when. I can communicate with my Doctor's and their staff effortlessly. I highly recommend MyChart for all...",
Doctors office doesn't consistently get my messages through this app,
Awesome Application! Keeps all appointments and medical information in one spot for patients and doctors to easily access. Very convenient not having to fill out packets of paperwork anymore.,
I love MyChart! It is the easiest way for me to keep up with appointments test results and messaging my Dr's for information. I really enjoy that I have the capability to do and learn so much about anything that I may have going on. I highly recommend this app!,
"Love this app...take a test and I see results same time, and often before, doctor does. I can see chart notes and read all my health related info in one place...if this app ever goes away I will feel lost. Information is power and this app makes me feel powerful and like",
Navigation is difficult. Reply options are cumbersome if you can find the option to begin with. Indo is good but processes are NOT easily found.,
"I like this app a lot but today I can't log in at all to write back to my doctors. It keeps showing a pop up saying ""we couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."" But I've been trying all day! Please fix this. I have a Samsung Note10+.",
Test results are fine and fairly easy to attain. However appointments don't always show up in a timely manner. My annual exam for next week just showed up. I'd already scheduled an appointment because some of my meds are needing renewal.,
"Very informative and detailed. WELL DONE!! The only gripe I would have is all the medical terms used. It would be great if you follow each term with ""layman's terms""..…. We'd understand better. Thanks, JOHN BENTLEY",
"Can't access Acct? I've been using it for years and suddenly, it acts like my acct doesn't even exist. Tells me to Select an Organization, then of course doesn't list options or find anything when I search. And I hate that I can't screenshot things when it was working.",
a section & find what loo1111111king for 90%of sections aren't used. assume drs just don't have the time to fill n each section but patients can do most of that stuff even conditions once complete the dr can review& make any changes. Want to b able to schedule an appt with nurse pract not just dr.most of us only see a nurse pract,
"Dependant upon what device you are using will be the experience, whether good or bad, that you get. Normally i would give it a five but today not so much bc of the device i am on i guee. I was kicked off the telehealth visit with the doctor and kept trying to get back on but it wouldnt let me. So i will do a walk-in instead. Not too happy with it today. I still gave it four stars though bc i do like it. Have a good day!",
Very caring people in there working,
"OHSU Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center and Endocrinology Clinic keeps giving me messages saying that they are having trouble accessing my files at Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic. Why can't OHSU see the results for lab draws done at YVFWC? Also OHSU is not up to date with my list of current medications that my Primary Care at YVFWC has on file in the Epic system. The MyChart App by Epic is not properly linking OHSU and YVFWC files. Now it is Legacy Medical, too. So it's the App ...",
"Normally I love the app, Easy to find my information, But after the last update I haven't been able to see my billing check my messages for see any information.. App crashes has no option to figure it out",
I am not able to message or make appointments for all my Physicians,
"Overall it's pretty good, but the latest redesign has a very small keyboard for trying to type in PIN numbers for logging in, would be nice if the keypad was a bit larger",
Ascension needs to take notes on how this site is ran. This is the best site I have used. Keep up the good work.,
"Can't find a way to access vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, etc. Also find it annoying to go to another screen without having to log off and then log on again.",
"Excellent one stop system to check my medical records and needs. Easy to get response from doctor and/or nurse quickly. This app is very user-friendly, while answering so many questions regarding heathcare. Can't say enough about this useful tool...",
This app is very easy to use! Leaving messages for your doctor is easy. They usually answer the same day! Your upcoming appointments are here and upcoming lab tests are also listed. Lab results are on this app too. Easily earns five stars in my book!,
Now that I can easily get customer service to give a quick reset so I can obtain access to my own MyChart I appreciate using it for once,
"This app is a wonderful way to communicate with my doctor. Using this, I am able to review the results of all test ordered (lab & radiology), request medication refills. I always get answers within 24 hours and most of the time in the same day.",
"My Chart is a failure. It is impossible to get results. It repetitively goes to ""Find a Doctor"". I have an excellent Doctor, thank you, but I need my test results!",
Very easy to use and navigate through!! I love all the features.. Overall just a very good app . My favorite thing about it is that I'm able to make contact with my Dr's office very easy...,
I love having my chart cause I can look to see when my appointments are and I can see test results and everything. Absolutely love the app,
"I use the my chart all the time. I make appointments, email the doctor and get test results. I love it!! If I can't remember an appointment date or time I can check. The email is without a doubt my favorite feature. I don't know how I ever lived without it.",
"Wonderful, very EASY to use! The interface is so easy to use and navigate! Anybody, any age, can figure it out! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",
another app is kind of screw you when you're trying to log in on it for a while there I was having to go to password program to Google password program and login from there get on the the right hospital to log in because if I tried to go to the app I will get some other hospital and I couldn't get it to change back to the right hospital. its a huge crutch for my doctor he tends to depend on it too much and doesn't talk to me and he doesn't answer my messages. doctor never answers messages,
I love this app! I have it on my phone and tablet! I love that I can keep up with all of my appointments even my Duke rheumatology appoinments which is almost 3hrs away! The only appointments that I can't keep up with on here are my dental appointments. But it's not MyChart's fault. The dentist's don't use MyChart. But I still love this app!,
"I love it very convenient.. everything you need is at your fingertip example: request records, pay bills, make/cancel appointments, medication refills, and/or message your providers. I will recommend this APP at 100%!",
Helpful. I love being able to talk to your doctor and schedule appointments.,
"Depending on your doctor's office they will insist you use this. Functionality is poor and I would rather just receive emails but the company that made this app has a business deal with someone. They will send authorizations that you cannot print, download etc. Have fun juggling referrals in the front office.",
"I Love This App!!! Great Experience. I have been using this for years and this is one of the ""Best"" Apps that I've ever used. Have never experienced a glitch, or moment of unavailability. Keep up the Great Work MyChart...",
Have had difficulty logging in the passed but that seems to have been fixed now. Very efficient way of keeping track. Thought you would like to know I am 82 and I did have a little help but can manage it by my self now.,
MyChart is great. I get all my Geisinger info virtually. And they even connect other organizations. Like my CVS. And you can use your thumbprint or a passcode to get in. You can email your docs. Get all your tests info right at your fingertips. Everything you need is right in the app!,
"I love using the my chart medical chart app, its very easy & simple 2 use, everything i need is here in this chart, i can share my documents with my provider, i can see it all for myself, i can request medication refills, medical appts, i can send notes 2 my doctor, etc everything is here when i need it, where have this been all these many years, I'm gratefull 2 have this system in hand, thanks 2 all my doctors at ummc, they have taken very great care of me, i would recommend them 10 + stars",
Beyond thorough and they are so expident. Great Job!!,
"Very useful and easy application. I like it very much. It facilitate how to make appointments, fill out forms, pay bills, and check other important information. Thank you developers.",
"I like that I can have access to my chart to see my prescriptions, allergies and appointments at any time. I have used the letter writing portion to ask questions of my Dr, this has worked very well for getting answers, I think that I have received answers faster than calling on the phone.",
"MyChart is the best thing to hit the Internet! ANYTHING you want to know about your health and what occurred at your Dr appointment is easily visible. I'm truly impressed with this app, so much that I showed it to my Dr who was equally as impressed. Thank you for developing an app that is so informative!!",
"None of the Unity Point places I go to are listed. When I click ""my unity point"" takes me to exact same place. Not helpful at all. I now have to continue on with the website rather than the app suggested.",
"I love my chart because, it helps me to remember my appointments. Also, everything is paperless I don't have so much paperwork laying around. I don't need to show medication updates or insurance. Everything is in my chart!",
Easy to schedule appointments. Saves time before doctors visits with e echeck-in. Easy to ask questions of medical staff. Visit summary and medication list is at your fingertips. You don't have to carry around bags of pill bottles to your appointments. Information is available to all of your providers that are with the Christus system.,
"In some ways extremely useful for communicating w/ my PCP some of my Mainline Health MD's w/ quick replies. No holding on phone indefinitely. However, not able to contact all my Mainline Health Dr's. Also, difficulties obtaining In-patient information from Mainline Health hospitals. Could use some user friendly instructions getting around in App.",
"Ok, except for having to reset the PIN ALL THE TIME!! I use it for two different health systems. One (UT Southwestern) ALWAYS works. The Christus system makes me reset the PIN very often.",
"I am able to link my various doctors, test results, appointments and more through MyChart. It's a great app. The push notifications keeps me updated to any type of medical communication. Great job!",
"It's a great tool, once you get used to navigating it but... Why main provider network is Providence. They have covid 19 testing as a separate option for appointments. Why can't I schedule covid 19 test appointments through MyChart? It makes it needlessly complex.",
"Good resource to quick check on family charts or look back at previous Appnts. The request an estimate for services feature is basically useless, so you'll have to sit on hold with billing for that. 😉",
"MYCEENTA My Chart doesn't work. It will not log in. It says something like it can't contact server. The Novant mychart works fine. I need the MyCEENTA my chart to work. Otherwise great app to schedule and reschedule appointments, talk to the doctor or nurse and see you biometrics.",
"The older version of this app was much better. Unlike this version, In the older version, you could graph all previous lab test (lipid profile, etc.) and compare past results.",
"I am the Mrs. of a stroke patient who now has to deal with the stress of keeping up with correspondence between hospitals, drs & LTD co. whom require all documentation of drs visits and after visit summaries do not include enough Information for the patients to be able to pass on to the LTD companies and the dr's dont seem to care enough to want to properly notate In the pt file Issues of pt that would prove to be helpful , Instead leaving prognosis unanswered, causing benefits to be denied!",
"Whoever thought of this was a genius this application that you combine all of your different doctors in the one application so that they too can see what other doctors are doing for you even hospitals out of town that you might have used in the past can be linked into this application this is a must have definitely five star application,, 11/16/21 And I might add after using this app the last few months updates that they have done to this app or excellent, truly I must have.",
I have never done this before. What I can say is that this ER experience is the worst. Been triaged twice because I am waiting so long. You ask a question and the techs are absolutely rude. The few times I have come the service has gotten worse. People that have had serious complaints have left rather then wait.,
"What happened? this app use to work great, now I keep getting an error about not communicating with the server. Yes, I uninstalled/reinstalled. Still doesn't work, very disappointing :(",
"It's nice being able to look up visits, prescriptions etc",
Easy to use and informative,
For some reason this app while being downloaded and indicating it is installed it will not open. I keep getting the same message that the app will soon be installed for a couple of days on my Samsung cell phone and my PC.,
The old app was better. This version is unnecessarily informative with wrong info. Tells me I have screenings due that I've already had or have scheduled. Tells me I have referrals coming up that I dont. Take a look at the Mayo app. Much better.,
I love being able to connect all of my doctors and hospital results in on app. I love being able to keep such close track of my health and read test results. This is probably the best health app ever made! 👍,
Makes life so much easier for me when your super busy and looking up one app can put a stop to several stops you would have had to do well let's just say it's awesome I really enjoy it,
Why can't I get the app on my fire tablet? It keeps telling me the only device available is my phone. With vision issues it is difficult to read My Chart from my phone. I don't like having to search for My Chart every time I need to access it.,
"Timely information on labs, scans, and biopsies, but just noticed I can no longer click on final results option. Results I just recently had access to a few days ago seem to have been removed. Also can only see the cost of one of my numerous scans and procedures I had during my hospital stay.",
"Ugh, the redesign is sooo much slower. No option to multi select and delete or swipe and delete messages. Makes it difficult to keep message box clean.",
"I cannot use the app AT ALL, 'there was a problem communicating with the server' is all I have gotten for MONTHS and every time I tried to call to get it fixed, it never got fixed! The app is useless like this!",
"Best medical hub available, most all my doctors from different areas use it and I got it all in one place. Message them, request refills, see upcoming appointments and labs, and get all my history in order so I don't forget something, I will forget, I seen me do it.",
"Loving this app, it has made it much easier to keep in touch with my primary care doctor, ask for refills on medication, and view my bills. It helps me keep up to date record on procedures I have had and ones coming up. Don't change a thing",
The upgrades have come a long way. Much easier to navigate and oddly captivating. Had me in there for 30 minutes just looking around 🤦😁,
"I'm having the same issues as OatyGoat is and it's irritating. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app 4 times in a row, and the same issues every time. Only the email links work.",
Very bad app. I used it over 4 years now. Every time they fix something they destroy other good thing. why hospitals pay money for it? Just an example the app does not save the user name or password every time I need to write it again and again this features lost after last update.,
Based on the information in this app I made an appointment at the Lenoir office for blood pressure concerns. When I arrived the lady at the front desk said they could not help me with my high blood pressure because they can't treat it. Of course that made my BP even higher due to the stress. This app should not include health care they can NOT provide!!!!,
Great feedback from the office itself,
Easy to get appointments and responses from doctor,
"This app sucks. My son takes a maintenance med that needs a new script every month. I used to be able to order it thru the app but now that he's turned 12, I can't view his med list and I can't email his dr, who I communicate with frequently. Now I have to waste everyone's time calling the clinic just to request meds. Teen proxy doesn't even allow me med visibility or dr communication. Uninstalling. It's worthless to me now.",
"This app has been easy to use, consolidates all of my medical information and appointments. I love that it synchronizes with my calendar and I can directly access directions to locate the doctors' offices.",
I have two doctor groups. Both switched from FollowMyHealth. Neither brought all of my medical history. Each implemented the MyChart menu differently. Problems result in MyChart and the doctor group pointing to each other. Billing is a joke. The health industry has the worst systems and they don't care.,
It's okay but I haven't figured out how to delete old messages and transfer from Providence to Multicare even when I followed directions. I keep getting a message saying that there's a problem with the program.,
Wish all my doctors used my chart. Easily to navigate,
One of the things I use my chart for is to log my inr home test results. They've made a change to the process that's worse than not helpful. The way it is now doesn't even match the info in the training manual.,
"The medical side of Lahey responds promptly but the app is not well integrated with billing, other than sending them. Any questions, and of course billing is not always accui, requires follow up via a LONG phone call with the billing department.",
Excellent my chart is very easy to go thru. It helps me remember my appointments the times n I can get to my results very quick I love it i love it I love it.. I recommend this app to anybody else who is thinking of trying it out I would say go for it!! It helps ALOT n I am more at ease knowing my info n checking it on my own. Thank you for making it!!,
This is a great app I recommend it to all of patience,
Keeps me up to date and able to pay my hospital and doctor bills online.,
"Very bad app! For one, I have to keep resetting my password because it keeps blocking me from getting into my account. Also, I can't download documents from my visits.",
It is easy to use and i get fast answers. Love it.,
I love this app. It makes my health and appointment's more manageable because with having two very rare autoimmune disease it makes keeping trake of everything simple and less overwhelming.,
"This app sucks. I can barely get it to work, and when I finally get into the part of the chart I want it gives me a server error message. ALL THE TIME. I'm an ICU nurse... No wonder patients are noncompliant. They can't see or act on their information.",
"I have been unable to verify my email address, I keep getting an error message. I have no way of fixing the issue. Totally frustrated and as a new user I cannot get the message about my initial visit. Oh yeah, I tried about 5 times!",
So easy and convenient to get the news you need,
Very easy to use gives you access to all types of information makes everything a lot easier and is not difficult to use at all self-explanatory definitely I must have app for your phone,
"I'm having trouble erasing old messages; I clicked trash, yet it still says I have unread messages and will not clear. I also just received a mssg from a Dr. concerning my last ECHO and I'm not familiar with him, yet I cannot find that mssg due to my phone being idle for just a few minutes. I would like better navigation so that I don't need to call Community Care (do to the very lengthy wait time)",
"Works great, even across different organizations, thank you, I had 4 tumors removed and this app helped me keep current I found some flaws in requesting prescrip renewals, it defaults to last healthcare provider, my doc was gone and a different okayed, then later it stuck on the other provider, I would like a drop down to choose which provider to request from",
I had to reset my password because it could not verify and some reason interface connect to other hospitals using my data and name? Very horrible set up they update!!! Don't loose data or sell info.,
This app worked great until it updated. Now I can't even get on the app. It tells me it doesn't recognize my username or password. I have to close the app and go in through Google. I don't see the point in having the app if I can't use it.,
I have found this app to be incredibly useful for all of my health care needs.,
User friendly. Really like the passcode option. Would like to see the option to view lab results by test results over time. Have to toggle now and it is cumbersome,
Were is the back button. I can get one test results to get back to the list I have to close the app and sign in again. Not very user friendly,
"Very easy to use, get all of the information that you need.",
"This app makes is easy to stay connected to my medical care providers. I also like the ability to receive test results in a timely manner, as opposed to having to wait for a call. I like being able to message my providers.",
This is the fastest and easiest way to view all your info in one place. 😉,
"This system is entirely devoted to maintaining an active line of communication with its users. The University of Michigan, our provider of choice, uses it as an effective notification and record keeping tool. I find myself satisfied with its ability to combine services between our two Medical Care Providers of choice. (SPECTRUM HEALTH [Grand Rapids, Michigan] and University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]). I would like our Florida Provider(Sarasota Memorial Hospital) use it. Sincerely, Sandy",
"Aside from the native Dutch, the app is using, it is a secure and efficient platform to access medical information and contact medical staff. An English translation option would be welcome - particularly in urban centers with a high expat population.",
"Absolutely love this app. It provides me with valuable information such as my appts, test results, med history, make payments, and even communicate with my doctors. I'm also able to link with other hospital accounts. I love how easy it is to access all my information.",
when it works it's great but it crashes all the time - especially on the message a provider function. it's really annoying to have to call up there,
"I love MyChart. It is a game changer if you really use it. I chat with my Dr's, it reminds me of my appointments I can find all my Dr's in one place. I can request med refills. See the results for all my labs. I can also go back and read the notes the Dr's wrote about my plan of care. It has been a life saver.",
Love the app. Its so easy to see all of your information.,
Great to keep all your records on hand and to keep apprised of all testing and results. Also to he able to see what my doctors see. Also the app is very easy to use.,
"Finally have a user friendly app. There is some hassle flipping through pages, but overall, nice! It's great to get test results and reports fast, sometimes before the drs..lol",
i think I've been able to log in two times total. trying to log in usually results in an error message telling me it had trouble connecting to the server.,
"This app need a lot of work, about billing information it doesn't tell you how much you owe you'll find out in a paper mail. All the lab cost doesn't show up on this app. When you think everything ok bill will come to you like you never pay a dime.",
Makes it easy to read up on tests :),
It is pretty good. It took me a little while to use it to full functionality. I like how I can communicate w providers(billing primarily). I recommend. There are still some kinks to work out.,
Extremely convenient. Evertything in one place and information immediately available on demand. The ability to communicate with medical staff in a secure environment is also great.,
"Using the app is great, but everytime you make change's it is very difficult for me to get back in! Can't you make it easier? I am not a technical person.. i do great once in please quit changing everything. Thank you!!!",
"Overall the app is great for tracking your test results, medications, upcoming appointments, messaging back and forth with the nurse or your doctor, and paying your bill. Cons: the option of paying for your visit when you e-check in is no longer available.",
"Great way to communicate with your doctor/hospital, get very detailed test results, track past and upcoming appointments, and lots of other functions I haven't yet used. Finally the patient relations front end of medicine is in the 21st century.",
Very good app keeps me updated on my health,
Best app ever. Without exception one of the biggest time savers and frustration reducers available. Love it and all the very cool features.,
I can read my chart when I'm ready. Everything is labeled for convenience and easy viewing. I can show others doctor's what ever they need to see at the tips of my fingers.,
"I hate this portal carp. If I want to talk to a doctor, I want to talk to them. This portal is just another barrier they put between you and your caregiver. They rarely respond to questions thru the porta. When they do respond,the response has little or nothing to do with the original question. It can take months to have a meaningful conversation using this tool. Just pick up the damn phone and talk to me! This is a horrible communication tool. I wonder if anyone will ever read this.",
"Great app for medical information. The only issue I have now, after my latest update. Is that I can no longer log in with a passcode, now I have to enter my user name and password. I cannot find the passcode option in the app settings anymore.",
"When attending virtual visits, the app forces you to complete an eCheck-In before it will allow you to access the meeting link, and there is no way around it. You MUST complete the eCheck-In. But the app regularly has server errors that make completing the eCheck-In impossible, meaning that there is absolutely no way to attend the virtual visits. I posted a similar review several days ago, and this morning I received an email that the developer had responded to my review. They just deleted it.",
"Very user friendly! Makes my life much easier from setting appointments, to requesting refills, getting test results and everything in between! I highly recommend this app.",
This app is very Helpful and assist me in keeping up with my appointments.,
Code doesn't work. You only have a short time to use it. This app use to be great. Now a very disappointing experience. I keep getting locked out of My Chart. My info will be put in at the Doctor's office. May change Doctor's if this is a constant thing.,
I have notifications in the app but I can't view some of it and what I can see will not clear out the notification. Houston Methodist only allows mammograms and one other thing to be registered through the app so I find this a waste of time. I suggest Temple Run 2 for a time waster.,
"Was working just fine yesterday then today when I go to log in it asks if I want to leave app. I select stay & nothing comes up if I select open in another app, it takes me website which then asks if want to open in app. So I'm stuck in a loop. I just want to check message center for my med script.",
"Cannot upload documents. During this pandemic, the doctor's office wants me to participate in virtual visits. However they also want me to submit documents and that cannot be done without going into the office. Note, there's nowhere in the app for 'contact us' so issues can be brought to their attention.",
It let me setup for a fast access but doesn't work all the time. I do like having access to my info that otherwise is hard to keep track of!,
I can't get what is online on the MyChart app.seems it will not record everything like Dr notes after visits .seems to have a glitch in the system.other than that I like the app,
"This app can be useful for non emergency medical questions or billing questions. It's also useful for checking past appt summaries and notes as well as upcoming appointment details. Lots of community and informative resources. PROBLEM IS THE FREEZING SCREEN, SLOW LOAD TIMES, PASSWORD AND USERNAME ISSUES.",
Easy to use. Allows a family member that I choose to also have access.,
I like it. Easy to leave a message and they always get back to you. Check upcoming appointments. Medication & Test results updates..,
"In doing an e check in I found 4 conditions I had never entered and have no idea how they made their way into my record. Accuracy of patient data is key! Also, it's ridiculous to expect patients to upload their ID and insurance card every time they check in. Ridiculously inefficient. Just ask ""has any of the following changed""?",
"I really like this app. Its convenient for me to ask for refills, and make appointments and remind myself when they are! So far I haven't had any problems except getting the xrays.",
"I love this app. I can see test results, message my different Doctors for any questions and see their answers from my phone. See reminders for upcoming appointments. See when my prescriptions are ready for pick-up. This is a well thought out app! Thank you!",
"They deleted my vaccine records. My Pfizer shots were both on there since May. I got a booster shot in December at Playdate PDX and submitted the info and photo of my CDC vaccine card to them to add the third vaccine. Instead of adding the third shot, they deleted the two shots that had already been there. MyChart now shows ""vaccination status unknown"". I sent them a message five days ago, no response. Update: the first message was sent December 15. I sent another on January 4th. I also called the customer service phone number which informed me they can only help with logging into the app. I told the guy I spoke to that Legacy Health must have thousands of unanswered messages similar to the ones I sent. The app is less than useless to me - it says my vaccination status is unknown, which is incorrect. If I lose my card and photos of the card, I'll be treated like an unvaxxed person, not allowed in certain places.",
Love it. So easy to Communicate with the Dr. Or staff. Fine out what my test results are without having to call the office. I think all medical offices should use this app. The only thing that needs help with is adding other web/apps to my charts. Like Patient portal of Athens.,
"App doesn't work, can't echeck in..Never recieved phone call back for updates why it's not working..One portal rep lied to me and told me cuz servers were busy due to covid, one rep told me they had upgraded from 4 to 14. This is medical records we are talking about. Don't feel secure in using. Wouldn't recommend.",
"Horrible login experiences. Problem communicating with the server. Enter username, paste in password. To get around the server message, you have to click on the username field again. Then click submit. Also fingerprint login doesn't work for to server message. Do you guys even do QA?",
"Never had a bad experience with it, easy to use, makes scheduling and seeing review notes easier and less calling if you have anxiety and less paperwork if you loose them",
This app is great. So much easier to contact my health provider using this app than calling and sitting on hold in the phone queue forever. It's also convenient to have the family's medical information if we need to visit an ER or urgent care clinic while we're traveling.,
This app keeps me in the loop... I would be lost without it!!!,
"Spent half an hour to fill out my health questionnaire, the last question was about the participation in 'MyChart recruitment research studies' when I clicked submit it looped me back to 'MyChart recruitment research studies' whichever option I picked. So the questionnaire has not been submitted. Annoying. ""Hate it"" when it happens",
My chart is nice but I would really appreciate a calendar view of my appointments. That would really be helpful to many.,
"I get immediate test results. It helps me remember appointments, keep in contact with all of my medical team. Very clear easy to use. My chart has helped me participate in my own healthcare in real time. Can't imagine being without it.",
I am unable to open my medications list. I've tried numerous times & it will not come up. I get my refills from this list & I really need some assistance. The app keeps telling me that the MyChart has shut down. Please help me.,
"Great app that helps me stay in touch with all my Doctors without always going to the hospital. I can see all my test results and clinic notes which helps me to stay informed, educated and involved with my healthcare needs. I can easily pay all copays and book any appointments.",
"Almost perfect, few tweaks needed. There are some alerts that keep popping up that I wish I can't seem to dismiss. I've addressed them but they just stick around.",
"Helpful but every so often my password has to be reset. Had to do this at least three times in the last two months. With out warning I would get lock out of the account, and I am force to create a new password.",
"Love MyChart very convenient to look up past medications, notes, test results. I was even able to see my xrays. I never had a problem with MyChart and highly recommended having it as one of your apps.",
Love that you can reach out to drs without necessarily going to er or anything,
"Love it! Make it so easy to manage appointments, message doctors and ask questions, you can even fill out paperwork before your appointment it's really convenient and easy to use.",
"I had problems initially, but support was completely helpful. This app is awesome. I can see after care reports, medicines, and make doctor's appointments.",
"Same provider for 2 separate e visits and recieved no assistance. I really hope I'm not charged for a visit when I was told to see someone at an urgent care facility. It doesn't appear to me that Veronica J is willing to help with anything. But then, she's not really even a doctor is she ? One star, and only because there isn't an option for zero.",
App errors when clicking on all notifications,
"Needs a way to track medications you have taken, especially when outpatient (it lists what is prescribed, but not ""last taken""). It could also then use the phone alarms to remind you when to take a particular medication again.",
"Great app, but we were told not to rely on it for lack of accuracy. The hospital's schedule and the mychart's schedule are not always in sync.",
Certain features of the app when accessing cause it to crash. When trying to get technical support the app provider they say it's a problem with the medical provider. Calling for help from the medical provider they say the problem is with the app provider. After further inquiries found out the the app. provider Epic is aware of the problem and was working on it. A month later the problem is worse it seems and basically useless.,
"It help a lot with appointments, payments, and save paper.",
"Like it with everything easy to find. I would like to see photos/videos of my x-rays, CT scans, MRIs etc... or link to download to pc/phone.",
Ease of use. Very helpful and saves a phone call. Plus no paperwork to manually fill out. Makes checking in much better and faster.,
"This app is great! No need to call in for anything, including test results. Been using the app for years on 3 different phones & never had any issues.",
It's a great way to interact with my doctors it's fast it's convenient it's efficient I couldn't have asked for a better app it meets all those long phone calls with just a quick simple reply and I don't have to stop what I'm doing to change anything I just simply love it,
"A great portal to your health info. Would give it a 5 but for one thing. When I look at my app icon, I may see a flag indicating that something new is inside. When I open up the app, I do not see anything that will point me to the new information. I have to guess as to where it is.",
"Im very unhappy with what Beaumont has done with their program. I used to be able to immediately get into my medical chart and check my test results but something has changed. it won't let me even get into the program to sign up, change my password or respond in any way. it is the worst!",
I love having my health records at my fingertips. Thanx!,
"I love having an app that's so useful. It keeps track of appointments, insurance info. Drs orders and instructions. Prescriptions, refills. Etc. I have a record of everything now. Plus I can message my doctor with questions, for free.",
"App crashes consistently. Used to be good. I tried restarting the phone, clearing app data and cache, uninstall/reinstall the app. Still crashes.",
"Once I got ""in"" with my ""code"" it's easy to access, but to go ""in"" on the USER NAME, PASSWORD way is horrible. Why?? Because it would reject every time. I don't know how many passwords I have gone through. I only use my ""code"".",
Its very easy and helpful i love it,
"I dislike MyChart very much! I feel like I'm forced to use it. All my info is ""trusted"" to an online app? Not good. Other than that, it's confusing, terrible layout, can't understand what's on it, or how to use it. Even doctors don't like this app!",
When you go into lab results there is no way to back out or get back to the menu you have to shut down App and re-load it again. in the Android version at least.,
"Overall not to bad, I wish I could review test results, once I glance at them they dissapear when I try to go back over them there not listed anymore, and what compounds this problem is that they are not able to be printed, there is not an option to do so.",
So easy. All of health resources in one place.,
"I've seriously been waiting for something like this all of my life. Everything can be coordinated and records kept in this app. No phone calls, no busy signals, no rude receptionists... Everything should be so easy!",
"I cannot access my surgery information, or my post-op information. It keeps telling me to go to the ROC email for my access code, and then go back to my chart and enter the code. On my phone if I try to access my email, it kicks me out of the MyChart system. I will NEVER be able to use that code. I have asked if they can send it through my email, , and have heard no response. What do people who are blind, or computer illiterate do? Are they denied surgery, or post-op care ?",
"All of my medical information is literally at my finger tips. My Chart is an exceptional and easy tool to use even for the most mature among us. I personally depend on My Chart for more accurate information, scheduled office visits, and test results. I have been using My Chart for over a year now. I can't tell you how many times I have walked out of my scheduled appointments, with my mind still fixated on the lab results or on the encouraging words my doctor just spoke to me. Go to My Chart 🙃",
"I love it! Very helpful with my medical appointments and really helps with quick turn around time with communicating to the health care providers, thus enhanced patient care.",
I have trouble connecting and opening messages or appointments at times.,
"Very bad application Always trying to get an appointment from chart app, when I click on schedule an appointment the app gives me error so I can't schedule an appointment I tried many times to call women health center, once they answer they told ne we ll switch your call to the nurse to schedule for u an app, they keep me on hold then the call canceled This s not professional at all",
"A mind of its own, sometimes it works sometimes it don't. It always has an error message stating its having difficulty connecting more than one link",
"Easy to use app. Love that I can message doctors office and they respond with a solution. Easy to make appointments or schedule lab work. I also like that I can keep everything centralized for kids, medicine, doctors and lab results",
Easy-to-use. And keeps you up to date on everything.,
"It sucks overall. Doesn't show me my upcoming appointments and for some reason, it has my chart linked to a complete stranger's account so I have access to all of her medical records and she has access to all of mine.",
This was the best app to have after having my miscarrage. They helped me set it up and you have many ways to see your test results and medications and even billing. Its easy and very understandable.,
Will not send messages. If it does the provider doesn't answer.,
"Bad update. Since last update i have to continuesly sign in, and I set up pin code for sign in and it wont save it. Frustrating. But app itself is great once you're signed in.",
"Which other options shouldn't be on main page after log in so many times, should be as a deep down as part of settings, is annoying every time you open the page is right there, I do not want to use it now, but do not want to loose the opportunity later on , if I change my mind",
Really thankful for apps like MyChart. Makes Dr/Patient communication and office/tests experiences much more convenient. The app is easy to use. Gives access to your information in one place.,
"Excellent app, keeps track of everything for you.",
"Can't get past the initial ""select organization"" as Kaiser is not an option. I already created an account online but there is no option in the app to skip selection and simply login with my credentials. Only using this for the covid vaccine otherwise I wouldn't even have bothered.",
"4.5 stars It's a great app to communicate with the Dr office and get test results or what tests you need to take, vaccines needed and taken! The only thing that bothers me is when a message is sent to the patient it takes forever to get a notification that you have received a reply from the Dr office.",
"So far, this is a very helpful App for my medical needs. I can see test results. I can have TeleHealth meetings with my doctor's. The interface is good too.",
"I love this app. Just makes everything so much more accessible, including messaging my doctors, etc. Easy to navigate, and if you have doctors in multiple locations like I do, it links them all with your permission. I can't say enough about it. I'm so thankful for this. It's a great stress reliever. Thank you!",
Love this App! It's so convenient being able to access all my health information in one place. Makes evetything a piece of cake. It also keeps me from bringing home all the paperwork from the hospital because it's all right in the app for me already.,
"MyChart has made things so much easier. I can renew my prescriptions, view appointments, view lab results and much more. It's easy to navigate. I love it.",
"I have always had timely replies to any question or concern. Much much quicker then by telephone. Can go back to view my husband, children and my individual appt history, lab & test results, appt notes, medication list etc. I can also recieve any dr notes my children may need without having to make a trip to the office. I alao love that it lets you know when certain things like flu shot or a type of test is due of your overdue.",
"Must have. Easy to use, saves time, all your appointments, and test results are easily accessible. No crashes or adds.",
I've used this app since it came out each update gets worse. You can't see your appointments or meds look at your bill. Pretty much everything you need to do YOU CAN'T! it just says error. This app is USELESS! I'll uninstall again and just use the web.,
Very user friendly. An easy way to keep up with appointments and linking other medical records accounts all under one app. Very convenient.,
"I love the ability to ask a question or touch base with my Dr's & their nurses whenever the thought arises, instead of trying to remember everything to ask at my visit, being able to sign in, confirm, cancel or schedule appointments, see the Dr's notes & summary of my visits, procedures, test results, upcoming appointments, along with a map link so I kno exactly where I'm supposed to b going & when I'm supposed to b there. Definitely has made this process much easier.",
I really appreciate this app. I like having important Dr info available to me to see. I'm also able to pay my bills without having to travel to the different doctor offices. I'm kind of scared with it being vulnerable on the internet also.,
"It would be nice if we could opt out of using location services to find our organization. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling to fix the problem of it not updating my location on my moto e5. However, it did not work.",
"Great! I deal with doctors at 3 hospitals in ABQ NM. All are in MyChart and easy to get info from one doctor to the next. Other clinics don't use MyChart which makes me less likely to want to return to those doctors. MyChart makes it so simple to keep track of everything from office visits, appointments, procedures to be done, lab work that is needed etc. While each Clinic has its own login, merging the multiple accounts means I can log into one and still see what's going on everywhere.",
"1. When canceling an appmt you must pick a pre selected reason and there is no category for ""Other"". 2. I uploaded my new insurance cards to my chart but I was contacted to upload them a week later, my doc didn't have tem, the lab did not have them. Had to be uploaded 2 more times.",
One of the BEST and MOST USEFUL app I have EVER installed on a phone of mine. And it's FREE!!!,
The MyChart app is so awesome to have on my phone. I get an alert when I have an appointment and when there are new test results and actually received some new test results while I was logged in to and viewing MyChart. Thanks Gundersen Healthcare. This app is really well thought out. Jeff R.,
As a patient with multiple doctors I find my chart to be a useful way to keep all my health information in one place. I also set up so all doctors are in the same health system. There is a good reason for Epic and My Chart to be #1.,
"Love the convenience of looking at test results, future appts. and messaging with my PCP. Dr. Curran is next level. She is so kind and takes exceptional care of her patients. I feel so blessed under her care. The app is user friendly and great all around.",
Keep getting error code 404. Won't show me any ins or balance screens,
I've been unable to sign in to My Chart for three months now. It's crazy I once could get in touch with all of my doctors and be able to keep my appointments. Now even with the ladies at one of my many doctors I'm unable to sign in. I've been diagnosed with many new problems and need MyChart login now more than ever. I love my doctors and that's saying a lot when it comes to me . Being able to trust period. I'm going to Novant Health doctors everywhere. I need somebody to HELP ME PLEASE Windy,
"Problem entering app through app icon. Unable to log in, states incorrect info, yet when responding to notifications, if I click on the notification, I have no problem it goes directly to the 4 digit pass screen but not fro app icon",
"App makes setting appointments a breeze. You can expand to the numerous clinics in area to get a quick appointment. Also, test results show up often before the doctor calls you. If you are on the fence about getting this app, just download it. You won't regret it",
Using the app helps me get the information ℹ️ need to stay informed.,
"SOOOO easy to stay completely informed of absolutely EVERYTHING going on with my medical care and the EASIEST way to stay in complete contact with All Of my Drs. I just LOVE 💕 THIS APP!! And the Drs and Nurses ALWAYS respond in a personal and professional manner. I've been able to get a complete handle on my medical care with ease, comfort and total confidence now. I just Love 💕 it.",
"MyChart needs an overhaul or upgrade! Something needs to be done to straighten out all of the problems MyChart has! I don't like using it & I prefer to give my doctors, the information I have, myself. MyChart is just too complicated!",
"Extremely useful. The messaging system the app has to send messages to your doctor is excellent. I haven't had any issues with the app, it works very well.",
Best app ever the only problem I have with this app is that when I go to make a payment is said add the amount you wish to pay and then it won't except it because apparently it's not enough money to pay it expects me to pay more than I can afford and that's kind of hard when you're on a fixed income....,
"MyChart is so easy and convenient to use. I can get updated information, e-check In before my appointment and get reminders in one place. This is one of my favorite apps to use.",
Experience is wonderful. No ads that I've noticed.,
"I love being allowed to look at my test results, read information, get refills, and pay bills all in one place. I love that I don't have to worry and keep calling to get test results, everything is printable, and I can do it at my own time.",
Does not allow you to cancel reminders to schedule appts. I had a mammo out of UM system and continue to get reminders for months. Clunky interface. Thanks for your response however I no longer go to that provider... The patient needs more control over accepting or cancelling appointments.,
"My Chart helps further the continuity of care between Patient, Dr.s and Nurses. It makes it so easy to stay in touch and Keep track of appts. You can see exactly what's in your chart. My Chart makes it easier for all doctors to see what other doctors are doing and treat the patient accordingly. Thank you My Chart for simplifying healthcare.",
this app shows the required data and protects it. they just need to make it easier to use and modernize the UI. UI overhaul needed.,
"This app makes my med stuff so much easier and more efficient. I can see upcoming appts, lab, and test results, referrals, and more. It is fast and simple to use. Cant say enough! Thanks",
Great App! Very convenient and super SMART 🤩,
"This app solves the age old patient's annoyance: the lack of high quality, immediate and clear healthcare communications. MyChart is the (formerly) missing link from the perspective of the patient and I am honestly delighted with it.",
Most of it is up to date. The main problem is that I can't see my x-rays and I was told I could.,
"This app makes communication with my medical team so easy and simple. I can ask questions, refill prescriptions, and read test results-- oh, and pay my bill. I especially appreciate being able to complete the check-in information ahead of time.",
"9 times out of 10 the app won't open...just get ""an error occured on the server"" message. Not at all convenient or easy to use. I end up having to call the doctor office and wait on hold for 15-20 minutes",
Awesome app! I do however wish there was a way for patients to put notes for issues they may want to discuss with their doctor in-between visits. That I believe would be useful!,
"MyChart has allowed me to manage my medical records and payments in a way that no other app or program has attempted to date. More important than that, it's helped me take better stock of my health and communicate with my providers quickly and efficiently.",
"Had trouble with loging in with username and password, but called the phone number at the bottom of the MyChart log in page and they assisted me in getting the problem solved. Excellent customer support!! Only took about 2 minutes time.",
"Awesome that you can switch between different organizations. Only improvement needed is ALL records, results and imaging be available here.",
"Everything seems to be working like it should. I can go back and forth from mine and my son's profile. Everything is there, and everything is correct. However, none of my documents will load, it just says to try later. And later it's the same thing. Highly annoying and inconvenient.",
"This app completely sucks! The entire my chart system needs serious improvement but, at least, the actual site recognizes my log in information! Not so with the app, so I cannot review any of it's functions! Since I do not need this app in order to use the my chart portal system for my medical care, it's history!",
Easy and quick. Very understandable,
I am not very skilled with a cellphone and I have no laptop skills nor do I know how to use all the Apps on my cellphone and some websites and portals are not phone friendly but this App is amazing and I have been able to learn how to use it. I am not sure why but not all of the features work but I do not think it is due to this App. I wish all practioners I see and hospitals I go to were connected so I would be able to use this one easy to use App plus there is at least one video that explains.,
"Easy to use once you are in w/ the organization. Unclear how to add another organization and how to add someone else's MyChart to mine. My mother in law has an acct & we've tried to add her acct, by sharing it, since I'm her caregiver, to make it easier when scheduling other appts.",
"I like how easy it is to use, talk to your physician , etc. The only thing I would change is the ability to enter things like the date that your last mammo or colonoscopy was done, or to update those items.",
I love this app! As I have numerous doctors and some are outside my network I find having this app available to pull up test results and medications allows me to provide all of them with the same information. It's fabulous.,
I know it's meant to simplify sand allow you access and control of your care but it's also convoluted and incomplete. Ultimately it is frustrating.,
Constant Error The app and site will not let me sign up. I fill out my information and it keeps telling me it couldn't read my Captcha. Every single time. So I guess I won't be using this app since it won't let me sign up.,
This app has been such a relief especially during quarantine. I have been able to contact all my sons doctors and social workers affiliated with Mychart. Also request refills and message doctors with concerns anytime of the day. They keep records up to date and in order. I love having this app.,
"This is a great app. Easier to get medication filled, read notes, schedule appointments, leave messages for my Dr. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to be on top of your medical history, and make life easier !",
"I cannot make appointments or send messages anymore. I do not like the new user interface because none of the features work or exist. So, I'm now back to calling to schedule things and request refills.",
Good way to stay in touch with appointments and recent information,
"Great app. I can see the notes of every visit. I love the fact that I can send a message to most of my providers. Great app, but some providers can't interface with it.",
"This app can be difficult to use. It isn't fair that I can't check a message at midnight or after. Plus, I used my password and it won't let me in. Says server error. I'm tired of trying to get into things after midnight and being told this. Ughhhhhh. Please fix.",
Very convenient and easy to manage,
Something changed with this app it stopped working properly. Not sure when. I had to come to the reviews to find the Support contact information? That is sad. I also cannot see any messages sent to my Dr.,
"I enjoy the app but I do not check it very often. This causes me to miss appointments because apparently, this is my reminder. I still need the auto texts to remind me. When I get that back, my rating will be 5 stars.",
Easy to use and when it's not glitching it's great. It never lets me go to billing and sometimes it glitches when I try to schedule an appointment so I end up having to call,
Very good information based 👍,
Very user friendly app,
"Great when it works, but areas of app only work sometimes. Also some features are only available on the desktop version.",
"No I don't like it. My experience with it has not been great at all. A lot of times it won't load, or you can't find the exact thing you need. Sometimes once you open something it isn't exactly what you need and then you can't find what you do need. You can't be sure if someone has read it or someone is going to actually help you. Apps are great but human reaction is sometimes a lot better.",
"This is the best app to keep track of all your meds, vitals, notes, appointments, test results and so much more. You would being not only your self a favor but also any health care provider as well.",
Great app for keeping informed. Always being reminded of appointments and can easily check in and pay my copay before hand. And they don't take it from my account until I've been seen! And so many of my doctor's are linked here and I can see all their notes all in one app!,
"Always very helpful, very useful for past and present appointments and stored test results addresses and phone numbers, also have a list of your medications right at your fingertips! I live this app.",
"It is frustrating when it shows a 6 on the face of the app and when you enter, you cannot find what or where the 6 items might be... You asked me to rate your appand there is no Submit button!",
Convenient and reliable and informative,
"I am running Android 10 on my moto g7 and still no fix for apps return to home page, or even previous page. Still must close app all together and log back in to return to home page. This for each time you select a feature or link.",
"Tried to book GI appt, processed for a long time, couldn't find any appts, app only allowed searching by single date at a time. Couldn't chat with nurse or doctor to ask question. Couldn't launch a video visit. Didn't have my families info or allow to add it even though many family have been to this health system before. Forgot login and had to pwd reset, didn't allow email or cell login or login with Google/Amazon/apple like other apps. Will never remember this random username.",
"I really like this app! Its very handy and works well for it what it is designed to do. 4 stars and will raise. Don't quite get why all medical info isn't kept here, that would be extremely helpful if it was. As I continue to use it, I will know more, it is 5 star worthy.",
"Can't access my information because my hospital group is not listed. It's one of the largest in the Chicago area. If I can't see my info, this app is worthless to me. Edit: Epic Systems, they use it. Their instructions don't work because they don't show up in your app. Stop making excuses. 0 stars for that weak response.",
"I'm trying to make a Video Dr.Visit with Dr. Tiffany Ward , I have been trying to get my phone Video Visit with Dr Ward and I have been trying to get it set up , but your new system is not working right and it's been since I had my last one in March and I would like to do it Now Please 🙏",
"This app is the best when it comes to My Healthcare needs. It's easy to use and if I have any questions or concerns about my health, The Drs and staff get back to me as soon as possible. I love UF-Health and I love My MyChart. I recommend this app and the Drs and staff at UF-Health. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who needs information regarding their own personal health needs. Thank you, MyChart!!",
It is the best app to get her all your child medical records plus you can get there appointments on there and test results I highly recommend it I just started using this app about a little over. A year ago and it's the best app for children's hospital I get everything they end respond into messening for ny qeutuons that you have,
"Can make appts. and wait-list to check if sooner available. Test results & notes from visits posted, logged for ref. & avail. on completion, same with appts., & upcoming reminders. Text mssg. facility to ask q's & receive replies for lab. / test results and to & from the h.c. providers in one's chart, no need to wait on the phone to leave/receive verbal messages.",
"I love this app. It is easy to reach out to my doctor when I need her. I feel more connected to my doctor than I have ever before. I can review all my test results as soon as they're in, access my medication list whenever I need to- it is wonderful.",
"Wonderful healthcare app! I like that I can have everything from different providers (same network) in the same place. And I love that I can request appointments, medication refills, and chat with my doctor from home, especially now.",
This app is had to navigate. To try and find anything on here is a nightmare and for whatever reason I have to reset my password everything I login. I also have a hard time finding the information for my children. I hate using this app.,
"My daughter cannot view any of her health records. When you call, they are not that helpful and can't answer any questions. Most of the time it's speculation. They make you go in circles and then you are back to square one! I have contacted her health care organization directly and they still cannot find a way to fix it. I don't know if it's an Epic system thing or healthcare provider thing but no one seems to know what they are doing.",
"I find this app easy to use, and can quickly see test results and appointments. The only negative comment I have is the billing, it only includes the amount but I have no idea what it is for.",
I find this app way to crowded.  You must deal with the password entry every time I log in. I have been working for  2 months of trying to get on to my chart and I still have not been able too. I am close to calling it quits. GET THIS FIXED!!,
"I love my chart! I can get all my test results and even ones from the year before to compare. My labs,xray,and visits are on my chart usually within an hour or so. I like that I can message my nurse or Dr. For appointments, refills, or just get a question answered. 😇",
Buggy. Tried to review and sign consent form for an appointment. It asks you for a password. Only problem is the field is disabled so you can't enter anything. Finding a variety of bugs. It's sloppy work. You should hire me to do QA. :),
"Excellent app however need all test results too show in being thorough not just the name of test you had done ,my chart blames the doctors however doctors state they have nothing to do with that it's my chart that controls the features ,etc what is able to be seen !",
I like using it very much its easy to understand and use.,
"I enjoy this app, I am often notified of Test results before the Dr. I can also easily provide dates of procedures",
This app is fantabulous!! Except when you forget both user name & password! **I haven't used 4 a long while! ** On 12/19/21 ** I 4got again the whole shabang! It was over a year ago that I had redone ALL info! Again today.Don't remember what the problem was? User/equipment error or something like that 🤓 I really appreciate this App AND the security is vaaavaaavooom! Not easy to get in App w/out ALL the privacy ?'s answered. Can't wait to send PCP medical records of mine & family history🙂,
I love my chart it is a great app thanks 👍👍,
Needs improvement. Alot of freezing up and alot of glitches. However the 2 video appointments I've had has turned out well. Get the other things fixed and I'll change my ratings,
"I love working with this app. It will tell the doctors or others all my information. My drugs I take , all the people I wanted to be contacted. Even my past surgery, shots ,etc. Plus if anything big really needs to be done. It's my choice so my love one don't have to make that choice. Plus a donor or not. If they need to save .",
This app is awesome when it comes to keeping up with your loved ones in the hospital. I knew all about my husband's problem and progress when he had Covid and I could not visit. All I needed to know was posted in this app. I knew more about my husband's health daily than he did. Highly recommend it.,
"Absolutely love this App!!!!! Highly Recommend it, I never have any problems communicating with my Dr. Always get notifications when necessary. Great way to keep up on your health and all results.",
Loved using this app. UNTIL they decided to update and change it. IF IT IS NOT BROKE DONT FIX IT. SO FRUSTRATING!!!,
"GREAT app! Very user-friendly ... and simply ... just easy to navigate. It makes sense where things are, which is - in my opinion - something that isn't THAT often found!",
Its really very helpful for me as a patient. In the presence of mychart i feel my doctor and his very caring team is always with me . But need to create a new feature in the app to provide proscribed medicine to overseas patients when medicine is finish and patient can not vist usa.,
"This is usually a great app, but one of my after surgery reports has now disappeared, and my March lab and Dr.s appointment did not transfer to my calendar, did not send messages to me (which I usually get) and when I checked on nephrology appointment, I do not believe these were in my list of appointments.",
very convenient and user friendly to use,
I have 3 tumors so my medical life begins. I thought this was greatest app ever until I paid my car insurance payment and it showed up in this app...now I'm trying to delete app and it's looking as if I may have to pay someone to remove info that they should never had been given access to at all.,
"I love going to the deharo clinic on Westmoreland there the best , ms.dorothy,Ms.Lydia,Ms.Victoria, everyone in adult medicine 5 is great people and I got to mention everyone in the Lab's department Ms.Natalie and the whole Lab's crew is great at Deharo Clinic on Westmoreland",
"I have always liked MyChart, Which is a beneficial app to keep track of appointments, test results and bill pay. After my husband's bypass surgery, I really appreciate how helpful it is, as I could see all his test results and charting.",
"Enjoying the app and giving me lots of information about my visits, appointments, and listed doctors who I see. My only complaint about the app should have a HOME return link when navigating to another page. Really irritating that I have to use a back return on my phone.",
"I like using my chart, but it would be nice if you had direct list of immunizations. I find it difficult to locate this information. I wish that my x-rays, and any mris would be displayed.",
I love this app because I can check on my appointments and get fast test results. Also it's easy to do E-check in. Tje only problem I have is that I can't set it up with a code number to open it. I had ot that way but then it went away and I can't get it back,
Very informative and intuitive,
MyChart makes it easy to communicate with my doctors. I can see most of my test results so I have an idea of what to talk about when I am speaking to my doctor or someone from their office.,
"Really convenient app to access you health information and schedule appointment. However, it needs a virtual meeting integration to make it a complete bundle. Will give it a 5 stars when that happen.",
I've barely been on here so far. But the features and user interface is super clean and exceptionally easy to use. I'm very impressed by this little app.,
"It's an ok app, easy to use but not a fan of always having to leave the app to view things in my browser. I could just use the browser and save time.",
"Great way to keep track of appointments, mess, etc. Especially like the ability to email doctor's office staff. Office visits are always followed up with details of the visiy",
Not bad but too cluttered. A third of a home screen is taken up to trying to get me to link to Inova Health System -- and it won't go away and cannot be dismissed. The app insists that I need a fourth Covid vaccination even though my doctor says that is not recommended for me at all.,
"I am very forgetful. Even if I write things down I will sometimes lose them. However, with this app I can always go back and find just what I need. Because of this app I have always been on time and have never missed an appointment. This app has made me and my Doctors proud. Keep up the good work. Thank you!",
"I use the my chart app for uclh. I am having issues with the app, it won't log me in despite me checking if my login details are correct. It let's me log in if I go via the website, but not the app. I prefer using the app over the website. I get the following message when I try via the app ""we couldn't log you in right now, please try again"". I have tried multiple times and I still can't log in via app. I've checked if I have the correct hospital on the app and I do.",
I absolutely love this app. It allows me to keep in contact with my doctor and refill medications I can check all yest results and see all appointments. It is critical for my health and well being.,
"I love this app. It's very easy to use and navigate..I love that I can communicate with my Doctor's and anything I need , and I can find everything I need to is on my eckhart so I don't have to pester anyone in the office or the doctors and nurses. And they get back to me quick...I think it's one of the best ways to communicate with the whole medical team. Love it!!",
"This is one of the best apps I've ever used. I love the ease of access and that I don't have to spend a ton of time searching for things. It is extremely organized with clear, concise sections. It also cuts down on lots of wasted time for the patient and doctor. This app is simply the best!",
"I can get test,x~rays,labs even messages from my health care providers getting messages to th are even easier to reviewing my men's getting request to refill . But what I find is the medical library it's totally awesome I can get answers to any test result find out about medications if there are gernic brands what to watch out for side effects since I'm elderly & have diabetes also heart related issues I'm SOoo very happy with pleased with my chart",
The new app is much easier to use annd has more freatures.,
This app has made my opinion of MUSC double in gratitude. The ease of use and quick communication with the doctors through MyChart has saved my family 1000s of $ in gas and travel. We live an hour+ away and used to have to come in for every little question but MyChart has changed all of that nonsense. Development and tech support deserve every penny they are paid and more. Can not say enough about how MyChart has helped my family receive better and more convenient health care. A++++++++,
"Great way to keep up with appointments, communicate with doctors, pay bill, and with ""zoom"" can go over paperwork, next step care, or anything that doesn't require in-person exams. No complaints!",
"Tons of false notifications. I keep getting notified that I have a new test result, or new message, or new reminder, and when I access the app, the actual data is a year old. Fix!",
Good to get my medical information all in one place. Timely test results.,
All info in one place and easy to use.,
"Absolutely easy to use, especially to send messages to my PCP regarding medications and to view my after-visit summaries. Smooth sailing, never a problem with the app.",
Very easy to use and always has my upcoming appointments scheduled for me. Let's me enter them into my calendar and I can easily access my med list and surgery lists. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! 🤗,
Slow. Times out and crashes often. Missing tons of necessary features. Clunky. The amount of money upmc charges you'd think they could put some into app development,
Always good...asks to reset password too much too often...it is a pain to always try to change and they done get a code to you at all or slow very slow. I just ignore because it is too much trouble...lighten up!!!,
Very easy to share info between organizations and to login to multiple organizations at the same time. Only issue is UX experience with appointment and notifications could be slightly improved with better organization.,
Payment options stink. I've made payments through the app and they applied the payment. I prepaid an appointment and the doc asked me to come earlier. The app never charged me for the time change.,
Easy to navigate and quick test results. Biometrics makes sign-ins quick and easy.,
The best thing that has happened to me since cellphone. Lol! I can check my appointments and send messages to my doctors that gets back to me in minutes sometimes. I can check in before arriving for my appointments. Should I go on? Love it!,
I have recently installed this and it should have benefits as long as it is on time with the delivery of information For example all the information for my appointment came through after I had seen the Consultant. Luckily paperwork had been sent a few weeks earlier. I will reserve judgement on the app as to whether it delivers relevant information in correct timing.,
When you need to keep your medical records together. This app is a great way of taking care of that without the paper. Every test and the results are keep by date so that you don't have mishaps in regards to that. I recommend this app for people who want to keep a healthy living.,
"Brilliant app 🙂 so very easy to use and stress free. Your able to see your up coming appointments before you receive a letter, and you can see all your past hospital visits as well as test results you've done and so much more.",
This is clearly the best health portal I have ever used. A great layout makes it so easy to navigate through and learn what you need. This portal has many great features.,
"This is very easy to use. My medical information is always correct and up to date. Scheduling, changing appointments and billing information is much easier done here rather than a phone call.",
"My chart gives me access to my medical data. It's really empowering. I also like the rescheduling feature, which saves a phone call to the office.",
"It's helps me keep up with what I've covered on my health but sometimes it won't let me make corrections. Such as my Annual Wellness Exam was already done September 14, 2021 but MyChart says I'm overdue. If I go for another exam before September my insurance won't pay for it. I can't correct it.",
"Unable to edit medical relations name and relationship, so dr does not get correct infornation in echart.",
Works great when it works. Just uninstalled and reinstalled. Wish me luck. Talked to tech support last week they were aware of problem?? Must be a dinger cause I still had issues days later,
It's good that it has all appointments on there.You can also keep track of all medications as well.What I do have a issue is contacting the provider thru the app.It will take weeks or not at all for a response from provider(well I'm sure that's on provider not app),
"Pretty good, but there are actions ""due"" when I've already had those appointments. I don't know how to get rid of them. It's confusing sometimes because I'm not sure if my Dr keeps ordering the appointment or if it's glitchy app.",
Won't let you move back and forth after you select an option. Once you are in lab results for instance you are stuck there until the app times out,
organized and easy to follow,
Easy to use. I love being able to see all of my test results and upcoming appointments. They send you an email and you get a notification. You can check in early for your appointments using the app.,
Was working until a couple of days ago. Couldn't log into my medical account for several days so I uninstalled it and tried to install it again. Now it will not install. Must be a glitch either in my phone (Galaxy S21 Ultra) or the app is having issues.,
I Like this App. I'm Connected to All my Doctor's. In one App. I can Send Messages to everyone at same time. All my Doctor's can click and Review my Lab work. Discuss to me and each Doctor about any treatment. Receive Appointment Reminders. Have my Prescription's faxed ordered. This app is Awesome. Easy to use and get set up. Greatful I have a great Health Care Team on this App. We are All on same page. I can ask Nurse any medical ? This is very Safe and Secure App to use. I recommend it.,
sometimes the app won't load. Also the doctor's are not checking messages. this part could be because of the doctors. I have also noticed that I can't use the symptoms checker or schedule appointment or do televisits from the app.,
Great response from my medical team at prisma health and the app is spot on keeping up my appointments thanks,
"Doesn't work after last android update. And, apparently after several conversations with EPIC they have no clue. Sad, it was a good app. To bad no one can fix the problem.",
"This app keeps telling me I need to schedule certain medical procedures. But, after scheduling and having procedure, the reminder stays up and I can't get rid of it! Incredibly annoying!!",
Thank you for helping the communication level for health improvement,
"My chart is wonderful for seeing lab results, communicating with caregivers etc. I just wish one could see ALL their lab results at once, example, when a CMP or CBC is drawn, they should open up that way, rather than one lab result at a time. That gets tedious.",
"Very useful app for all your medical records and appointments. Although not perfect, it does work very well. Nice to order prescriptions online. I like the app and use it regularly.",
MyChart is very helpful to keep track of all your tests..,
"Have been using it for awhile now. Trying to connect for a couple of days now and keep getting an error about not connecting to server. Uninstalled it and installed it again, same error.",
Amazing experience it just makes appointments s easy Andi love that I can get my test results straight though my chart as well as look through past visits and testing! Being able to msg my Dr at any given time for questions is probably one of the smartest ideas I def recommend!!!,
Duke is the best and this app reminds me of appointments down to routine things that need to be done. I can message my doctors and they always respond within 24 to 48 hours. I can request appointments and refills and all. I love it.,
Great to have access to my health information at my fingertips.,
Love this app very detailed and easy to navigate,
I have many chronic illnesses and is sometimes difficult to keep my doctor appointments in order. But this app made my life 20 times easier. And communicate with my doctor easier.,
Love MYCHART! Makes life so much easier and way more convenient!!! My fav part is the messaging and the in demand appointments!!,
I love being able to stay in touch with my medical history and my doctors.,
Wonderful!!! I love being able to contact my doctors at the touch of an email!! All questions answered. Appointments made and canceled. Bills paid!!! It is truly a wonderful app!!! So easy to use.,
"I love being able to see test results, my meds, messaging providers adding appointments to my calendar. What I don't like is that they took away the ability to see sent messages.",
"Get app to be able to try to get in touch with doctors and schedule appointments. But when you go to message or even past visits, it pops up with a error screen most of the time.",
"I love having my medical chart available at my fingertips. It is very nice to be able to message my physician when I need to, see my labs and make appointments. In addition I have access to other medical information from different medical services other than my primary physician services. It is all at my fingertips on one site.",
I would give MyChart a 5 if I could ever get on the app. It's an awesome program but 'sucks' when I need to access it and can't. Like now. I'm trying to preregister for an appointment today but keep getting messages as to why I'm not able to get on.,
"Wont opem. Says there is newer option, but it does not update. Black box comes up and says there is newer version of mychart. I had brought down version 4.4.2. Is there a newer version? I click ok but there is no link to the newer version. There should be one.",
App is good. One improvement could be eliminate duplicate notifications. These are distracting and time consuming.,
For some reason it will not let me log in no matter how many times I reset my password. I can only log in online and 90 percent of the time its touch and go. I know my stuff but I can't access it and its entirely too frustrating and not worth the stress,
It seems they fixed the issue now. Original issue: Can't login. It shows a loading indicator and never finishes loading when logging into Baptist healthcare.,
Important to oneself to be able to utilize this app for quicker results knowledge and connections to Dr. I pray this app is considered a extreme high attention to security thus protecting us.,
"I love MYCHART, bit I've had problems where the app wouldn't load (error). I've had to un-download it and re-download. So far no issues.",
Great way to keep in touch with your medical records and status,
"Was a great app until they released 9.5.2, which made 9.5.1 unusable. But 9.5.2 is not currently available for my Android 10 phone, and my email to the developer is unanswered (except the automatic reply) after nearly two weeks. This is not a game app, it is an app for medical info, and the developer needs to realize that people are relying on it.",
The PC version is more robust. The app does not have a printing feature for letters/forms often required for registrations. It is view only at this time.,
"I have underlying health issues and the MyChart app allows me to have the freedom of checking lab work, consulting with my Dr or scheduling appointments. Its very easy to navigate. Im very happy that this app was developed.",
Love it shows me everything I need to know,
"Every time I try to open the billing icon, the app crashes. I've been trying to open the app all day, and it seems to be frozen. Not sure how this has a score of 4.3 to be honest.",
"This is a great secure way to pay bills-also paperless!👍 I can access test results, send a message to the doctor and see upcoming appointments. Also the app works without glitches.",
"I love everything about the portal. I can go back and check results of previous tests, check appointments, message with questions. It's so convenient!",
App suddenly gives error communicating with server on my Samsung S20 FE mobile phone. I can still access it from my computer and have reinstalled app from play store a couple of times but no change.,
I like the fact that I can be able to one app to communicate with all my doctors on makes it so much easier than having to call so many different offices I just wish my ENT office and OB/GYN was with AHN so they could be all with the same thing and I can communicate all with them underneath the same app and make it so much easier so that way they could help take care of me get the best care I need !!,
Recent update was great with the large easy to read but having the two charts separate and not combined made the app worthless. I might just as well use the websites.,
When i tried to set up account and after i entered much info it says cant sign you up deletes all my entered data. Most programs give you the courtesy of telling you what info is incorrect so you can fix it. Your program deletes everthing so you dont know what you entered the program doesnt like. Program not user friendly,
It's awesome. Saves much time and money.,
"Very easy to Navigate. When I have an appointment scheduled I add it to my calendar directly from the MyChart app. With available notifications, its a breeze!",
"This app is awesome! I have all my info in the palm of my hand. My appointments, labs, meds and I can send and recieve messages to and from my dr. I couldnt ask for a better app. Try it for your self! I give it two thumbs up!👍🏿👍🏿",
It was 5 stars but for a long time now I haven't been able to make appointments or look up available times....thats the worst cause it made things so much easier and the feature I used the most.,
"Really love this App! Would give 10 Stars if I could! After being in a severe car accident, am using this app everyday for appointments, pushing paperwork to insurance companies, adding with a click - my Doctor Appointments to my phone calendar. Has Doctor phone address info. This app has made recovery so much easier. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
"Great until recent update.After update, I have been logged out. To log back in, I have to pick a provider. However, my provider is no longer listed!! What happened to my provider?? They still use MyChart, but now I can't access my info!!! 😡",
"Exceptional app for keeping all of mine and my children's medical information on one place. I can see all medications, all upcoming appointments, and reminders for annual appointments. I can request prescription refills easily and send messages to my doctor if needed.",
Clean interface. Very convenient to stay up to date on necessary physical check ups. I wish they had a mental health section on this app. :),
"It is a great app it allows me to keep up with my medical chart, I love this app I don't have to go out in the cold don't have to worry about slipping on the ice and most of all don't have to worry about being in a crowd and possible covid exposure everything is at my fingertips couldn't be happier get the app it's great",
"This app is getting steadily better. I use it with 3 different medical systems, and it switches back and forth smoothly, while still respecting security.",
Got this app and went through all the hoops just to use video call with doctor. When launching video call it gives generic error saying can't connect and contact customer support. Useless.,
No real use for the app. It's too limited compared to the actual website and missing links it should have in order to be truly useful. No point in keeping it installed.,
"Fast, easy to access, and simple to use!",
"Previously rated this app ""A"" grade; MAJOR error message issues since developer upgrade Nov 2018!!; Upgraded version should *never* have been released until these app errors/bugs were resolved! Very poor.",
"Messages sent do not show up for the recipient to view. (Update) The messages issue seems to have been fixed. Scheduled appointments display the incorrect site location and address, sending patients to the wrong site.",
It provides excellent access to answer questions on healthcare from my direct providers. Quick response on filling prescriptions also. I would only say it could be a little easier to navigate.,
"Great to use, but I don't like that it's impossible to get it updated. There are two conditions that I do not have that show up on my MyChart record and that really bothers me. Is it a HIPPA problem?",
"Love it. Use it all the time. Helps communicate with my children's pediatrician, as well as my and my spouse's physicians. Refill requests are simple, and the app is easy to use",
"App no longer connects. I can sign on through a web browser, but the app does not allow sign in. Says there is an error in communication with the server. Overlake hospital.",
"I LOVE THIS APP Extremely user friendly I am very forgetful &this app reminds me of appts &will even add to my phone calendar for me I always receive a response quickly if I send a DM to my Dr. It makes visiting Dr/asking Dr questions so much easier, faster &less stressful! You can make your appts online &choose which Dr. you want to see You also directly see your test results as soon as they are available, before you get the call from the Dr, or any of your medical history on file. Amazing!!",
It's good but pity it doesn't sync with the NHS app,
"I am always happy to see my test results and to be able to message my doctors. However, I am extremely tired of receiving notifications about messages and test results which are either non-existent or not new!",
"Sucks that this app does not exchange data with other similar med apps. I have similar apps for my GP, my dermatologist, and my cardiologist. Same review for all: similar ease of use, etc., blah blah. ZERO STARS for sharing data. All of you please get your collective act together and share patient data with other apps. Develop open standards with compliance tests. Promote a compliance logo. Do not tell my why this is difficult or impossible. Make it happen. Else you fail hard.",
"This app is extremely easy to use and had many features that they always update as new features become available. I've been using it for years now and even with multiple providers, it's still the best.",
"Terrible, can't get my results even though I received a call. Locked my account even though I NEVER logged in to begin with, tried creating a password, said it was too weak, made a stronger password, said it was to weak as well, then I put the SAME password back in,success? Attempt to login, said my information is ""Invalid"" after JUST creating my account and copy pasting my exact information. Called the help line, no help or response. How do you disable an account without even logging in at all?",
"Both the app and website are very hard to use. I have spent an hour or more, trying to log in to get a copy of my medical records, to no avail. I cannot sign in, get an activation code or user name. It really should not be this damned difficult! I hate this system! It is useless! :P",
"Worst medical app I have ever used. Error after error. Once you finally get in, it looks cheap. You cant find anything, test results have to go to browser to see. Very useless. Waste of your time. Its a joke.",
"I love the My Chart app. It has all the information you would need like your doctors visits, after summary reports, blood work results, billing etc. It is A very easy app to use.",
The app doesn't seem to want to play sound through bluetooth earbuds. The sound keeps coming from the speaker of the phone which is verry annoying in meetings.,
The MyChart app has been very professional and concise!,
"Wont allow me to stay logged in, have to re-enter password every time. Dosent give alerts. Hospitals assume that because they hide a post in there, then you recieve it. Another step towards customer service is done by the customer.",
"Have used it for years without issues. Recently uninstalled/reinstalled due to lab results not showing. Now works great on Samsung Tab 2, but still not functional on Pixel 2",
"It's great for me. My children not so much. Once my kids hit 10yo I no longer have full access to their accounts. I can't see medications, Refill them, can't see test results. I can make appointments, but I can't see them after they're scheduled or cancel or reschedule them. My 16yo can't make his own account. And the clinic can't seem to fix The app is great for me bc I have full access. I can see my test results, message my doctors, schedule appointments, see my medications & request refills",
This app works so well that when I was in the hospital I got to view things that was happening to me before the doctors came into my room. I also can get test results back before I visit my doctor at his office. I don't have to wait and worry. It's also a great way to see different doctors all at the same time. I can take better control of my care. Better proactive.,
"What's the point of this app at least Montefiore version, smdh!!! me and my sons information is never up today I always complain to the doctors about it but unfortunately they cant do anything because they dont manage the app, so im not blaming then. Me and my son have Our primary provider but I could never make an appointment through the app, when ever i could make an appointment there aren never any appointments available this app is more of headache then a an actual working app. Smh...",
Info is incorrect a lot of the time,
I live this app.! It's been a life saver for me. Easy to see what I have coming up and easy to schedule appointments also easy to find out test preparation and results! Making appointments so much easier and the early sign I. Are great! 👍👍👍,
MyChart app was made available the same day I received my first appointment. All needed information can be accessed through the app. Information and contact with my Doctor made through the app before my first appointment. Easy to use. Very pleased with this app.,
"Haven't noticed an increase in communication or efficiency from my health care provider. Another app, login, and password to receive the same outcome. At least the GIANT health care company was able to save some money and fire a couple of employees.",
"Great App, now let's see if you can fix the health care system, it seems to me having a really nice fast car with out tires and a motor would be useless.",
"This is a great app. Especially, for patients of John's Hopkins Hospital. It makes things so easy and there are NO ads. You can email your doctor directly. You can read your test results privately on your phone. You also can make and cancel appointments and much,much more!",
Excellent way to communicate with the Drs. Office. Dr. ZHAI reviews my blood pressure often and noticed a drop in pressure and changed my meds. They respond right away and it gives me a sense of having 24 hour care accessible. Everyone should use this tool.,
"I enjoy using MY CHART! Every appointment and test results, etc are quickly posted for you to see. Even on the same day. The only wish I have would be able to actually SEE your exrays or MRI's! Maybe in the future?! Keep up the good work!",
"I do not like that it sends a notification that you have a message and when you log in it doesn't take you to the message right away, you have to fish around to find it. And it doesn't update messages about re-sign ins.",
"Great, simple and effective tool at your fingertips. Especially when all your doctors are in the same network. Need a prescription refill, too easy. Need to message your doctor at 0200, too easy. Need to download your entire Health Summary, too easy.",
Love this option. Usually here answer fairly quickly.,
"No notifications or emails. My doctor sends me messages and unless I go into the app, I do not get them. I verified both Email and device notifications ARE enabled.",
"MyChart is a very advanced Patient Portal. You can see test results, after visit summaries, medication lists, and messages from practitioners all in one site. I also keep track of my health and pay my bills here. It was very well thought out and I am happy to use it frequently.",
Iris is the best. Don't have to worry with long holds on the phone. I get early test results before the office calls. Refills w/o calling in and so much more. It's just convenient for me overall.,
"I enjoy using my chart to schedule appointments.. I really appreciate being able to Post a reminder a Day early.. It has saved my Bacon numerous times.. I love how I can send messages , view All doctors And renew my meds.. I enjoy being able to ask questions about a procedure.. Thx. Epic for a great app. ...!!!",
"Doesn't allow me to sign up. I fill out all the information, but once I get to the ""I am not a robot"" it will show the green checkmark then once I press submit it takes the checkmark away and say ""you must answer the CAPTCHA"" and the red beating heart loading screen pops up then the app crashed after a few minutes",
"Have been using this app for years. It has steadily improved & very user friendly. Everything so easy to access & to send health information to another physician if need be. Can view medications & renew them, health summary, message your physician & much more. Very satisfied.",
"Love this app. I like being able to schedule or cancel appointments. See my lab results. Check when is my next appointment, requesting medication refills or messaging my doctors office. Holds a lot of information. I use it all the time",
I'd have to say this is one of the hardest apps I've ever tried to get a hold of a doctor on or just to send a simple message that my appointment that I scheduled while I was at the office is not showing up on my chart. They seriously need to rethink this and make it use a friendly because it is not that at all,
"Simple, user friendly, faster response",
"Used to use this app all the time it was great. Now every time I open app and try to log in I get ""Unable to log in, please try again"". And when I click on email epic it sends me to PayPal. I have erased and reloaded app twice... no difference",
Hit and miss with labs .some labs show like in minutes others hours after nurse already told me. In hospital you can't message any of those Drs lab questions it only sends to PCP who was not ordering Dr so has no clue why or what numbers need to be for the one part you are needing answers. Very frustrated about not being able to explain this to my disabled son who is the patient or his mom who is at home taken care of all those issues while I am up in the hospital with son.,
I like seeing my results and appointment reminders.,
"I can't log in. I can't access my emergency contacts to update information, or to remove my ex from the list. Biometric login isn't even an option anymore. This is completely unacceptable.",
"Great communication tool, been using it for 5 years. Have medications, appointments and communication at your finger tips. Wish all medical facilities communicated with each other as well.",
"I had no problem until the update now I get the error msg. Saying I timed out, contact to get password update. I called Christie Clinic and she said she sees no problem. Deleted app and reinstalled. Same message. Why update? I see many having problems. Needs fixed ASAP",
"All your medical needs in one convenient app. Research doctors, facilities, make appointments, check results, and billing all through the app! Conversations and information between specialists; even secretaries available at your fingertips.",
"What did i ever do without this app. This gives me complete control over all my medical information. I haven't had any bad issues yet. So easy to ask my doctor questions that come up in the middle of the night, by the time i wake up i have an answer from My doctor at to what to do. Love it love it love it.",
I have found it very helpful with medical records doctor's appointment and other information that you may need it is really easy to access without having to go to your doctor's office or call.........,
It's a very useful tool except for the fact that I can't submit a payment using my credit card. I enter in my card information but the submit button gets hidden under the back and cancel buttons and it won't scroll down for me to access it.,
"Quick, efficient and effective",
I had a covid test today at a CVS drive-thru testing site they told me to download this app and start a new account bc this is where the result will be reported. I tried multiple times and the app keeps telling me it can't verify my identity. And I can't find a number to call for help to set up an account.,
"AFTER 20 MIN. OF WAITING FOR A VERIFICATION CODE JUST SO I COULD SIGN INTO THE APP, I GAVE UP. IF THIS IS THE LEVEL OF SERVICE I CAN EXPECT ONCE I'M IN THE APP FORGET IT. YOUR LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE NOT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE CODE SPEAKS VOLUMES OF WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED ONCE INSIDE THE APP. CANNOT DELETE FAST ENOUGH. PLEASE SAVE ANY LAME RESPONSE YOU MAY HAVE, IT ONLY MAKES YOU LOOK MORE DESPERATE AND PATHETIC. ZERO STARS",
This app is wonderful. I use it for 2 Drs. Unfortunately the others use the ascension portal which is a joke. I wish all Drs used this one. I left ascension software people a note to look at this one to see all the stuff you can do with this I highly recommend MyChart.,
"This is an excellent tool to help you manage all of your medical information: see test results, send messages to your doctors, get prescription refills, scedule appointments, read after-visit notes, check in for appointments, fill in pre-visit forms, and other data as well. It's very useful and cuts down on paper waste, too.",
"FIXED! awesomeness! Thank you. I cannot understand WHY this is rated #2. It isn't. Its THE BEST app ever! It isn't JUST for covid info. It has ALL your medical needs in one little package. All my stuff from cardiologist, nephrologist and endo in one spot. Logically. : ) NO ADS.",
"Great! So far I didn't use it yet tho, kind of jumping the gun with asking 4 a review already so I really give it 0 stars but if it's a great site I don't want to mess up their reviews. They're lucky I feel like being nice especially since I just had a big Q tip up my nose too far for comfort😝",
"I love MyChart. It is easy to use, live video visits, love that I can request my refills online and send messages to my providers, have only had a few hiccups with video visits but otherwise awesome app.",
Excellent way to esign up & not have wait in line.,
It's a great experience to have all of my healthcare providers in one app. I suggest they show the name of the organization at the top of each menu so we know in which provider's app we are in. Thanks,
"It is not very easy to use, it is difficult to understand what the alerts are for e.g. an opening for an appointment when I don't need any, and it is imposible to update i.e. covid vaccine shots (it took 5 mo for you to acknowledge I'd had my second shot, let alone my first).",
"This app is great for managing my ongoing health care appointments, especially their use of including links to virtual appointments by zoom, so I can easily find the link to click on to join the appointment on yhe scheduled day/time of the appt.",
I'm not very knowledgeable with this type of technology but this is very easy to use.,
This app Sucks. You set up automatic payments and then all of a sudden they decide its not enough and then no longer accept automatic payments and you get a nice little notice from a collector.,
What happened!!!! I keeping getting a server error. I can't even access the app anymore. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app still get the same error.,
So easy to use. It saves time.,
Love it!!! I enjoy having all of my health information in one place... easy access & so easy to be navigate thru. Keep up the great work with conforming to our current day & age situation of a pandemic we are all in & making it so much safer & easier to participate in our own health care.,
Can the password recovery feature be fix in the app and website please .. I'm on my 5 day waiting for the code ...for a person like my with memory lost problems and not having my notes on hand ..I get lock out a lot . If the feature would work it will really help us and save you money on customer service!! ..just read your answer..why do you think I asked to be fix on the website too? BECAUSE IS THE SAME PROBLEM THERE!!!..READ THE FIRST LINE!!!,
It is fairly easy to find information. It could be made easier. I think it should bee possible to disable seing info that one does not want.,
I hate it. It's ridiculous. I have never been able to get into my chart. It's either the user name is wrong or the password. They send a passcode that is only available for 10 minutes. I go with in a minute and there's always something invalid. So give me a number to call but they don't answer the phone or they are to incompetent to help you. What a joke! I don't think there really is a my chart.,
The app is very easy to maneuver. It avoids having to wait on the phone to leave messages for your provider. You can handle all of needs in the app.,
It would've been nice if we knew the icon for this app is not the AHN symbol. I looked and looked for the AHN blue and green diamond. As a result I had to do a telephone visit instead of a video visit. It's just that simple. Tell patients the app is a red chart and not the AHN trademark blue and green diamond,
"I so appreciate the ease of this app & the amount of information that can be so readily accessed & shared. I love the integration of paperwork, directions, appointment confirmations & provider background information. It's so helpful! Thank you.",
It is by far the best app Tells you about any think your doctor tell or do Using this app is a great way to communicate thank you,
They were very courteous with explaining everything to me and I really appreciate their help,
"Not perfect. No direct communication between me and my doctors have to use phone or email. Waste of time. We should be able to get all hospital docteurs in the same place. Like I have doctor from 4 different hospital but not able to see all in one place There answer is all way. ""Communicate with your care team.""",
Super easy to use and very convenient way to keep track of appointments not haven't to wrote them down or get a appointments card. Also nice to see results for labs and other things without haven't to wait to hear from the doctor office,
"MyChart is great. I have all my medical info in one place. The only recent downside is it sometimes indicates on the icon there is a new something to check but when you open the app it's not clear where the new item is. Message, test result, etc.?",
"My chart has been great. You can read test results, look at past notes, send and receive messages with you Doctors, and so much more. I would highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to be involved in there health.",
Was great now it doesn't work at all. I just get a blank screen. What happened? My husband can't get his to work either. There's no way to ask for help because you can't get in to do so. Is this ever going to be fixed? I emailed and it took over a week to get a response asking me for things I had already said I can't get due to not being able to get into the app. Now I have to wait as long to get maybe another response? This sucks. It was a great app. What happened? Why is it taking so long to remedy?,
1st time - no or very little audio. Login and connection issue. 2nd time - average connectivity. Had to requ est assistance by separate call from another phone.,
We it works kind of okay but it needs a back button to return button to navigation page/ home page. I find this irritating. Otherwise it seems to work good.,
"I love the easy access to the Dr, however I am now unable to send a new message. I've searched for a half hour now.",
I absolutely love My Chart. Super easy and convenient. Can see all your past and future visits . Message with all your doctors. Personally. Very quick responses.,
One of the best apps you can have it is very useful and easy to use and you can pretty much take care of all medical needs except physically see doctor but other than that IT THE BEST!!!!!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING IT EASY FOR US PATIENTS,
Needs to be a simple way to delete older info. Messages etc,
This app and apps like this are wonderful for patients such as myself. I can contact my doctors and team at any time and get a response whether it be by message or phone call within 24 hours.. it's quite convenient especially when you see any given doctor about once a month.,
Horrible app. I've always had a problem looking at my charts. They never seem to have their ducks in a row and the app is always crashing. I'm plagued to use this blasted app because of Trinity's push to going electronic.,
"I love my chart. Everything you need to know concerning your medical history is safely stored, you can request med refills, dend messages to your medical providers and more. This app is a source of keeping yourself up to date. I recommend anyone Novant Health patient to use the app.",
"I installed the app on my android and I am trying to sign up or create an account, but after I typed my zip code the next item is county, which I am supposed to click on my county, it will not allow me to click my county, I am signing up for Montefiore Medical, can you help with a suggestion. I downloaded thru Google play. TY",
"Nice app, easy to use and helps keep me organized",
Fast reliable information,
"Cannot use any boxes, keeps saying error occured try later. Been happening for months, about ready to uninstall and go without. Worst app ever.",
Have not been able to log in ever!!! Have requested the activation code about 10 times and still haven't received it. They send an email saying what to do but nowhere in the email or the link is there any code of any kind. It has been almost a year and I still cant log in or get help.,
"This place is amazing. Everyone is friendly, professional, and the lady that does the blood work is off the chain! First time stick everytime! My Chart is a plus. You have all your visit info and test results with you at all times.",
I can't load my payment information and also it won't verify my phone number. It's quite frustrating. My Dr wants me to use this application for everything and yet is seems to not provide all needed things. Med refill information can't be sent either. Not my favorite app.,
"I keep getting notifications via email, so I'll sign in and can't find anything new. A bit frustrating. I also have a dot on my icon but it doesn't tell me why. Maybe I'm just too low on the tech tools totem pole?",
It's wonderful. I can leave a message with my doctor and the staff at any time day or night. They reply in a good time frame. I can get my prescription refill by a touch of a button. Plus it shows all my up coming appointments in the network,
"I like how easy it is to use, in general. Two things I wish it had was a way to get in touch with drs/depts you're not presently assigned/referred to. Also, I'd like to message the IT dept for Scripps.",
My health care system does a fantastic job with this service. It helps me stay connected with my health care team and keeps all of my important health care info together all in one place. A suggestion to improve the service they should allow you to upload records that you have from places not contracted with this platform.,
"It has become the worst app ever. I used to use it for Everett Clinic and loved it. Then I went to a clinic out of town, and they insisted I load their info into MyChart. It deleted my Everett Clinic info, and now I'm having issues loading either one.",
I love MyChart it is so convenient and easy to navigate I can do anything I need to on the app even contact a nurse directly to ask a question when i did ask a question i received a response within 1 business day i have all good things to say about the app,
"It's not reading my 4-digit passcode, so I enter my user name and password. Then it switches and says to sign in with another way! Everything seems smushed together! I can't make a appt. w/NOHN because of my changing to Jamestown Clinic in September. It only shows me my future Dr there!! I need help!",
Great app for contacting your doctor and getting information.,
Tried to sign in to see my blood work results and keep getting an error 7 code,
My Chart is an excellent app. I get reminders for upcoming appointments. I receive my lab information in an easy to read format that I can share with other doctors. It is Sublime.,
"Has constant issues with biometric login and retrieval of information. When does work it is excellent, the repeated issues though make the 2 rating extremely generous.",
"No more waiting for call, or calling to make an appointment. Everything, and anything of all my medical records. Including appointments, test results, reminders to set appointment, or make appointment. ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS IN THE PALM of MY HAND.",
"This app is great, but it is my physician that is truly amazing! He is very receptive to questions and concerns sent through the app. I work nights, so the easy access to my records at anytime is a big benefit!",
This app is great at annoying you constantly. Had to delete it and change doctors because of how annoying this app is. Will notify you of your appointments at least 20x a day. Fun times. Who thought apps like this were a good idea?!,
"I really like the app, Please make it better! Paying a bill doesn't work at all in the app! Old payments are stuck in the old mychart. Fingers crossed for the future of this app.",
"I absolutely love this! what an approvement from having to hear back from doctors to get your results, now just log on MyChart and see all results, love being able to pay my doctor and lab bills on it as well, I hated writing out checks and mailing them. A+ to this!",
This is so much easier to navigate through. Definitely a plus you can keep all your doctors test results appointments in one place.,
Great App! App makes it easy to keep track of appointments and labs. Like that I can view my lab results and not have to wait for the doctor to tell me on the next visit. Also Like that I can send a message to my doctor whenever I have a question.,
"I love this app, I was previously using the app on the web, which I've been using for a while. I like the ease and quick access to my info. With this, you can log in with a password or biometrics. I like biometrics best. This is a great app. So far, no issues. 👍👍",
"Awful. Options offered aren't relevant, no phone numbers provided, no options to see alternate doctors, few options for visit reasons, and no appts available for TWO MONTHS!",
"Great for most things. Get lab results very quickly, sometimes faster than my doctor. I wish when they sent notice that on line check in is available, tell what appointment and what time. Even at the end of check in they still.",
Easy to navigate. No answer back to my questions but very nice to be able to see what they see on their end. I got answers to questions I thought I wasn't able to learn. Very useful and handy if you are interested in your healthcare.,
"I enjoy using MyChart a lot, and it makes things very easy. I am immediately notified about any test results when they come back and if my primary care provider ever reaches out to me. It's great.",
Never have problems accessing my information. I get alerts right away of any changes or messages. Makes managing my appointments and health information easy.,
"I Love using this application it's so much easier to communicate with my Doctor's and their staff, I get a phone call or a Reply within 24 hours or the same day, this app is Wonderful it also helps me keep track of upcoming test and appointments.",
"Excellent app for keeping up with doctor's appointments, medical records, medications, and almost any aspect of medical care. I wished more medical practices would use it.",
"Won't connect to servers, if you change your phones orientation before it's done logging you in it seems you back to login, it's slow and clunky",
Anytime I use biometrics I cannot log in. I use both the android and iPhone version And anytime I use biometrics to log in on my android. I am unable to log in without having to type in the password All over again. I'm not sure why this is an issue but it It is very inconvenient.,
Excellent tool saves times. Quick and easy check-in. Great accessibility to important information. Love it!,
"Without my Medical Chart I would be totally Lost without It! 👍👍 My Chart Keeps Me Informed with Everything that I need to know on Daily Basis 👍 even with All Information that I need to keep track of, Extremely Important For all the Specialists needs to know about My History as Well... ( Best Thing Who Ever Came up with this ) keeps Us on our Feet and Toes. Thank you for taking your time making ( Our Chart to be available for All Dr's Appointment's and needs So they know what's Going on...",
"I like that we can do virtual urgent care and appointments, it's like a calander just for your health without the extra steps. The sound sometimes goes out for the video but that's no biggie, I just wish some test results were more readable for us patients",
Love this app! I feel like Im so well-informed and a part of my own care. I can look up any and everything about my care all in one place. With no hassle. It's my digital medical chart right at my fingertips. 😁🫶,
Total knowledge! This app is by far the BEST app I have on my phone. I can review my visits and the conclusions my physicians make after the visit. I can make payments and view all charges to see if they are correct. I highly reccomend this app.,
This app allows me to connect with our physicians when I need to but can't make the call! Love this as I have 17-22 kids here and can't always focus on making calls productively! More time with kids and less with my phone!,
I love that I can use to access my records and test results and love that when tests post I can see them as well as Dr like everything bound to not work from time to time but overall I prefer this over having to sit on hold and wait for someone to answer phone to schedule apps and tests,
I really enjoy MyChart app it keeps me updated on my appointments. I can always review my results without waiting on the phone to speak with a person. Its very convenient with my life schedule thats already pretty busy .. lol,
"As I get older, I'm finding my health to gain importance. Having an app like MyChart on my phone, helps me to stay in touch with my healthcare team and receive timely updates on conditions that need my immediate attention.",
"App is useable once, maybe twice, and then it crashes, and crashes every time from then on. Extremely frustrating.",
Very convenient and easy to use. Results visible so quickly after visits. No wait for mail anymore. Highly recommend!,
"Pretty Good for patient's that stay up to date with the medical visits and care from your Providers. I do not like the fact that I cannot get an email to my specialist. I want to change my primary Location, due to my primary doctor, has moved or left JPS.",
Very easy to use. Initially I was accessing my record from a link to the website when I got an email notification. The app is so much better.,
"Great experience easy to move around in. Great way to keep up to date on appointments as well as the list of medications , and send your doctor private messages , Highy recommend!!!",
I find this to be a great way to communicate with my provider who is very prompt about responses. I also like the option of the video visits.,
MyChart works very well. I wish all doctors and hospitals would use it. It is very intuitive to navigate and find the information you need. Nurses and sometimes Doctors can message you.,
"I've always had a good experience using MyChart. It's a great way to interact with my doctor and his team to get questions answered, check in for appointments before getting there, etc.",
"MyChart is great you can do there schedule appointments see all your providers see your after visit summaries, upcoming appointments, lab results, send message to the providers, see a list of your medications and past receive your appointments it's an overall really great I use it all the time 😊 Thanks",
"I love this app. Because several items are properly shared, timely programmed, documented, emails, appointments, etc. at your finger tips.",
"You need to search for the messages or notification that you have been prompted to look at or read or respond to. I still have numbers on mr 'My Chart' ICON, on my home page. I don't know what they want me to look at! OTHER WISE I LIKE IT!",
"I love this app. I'm able to view my test results, refill medications and communicate with my doctor and/or staff. It's very easy to use and I've not had any problems with it.",
always recognizes my password as invalid even after completing a password reset. the login works just fine in browser so there's no need too keep struggling with this app. uninstalled,
"I absolutely love this app. I can get all of my test results, reminders for appointments, and can message your doctor also. Great app, great job!!!",
"What an awesome app to see in real time care provided and importantly, test results, instead of waiting for the follow up appointment. If your local hospital or providers use EPIC, this app is a must have use!",
"I have never installed a better app than Riverside's My Chart!! Soo much easier to communicate & get responses to/from my doctors, link to other docs/facilities & share info with my providers.",
"It's great for several things, such as: Making and verifying apps. Sending messages to your provider, and seeing most of my test results! Love this app",
I enjoy the MyChart it's convenient! Love seeing my results for me to look at when convenient and in private. I use MyChart to refer back on lots of information without calling the Dr. and waiting days! Its nice that you don't have to bother the Dr. alot and can look yourself!,
Great app! Notifies you of all your appointments. You can send and receive messages with All your medical providers. Order prescriptions. Very simple to use. I recommend it to everyone...,
"It's buggy and when you try setting up an appointment, you get a message saying to call instead. Why have the function to make an appointment through the app if it doesn't even function?",
"Why is it everytime something is supposed to be easier to use, it just makes it more confusing? Talk about changing for no reason other than to change. You already expect me to carry 100 different apps for no better reason than to just carry them. I HATE my Galaxy phone to bits.",
I love the ease of use for MyChart. All the information is easy to access and most of the time my information shows up before the doctor sees it. Great app!,
"I am very satisfied with my chart. Have good responses from all my doctors when I ask questions, and the test results are fast and easy to read.",
"Excellent, convenient, very useful, and huge time saver for all parties. Also very detailed.",
"MyChart is a lifesaver for me!! All my Washington University doctors are on it, and I can get my lab results fast. My primary care physician always comments on them as soon as they come out. It really keeps me from worrying that something is wrong. I can also message my providers with questions or concerns, and they can message me back right away. I can make appointments when I need them and even see a virtual doctor or nurse practitioner if I have an urgent health concern. MyChart is AMAZING!!!",
I am trying to log in but it impossible just to recover the username need your SSN that seems unsafe to me but when I signed up it didn't ask me for a username so apparently I am screwed This app has no support system I call the number but no one ever picks up the phone so thanks for wasting my time,
It's great. I can message my docs whenever I have a question and they get back to me quickly. I can keep up with all my tests and all my appointments in one place.,
"I love getting test results when they're ready, making and getting appointment reminders notifications and being able to check in ahead of time. Great app.",
I have been very satisfied with this app. And I just learned that the chart may be accessed by any physician after entering a code passed on by me within an hour of acquiring it. Fantastic! 👍,
MyChart is easy to use. It makes keeping track of medical information so much easier. It makes communication with doctors office so much better.,
My medical history is at my fingertips. I can easily communicate with my doctor about changes I experience without scheduling an appointment to ask a question or make a comment. Love it!,
GREAT APP. allows me to stay in contact with my doctors as well as keep up with important dates. It allows so much information at a few clicks of some keys.,
"I love using the My Chart app. It keeps you updated about everything concerning your appointments, test results and allows you to communicate with your physicians.",
"I love that I can post straight to my calendar from the MyChart. I like being able to contact my doctor, cancel appointments, do just about anything I need done on MyChart. I like the app.",
The app is very easy to use. You have all your medical records right there. I use it for my mother. Both of are signed in but I have access to her records from my account. It is so very helpful.,
I am very pleased with this app. Super easy-to-use and gives me access to all my records from different doctors and hospitals.....so long as they are all on epic.,
"You can access your health chart so quickly and easily. Check appointments, Labs and medical notes all in one spot! It's awesome!",
"It is very easy to send a message to the doctor, make appointments and it is easier to make a prescription file and be able to register for the appointment without having to wait in the clinic, this app is the best",
"I am very grateful for this app. It puts everything right at your finger tips. And, it is nice to be able to see any of the results of Lab work or Procedures that were com​pleted.",
If you don't use My Chart you should. It is so easy to use. I love it. All my medical info is there so when I go to a new Dr they can get my info. I don't have to remember or make any lists.,
Past few months couldn't see my appointments and ask for refills. Send and receive letters or messages from my doctors office. I like the old one better.,
Best idea ever before it was hard to talk to someone in the Dr's or to have proof of being clean this app is the best app ever made I love it I use it alot and it helped with getting appointments for a problem that would hve killed me if it wasn't for communication in the app,
"The app is easy to use and has all my medical records, notes, and test results. It's really nice having quick access to that information and monitor your health",
"The most useful app on my phone, an absolute revolution in healthcare. I can only hope that Epic's core value of improving people's health remains, above profits and all else.",
"Pretty easy to use once you get logged in. But, your experience also depends on your doctors, and I finally have a good one that respond to messages in the app.",
This app sucks. It makes me reset the password every two weeks. I have to add my insurance every time I log in!!!!! I hate it!,
Wonderful for tracking your medical records and options to message your providers. Not so great with the specific person you message is not who returns the message.,
"It works great, but it is sometimes confusing when it sends you emails and leads you to another area.",
"Poorly designed with no thought given to ease of use. Dog forbid if you have more than one provider. Unfortunately, I work with this apps' data daily.",
"Lots of empty promises. There is no easy way to track down a doctor. I've tried by name specialty location, department and people never show up in the search",
In the app I cannot look at my messages I can't send a message it won't let me go into my appointments it just keeps loading and loading and then sends me right back to the main home page,
"This app is perfect. I can check appts, see test results, send and receive msg and update things. I'm very happy with Memorial staff they care on professional and personal levels.",
"Way easier and it really keeps me accountable for my health. Nice to view results, x-rays and letters. So much more than a visit to your doctor.",
It's been months and I have been logging into RUHS but it keeps treating me under LLHS which doesn't even take my insurance. I haven't been able to make an appointment or anything for almost a year bc of this glitch.,
Keeps me up to date with results and appointments. Also can send and receive messages with your doctor. Order prescriptions. Does everything except tuck you in at night.,
"The app is very helpful. It's nice to be able to go and get your health information all in one place. Notes, appointments, test results are all here for my PCP, specialists, surgeons etc. can all be viewed and shared from one location.",
"I love MyChart. You can EASILY schedule an appt, reschedule, or even cancel an appt. And if you're filling out paperwork online on MyChart for the first time it'll take 5-10 minutes which can be a pain in the butt but it's worth it because when you arrive at the dr's office you don't have to fill ANYTHING out. The only thing you would have to sign is discharge papers when leaving. Love it and like my dr Bulah Parsells....great dr 🙂. Would definitely recommend dr Bulah Parsells",
It is great having my medical information in one app now. That is because both Piedmont and Emory are using my chart for their patients. Ì use one app to gain access to each patient portal.,
"best app,communicating with doctors office is easy,prescription refills easy.test results awesome,accessing medical history,awesome. smartest app idea ever. thanks",
"Wish navigation was easier to understand, also maybe more explanation of what results are. Idk really it's an okay app",
I absolutely love the new MyChart. I hope that it continues on and has big improvements over the years so it can continue to be utilized.,
Mixed feelings about this app.... It gives me notifications that I have notes or messages on my son's account but when I go to the account there is no section to click on for notes or passed appointments. When this is fixed I can re-rate,
"So easy to navigate, see test results and clinic notes after an appointment, by far the best medical app I've seen. One more reason I love the u of u clinics.",
I enjoy the ease and quick responses I receive from the staff at Presbyterian! This is easy to use and the response of reports and outcomes of test and procedures is amazing.,
This is best patient portal I have ever used. I am 80 years old and it is comforting to know that I have access to ALL my medical records and can read my doctors' notes regarding my health status.,
"This is a app that was good at first to use, but now you can't do anything with it. It always says error occurred. Just not worth keeping it on my phone if it doesn't work.",
Easy to set up and use. Gives me up to date information and shows me test results faster before the doctor can tell me. Great app!,
It's a good app. I just wish that not everybody could see your records,
Can you get past the log in screen it won't let me I've reset my password 4 times and put in the exact same password as I did before and it still won't let me in so I am just going to use the website online I put it on my home screen so it's easier for me to get to..,
"Love having all my info in one place, plus, can remind me of appointments and do pre-check ito use. Manage my bills as well. Very easy tobuse.",
"I have to log out each time to see a different lab result or when I want to see appointment, etc. I also can't compare my test results to last year's test results like I use to be able to .",
"It is very easy to navigate, have access to all test results, appointments across multiple organizations",
"Absolutely worst customer service ever!!! Emails were sent, but there was no response. My mychart doesn't work, and my best buddy is now having the same experience.",
Works great does what it needs to do wish it was a bit more interactive where I could make my own appointments without calling in or cancel them if I need to.,
Love this app I have a lot of medical stuff going on so if 1 doctor has questions about something I can get it from my chart for them if I need to get in touch with one of my providers I can I can keep up with all my appointments and reschedule if I need to and the list goes on and on it's a must have for me,
"Makes life easier. I can schedule appointments, request refills and ask questions and get a response quickly. Saves time for everyone.",
"Great experience. I love using this app for communicating with doctors. I received quick, detailed responses for all of my questions.",
Always a great way to talk with my Dr.,
Super easy love the e check in and all the things I need in one app,
I was referred to this app by a doctor I saw who told me it was an easy way to view lab results but the app keeps asking me for a verification code which the doctor never gave me and when I chose the no option and fill in all my details and after two methods of identity verification which come back positive theres always a third one which says it can't prove my identity even though it was proved twice. So now I can't look at my lab results cause a company called Prove can't verify my identity.,
makes things way more easier,
It's good to keep track of everything with Lifespan but wish I could get rid of notifications after I did what the notification told me. I like the app and It's super easy to use.,
"It took so long ,and it took several people to get to my chart...it has issues when you're signed in with too many attempts...when I was in a screen, it would TELL me ""error try again later ""& I did on many attempts...",
I am having issues being able to review my after summary visit or send or read any message in my son's linked proxy account on the portal. I am also having error messages when I try to access any option from the main page. This is with the link to MyScripps. I got this app so I could access multiple organizations but seem to lately keep getting error messages with MyScripps. I may just get the MyScripps only app instead.,
I recommend this app 100% I love the fact I can message and get a response back in the same day. Also I can view alot from the past. Also can look at my tests. Everything you want too know you can look it over in this app and it's amazing,
"It's not very easy to use. Can't add doctors to the ""team"" and can't add visits to the app that it doesn't show. Just 2 things making it hard to use.",
MyChart is easy to install and user friendly. Some of the data from other health systems is slow to acquire but this is the network and not the app..,
"I enjoy a great deal the ""My Chart"" app! It's very resourceful to obtain the test results, to schedule and make appointments, and to send, or, receive messages from my doctors, medical professionals, and other staff members!!",
My scheduled mammogram went very well. Staff was very helpful. Results came back to my phone app ( my chart) almost immediately. Easy to use & puts my mind at ease.,
"Helps us keep up with tests, appointments, medications, everything needed as we go into a liver transplant! We can also send messages to our providers and set reminders for appointments and emails! Great program!!",
Really easy to use. You can view the notes the Dr. Leaves for you as well as any notes he leaves for other Doctors. You can view test results from multiple hospitals/ Dr visits. Your able to check in on it and update your info to insure your up to date on shots and more and if you aren't. You can easily find a Doctor and make a appointment.,
"Still definitely some links to work out (i.e. scheduling normally makes you call, would be nice to request a callback via the app) Overall a huge improvement in personal medical care and keeping a history.",
"My chart is easy to use. It makes it easier to check appointment dates, read doctor's note, and communicate with the medical staff. It is also easy to download documents.",
Do not do e-visit It's not same day and they only text you. If you think you have pink eye they say it's most likely allergies. Then they say go into a dr. If it dosnt improve. I thought it was a video visit same day.,
"I love this app, I like being able to see my results right away and it reminds me of appointments coming up. Its very user friendly",
Does not report to the university of Florida for days/weeks this causes me to get a ton of phone calls for bills already paid. It is easy to make payments but UF can't see it so you still get harassed and multiple calls. Need to communicate better.,
Constantly crashes and says there is a server error almost every single time I try to use the app. App need a lot of bugs fixed.,
I guess this could be useful. My issue is that the information available is not complete. I have been to the hospital in ER many more times than it shows in the recent past. Only one of those visits shows. Where a the rest along with the test results from those dates?,
Does NOT WORK! Unable to do a video visit from the app which is required for my doctor. What the heck epic. Get your stuff together. Missed a critical apt as a result. Just kept getting kicked out.,
"Incredible, I'm glad my family and I have it.",
"Frustrating USA App to use in UK. If a phonecall is made it goes on App as a Visit. Test results written for medical professionals to understand and not for us so no point! The drugs list shows the medication one is on, not always correct and says the mg of 1 tablet but not the amount of those tablets you may be prescribed so that's potentially dangerous. Hint: keep your own correct records on you all the time. You won't need this frustrating pointless App. My UK Hospital hears lots hate it too.",
"There is zero navigation within the app. Once you click on something, for example, App Preferences, you cannot go back. You need to exit the app and login again.",
"I loved MyChart... until recently. The ability to message my physicians, look at lab & imaging results, look at images and share my records with other facilities was great. Now all of a sudden I am not able to open images or share my medical records.",
"Unable to login with biometrics. Ever since I got a new phone, biometrics fails. I am able to login with user/password, but what's the point of having biometrics if it doesn't work?",
"I love this app it helps me to keep up with appointments and I am able to talk with my doctor or text them if I have issues, and I am able to fill my prescription when it is time and review my test results. Everyone should get this My Chart app 💯👩‍⚕️🏥",
"The best way to keep track of all appointments and dr. messages and reports. Keeping medications ordered, great lab work reports. Have been using MyChart for almost 10 years. All that I need is right here.",
Absolutely LOVE this app! So easy to use and very convenient. I like the fact that you can add your appointments to your calendar and not have to carry a planner with you.,
"It's nice to have easy access to my tests but the payments are horrendous. Both the app and website won't let you update your payments and the ""office hours"" are never available.",
"Best thing they ever invented., We keep track of everything here thanks again",
"Earlier today, I gave the app 1 star because it hadn't worked for about 2 months, but finally after uninstalling/reinstalling it 4 times it finally started working. The other version that worked until recently was very nice, hope this one is too",
"If I could give it a 0 I would! Biggest piece of garbage ever, will probably switch doctors and hospital just cause of how ridiculous it is. Tried to get a code is practically impossible I asked for one 3 times never got one, it says give it a few minutes to get one and it never shows up!!! How about u shove the app straight up your hole!!!",
Always right on and informative.,
I love the app. It has everything I need to know and all my appointments that are coming up and also past appointments with the Dr's note's. Its super self explanatory so easy to navigate threw. Absolutely love the app!!!,
App stopped working last week. Uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. Very frustrating. Shows blank screen after signing in.,
MyChart allows you to see important information in a timely manner.,
"Really good and extremely handy, I have found it useful to find out specific information when at other appointments for information they may need. Only downside can't see letters on the app.",
"I have had terrible experiences with My Chart. It seems that I can't get on 95% of the time and end up getting locked out. Nothing seems to work. Sometimes I don't get a response at all and I never know who is going to respond. All of these ""safety precautions"" are unnecessary. If I do get on, the information is easily accessible. Nancy Pursley",
"With a commendable user friendly interface, the MyChart app allows for up-to-date information and makes it easy to communicate with your providers.",
This app is very useful that is if you can log on. Almost every time I need to go into the app it tells me that my logon information is incorrect or error. Then I have to keep calling in to reset my password. This problem needs to be fixed.,
Not sure what is going on but it keeps on saying that it has a issues communicating with server I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still get the same issue I finally was able to get on via the website but can you please tell me what I need to do to get this fixed because I have a lot of medical issues that I need to be able to get a hold of my doctors through my chart,
"This app is very helpful and easy to use. I can leave and send messages to my primary physician and get an answer fairly quickly. I can view my lab results, schedule appointments.",
I love the My Chart App. It is so handy and awesome with every procedure and all your health issues you are having. It's absolutely a great way to check in and view everything you get seen on.,
"As soon as I make an appointment I get the alert right away, it makes everything alone easier and more convenient. I highly recommend my chart for everyone.",
"Very helpful, tremendously useful communication tool, easy-to-use. One is able to immediately access lab results, upcoming visits, download visits to personal calendar, and send questions about lab results directly to PCP. Does not require extensive computer or IT expertise.",
Without this app I would have been lost... I love everything about this app. Being able to message my Dr. Is awsome... test results availability... list of meds great... not to mention upcoming appointments and past appointments,
As a woman in End Stage Liver Failure - it's so hard for me to get out n about. This app has made things so much easier for me! I can do almost everything via interapp Zoom with my specialists unless I need my blood checked. Life saver!,
"Since I started using MyChart, I have been able to keep up with all of my outside of VA appointments and healthcare results. I can also consult with my doctors for specific reasons, and that's what counts. I really like this app and it's purpose.",
"Recently, I've been getting occasional prompts from the app about info not being available due to server issues. I cannot tell if it's my phone or the wifi signal. I am operating under 4G mode.",
I cant even log in to make an appointment anymore its sending me to some external link that doesnt even work. Nor can I log in on the website. I really need to make an appointment and get some info about past surgery out my chart. Hopefully they get it working again.,
"Really good app "", upcoming appointments ( with whom you are going to see), medication,allergies results all in one place. Any Questions that the medical staff need can be filled in beforehand . You can also allow access to other hospitals ,Dr's etc",
"I believe in the concept and liked the idea, however the constant changing of screen formats and the lack of uniformity between organizations information screens seems to be very confusing and competitive rather than helpful and informative",
I keep getting errors when trying to see medications or send messages. I uninstalled multiple times. My husband does not experience to same. I am on an S10.,
I dunno what happened but I can no longer sign in using my finger print and I cannot find any options in the settings to turn it back on... I'll change the rating once I can fix it.,
"It is important for users to note that some material that is easily seen on the website, including some messages, is either hidden or not available in the app. For this and other reasons,, including navigaton, the website should be your first choice.",
"I love mychart! But, I keep trying to pay off my past due balance, & it won't let me proceed after entering all my info? I even saved to wallet (which I didn't wanna do), & nothing. Options are back or cancel, & I hit back, & it deletes everything. I don't know how to proceed after entering? I've looked everywhere on the app. Do I have to go to the physical website of mychart?",
"The app has been unable to communicate with the server for several days, almost a week, i am unable to do anything at all with it, i can't even sign in. I don't even know how to report this issue since i can't log in.",
Very good app. Keeps me up to date on all medical. Can add appontments straight to my calendar with details. Love it a real time saver. All in one place.,
"All my records, results, and labs alll in one place. I can even email my physician and he emails me back quickly if i have a question or concern. Also has all my Medications listed in order and you can request refills when its time. I highly recommend this app to everyone so they have access to their records at their fingertips.",
This app is pretty intuitive. My favorite part of this is that it can connect all of your records and medical background from all networks upon consent.,
"Unusable, as the app asks for my date of birth to complete important tasks, but it can only be entered from a calendar pop up that requires me to scroll back one month at a time. Over 500 button presses just to enter my date of birth.",
"Love this app. Its the best app they could've created for staying in touch with your doctor, refilling your medication and scheduling appointments. Plus it does more than just that, I love MyChart App.",
"Well, I was very happy with this app until the last Android update. Now it will not open. It just stays on the opening splash screen and never opens. I hope they fix it soon, because I rely heavily on it for my medical info.",
Awful. you can't really chose who you message... So many features don't even work. Can't even access my medical records from mine. Just so many problems. Only good thing is it automatically writes down my appointment dates and i can find them ahahh,
I have been using this app and I love being able to view qll my business but would really appreciate it if you will allow me to individually message the one person of choice because I have been getting calls from just anyone in the medical team. I also love the 4 digit pin option as well I also get my vaccine shots somewhere else so please remove the vaccine link off my health care chart,
Easy to use and keep up with Labs scripts,
"So Far I have had pretty good luck with it,only problem I have is it keeps saying I need to update personal information which I have reviewed and it's all set and it won't let me state I'm all set ??? So everytime I go into Mychart there it is Need to update and I Don't",
It works as well as expected with one variable. When making appointments if there is no available appointments in your time frame it sends you back to try again n agsin. Frustrating...,
Super convenient & easy to use.,
I enjoy using my MyChart because I can go on and check my lab results and send my Dr an email if I have a question to ask her. And she will get back to me once she receives the email. I also like the fact that it reminds me of all my appointments that I have coming up either phone appointment or office visits. I am very happy that MyChart is there for me so when I need to check something I just sign onto it.,
Set up a payment plan through mychart. For some reason it was not set in place although verification was provided to me and I was sent to collection fo non payment. This app is worthless!,
"This app is fantastic! I can see what is going on even before I get a letter. I can get in touch with the dr or other staff, book an appointment, check my results... really essential to keep in touch with the hospital and the consultant.",
Really helpful for setting up appointments and or cancelling them. I can talk to my doctors via video chat when I can't go in person. I can also see medications and lab results. A good app overrall.,
Not happy. Organizations not sharing info with each other. I keep on getting notifications but I'm not told how to solve this issue. Would like to sign in with only one ID and password for both Organizations.,
Love It. So easy to use,
Since I've installed this app it's made my life so much easier.,
It's a great app to have all of your chart information at your fingertips. It includes reminders for appointments that are coming up. Also has a message board that you can communicate with your healthcare providers. It makes all of your information instantly available.,
It is perfect. I don't have to ask for health diagnosis or call nobody. Everything is there😊,
"Most convenient app have ever used Question are answered in the quickest Most timely manner everyone has gone above and beyond in the most professional manner to help with appointments, Question, refills anything in there power that pertains to my medical issues so very pleased . Wish all my apps were this easy thank you U F Healthcare.",
Easy to use. Virtually eliminates waiting for results and consequently the stress associated with that. Super easy to make appointments.,
A great system to keep track of all your medical information,
"There always is an ""Error on the Server"" message. When your trying to fill in as much info, for a video appt. Very frustrating.",
It will make you look at a goal that you did not agree to as the main feature every time you log in.  You cannot hide it.  There is no feedback feature.  There is no way to remove incorrect info that subsequent doctors said was incorrectly noted by another dr.,
I find this app excellent in the communication between my Healthcare team and myself! This opens a door of direct communication and helps resolve refills on medication and care in a reasonable time frame!,
I can't get it to open. It used to work great. I even uninstalled. I then installed it again. It only spins continuously. I don't need something I can't count on. Everyone says use it. I would if I could. Exasperating!!!,
Can't get into the my chart account and I need to see my appointments that I have missed because I can't get into My Chart Account and need help A.S.A.P.,
Useful and practical feature. But there is n0000ⁿ@@8@88@800o replacement for old school calling the doctors office. There isn't an option to make an emergency appointment. I had to call for that. Otherwise it'ok. No point in answering questions/questionnaires while sitting in my waiting room because they will ask the same questions again anyways. So you are not gonna save time.,
I'm very appreciative of my mom telling me to install this on my phone because when I was sick out of state I was able to pull up all my medication quickly. It's also helpful for knowing when up coming appointments are and being able to check lab results easily if you're waiting for something you've had done.,
"I can never login to my account through the app. I constantly get locked out and told I need to reset my password. However, if I use the same login information on the website I have no problem accessing my account.",
The app would work a lot better if the people you attempt to get a message through would answer you. I am extremely dissappointed not with the app but by the substandard way that my hospital system runs it,
"What's new? ""Our app is completely unusable. We have decided that our app being slow and frustrating so we made it completely unusable"" this should be your update quote. You expect me to trust you with my payment information and I can't trust you to reliably send what is essentially a text message correctly. Hell, I feel safer corresponding with a Nigerian prince via email. ALERT: this app developer is actively hiding negative reviews to keep their ratings high.",
"Very convenient. All your health information at your finger tip. Easy to make appointments, video call and much more. Highly recommend.",
Great for all my medical appointments and payments plus test results and message with providers,
"I loved it , getting my results ,appointments, ect..until I can no longer get in ..keep saying try later this has been going on since the 28th. I've un installed and re installed it no luck. not happy.why have a app you can't access.🤔",
The app is for convince and educational purposes. The lack of ability to fully use something that can save someone life is absurdly vexing. Its like malpractice almost but only misrepresentation. This hospital needs to take their patients health and well-being alot more seriously.,
I cant stand this app. I cant reach my doctors like I used to be able to on their old app. I also cant see all of my providers. Which is a problem also.,
I think it's great because I can get thru to doctors easier and get answers faster than trying to get thru by calling them. It's also awesome because I can get results of tests and double check my appointments. Pam Lewis,
"used to be decent app, i have a new phone and when i click forgot user name info- name/ birthdays/social....which is needed to gain access.... but the screen goes white and stalls out when i send the info. I've tried removing and reinstalling but does the same thing. worthless if you forget access info.",
"I love i dont have to deal with calling someone and being on hold. Just get get on my chart and update med lists, check for all exam results, message PCP about any questions or concerns. Any changes of address, name, anything just change it. Its easy to go through and change things as needed. Thank you Kettering Health Team!!!",
Excellent ease of use. Easy to contact doctor during off hours. I enjoy being able to check my meds refills and viewing my after visit summaries. I also like view test results with instructions. This is an excellent tool to which you can communicate with your doctor.,
"Really handy. I like the ability to order pill refills, without having to call or wait on-hold, to do so. I like the ease of personal access too.",
It is tragic that information is so often wrong. Just utterly wrong. I have been trying to get one TDAP notation off of my chart for 5 years. I am ALLERGIC. I have requested repeatedly to have wrong info removed. This mistake could be fatal.,
It would be a great app if it didn't regularly fail to retrieve information. It frequently gets errors when trying to see messages or test results.,
The mychart app is great for getting everything setup but the only thing I would like to see added is a notes section that you can write down everything wrong so you dont have to keep repeating yourself and so you dont forget to tell the doctor something,
App isnt letting me log in but i can log in on the internet using same password and user name. Needs to be updated or worked on. Iv uninstalled and reinstalled several times and have waited weeks between. App sucks!!!😡😡,
"Great app! It keeps up with appointments, gives me instant access to test results and all doctors notes and gives reminders for appointments needed for yearly exams, mammograms, etc.",
I love MyChart so much!!! It shows you in detail your past appointment notes and everything. It's just wonderful to me! I also use it for my daughter as well and it's nice to have all her information available to me as well.,
"Excellent ""one stop shop"" for my healthcare. I can check my lab results, upcoming appointments, pay my bill, and message my doctor.",
I cant connect my account to my chart. I downloaded the app and set up my account prior to my appointment and it wont let me connect my account after my appointment. It continues to say nothing to show when I know it's something to show!,
"It's very easy to use, I love it",
This app is a necessity I can contact my doctor anytime I need to speak with her about anyting,
"***This still does not work, I emailed as advised, any updates? I use to have no problems with this app., now I keep getting ""problem communicating with server"". I even uninstalled app and reinstalled, did not work. Any suggestions? TY",
Only complaint is technically is still needs fixed but no knows how to????,
"First time. So far, straight forward, get back to me in about 6 months. Had some problems with signing on, couldn't get the code to verify anything. Tried 5 times, somehow I got around it. (We'll see )",
This is a very good app. It is informative and sends reminders of appointments and you can also access your virtual appointments with Zoom through this app. I recommend it for anyone.,
My My chart disappeared and now I'm stuck with a faulty sign in... it is in the state of I can't remember my sign in or password.. it takes me 10 minutes to get all of the ducks lined up in order to get into the chart from the widget... HELP !!!!! How can I fix this problem?,
"It's good to get test results and review appointments without calling doctors offices. Also echeck in saves time. I can do it at my convenience before arriving for appointments, then just walk in without delay.",
I have been finding the process of signing up exceedingly frustrating. Trying to get tech help means long waiting on hold. Call backs at this point (2 hours so far) not an improvement.,
Love this App I can do everything I need in one place. Contacting my providers scheduling my appointments getting test results and more. Also very easy to use.,
I love using My Chart. I do have a couple suggestions. One it would be nice if there was a spot to make notes for things you want to talk to your doctor about. At up coming appointments. And while I know this is for Lee health. I wish I could keep track of some is my specialty doctor appointments in the same area.,
Half the time my messages don't open and I can't contact my Dr other than calling them on the phone. It's very frustrating when you can't open receiving messages or send any messages for well over months... This has happened to me quite a few times.,
"Won't take my sign on....UPDATE: Apparently,whatever issue caused the app to not accept my login on my cell has resolved. I can sign in now. I always sign in through the same provider, then access my others thru what I consider my primary healthcare organization.",
"Won't let me search/choose a specific doctor for my primary care provider, only gives the option for most recently visited doctors, regardless of type of service/reason for visiting. This issue is also the same on the web portal. Let me pick my own doctor please.",
"Sorry app, can't get into cause it takes to long. No problem inside the hospital but outside no good. Get notifications can't get to read them. Still can't open My Chart, but still get notifications!",
"App doesn't provide much information at all. Only had my allergies, an appt I scheduled from 2 years ago, and recommended flu vaccine. I was hoping to see my actually test results, it even has a section for them yet nothing was in it.",
It's great to have. I have no problems with my chart appointments and is great to be able to talk with your Dr from your home with all the Corona viruses around. It's safe & easy. I really like the my chart app.,
"Great to finally have a single place for appointments, meds, visit summaries & test results. You can even communicate with med staff, although that's pretty locked down & not immediate. All told this is a huge benefit to my medical care.",
I love this app you can add your appointment to your calendar you can message your doctor see your test results. Very convenient. I do wish they are able to add telahealth app with it so some of us that have some issues leaving their home can still make their app. I have a few clients that are not able to leave home anymore. But still need their care. Hoping this will be something that can worked in to the app. Doctor carpenter is a good doctor.If he has roo.Ask for him.He is funny and efficient,
What happened to Lakeland Spectrum? I just restarted my phone and went to check what was added as I had received an email but its as if I'm starting MyChart for the first time and I don't see them in the list of Michigan Healthcare facilities! I just had an MRI done at the hospital and like checking the test results rather than waiting to hear back from my Dr.,
"Love this app. I'm able to communicate with my providers without any long holds, trafers on the phone, and disconnects. I can see future appts, past appts and everything else at my fingertips.",
It says update but I've been trying to update it for 3 hours. I decided to uninstall to see if that works and its not allowing me to do that. I haven't had any problems with this app until today. FIX IT PLEASE!!!,
"Very easy to navigate and much easier to make appointments or even just speak with my Dr, simply leave a message in mychart and you get a quicker response than waiting for a return call, and access to all medical at anytime, definitely worth the download..5 stars",
Very easy to use. Saves valuable commuting time as well as keeping you from getting exposed in a hospital setting! I love it!!!,
"Shite app,no listing for the hospital i use even though they promote it. So cant get to my records from there. I'll just go online for it. February/23 they still haven't done anything for fixing this useless app. I just had to go online to get my recent info. Back to deleting it.",
"Quite useful app. You can check in, fill out forms, get reminders, message doctors, get statement notifications, and pay bills all through this app. And its intuitive to use.",
Very bad options for older ones. I can't store my mother's password on the app!! THIS IS NOT A HIPPA VIOLATION IF I WANT YO STORE IT. SHE NEEDS THE REMINDERS AND IT IS TO HARD TO REMEMBER 20 PASSWORDS. To protect my information they make it impossible to get to.,
"Not sure what's up with this app but even though they list several doctors is my providers, I can only submit messages for one. Plus it won't accept my biometrics to login. Difficult to schedule an appointment.",
"It does basic functions but often redirects to the website, has no non-English options, and the interface is clunky and confusing.",
"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE VALUABLE TIME! Several times I precisely followed incomplete instructions and was told to start over and enter things not mentioned before or something I didn't have, change my password to something impossible to remember, or I didn’t know my own name! I consider this app CRIMINALLY DANGEROUS and will be reporting it on behalf of those sent here by their providers for access to critical records but are blocked by unmanageable demands. PLEASE DO NOT DEPEND ON 5HIS APP!!",
Too many pointless notifications and emails.,
"I had problems at the beginning, but think that was to operator error. I am very happy with my chart, enjoy using it and getting results quickly",
"For someone who is just starting on their journey of taking better care of their health, I really do enjoy using this app. I have better access to my personal health, direct contact with my Doctors with any concerns or questions and so much more. I am beyond satisfied.",
"This app is alright..when it works. I try and try to get my fingerprint to work on this app, but day after day, I'm calling you guys to get it back on there. It could be because I've been ""hacked"" by some a-hole, but that's besides the point, I s'pose.",
"This app is absolutely wonderful! It's easy to use, shows you everything you need to see and even makes dealing with the healthcare system fun again.",
"I do enjoy this app. Keeps me up to date on appointments, I can ask questions, saves so much time at check-in., I don't feel pressured and rushed to fill out forms. And I haven't seen any ads",
Extremely informative. A great scheduler with all the information needed. A great organizer and calender.,
Keeps track of appointments and results. Tracks billing as well. It has a user friendly inteface. Such a great tool.,
"This app makes me feel in control of my health-care. I'm able to communicate with my doctor and his staff without having to go through the ""telephone rounds"" if I have a question. It's all on ""MY CHART""! Big fan!",
Tired of all the appointment reminders. Can't stop them even when you change it to mail only. Constant texts and email. Reminders start 2 weeks before your appointment and every 3 or 4 days I get another until day of appointment. I have shut down my account. You fix it. Don't expect me to do it.,
"Incredibly convenient way to view, track, and receive medical information, including appointments, prescriptions, and test results. It's also nice to be able to text my primary care provider and get a quick answer.",
was fine but last update comes up with error can't connect to server. (Couldn't log in right now) I use it to track appointments and now that is inaccessible!,
"How could it be so chaotic and buggy?! Frustrating to allow Epic to handle your health information. This is what virtual monopoly and lack of development leads to. Constant errors on retrieving information, multiple repeating pages from participating hospitals.",
"Still Not working. Uninstalled. Restarted phone, Reinstalled. Still not working. Repeated in January 2023. Still can't log on. If I go to online mychart, I can log on just fine. App is worthless.",
"I love MyChart! A great way to communicate with doctors, see test results, and send messages! The only thing I wish is that you could take photos of messages and test results.",
"My Chart is a Semi-Functional Application, even logging into my chart through the internet its only 3 stars. Suggestions: Make it possible to be able to log into more than 1 account through the App and online. App does not look bad visually.",
"Love having access to all my health info, can leave messages for medical staff in various depts. Can order medication, pay co-pays and other bills, schedule appts and see when annual procedures like shots. Mammograms, etc are due. This app makes it easy to manage health.",
MyChart is pretty cool I'm still learning how to handle it will keep it there I'll get it down eventually if you can send me any tips to help please do,
Can not verify my personal data when I am logged in to Skagit MyChart. They send me a verification code to my cell (at correct phone #) but their text never arrives. I have reported this problem several times but nobody gives a damn. That is a Skagit health for you.,
"I love this app! It's very user friendly, and I can send questions to my doctor, and someone always replies! I also like that I can link my health records from other facilities that I've visited so notes can be compared.",
"Wish all my doctors used this same app (have 2 others🤨) Love this app for looking at my med records, rx refills, vaccines, etc. but scheduling hasn't worked out for me, just call the Dr instead. Thought I made a virtual appointment for Dr (not my gp) through this app a few months ago: answered the questions, put in credit card info to pay for the visit. Then all I got was a Thank you and confirmationof pmt, no Dr visit.",
"This app is great ! Its easy to use most of your providers are listed. You can use this app for Upcoming appointments, med refills, you can view your test results and if you have any questions at all, you can use this app to reach out to your health care providers. I highly recommend this app.",
The app is great.... just I sometimes like to see past letters and information and it seem not properly visible like only half the page right to left displayed. Otherwise it is great Thank you,
"I like having my chart available and I'm getting more comfortable with moving around in it. However, my phone tells me I have six items in my chart but when I sign in, I can't tell what is new and where I need to look.",
When I look at the mychart icon on my phone there is a 3 on it in red. When I go into the ap to see if there are new test results or anything new to look at I don't see anything new. Yesterday there was a 2. Today there is a 3. I am VERY frustrated. There is too much junk on this ap. I hate it.,
"So convenient and I love the metro west Park clinic,and of course the Drs there very good Drs.",
I absolutely love using the MyChart app.. It makes it so easy to make and cancel appointments with ANY doctor and it also makes it easy to communicate with medical staff and share records with other providers and hospitals.,
Worst app and chart ever! Just changed password a few days ago and my login worked. Now I am locked out again! I cannot get it to send anything to email to reset my account again. There is no one you can speak to on a Saturday. I doubt my email will be answered either. Fix your errors!,
Just downloaded app. Went to log in to Beaumont and I keep getting error that terms and conditions can't be loaded. Can't get pass the log in screen. Makes the app pointless for me.,
Needs better upkeep and able to message more freely,
"Everything is great, except I can't send billing a message or I don't see how to send billing a message. I have two insurances and they only billed one. It would be nice to message them here.",
"Utter fail. Other care providers can't connect and help me with my PCP. Useless dreck. Usual stupid time waste, using terms only doctor can understand. How much tax payer dollars have been wasted on this? The only thing wrong with the old app is that care providers weren't forced to use it. The web designers should be prosecuted.",
"Love My Chart! The only problem is that the medications section is a mess. When you get refills they show up as a new listing g. It will tell you you have another drug with the same name, but if you try to delete it tells you your doctor has to do it. The list I have is ridiculous.",
"Love it, very convenient, access to info immediately, wish I used it since the beginning. Awesome app configuration ready to use and apply to your needs.",
I think it is one of the best apps there is. I have loves this app sense day one.,
"This app works great, but all of the sudden I can't attach a file to send with my messages. It closes. I know the first one was too big, you have to have a small file to attach.",
I love it it's helpful to see my test results and when my next Dr visit,
"Works well for the most part, but one of my linked accounts is not syncing with any of my other accounts. The hospital in question won't help because they blame the app. All I know for sure is that something is broken.",
"It was working OK at first but then I noticed that with certain doctors I wouldn't see anything showing i went to my appointment and now I got a notification that I have a new message and when I click on the symbol to go to it it opens and closes really fast and saying something about an error and to try back later it's been saying that for almost two days how am I supposed to get results it might be from the colonoscopy, endoscopy and throat stretch i had so what am I supposed to do",
I absolutely love this app. It makes it easier to contact my doctor personally and make appointments and request prescription refills. I give mychart 5 stars I have never had any issues with mychart. Keep up the great work developers.,
"Almost never loads. Most times returns a server error, regardless of provider. Can't actually use it to do any review or communication. Waste of space.",
Doesn't show booster shots for covid. Like the old format much better. This one is so confusing and you don't know where to go for the information.,
I loved this when I found out about it. Now I can't even make appointments with it anymore. It just keeps giving me an error. Regardless on if I sign out or in. Remove the app and re download it. Please fix this.,
"I really like having this app. It nice to be able to check on test results, keep up with my appointments, and even message my doctor. It's a lot more convenient than having to call every time.",
"Wish we could get a graph on all blood test, urine etc. like the old system. The graph option was great for realizing good or bad results over a time period.",
"Great app it shows you past present and future events, when logging in and signing up appeared to be excepted by multiple organizations. Allows video and ""text"" interaction with your doctor. Check lab results, schedule visits, even pay. Easy to use.",
Makes scheduling and prescription request so much easier and faster. Plus easy access to your healthcare team. Plus I can switch from one organization to another.,
"I absolutely love this app. The convenience to message your doctor about anything is awesome. With the pandemic, my social anxiety and taking care of the baby,the telehealth visits are just what I need! Great work.",
"Has ""Call Customer Service"" button that doesn't work. If this functionality isn't available, remove it from the UI. This is just lazy. ""Two business days""for a response turned into 2 weeks. No billing info AT ALL except for amount due.",
I just love the fact that everything is there and the best part about it is u can contact ur health doctor just by this app if u don't have a phone to call them. Just as long as u have at least some kind of wifi or internet connection.,
"My Chart Portal is extremely positive tool to help keep up with the constant changing Medical world. It a total list of Your Doctors appointments, procedures, labwork List allergy, your medical present/pass history, and so much more.very important app. Great organization Thank you",
"Love that all my medical records are in the same place. And at the click of a button, it's available for me",
"Easy to access all my information about test results, visit summaries and notes, and future appointments.",
Love this app and everything about it. I hope they make finding medical records easier when using university health system login.,
"This is a great app! I wish the doctors I had back in Louisiana had used, but they didn't. Here in Indiana, all of my info from all of my doctors is right here in one easy-to-use app ... even all of my meds and their dosages are listed. I ❤ MyChart!",
"I have only had this app a couple weeks, yet to really use it but by browsing around the app so far so good. It's interesting & definitely up to date with our lightning fast (too fast in my opinion) technology.",
"This is the best Healthcare App I've come across. All of your records in one place, give access to the entities/people you wish, and manage everything to do with your healthcare. An all-in-one app that handles EVERYTHING!",
A great app. It's giving me all I need concerning my NHS information in one place. I find I now trust and depend on it for all my health comunications.,
"Great services, cleaner areas and the most important they have all you need in the same Building. , X-rays, Laboratory, etc. You don't need a referral to another facility. It's all here. Doctors and Nurses are so professional,. Thanks , Harris Health System, El Franco Lee, etc to may our life more easier. Sincerely, David A Machuca",
My Chart is so simple to use and you get results and visit summaries almost immediately. Also a great way to keep track of upcoming appointments.,
"Overall the app is great, however, during covid times, wouldn't it be easier to keep scheduling through app working? Not only is it convenient, but it also cuts wait times down for calls",
"I love my chart. So easy to see appointments, message my doctor get Dr. Notes of my visit, see results of bloodwork. Echo etc. It's fabulous. I o ly have one challenge and that is going from one screen back to another I have to close it out and begin again to get where I need.",
"Very helpful app! I haven't had any issues. This application just does it's job. I have no problem communicating with my care team, paying the bill, refilling prescriptions. These are just some of things you can do with this application.",
"I so love this app!! I can ask for refills, communicate with my doctors or their nurses, and find out test result⁴s as soon as they're ready! What's really cool is that I can request my medical records be sent to any doctor or specialist that needs them, or to review them for a proper diagnosis.",
"Love this app, knowing I can be reminders of all my appointments.",
"Got spouse's dr. on the phone, we could hear him but he couldn't hear us! Couldn't get the microphone to work. He was able to complete the telehealth visit by calling spouse on our land line. Glad we still have one!",
"The apps a pain in the neck, it requires an email that I really don't want to give up that didn't need it in the past but now every time I get a notification message I get an email which is a pain in the neck I don't want to be notified through my email nor do I want to give this app my email address I read some of the reviews trying to figure out how to turn the email notification off but I can't turn it off I wish I can send a screenshot because the area that it tells you to go into is so tiny",
The app keeps stopping and I cannot read anything !,
"It's sending me test results that I've received already like 2 weeks ago by email to logon to my care to see them which was done 2 weeks ago! Rubbish system. 221121 ,still doing the same thing after all these weeks send multiple test results 2 weeks after receiving 1st result,di not bother with this app useless",
Great (ish) and a million times better that other local health trusts. But it all depends on the information put in which too ften is sadly lacking - meaning follow up calls which negate the point of the app in the first place.,
"The app is great. Everything is easy to use. I am having one issue however, I thought I was contacting my doctor and it said clearly on it but it messages any random doctor apperantly? As I have other doctors answering my questions not MY doctor even though it says I am messaging mine. Which is odd.",
Wonderful tool for managing all aspects of care.,
This app has been extremely informative and beyond helpful. I would suggest anyone who can use it should. Doctor responded the next day to my message and started immediately on my request. Thank you to whoever is monitoring and managing this app you are doing an amazing job.,
"I requested an appointment on my chart app I got 3 unnecessary phone calls to get an appointment I didn't requested just to say that I need different appointment I could schedule on the phone when they answer, the only good thing about it ot that you can see your information without requesting medical record and a great way to make you pay more",
Easy to use and track your care,
I hate when I have to reset the app by deleting it and restarting it all over again have a problem with on the phone freezes up and you have to reset it your app makes you go through hoops to get it restarted,
Extremely user friendly and convenient,
The most maddening app I ever used. It asks you to schedule an appointment and doesn't tell you what the appointment is for or what Doctor requested it. No way to reject it or do anything about it. Users need to know what about the above. This is unacceptable. It asks you to do a review of health questions even after having done it just a day ago. Need to ask only about new symptoms or relevant questions related to the appointment. Having to repeat the same questions over and over is redundant.,
"LOVE the app, I get test results the same day, if not... by the next day at the least! Can email my doctor/s and get answers alot faster than phoning. Can see my prescriptions, Can order more if need be directly through their office from my portal. I can see upcoming appts. and can upload to my calender. They even give street closures to the institutes if there are any. I can see all my x-rays n mri's. Pre-check in saves time at office visits. It's an all around winner if u ask me!",
"Easy to get around and view appointments, results , ask questions when needed. Sometimes it's easier to make an appointment than to call in.",
I like the app but now when I try to do a video visit it says hardware system failed cannot connect to camera and microphone off called tec support they said was my phone took phone to my carrier everything is fine worked fine until they made the changes,
Makes keeping your record's easy and readily available to share if necessary. Links to other counties so if you move you can easily prep your new health care provider at your fingertips/ on the go! Easy to update your personal information if it changes bees instead of calling your doctor or making a visit to the office. Super efficient and effective for pharmacist to refill RX and pt pick up.. Also never had the app crash or fail to provide my info +it's 100%FREE!⚕️🦠🚑🏨🌍🤳🩸🧠🫀🫁🦷💦🤢🤮😁💯,
Updates are slow and take a long time to happen. They are needed badly to keep patients informed about what's going on and accessing information. It is easier to use this program on your computer than it is to use on your phone. That needs to be improved and made better immediately.,
"I'm able to see all providers that allow me to link my account to their practice, Atrium, formerly the Baptist hospital & Ortho Carolina are all linked together! It's easy to schedule appointments & select medication refill requests for connected providers! I love using this APP!",
Great app. Allows you to get test results super fast without having to play phone tag. Only negative is doesn't have all meds listed on there & takes while to update them.,
"I am unable to update any information, like medications, diagnoses etc. Your response stated some options are set by NHS trust... but if you skip the initial set-up questions - such as medications and medical history, there is no facility to go back and update or add the correct information retrospectively.",
"Its pretty easy app, and it gives me everything i need to know or do.",
"Overall, it's very good! One suggestion.... Make it easier for the PATIENT to update and remove medications they are no longer taking. The PTA med list gets so messed up with meds that had their dosages changed or were one time meds given for procedure prep, like sorbitol. The patient should be prompted to view and update before any appointment or encounter. Thanks!",
I love this app! Mychart makes everything so convenient and it makes it easy to contact your doctors and remember your appointments. I haven't had any issues with this app! ❤❤❤,
Private Convenient & very easy to use,
This is so easy! Saving time and frustration at check in is worth the time to fill out the forms ahead of the appointment. Medical issues can be so complicated. Thank you for making one task simpler!,
This app barely allows you to access anything. It tells you that you have upcoming vaccinations due but it won't let you schedule them. It makes it really hard for you to contact your doctor. It's just really not user friendly,
"I love having mine and my kids medical records, appointments, medicines, etc. At the tip of my fingertips and being able to check everything whenever I feel the need. Great app!!!",
I love the interaction and how I can look and view my results....,
Finally a way to have more than 1 provider in the app. Just accessed the app and found I can now access more than 1 provider on it. Something I have needed for a long time. Makes it much more useful to me. Thank you!!!,
Would have given 5 stars except when doing electronic check in it always asks for retirement dates for self and spouse. Wouldn't be so bad if one could type in dates using mm/dd/yyyy format but u have to scroll back each month - I retired in 2013! Shouldn't even be a required field.,
Very easy to use and dependable app,
"Excellent way to stay on top of health. Only issue is paying bills gets convoluted. Needs to be way easier, please put fast pay codes in a more accessible location.",
"I have been to many doctors and nurses. I think Anne Giles and Dr. Kurakambi ( I tried hopefully I spelt it right) are the absolute best. They listen and explain things so I completely understand. Thank you guys, for making sure I'm going the right way. Love Inova because of y'all.",
Love using this. Very helpful! Makes it easy to check for my next appointment and follow ups with doctors and practitioners!,
Keeps me on track with appointments at updated on test results,
"This app keeps telling me to get my flue shot, COVID-19 vaccine, mammogram, shingles shots and pneumonia shots. I got them all this year, several months ago. I also told several doctors during my visits about shots, screenings I got. Why doesn't anyone update this? It's very irritating to read msgs that I need to get those anytime I open NCH MYCHART. Pls update patients shots, tests etc once they are completed.",
"Its a nuisance . Site keeps changing, socalled code numbers are requested a few times each login and it gets accepted once requiring a pw reset for each field. Nothing but aggravation.",
"As a 65 yr old woman, who has had brain surgery and other head trauma injuries, this App is very difficult for me! Now the App does allow me to log in with a passcode instead of username and password! Much easier! 🙂",
Love the app except for the fact that you can't message a Dr you don't have office visits with even tho you are under their care with procedures and medication. AND the fact that it keeps showing tests are past due even tho you have had them. But other than those small issues I love this app.,
"I can access a bunch of stuff, yes, but there seems to be NO WAY to actually send a message to my son's care team. I hit ""messages"" then there's absolutely no option for sending one. Not very helpful.",
This app is great. Everything is easy to use and so convenient. Love the check-in when you pull up for appointment. No trip to the desk to check-in.,
"Even though data from different medical providers/organizations is stored in your app, would it be much easier for me to use if My Chart opened with a personalized home plan with my last known demographics, my PCPs name, preferred pharmacy & a dashboard of other choice in drop down boxes &&& a log out button placed predominately so one can see & not seek.",
I love MyChart. So easy and convenient. I love having all of my medical information in one place. Makes it easier to review and remember doctors instructions and appointments.,
It works as expected. My big problem with the system is when you ask a question to a doctor they send it to whoever is available. I am guessing this is done to improve response times? I would happily wait a few days or more to get an answer for me from my doctor or at least the doctors opinion. Instead I often get someone you doesn't know me or my situation that only gives me a generic answer. I would rather just not get a response and ask at my next vist.,
I like it! It's helpful when you need medical info. From your doctors. Love that I can see everything from meds to test results. Its the best thing ever for the patients.,
"Been a couple years and it works well. Medical digital systems can be very wonky, and this app generally minimizes that. Plus I appreciate the convenience!",
It's nice to have an app that allows you to see results and not have to wait until you see your doctor. It's also good to have a sourc for reminders and making payments.,
Easy to use. Love the previsit log in.,
I have a very good experience with this app and found it very useful until this week when the app was changed. Now there is no fingerprint login option. BJC is my provider.,
"There is no need for hold times via the phone or anxiously waiting for the return call from your Dr or his nurse any longer. You can virtually get every answer to any question or access to all of your medical information so any current or past info you may need regarding your medical , is at your fingertips. Incredibly convenient is the words that come to mind.",
I downloaded the app and have yet to be able to use it. Everytime I log in it tells me that the Terms and Conditions could not be loaded to try back a later time. Well its been a week now and still the same message...,
I can't look at my messages or even look at my medication or send a message just started acting up this week,
"Every time I attempt getting into the ""medications"" section, I get logged out of the application. Messages saying ""server error"" pop up in almost every section. Not helpful.",
Fantastic my test result is lost in this app. 3hrs waiting in line just to get qtips up my nose. The app doesn't recognize my username and refuse to let me reset the damn password meanwhile you call those people nobody answer and you wonder why NY have to worst case of covid out there. I'm walking out there no knowing my status. Women have kits for pregnancy let us have ours for this and leave us alone with your bad service,
Ready to use and understand,
"It is great multiple main medical providers use this app.( Wellstar / Tsnner and Emory) are the 4 I know of. Ot easy to use for refilling meds , packing to a nurse seeing yest results and making appointments. I think it is a great app. More medical providers need to use ot.",
"Makes everything about all my doctors etc so much easier. I can send messages, get prescription refills pay bills and keep track of all my appointments. I haven't had any issues!",
"I did not give this application permission to be installed. Furthermore, the suspect transaction that triggered this makes no sense, as no personally significant healthcare provider is listed. Something is quite wrong. Uninstalled as soon as this is posted.",
I like the messaging part. The app still shows a surgery referral although I had that surgery almost a year ago and the referring person no longer works there. Slightly annoying.,
You can view your blood work faster and you can look up Dr appointments. Love it !!,
"It is great! So easy leave a message and the doctor's call you back, I feel this makes my life stress free! I've got doctors , dentist, and my orthopedic doctors all on one app! Thank you for making my life a little easier!!",
"This portal is a lifesaver to me..My providers answer quickly. No more calling them and waiting for calls back, test results can be reviewed, meds, and so much more. I can't say enough good things about it..",
"This app has been a god send, My husband had a long stay in the hospital, and this app had all the information I needed to stay up to date when I couldn't be there. It is also very easy to message with Doc's and schedule appointments.",
"Was a good app, just stopped working randomly. I have been trying to log in for days now and it just will not let me because of the terms and conditions not want to load. I have new and important messages to read there but I can't see them. How can I fix this?",
I don't know where I would be without my MyChart... It keeps track of all my doctor's appointments and physical therapy. And if I have a question it's right there for an answer. Happy,
"Setup password, tried to log in and it failed 5 times, setup another, same thing, tried to setup a third password, and everyone did the same thing. I can't give it a lower rating or I would..",
"My new OBGYN introduced me to this app. &text it to my phone to show me how to set it up. It's super user friendly, very informative & I love that you can receive results w/in a few hrs & also chat w/your Doctor. I will definitely make sure my family members & friends are using this app. I would give it more than 5 stars 🌟 if I could.",
"The app does not tell you what/where to find the new message/ test result/appointment/prescription refill... It simply lets you know that SOMETHING has been updated/ sent to your chart, then you have to go to 5-7 places to find out what it is.",
I'm glad to be able to have this app it saves a lot of time and worries,
Excellent app to have so one has access to their medical records. Past and future appointment records. Meds through pharmacy are easily refilled through app. Give on control to allowing others granted access as wanted.,
"App seems to be getting better. However, app collects a lot of personal data like email, 1st & last name etc. to sell. I am not ok with this.",
I couldn't load my messages or past or future appointments for me or my son on the app but was able to access them on the browser but it takes a long time for it to load. It has been very helpful when it works properly.,
Won't let me pay bills in app. I log in and it says I have a balance soni click on it to pay. It asks for the card information but when I enter it there is to option to submit or continue. The only options available are back and cancel.,
What are the best apps very satisfied with my chart I recommended for everyone signed Bob welke,
Love that I can go on my chart to see upcoming apts and don't have to call into he clinic and wait for a long time and hold up the lines for someone else who might have a need that is more urgent than mine.,
"I HIGHLY recommend MyChart!! I love being able to get tests results within a few hours, e-checking in for appointments, and going back to check results from a few years ago to make comparisons. I am my husband's caregiver and I honestly don't know what I'd do without MyChart!!!",
"Everything I need is in one place. I can easily communicate with my Doctor(s), schedule appointments, review my test results, etc., for me it that's important.",
"Great system for keeping all your medical records in one spot, and to keep track of appointments. I use both the Android and Windows versions.",
it only lists 2 of my doctors and I cannot add the others... plus when I checked in for an appointment I had to manually add all of my medical history and then none of it saved in the MyChart app... so I am going to have to do it again.. . this is ridiculousness..,
"This app is easy to use, I can access my test results and easy to make/cancel future appointments. When I message my doctor I get fast responses. Today tho I cannot get on due to error but could be the system is down.",
"I thought I could just log in with the user ID and password I used to register through CVS's website. However, it asked for my state and then listed participating healthcare facilities in that state - and I did not see CVS among them.",
I would rate this app a 5 star; however I have tried multiple times to verify my phone number by having a text sent to my phone and it NEVER sends the code. It's very annoying to have to have it sent to my email instead,
Extremely pleased for the support through the app.,
Best app for staying in contact with my doctors and getting the test results in an efficient manner. Kudos to the development team and the coding specialists,
Compared to many other medical applications I am forced to use. This one is a really nice change. It works well does what it is intended to do and gives me an easy and quick portal to access my doctor and doctor's office,
"Frustrated!! I downloaded, created an account, log in, pass and when I attempt to log in for results, it says log in not valid. Keeps bouncing me around and can't get in. Is there something I should know? Poss. Doing something wrong? Ugghh",
This has been wonderful having all my health information at my fingertips. Being able to see notes from the doctor is great. Alot less waiting & wondering what is going on,
"We've been with the same insurance company for many, many years & when this app began getting used by medical personnel & their notes about visits, appointments, messages and request refills for medicines; I saw the potential for fewer medical errors & this app gives control back to the patients! #YayIris [Additional optional info below, I answered via the star rating, the first being 5☆ bc to my knowledge there aren't any ads inside the app, idt!]",
"Very easy to use, makes communication with my Doctor super easy. I also get to schedule appointments and check on all lab results through the app.",
"Excellent App. Get confirmations of hospital visits, test results, etc. straight away without having to wait weeks for a letter! All medical appointments etc together in one place.",
"MyChart used to have a tab to keep the username. It doesn't have that feature on the new updated MyChart. Every app has a ""Remember Me"" feature, except MyChart. It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying.",
"This app now takes up more storage than Facebook! If you made it like that, you could at least program it so it can be put on an SD card!!! I have space issues and may have to delete it.",
"Easy to use. For people complaining about the screenshots use the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner to access the app preferences, I there you can enable screenshots.",
"VERY POOR scheduling feature. Too easy to schedule doctor appointment for the wrong day, which is of course, medically dangerous. There ought to be safeguards for a sick person trying to schedule. I WILL NEVER USE THAT FEATURE AGAIN. It's not worth the risk!",
"Very confusing, multiple entries",
POS app. I can use the MyChart web page just fine. However the app has been impossible to recognize my account. The user interface for creating an account without an access code appears to be created by amatures.,
Very easy to get around in once you figure it all out,
Junk. Says there is a new version right out of the box. Edit 13/7: Still garbage. Unusable because it says there's a newer version available even after a fresh install from the store.,
This was so hard to navigate I tried several times to set it up and had difficulty every time. I'm not sure whether I actually got it set up or not. All I want to know if the results of my covid test,
Could not create an account didn't like my name and password that I used to try to log in. Kept trying to figure out what was wrong and eventually it just bomed my account totally. Says to contact my chart. Gives no info how to contact them.,
Very attentive with patients..,
It's not bad. Can't clear reminders. My doc ordered a test. 6 months ago. I had the test done. Results were loaded into my chart by testing facility. Reminder to have testing done is still there.,
I love that I can connect with my Dr. and see all of my health information.,
I absolutely love this! I can get in touch with my doctors of I don't have a chance to actually call with no background noise. I can also see test results and records from prior visits which helps when you don't have the greatest memory.,
"Fantastic app, keeps track of all my appointments, past,present and future! I receive all my test results as fast as the doctor gets them! The only thing I am still waiting for is an update of my vaccinations.",
"I absolutely love My Chart. I like being able to get my test results faster, having access to all of my records, but most of all, I like being able to make, change, and confirm my appointments online without have to wait on the phone forever to talk to someone. I can get answers to my questions right from my Dr so much faster then waiting for someone in the office to call me back. I also like knowing that if I have to go to another hospital for emergency treatment, that my Dr can see those notes",
"Can't find where I can print from a mobile device. I always like to keep a copy of my lab work. Also, having trouble viewing past ""relpy"" messages from my doctors. I have to find my original message that I sent.",
Have to use it wish there was something better. Give me an alert to schedule but then tells me I am ineligible. Can't dismiss the alert so it clutters the screen. Hard to navigate,
I like having my information easily accessible. I would like to add a picture on my own instead of having one taken off of the internet. Being to change that would be very helpful.,
App is awful. Great that one can view test results but the video never works for appointments....I've ensured the permissions allow for mic and camera...nothing.,
"Useful! Message doctors and Healthcare providers directly. Analyze your med exam results directly on the website/app. The app itself crashes sometimes, but much more useful than literally millions of other apps!",
User friendly and very convenient!,
It's very convenient and you can do it all through the app,
"The UM clinic phones have changed to a main distribution center then they route to clinic, horrible experience everytime! The app will give you quicker responce times then the phone most of the time since the phones changed.",
"I've had to make appointments/cancel appointments and check test results. This app has made it easy for me to get the information I need without haveing to call, get transferred and waiting on hold. I would recommend it to anyone.",
"Very useful in keeping up on your health. It's nice to be able to communicate with your care team via the app, schedule appointments and check any test results you may have.",
"It really bothers me that my vaccines and preventative services, (ie. Colonoscopies, bone density , mammograms ...) are NEVER correct on MyChart. I have had them ALL but there is no way to update any of them except for the flu vaccine. Even after Dr. visits these do not get updated. Frustrating!",
"Absolutely useless! Doesnt tell you anything , doesnt even let you delete wrong or old meds but will delete if you swipe on diagnosis to see if it give you definition which it doesnt. Billing even stinks ! No dates of service just a total of what THEY say. Worst app Iv ever used seriously.",
I find this app very helpful and easy to use,
"Once I was able to figure it out, for the most part, it had been wonderful to be able to refer back to it to talk with new doctors or urgent care or the ER. It's nice to have all of my medical info in one location.",
Very nice app but since not all my doctors are using it. I thinks I don't have health care visits set. It would be great to be able to add providers appointments not affiliated with Englewood Hospital. My regular doctor isn't affiliated with any hospital.,
Well its extremely hard to use. Notifications never come to my phone. Things don't get updated. I'm left in the dark because everything is done through the app so basically my health-care is worse than before this app,
"Love this app. Has everything I need for appointments at my hands. However, it will not let me verify my phone number. I click verify so it can send a code via text and nothing happens.",
It's so helpful everything is right there when needed to be found,
"Very handy and a huge time saver for non-urgent inquiries, reviewing results, and so forth. There is a bug in the biometric login: when you enable biometrics login for one organization it breaks it for other organizations.",
"Smartest Idea in a long time! Easy Contact with Entire medical team. No calls for Refills,just Request. Many Hospitals involved,Your Drs( most) are connected to one of them usually. Easy also,..Well Done..Try it FYI.. IF not working on your Device, I can safely say,The App Is Strong,well made. Clean Ur device/ CK Permissions. Promise,It's Solid!",
"Wow?????!!! Just installed and entered my password and keep getting an error message that terms and conditions could not be loaded. Multiple times. So far, just like Honor Health, this app is awful.",
I haven't been able to login through the app. constantly tells me my info is wrong and when I select to reset it I get an error message. I'm not even sure this app is available and running.,
"Easy to navigate and find or make schedules for appointments, for someone who forgets most the time the alarm function has been helping a lot .",
Doctor Penhall is very good and I enjoy my appointment.,
"I keep getting emails about updates to my record. When i go to MyChart to see them, there is nothing new and/or no clue where the new info would be. Its a waste of time!",
I can see my results before dr visit and its a history of medical records plus appt and ability to ask nurse questions.,
Great to have health information quickly. Menu navigation a little tricky. Some reminders stay too long. Follow up with practice if no response rarely needed.,
Very easy to use and extremely helpful. You get messages to remind you of certain things that you need done such as vaccines and wellness screening. Love this app!,
The best way to keep track and understand your medical,
It's SO frustrating that I can't change any settings. I've paid my bills by mail for 45+ years and this downgrade to only communicating with my phone is disappointing!,
1. I'd like to scroll thru my Lab results INSTEAD OF viewing 1 result at a time. 2. I'd like to Bookmark more than 1 message at a time. 3. I'd like the Bookmarked messages moved to its own page(s). 4. I'd like to Delete more than 1 message at a time. 5. How long do I have to RESTORE Deleted messages???,
MyChart has become easier to access and use. It's easy to leave a message for Provider Team although it may take 24 hrs or more to receive a reply. I like MyChart very much now compared to 4 or 5 yrs ago. The three questions below can't be fully read.,
Long delays accessing information.,
I appreciate this app. Test results at my finger tips . I have a direct line of communication with my entire health care team . I simply leave a message in the app and they message me back within an hour . Great job Wake Forest for using MyChart. Believe me I have shared this with them,
"Excellent for scheduling appointments, and communicating with my provider. I do wish the reminders could actually be removed instead of sleeping and keep coming back.",
"MyChart is very easy to use. I like being able to send messages back and forth with my doctor or the nurse, rather than calling. It helps to keep up with appointment dates, past and future. All your doctors on one App! Awesome!",
get uptodate info before it arrives in the post very good app,
"Very convenient for checking test results, refill prescriptions, Dr. appointments.",
Easy to navigate. Fast. New data arrives quickly. Layout quite good.,
Makes you able to access medical records and send messages to doctors. Even gives you access to images from testing. Essential for reviewing and sharing medical records and obtaining documentation from visits/tests. Allows doctors across different organizations to review all MyChart records through linked accounts.,
Amazing and timely,
I did really like how it worked and used it frequently. Especially while at a Dr visit for dates and discuss ion but since last update it is slower and I even have problems bringing it up it takes forever. Not really happy right now.,
"Great app. All your records on your phone. Well managed. Love being able to ask questions and get a quick response, schedule appointments, and request med refills.",
"App has really come a long way. I can message with my doctor, schedule appointments, see my records, and do the same for family members in my care. Seems to have strong security in place, too, while being relatively easy to use.",
Some appointments can make online but earlier ones are found by calling nurse. Has messages to doctor and test results. Would be nice to have access to doctor notes and which medicines not to take or what to do after check ups. 4/5! Edit.. Cant contact mental services or doctor. Video phone appts are questionable and sometimes cancelled. Need to inform patients when services are closed for holiday to be able to go to er. Other options are hidden and dont work or send you out of app. Needsupdate!,
My Chart is a very awesome app. It makes sure that you get your test results on time. I'm really happy that I downloaded it and installed it. Such a great app. Thank you for making it for me ok. Dennis DiLullo,
"Super easy and helpful when going through my chart, history, and upcoming appointments. Grateful that I have this to go by when I'm on the go as my days have been scheduled. Thank You for having this option to go to.",
App will not work & let me connect to see my results or information because my hospital is not listed & theres no way to add providers that aren't on the list. Well thought out plan guys! Worst app I've ever put on my phone.... congrats,
I REALLY love this app! I have two other medical app systems I use with other doctors. My Chart is by far the easiest and best one out of the three! I LOVE the fact I can help keep my medical and pharmaceutical information current.,
"Fast and easy to get ahold of anyone for help , and instantly notified when you have a next appointment, test results everything on your phone when you need to check ✔ the ladies at the clinic are so helpful & kind. Would definitely recommend 👌",
Easy to use & get in touch with your doc.,
Easy to navigate and great to connect multiple hospitals and portals to have quick access to all your records in one place,
"Very useful app. I am able to schedule, cancel and reschedule appointments with my doctor. I can communicate directly through the app with my doctor any time.",
It's very helpful and useful and very convenient,
"Discrimimating people based on their income - saying there's a newer version although I just downloaded it. I'm sure it's because of code error, not liking my older smartphone with Android 4.4. Not everyone should have the newest gadgets to track their health!",
"It was good for awhile, and then cant sign in everytime i try it say there is a problem with the server , so i had to unistall and delete, it sucks now. I try to sign in way too many time isntall and unistall and make no diference , i was happy at the begining when i srart using it now its bad too bad.",
It is amazing when you have everthing in one place. Never missed an appointment with and less calls made to the doctors office because of this app. It's just great and I'm happy about it.,
"Useless for me right now. Won't let you sign in unless you select a healthcare facility. I don't have one, just wanted to see my MinuteClinic chart but couldn't get past the ""select a facility and sign in"" stage.",
It is exceptionally designed and easy to use. I live being able to do ally pre-visit check in questions before I arrive and also take care of any co-payments. I have used another health organizations mobile app and MyChart is far superior. Well done!,
I absolutely dislike this new MyChart I love the old portal. I cannot email my doctor. It has the wrong as my primary and I cannot change it. I've been trying to refill my medication for 3 weeks I can't get anyone to respond back through the charts or through calling or through Walgreens sending a request. I want the old one back so I can email my doctor directly. Totally dissatisfied,
"When it works, it's fine. However, this app is rarely able to load. Most of the time I get an error message and cannot retrieve new information regarding my care. However, it always works well on my pc.",
"As a senior citizen. I love MyChart. It has all my medications, notes from my doctor's, test results, and all my upcoming appointments all at the tap of my finger. I can easily email my doctor with any questions I might have. It makes my life easier and I love that.",
I will not use this app or give a damn about this app this help you try to download it and then wait for 4 hours or better to talk to a representative to make sure that you are hooked up to the app truly unsatisfactory noise can do better but the employees is just feeling a little too soft and they can just don't answer the phone or call you back when they feel like it I don't have the time this is an app that I would not use or recommend anyone use,
"I really appreciate being able to casually communicate with my health providers, receive messages from them that I can review at my leisure, schedule appointments where I find the best available time, and see my medical history at a glance. It really is helping me keep up with important medical information for my better health.",
"The concept is ideal. Though it would be helpful to be able to schedule more services. Such as testing, lab work, nurse visits..etc. Being charged for ""email/messaging"" your Doctor's through MyChart? Why? Frequently the responses you receive are from nurses or other members of their staff. The nice thing is that you can access test results and are able to schedule some appointments.",
So very useful. I keep track of my appointments and my mother's and scheduling/rescheduling is very easy. I really like the fact that I can see the results of all of her tests and reports on her procedures within hours.,
This app is subpar and has no development oversight. The update email and phone number doesn't work after you confirm. This is restrictive and prohibiting proper access to my medical information. Is that on purpose? Who is accountable?,
I have a new Android so I don't know why I have the problems I have. I try to go to one subject and messaging or tests and it just thinks and thinks and thinks and then goes back to the home screen takes me forever to get any information from this app. If I'm the only one that has this problem I'm sorry I wrote this.,
Works great. Love the trending.,
Easy to use. Messaging and setting up appointments in app is easy. Love that all notes and results are in one place.,
"easy to use, love that I can read my own results",
"This app makes it easy to make appointments, message my doctor, and request refills. It is better and cheaper than going to the doctor's office every time I have a question. The app works smoothly and it is user friendly.",
There's no back button! I get stuck on a page and can't go back to home page. I've even tried the back button on my pull down screen on my LG phone. Previously it worked. But now I can only tap it once. Please fix this issue.,
You can't change the doctor that you want to see. You are forced to select whomever is selected which is only one person in the list. The practice has many doctors. Not sure why you are not allowed to choose others. Poor programming and/or business design.,
A really useful app. It allows real-time access to lab reports and reminders of up coming appointments along with very useful notes on doctors visits. Best app of all my physicians.,
This is a necessary app to have when you are experiencing many health issues. My information is handily available with a click which includes test results and other important items. You should add this to your list!! I highly recommend...,
Mr. Johnson has been a great help to me and appreciate the work he has done for me.,
Try your best to use an IHC hospital everything about them seems to be better. In their app as soon as the labs are tests are done I can see them whether the doctor is seen them or not and it's been that way for years this one it can take days and weeks for results to show up.,
"I don't even know what purpose this app is supposed to serve, since I literally can't access any useful information, message my provider, request an appointment or anything else the app advertises. I just wasted my time signing up for this app because it doesn't actually do anything.",
"I love this option. I was calling the office with my questions and waiting for a callback. Now I just type it in & hit ""send"". I usually get an answer within 48 hrs. My phone will tell me when I have a message ""waiting"". It's great 😃. Saves a lot of time and now I don't have to bug the nurses.",
"I love this app! I'm very forgetful alot of the time and being able to log in and see my appointments makes my life easier. Also, it is great being able to email your doctor instead of having to call on the phone.",
Great app for medical aid 🔥,
"I love this app! It keeps track of all of my appointments, my test results, my medications, and my extensive medical history. I'm able to schedule appointments and email my doctors. Don't change a thing!",
I really enjoy using this app. It offers quick support. You get information updated on the go. You can reach out to your Healthcare provider within the app. All your information in one place. You basically take your records with you wherever you go. Love it.,
"I always have problems logging in using the app, making it unusable 90% of the time. No issues logging into the MyChart desktop site, only the app.",
"This application has always an issue with keeping you to constantly prompt you to update your cellphone and you do follow command and IT DOESN'T WORK? what a waste of time, you'll need to something about this??? Thank you.",
"It's complicated, but I do utilize it, & appreciate it. I'd like to see more functions, with simple patient knowledge. Like, bloodtype for instance, various ailments diagnosed already, etc...",
Great easy user-friendly navigation,
This app is awful to use . I have t change my password at last 2 times a month. This should not be happening. It's a hot mess,
This app really helps me keep up with my appointments and medication,
Been a great app. Then now I can't even get a code to look at my chart. Which I need so I don't have to look up all my papers for new doctor. Need to fix it. I'll just delete it and keep my old way of records. Thank,
"Couldn't remember user name, called help desk (man was very polite) but information given was incorrect and completly useless. Tried to call back within 5 minutes and all I get is a recording.",
Easy way to keep track of ALL medical issues. I absolutely LOVE this app. I can communicate with my Dr.& all the clinicians that are part of my health care very easily. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,
Good and useful with some issues and glitches. Last issue I encountered was booking a test/procedure that requires physical presence but only telephone appointment option was available.,
Very helpful. Easy navigation,
I like this app because it helps me with my appointments. The main issue is trying to log into my account. I kept getting an error telling me that there is a problem with the login and to try again. I did and got the same thing over and over. Needs fixing urgently.,
"I like it,its so simple,except having to wait 48 hours for a question to be answered",
It's been fine can you send me some contact lenses,
"Never had any issues until march 22,2021 The app now is crashing every time I launch it. Unless I uninstall and reinstall then it works for that time . Not sure how to fix the problem.",
It used to be a good app but it removed one of my children's account without my permission and I no longer have access to his information. Like how you gonna remove a child without my permission. He has a huge medical history that has been easily accessible until recently.,
"It's very easy to use, gives to quick access to test results, direct communication with your doctor, the ability to share your medical history quickly. It's just a nice app.",
super slow with poor results. NOT HAPPY can someone get on the stick and fix all these problems. good lord this is totally just terrible. your app does work at all and no communacation of letting us know that you're even looking into this. damm good thing we did not pay for this. come on!! fix it.,
"My chart tells you to call phone numbers that cannot be completed as failed, never answered, or send you on a 4 phone chase that ends up with person answers, they have no idea why you were giving that number. The land lines cannot receive texts. Revive appointment 1 day before.",
"Like the easy use but if someone inputs incorrect information, it is impossible to correct or remove it & no one is knowledgeable for correcting this. Such as updating ""Coverage Details"" or ""COVID Vaccinating Record"". This needs to be updated.",
"After clicking on any link, there is no way to get back to the home screen...very frustrating because I have to close and reopen the app. Also, it would be nice to be able to upload a photo or document.",
"Not dependable. Most everytime I use it I get a 500 message, something about the server. Not sure who has the problem. It's a wonderful tool, if it worked.",
"This is the most awesome app I have ever experienced!! All my health records, tests, Dr's visits, their notes, etc... available with just access to the internet!!! And it works! That software company needs to be contracted by the Florifa DEO to fix their reemployment system!!?",
"Very good app but the reminders a bit overdone, I only need one..Also they should clean up the opening screen, some of the stuff seems a bit too overbearing.",
"You can't pay your bills anymore! I just got a ""60 days late"" notice from my clinic, and there's STILL no billing information on the app! I know I used to pay through here, and it was *brilliant* - I don't know what's changed. There's no info on the website version either, so SOMETHING has gone horribly sideways. What happened, y'all?",
"Love this app! I can communicate with my doctor and the nurse is so much easier. I get quick responses, better than if I would call. You can see results of your test and your x-rays way before you see your doctor. Helps you worry less.",
"I get notifications saying I have a new messages but I can't find them. Messages sometimes disappears. I don't get all my test results. Being a heart transplant patient, I'm afraid I'll miss something important so it's useless to me.",
I've been using this app for over a year & have loved using it!My old Dr.used to work for University Healthcare & was always available to message if I needed any questions answered on this app!I would get this app & install it on your phone if you have a MyChart account!I can also message my former nurse/care manager on this app as well!Get this app & install it!You won't be steered wrong!,
"Too many Drs on it and it gets crazy and too hard to navigate. It's not clear where to go, and using back button spits you back out. I really hate using my chart but every Dr wants me to and requires it almost. I hate this app.",
"Clear on all of the information for your appointments, easy to read and if any questions there are numbers to call. Very helpful and you can read all of the notes about your visits. Can also schedule, cancel or reschedule appointments.",
It's great to be able to see all your appointments and test results,
It's good. Makes thing go faster.,
"Love this app, it makes everything so much easier to access.",
"This is the most user friendly, informative, convenient app I've ever used for my healthcare. Definitely worth downloading and using for all of your healthcare and communication needs. Excellent!!!",
I really appreciate the MyChart app. It is so helpful to have all my Parkview Doctors notes and test results in one place ! It's so easy to use and has made my life easier when it comes to my health care. Thank you !!,
"The app is awesome! It's nice being able to access your medical records without having to call the doctor's office, request the records, go to the office to pick them up or wait for staff to fax or email them. It's also, a great way to communicate directly with all of your doctor's. I highly recommend downloading the app.",
Love the app. Use it daily due to chronic illness. Only suggestion I have would be the ability to upload a pic so a Dr can see if you need an appt asap or it can wait. And for drs to be able to upload images from scans would be nice. But it's a really good app.,
I don't like the updated version of mychart . When u msg ur Dr. It doesn't spell out ur msg correctly it scrambles ur msg up very Badly and u can't update your address everything is all mixed up 🤔 put it back to the way it was and u can't get current doctor appts !! what's going on this isn't right.,
"Will not open. It said it cannot comunicate with server. Works on the web. They keep changing the format, and they get worse every time. If you want to send a message, you can't see what you type..",
"I had recent brain surgery & this app has made managing appointments, doctor's notes & payments easy. It's so helpful to have everything in one place. I use this app every day. I love it, thank you.",
Fantastic app. Highly recommend for everyone,
"Functionally worthless. Slow, clunky UI. Your information doesn't update. When things start going wrong with the app, there's no way to get help in the app. Why was I required to get this garbage?",
"Keeps me abreast of my Dr. Appts. and health status. Also, gives me the option to send my Drs. a message without having to wait on the phone. It would be nice if there was an option to recognize an employee for a special service that he or she performed!",
Always at your fingertips and up to date. Love the pre check in. If all the marbles are rolling in the right direction your messages are promptly answered. Easy peasy!,
"My Chart gives me access to any of my records & test results. I like being able to have & control of my own records, test results, & Drs notes. I'm able to make appts, ask a ?, Or refill meds online. I've always got answers the same day I've contacted the Dr. It has a reminder for all my appts which is nice if you have a lot of appts with different Drs. If you have a busy life or busy taking care of children MyChart helps to make sure your taking care of yourself as well.",
"Server has been down for a few weeks now, can't read my messages from the doctor",
"This is a great app, as long as your team is the one to receive your messages. They respond quickly and are ready to help. The only flaw is when your team is unavailable, your message goes unanswered for days, if it ever gets answered at all.",
I no longer can connect through this app. I don't understand what's wrong. I've done everything since the latest update and it has completely failed and no one can help me so incredibly disappointed.,
"Easy to use, and is updated instantly. There seems to be no possibility to input something myself, like it tells me that my wellness visit is overdue, but I went and apparently the Dr.'s office did not enter it.",
"Naming the app ""my"" is obnoxiously possessive. With minimal configurability and only allowing epic based data sources I removed the app as soon as I got my results. Big brother still has them I'm sure but so it goes.",
Great app everything is all safely stored in one place. Only issue i have is requesting my refills. You have to make an appointment to see your doctor to get your refills. Still it's a awesome app.,
"I absolutely love getting access any records or appointment information I need right from an app. You can schedule and check dates for appointments, send messages to your doctors, refill prescriptions, and even access medical files like x-rays and lab results!",
"Sub par, appointments need to update once completed. Update: per your reply, old or past appointments should not show unless you search under past visits and not be clumped in ALL visits.",
Easy to use with complete access to information.,
"Would have been five star but, there are a couple dates that are wrong and list of procedures that were never done, that says were done. Accuracy is not 100%. Other than that it's a great app",
"Very helpful app. for keeping track of all of my appointments, test results, and referrals.",
"This is an awesome application. It allows my doctors to coordinate directly with me and for me to interface directly with them. I can see my medication, I can ask questions, and there's an assortment of other tasks that can be done. I suppose there are privacy concerns that are important to many but frankly I'm not sure there are any secrets anymore anyway. I do believe however, that the developers did their best to keep confidential information confidential. Dave Merritt, Chester, Virginia",
"The previous version made sense and was simple to use, but this is just a mess and doesn't work half the time. Sometimes I wish I could just look at a calendar to see where my appointments are but it doesn't have that option.",
All of your medical info in one place associated with docs who interact with MyChart. Very well organized and convenient. Covid vaccine records are there in QR scan form for traveling purposes. The app does a national database search for the info. Medication list is there plus all medical records and appt attended.,
Great app to have to manage your healthcare needs!,
I didn't have any trouble with my televisits but then since this spring I haven't been able to connect with my provider at all and now it's June and I have tried once a month for the last 3 or 4 months and I still cannot get a hold of him. This is very frustrating.,
"It is so convenient to access notes from my doctor(s), test results, appointment reminders, and pre-appointment check in available on my phone. I also line the convenience of my children's ""Charts"" linked to mine.",
"At first the app would not download from the Play Store despite numerous attempts on different dates. So finally it download from Chrome browser on mobile device, attempted logging into numerous my chart accounts (in app) from different facilities, but message stated ”app out of date, before proceeding needed to update the app"". What gives?",
I love that I can see my info any time day or nite!,
"Great app! So easy to schedule and cancel appointments, read prescriptions, check appointment history, change medical coverage information etc. Very glad to have this app.",
"I absolutely LOVE this app! It's positively WONDERFUL about submitting scripts for refills! Instead of leaving a message for a busy nurse to sit down & hear messages @ the end of a tiring day & THEN send them to the Dr to approve the NEXT day, all info is right in front of them & instead of the prerequisite ""allow 72 business hours"".....blah blah blah. I've seen me put it in late on a Sunday night & get a text from my pharmacy BEFORE noon the following morning! Totally awesome dude 👍🏻",
The app is very nice but im trying to change photo but is not working thanks,
"📌 Sharpen your crayons kids and go back to the drawing board. This app sucks. 5 out of 5 doctors agree. That's really not fair, one of them should not be a doctor, but I digress. The app is ridiculous. It emails me constantly and when I log in there's nothing. Also it has so many mistakes in my history. After what it took to get my name spelled right. I hate it. Why is there no place for the patient to leave notes or correct our doctor's lies and innuendos. Godspeed-",
I have had difficulty changing info. I tried to change my emergency contact and it froze on the County when I was entering her address. I tried it multiple different time periods....very frustrating. I will just have it changed in an office.,
Difficult 2 get in. Keeps saying error or going back 2 sign in page.,
I can't pay my bill through the app. It just redirects you back to the start. I've called on this and have to wait on hold to pay my bill. I had been able to pay using the app but now I can't and it's since been 2yrs.,
"After update, my insurance keeps clearing after I input it. Have input it multiple times now and when doing pre visit steps, it states no coverage on file.",
"I check to see results of tests but when I ask a question it never goes through. It comes back to ""ask a question"". I find if this doesn't work then it is useless to me. Fix it !!",
"Love it for scheduling appointments, because ARC DOES NOT 🚫 answer the phone. Also good for getting results of test and office visits. Bonus! You can add others to your Account so you can see whole family in one login.",
"Overall, this is a fabulous app and a wonderful way to coordinate all my Healthcare. HOWEVER - It seems ridiculous to have the app check me in, and then I still have to check in at the desk. What a waste of my time to check in on the app at all.",
For some reason everytime i open app it takes me to play store then have to hit open?,
"There was a lot of information coming at me and my family while I was in the hospital. The MyChart app made things much easier to understand, as well as being able to forward info to other healthcare providers. Total transparency, a very powerful tool.",
It been good so far haven't had any problems,
I live this app. Everything u need to know like test results or appointments,
"Server always seems to be down, I can hardly ever see my after visit Sunday or doctor's notes",
This app is not only very useful but informative too. It reminds you of appointments you may not have or in your diary and you can read all of your medical information. From letters following scans to post op observations.,
Doesn't even save your log in. Your browser is MUCH better than this worthless app. Ironically reading the positive reviews they mistake the app for the service. It IS great in your web browser. But as I mentioned don't WASTE your time with the app.,
This app has been a lifeline for me and my health needs. Works great.,
"Really like my chart, great way to correspond with my Doctor.",
"There should be an option to remove the section that lists goals on the main home screen of the app, as mine lists personal information that I would not want anyone else who may within the viewable distance from my screen to see.",
Great app links everyone. Everything in one place is awsome,
Me an my family has been treated with care an compassion while dealing with my cancer an this app is a massive blessing keeping up with everything.,
It would be better if there was a way to double check whether providers received requests for appointments. I have sent 2 requests to the same provider for an appointment with no response... Did they get it? No idea.,
Great App User Friendly Very helpful for all to use.,
Always happy with the amount of time of response to questions.,
Make things easier Like to comunique with them !!,
"Love this app very easy, keeps me informed of all my past,present,and future medical information.",
Needs more features maybe even a video call/meeting option.,
I always have to re-verify even though I'm using my finger print. I was thinking that I was talking to my daughter's doctors office. Someone else messaged me back saying that I needed to contact her doctors office 😐 ......I was under the impression that this app was linked to the doctors office portal.....they shouldn't tell people that this is a quick and easy way to speak with your child's medical team because it's just a flat out lie....🤨😐😑😶🤦🏾‍♀️🤔,
Great way to learn and understand better our medical health but don't fool yourself into believing what you read because the ways and means of any professional practice are far beyond our ability to assess and interpret. But the service is the next best thing for all curious patients.,
A pain to use. The Email notification log in worked well. With the stupid new app when I go back in to the regular one it gets in a loop. Useless. I di not need a disfunctional app.,
I love having all my test or appt info all in one,
I love the convienance of having access to all of my medical records in one place.,
"Can not schedule an appointment. It prompts me to select appointment type, but the screen is blank. Do not have the ability to send messages to my dr. App says ""no available recipient"".",
It doesn't work most of the time. I log in and I get the first page with menu then when i try to see something it doesn't load,
"It's great helps me keep up with appointments, and even reminds me of new ones. Also gives you information about the appointment you just finished. You ask questions and even sign up for assistance if you need it.",
Seamless control of everything medical! Great app.,
Why can I NEVER make an appointment through this app!? It's ridiculous!,
"Upgrade made it impossible to sign in with my code # , very annoying",
I enjoy my virtual visits with Dr.G Khuns.& it's so convenient and it's so nice to go on there for my prescriptions set up an appointment with my doctor or the hospital is wonderful I love that MyChart and it saves time.,
"I use MyChart a lot. I just moved cities, so I like I can have my old city MyChart to get to past records and the new city MyChart to see my new Dr's items.",
This App is very very helpful and give you all the important info you need right in your hands I recomend this App,
Great app! Saves time & travel,
Easy to communicate with your Doctors and their staff.,
Very easy to use!,
Simple and very informative,
The security code doesn't copy to the log in just started doing this,
"Can't link accounts between WA state organization and a TX organization. Spent all day with MyChart teams of either org and still NOTHING. App and web browser MyChart login of old org says ""cannot authenticate external acct"" of new org. New org MyChart doesn't even give search option to link accts. Both teams at a loss to troubleshoot after 7 phone calls.",
Very nice and helpful to have this,
"My Advent Health provider wanted me to download this app and once you try and select a health provider, Advent Health or even Aetna is not an option....something isn't right, so one star review it is.",
"I'm not able to schedule appointments, only cancel them",
Wonderful app! Easy and efficient!,
"Excellent app. Make appts, cancel appts, receive reminders about health matters, send notes to your medical team, see your lab results, see which prescriptions you are prescribed... Great app!!",
Very good setup and easy to use.,
Easy to navigate through.,
I have not been able to access my info it says server error please fix,
Very well thought out and detailed layout. Easy communication with my MD's. Each update gets better.,
Great app to help and keep up with appointments and questions,
"Comprehensive, and easy to use!",
Awesome. I don't miss my appointments with this app.,
"This is the best thing for me, do to I can get my family medical history.",
I can keep up with all my appointments very good app,
I love having access to see all of my records and billing in one place. It makes it so easy to manage my Healthcare. Thank you.,
"A very useful app! Since update, however, it is very slow to load, and stays on the main screen for several minutes. Not sure why",
Absolute garbage. Make an account MULTIPLE TIMES and can never ever sign in. All I want are my covid results. It's BS that they can text you 100x leading up to the covid test and then when it's time to see the results you all the sudden need this account? Why not text them to me you f*****s!,
"I would be lost without this app. So much information and all my appts..past and present. My test results.. everything I can think of at my finger tips..all my doctors..medication.. even suggestions of vaccines, scans & test needed. Approaching my age I appreciate all the help and aid I can get. Thanks MyChart.",
Sometimes I have a hard time accessing. But I enjoy the convenience of accessing my information and my providers.,
"The app is extremely convenient for communicating with my doctors for setting appointments, asking questions and receiving lab results, not to mention virtual visits. A must have app for me...",
Doctors keep being removed from messaging/scheduling.,
"Brilliant, I can see all my son's test results 😎 Would be nicer if there was a graph plotted with all the blood test results.",
It's a very informative app,
I love this app. I enjoy the fact that most of my medical information is just a finger tip (portal) away. The app seems to be user friendly because I can find my way around easily. I enjoy how quickly things are updated ie. doctor's note(s) from visit.,
I love how I have instant access to me an my children test results and medicines. Its like my records on the go. Can't ask for a better app. I give 5 stars,
"The app did not send 2 of the last 3 refills I requested to the pharmacy. I was asked to email developers, which I did. No response and the problem still exists, it is getting my refill requests to my pharmacy. Very disappointing.",
I like being able to combine all of my Doctors into one app. This is very convenient for me to lookup all of my medical records.,
"Love ""My Chart"". Things are so much easier.",
It's easy to use and gives lots of information.,
Really helps keep all medical records in one place.,
"Helpful overall, really unnecessary to have to log in to different clinics/organizations. Do this in the backend where patients aren't required to navigate, no one knows or cares if their provider is with St Charles or Summit or anywhere else.",
Quality of Life dr in anniston al DOES NOT even use it.,
A huge thank you to Valley Health Milton!!! Dr. Dillon and support staff always helps in anyway they can. My gratitude is overflowing for the help you have given me!!!,
"Very easy to navigate, all the needed information is there, your doctors, appointments, payments, messages",
Not much to say I get the results before the doctor calls to tell what they are,
I've enjoyed this until they added Oklahoma University now it won't let me see most dtuff.,
The app is easy to use and provides quick access to medical information.,
"So nice to have everything from records to test(s) / shot(s) due, Message your MUSC doctors, pay bill, pre check in for upcoming appts, schedule / change / cancel appts all in one spot. User friendly interface. If you deal w/ MUSC - even for a COVID 19 test ... download the app.",
"I like the app,but I lose my password occasionally and I have a hassle getting it to reset,wish this could be fixed its a pain!",
Easy to access and to get in touch with a provider,
Having to reset passwords too often and have a password keeper. Take too much messing around.,
"Used to work but now it doesn't. I can't see my upcoming appointments, look at my test results, or do anything that would help me with my care. The app is up to date, but it doesn't work properly. This is my ONLY way of seeing my appointments. Please fix this.",
Missing helpful features that are available through the mobile website such as viewing the history of lab results and seeing them on a chart.,
"MyChart has made life easier as messaging, ordering prescriptions, seeing test results and appointments coming and scheduling.",
Easy to use and navigate,
"Absolutely LOVE my MyChart! I am able to communicate with my Dr. (Who is also the best Dr. EVER!) I can easily reach my Dr. If I have questions about my medications, any upcoming tests & blood work that needs to be done. This App is laid out perfectly! Reminders are sent to your phone if it is time for prescription refills, & if you run outof refills, you can request more refills online & your Dr. Can quickly get that done. Like I said. it's awesome! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!",
"Excellent app. I love it very easy to access and all your information is safe and secure. I will refer to all my family and the community. Thank You, The creation of this app is 👏👌💯⭐ MRS. ARNOLD",
Makes my life so much easier everything at my fingertips so much information,
Easy to use and very informative,
I must say MyChart is pretty easy. I have had it for several years now. I wish I could have my husband on my account or just handle other adults on the account with there permission because it would be easier to know about appointment's or sending messages to the Dr I just handle all that stuff so we always have someone home to take care of the little ones and don't double book appointment's but I did figure out a loop hole if they send me the message I just put account and password & I'm in.,
"It's easy to use, you can check in for appointments before you arrive so when you do arrive, just give them your name, and you're ready to see the Dr. You can also send and receive messages to and from your providers and request prescription refills. Works for me!!",
"Excellent App, allows me to view my medical results and share said results with any medical providers I have, even during traveling.",
"This actually has been a great app, I also combined it with my UT physicians app so they're like in a group app. I can do that now and it's convenient.",
I like the app it's a great tool to have,
Great tool to find appts and test results,
This app really helps to save time and gives me direct communication with my health care professionals.,
"I love this app! As a cancer patient, I have so many appointments to keep up with, but MyChart makes it incredibly easy to do. I have access to lab results and doctors' notes after each appointment. I am so thankful for the ease and convenience.",
Better communication than phone and emails due to faster results review and medications logging of changes.,
"I love the My Chart App having easy immediate access to my appts, test results, what I need to do as far as setting up appts and the ability to leave a message for my Dr & his nurses. I definitely recommend the app",
"I love this app it's so great to keep track of when my child has a appointment coming up, and I can schedule or message the doctor if I have any concerns or questions.",
Makes it easy to access my information and check in for appointments,
This app is so easy to use. I like that I can log on see my test results and if I need them for any reason I can print them out and I love being able to message my doctor or a nurse and I like that we can now see our radiology images. I also like how I get to schedule an appointment with my Dr or with another Dr.,
My chart is very helpful to keep in touch with my Dr. Easy to use.,
"Very efficient at keeping me up-to-date on labs, lab results & medical appointments.",
Excellent way to see doctor when already a patient and live > 100 miles and no change in status just need checkup. Thank you very much.,
This app is terrible compared to the app I used before for my medical. I don't know why they switched but this sucks.,
The best maintained and performing app out there.,
MyChart is very handy & easy to use.,
Fairly easy to use & navigate,
Excellent for keeping track of medical info,
Having issues logging in. Telling me there is a server issue to try again later. Has been doing this for the last 2 days. Very frustrating when trying to get appointments made.,
An extremely useful app! Has helped me alot concerning management of my appointments and medication.,
Not user friendly and many times bill will not show to be paid,
Love it. It is so nice to keep up with everything,
The app works great the only problem is is the hospitals utilize this format do blatantly disregard keeping the information current and up-to-date well as giving you a format to delete any and all information that you do not want on it when you requested over and over and over again to their persons in charge of this app at the hospital at which it is being utilized for. The CEO each entity hospital represents should get on mid-management and the executive management to address this immediately,
It's easy to use and I love it,
Better than a phone call!,
Very user friendly..No more calls.. We love it.,
I really appreciate being able to have the app as it is very user-friendly.,
Sux. Very hard to navigate when the pages time out and reset.,
It's not easy to use between applications,
"This app helps me keep up with my appointments, medicines, messages to my doctors. Everything! I love it!",
When I can get in it's great but mostly it won't let me in.,
Although I am learning everything about system,
This app is very helpful and I will continue to use it. I have had not problems with it and can view everything I need to and will recommend this app to others.,
"A Great App!! Easy and convenient, I use it all the time!!! A great way to stay connected to your doctor!!!",
"Not happy with app. Has test 4 weeks ago, no updates no eta",
Very easy to use and understand,
"Depending on your diagnosis,or more so what they want your diagnosis to be, one day it's this on no tomorrow it's this yet maybe the next day it could be, but then again, give it a day or two it could be but probably not. You see the confusion they cause. Clear as mud.",
"Trying to login using the exact username and password and instead of giving me a prompt to reset the password and without warning, my account got blocked. Non existing customer service makes this really a negative and frustrating patient-doctor experience .",
Slow and doesn't always work,
Extremely convenient. I can see my complete medical chart. I can message the Dr and request medicine refills. It is fast and easy.,
I enjoy having all my medical information in the palm of my hand. Love it!,
Excellent app. Excellent quality and style very easy to use. Great layout with excellent communication quality.,
User friendly easy to get to what you need,
The username and password don't work. The notification takes over 20 minutes to log in. Only the online works for me,
"I don't really like to give 5 stars. So, this app gets 4. It is convenient, I can reach out to my medical team and they will reply. It is a handy little app to have. The shots are a little frustrating, some them aren't right.",
Easy app to use.,
"I can see all my medical info from my Bon Secours docs, and tie it to my SENTARA app. This way everything is easily connected. I can send messages to my docs, read after visit notes. (This has proven to be VERY GOOD! AND HAS SAVED ME POSSIBLE ILL EFFECTS FROM A PROCEDURE).",
Doesn't include all of my doctor visits. Optical and ortho,
It works great after I had to find out I had the wrong app and had to download this app,
I love this I can check in make appts,
Terrible! Sometimes it will let me sign in THEN NOT!!!!! VERY AGGRAVATING FOR SURE!!?????,
I love my chart. When you have a test done it shows your results. You get the results before your drs. Does.,
Great way of communicating.,
Very convenient and informative!,
"No great for older people. Also, Drs send messages to download and print documents but I have no way to do that",
Doesn't do as much as the website but it's pretty convenient.,
"This app assist with the normal procedures about your case, it saves a lot of paper work that usually can be misplaced, and it gets you informed about clinical research and potential participation opportunities. It can estimate how much your procedure may cost, it can let you updates about their practices, and how you can get involved.",
I Love Love mychart it's very easy to use also to stay up-to-date with your overall health and wellness & even to contact your Doctor/s. If needed.,
Really good App you get your info about your visit fast and your lab results before the doctor.Good appointment maker and reminder,
Seriously. Too much to ask for a simple Q n A.,
"Generally the app is functional . I have found a problem trying to schedule an appointment. How about ""other"" instead of your very specific options.",
I have used the APP for looking at my test results. I also contact my primary care physician when I need questions answered or an explanation about Test Results. I am able to see the answers with an explanation almost immediately. I moved down here from New Jersey. I laugh when I tell them my text results are available within 24 hours. It is tsking some of the doctor's over a week to let the patients. Some one needs to sell them this APP. Love it and thank you.,
This app is the best thing the medical industry has done for us patitients. App is always improving and great for scheduling and requesting refills. Updating info and sending and receiving forms is now digital as well. Highly recommended,
"Can't find allergy info, nothing is up to date.",
I really enjoy this ☺ app for my phone so easy and non stressful,
"Why does the page look and is unusable on windows? I do not want to pay my bill on my phone. I what to use a desktop site. BUT seems that's a bridge too far. The NEW mychart so far not so good. I see you asked another to say which providers site he uses so here, Mine is university health care in Georgia,USA,",
I actually like my chart. I'm not very vocal so it's convenient for me. Thank you.,
Can't schedule appointments Can't get results Wait of time Won't let me see my kids chart nor schedule appointments Very disappointed This app is not what they say it is,
"This is the absolute best app I've ever used. Works much better than anticipated. Far more useful than anticipated. I've been using it a lot and getting excellent results. So far, it keeps me from having to make phone calls, I can get most information I need through messaging in this app.",
A great help when I need to check with my doctor .,
"Love this app. All doctors should use it. Easy to communicate with them, all medical info in one place. Excellent!",
Very user friendly.,
Very easy to use and self explanatory.,
"Very good App, helps me keep up with my Appointments.",
It's so nice having a company actually trying to help people have all of their health information in one place.,
Many times results are not accessible due to server error and the same result is open online. Can you fix it as it's annoying being unable to find out.,
"Very nice to have this app. One area of improvement would be to allow app users to make our own notes for future reference re each entry. Doing so will help make us better, more involved and, therefore, more informed, patients.",
"Easy to Use, and Very Helpful. Thanks 🤗",
"I love mychart. Easy to use, it makes everything easier such as making appointment contacting office and reviewing test results",
User friendly and allows me to communicate with my healthcare providers,
Awesome easy to use charting,
Very user-friendly and convenient.,
This app needs a more human touch a customer service phone,
"I absolutely love this app. Now, wonder ~ What did we do before My Chart?? How many trees did it take for all the printed out paperwork? Carried appointment cards in wallet or a place easy to remember 😉 Then🤔 could couldn't find the card?? SO had to call doc office, with pen and paper in hand so wouldn't miss appointment",
Apps great. But seriously can we quit getting covid shot info now? If we want the vaccine we would've gotten it by now. Maybe have a button on the app that takes covid info off my chart. So some people can still view if they want an others don't if they want.,
Good attitudes all around. You are all very much appreciated. Thanks for all that you do.,
"The app is great for easy access to your medical records and for contacting providers. However, it keeps telling me I need to review and update my personal information every time I open the app.",
Best way to keep in touch with your health care team,
Great source of info at your fingertips.,
I really enjoy MyChart. I get to review how my visits went and when my next appointments are.,
"My Chart is perfect for keeping tract of my appointments, test results, after appointment notes, and being able to receive and send messages to my providers. It's an excellent way for me to keep up with my medical business.",
I use Mychart regularly and I have never had an issue. It is very helpful and accurate.,
Glitchy but easier than calling your doctor's office,
"App is great, but my COVID 19 vaccinations are not visible.",
Easy to navigate. Simple.,
I love my chart because I can get hold of my Dr. Quicker to refill meds or a virtual visit. Or to see lab test results real quick. It is very nice and convienent,
I'm literally a patient of Orlando health and they will not allow me access to my charts. Don't use.,
"Nowhere to pay bills, nor the information needed. Nobody gets back to you when you submit a question. They don't upload your actual documents for the documents page. I can't see my xrays. Not pleased with this app.",
"My chart is very helpful. Since future appointments are included, I can always verify when and where. Appointment notes let me review what was discussed and use the app to ask followup questions .",
Good experience! the only problem is that I cannot do multiple deletions. It's a great application to communicate with my doctors.,
"Very informational, can do a lot of things with this app. Love it",
Easy app to use.,
Really great. Could probably benefit from a senior citizen version however as my grandmother struggles with its functionality.,
The apps great and very helpful,
"Good app, keeps me in connectuon with my team, and lets me check in for appointments without going to the check in desk. It's also a great way to communicate with your team and remember what happens next.",
Why do you have the feature to text the doctor about medical questions when they get mad and tell you to make an apointment.,
App is a good source of information,
It is a very thorough app. I can make doctor appointments through the app Email My Email my doctor. Keep track of my appointments,
My chart is the easiest to use of al medical portals. I'm on four. Only thing I'd like to do is correct medicine be as I've not been in some for a while. Also add to medical allergy lists to update Each doctor seems to have inaccurate items listed,
"Of all the medioapps I've used, this is far and away the worst design. The whole idea of having this app is to make life easier. I refuse to fill out all of this information simply to go for a routine office visit.",
Great tool to access my medical information and Doctors.,
"How to add a Dr into a contact list, I am not able to do this, the only Drs are the one that visited or done an online meeting. Appreciate your help",
I really appreciate that I can text my doctor's and get refills and view all up coming appointments and see my test results and read after visit summaries without having to go to the clinic and it's a more personalized way to stay in touch with the medical staff. Super convenient.,
Great to keep in touch with your doctor,
"Excellence, keep track of your FYI. SIMPLE TO FIND. THANKS 😊",
Love this app! Easy to use and very convenient,
Convenient as well as keeping me updated.,
"Works, but not the most user friendly. Some options are buried and difficult to find.",
"Easy to use, get updates on my test results, and let's you know when you have appointments. Very helpful app with lots of benefits. I highly recommend.",
"This app helps keep me up to date on everything medical with test results, appointments, and medications. After my health issues, I need this app to keep everything organized so I don't forget anything.",
I have access to all my health providers in one app.,
It's wonderful to get test results so fast,
This app is definitely a game changer. It allows you to not only be informed but stay consistently informed.,
easy to use. Get LGH Portal and Penn Medicine to seamlessly work together.p,
This app help me out a whole lot its amazing,
"Very friendly use interface. It has everything you need to schedule, cancel, and change appointments and view everything you need.",
"I just want to log in, in the past I logged in and then my providers show up, now it wants that first, but if it let me log in I wouldn't have to go thru this",
"This app has been so helpful. I am able to actively communicate with my medical providers, review medical appointments, notes, test results and more. I would highly recommend this app for accessing your health portal.",
Very easy to use and helpfull,
Runs slow can't use it often,
Love the convenience of being able to communicate with multiple providers and give access to coordinate my care.,
Easy access super easy to use love this app,
I love this app I can see upcoming apts and results from Dr visits . Awsome,
Absolutely love having full access to all my medical files.,
Clunky and hard to navigate,
Verifying each time becomes tiresome waiting for code.,
"This is the greatest app ever, I love how it connects me with every doctor in the BJC network",
Love it so easy to use and makes getting result so much better.I work at another hospital that has a portal and it is aweful.Your patient portal is so great thank you.,
I use the MyChart for my doctor's office and for CVS covid testing results. This app is easy to use and extremely convenient. I am able to ask questions of my doctor and generally get a less than 24-hour response.,
It's easy to use to refill ur medicine's and make appointments for doctors and read ur summary of what the doctor said bout ur visit and u,
This has made my life so much easier. Highly recommend,
This app has made taking care of my wellness needs so much easier. It allows me to manage my appointments and test results in seconds. Love it!,
Love love love this app! It is so convenient to manage medical appointments/test results/follow-up.,
"Love that I'm connected with all my doctors, I get test results as soon as they are ready and I get reminders for any appointments, I can request refills on medication I can ask any of my doctors questions, I can make payments in a secure way. I can also change or reschedule or cancel any appointment if I need to all on this app !! Plus I've got all my procedures and my health history with the doctors notes in one area and is always there if I need it !!!",
"This is an absolutely fantastic way of communicating with my doctor. It has test results almost immediately, it helps set up, and notifies me of, appointments. Now that I have it I would not want to be without it!",
I love it so easy to make appointments seeing test results,
I love MyChart! Using it is breeze. It's easy to navigate. Making appointments with my various healthcare professionals is a cinch. I highly recommend the app.,
I love this app! It is convenient and very helpful!!!!!,
I love MyChart I always had problems with iris acct. Ty,
It's Amazing helps me stay connected to our doctor and nurses!,
CT scan results were posted on My Chart within an hour of my test! Pre-register is helpful. As is confirmation of my appointments.,
I am very pleased with the service that I receive from my whole team. They are awesome and I feel very comfortable.,
"This app provides me extraordinary access to my health care team, appointments, contact information, Q&A, and other resources important to my treatments and recovery. I can't imagine how I'd function without it.",
Very well organized and helpful,
I can't see how to cancel and change appointments.,
Keeps me up-to-date with all appointments and results.,
Makes everything easier. 12/10,
Excellent way to keep up with appointments,
"Great program, getting better all the time.",
"I loveeee this app! It's very helpful for setting appointments, test results, medication refills! Game changer for sure!",
Love the App! Being able to talk to my doctor or another doctor directly is wonderful. Having access to notes they put in and test results is by far keeping me in check with my health and helping me ask the right questions when I am not sure.,
I find the app most convenient and easy to use. It allows me to keep in contact with my health care providers without the hassle of going through channels of red tape. Thanks 🙃,
"Can't get the app to work on my Android device no matter how many times in uninstall and reinstall or how I answer the prompts. I keep getting a ""Server List Error"".",
Cool features. But responses from staff have been passive aggressive and good stuff like that. I'll probably go back to calling pharmacy as to not get treated that way. App works. The human. Interaction part... Not so much,
This app supplies what most patients with long-term care have been looking for. Intuitive and simple to apply to any device. Thank You 👍👍,
Absolutely LOVE IT!!!,
Has been a real help especially when I got my prescription refilled that I had the doc call in and they sent it to a different cvs the app let me know exactly where my meds was at,
Can't sign Into it even with the current user name and resting the password twice. I tried calling customer service selected option 2 and it just kept repeating itself and still couldn't get ahold of nobody,
Excellent Service! Now I never miss an appointment. I can get and read my test results as soon as the very next day. I also can make appointments right from the app. Also send and receive messages from any one of my doctors. I'd be lost without it! Thanks for such a wonderful tool.,
"My Chart is wonderful. It's nice to be able to look & see your information at the touch of a button. Keeps you updated on your appointments, meds& everything you need to know. Thank You, E.Crisler.",
When I can use it works fine. But there are times when it won't open. Keeps saying connection error. I have internet but still have trouble with app sometimes.,
"Best ever to keep up with payments, correspondence with doctors or staff, test results posted same day (no waiting), renewal of prescriptions instantly. I am a patient of OSU since 2020 and used this app since then. No issues ever!!",
"App just keeps forgetting my credentials and sometimes straight up refuses to let me log in, have to reset my password every time I use it even though I write everything down and keep it in case I find myself forgetting as I don't use it every day.",
Terrific app ..easy to read & navigate.,
Nice to be able to get on app and get everything done I want for example set up booster shot for covid as well as set a appointment with my doctor at the same time I can see all test as soon as they are complete great app,
Audio on video visits is very poor. The constant echo on speech has made it impossible to continue with most sessions. Navigation of Mychart is awkward and doesn't use the same thought processes common to other on line businesses.,
"Like it very much. Have communicated with my primary. Much better than being on hold for 30 minutes plus. I can see my lab results, have learned when I need to be concerned and when not to.",
I love this app. User friendly. Interface is fantastic. I can access all my appointments info and I can precheck in before appointments. I can access my medical information. I highly recommend this app.,
Dr Rider and Nurse Joanne are always friendly and helpful.,
"This is the best app, when it comes to communication and information between you and your Doctor. Is so easy to set up, easy to navigate and use. I feel safe using it. Eliminate so much paperwork.",
I like having my test results and medical information in hand and not have to call and ask.,
"Unable to log in through the app, tells me my password is incorrect even though I'm able to log in just fine on PC. This has been a problem for almost a year.",
Great tool for keeping track of appts and test results. Or to leave messages. Able to check your history or look over notes from visits!,
"The one experience I've had with their remote visit was incredible. The doc was nice, and the process was quick and smooth.",
"I love having this app. It's very helpful for keeping track of doctor visits, test results, and meds. You can message your care team or request prescription refills. Very easy to use.",
Easier than going to an office everytime.,
"This is a very good ap. It keeps track of everything you need in o e place, all tests, immunizations, current medications, allergies, etc. It even alerts you if something is due (test).",
App worked fine until a few weeks ago. Now it just loads and won't let me in. Have done everything possible including getting ahold of tech support for my phone and still no fix. App is awful at this point.,
I enjoy being able to see my records it also helps me understand my medication I take,
"Worthless now. When I go to schedule, my provider is no longer there and when I search they are not listed...it gives me places in other states even when i search by my zip. Complete junk now!!",
Used to work decently. Now it force closes in many of the menus (esp billing) Found an old version (9.2.3) from apkmirror & everything seems to work fine. Hmm why break things?...,
"Love using the app...It's convenient, user-friendly and I'm able to get timely responses from my providers....",
"Good app. My only suggestion is to spread the numbers out a bit more where you enter the pin code to sign in, the numbers are too close to each other and keep pressing the wrong number at times.",
App is very easy to use and I had no problem and when I called customer service to get my MRN they were very polite and very prompt to get it and it was easy and quick!! Thank you very much!!,
"Has definitely made managing my appointments, records, and communicating much easier. Not to mention it's all in one place.",
I receive all my medical appointments in one place. Time saving and easy to use. Love having the ability to connect with my doctors and specialist all in one place.,
"I have been using MyChart for over a year. Recently it requires me to request a code after I have signed in, it is doing it each time and it is very annoying. How do I just sign in without the extra step of obtaining the code.",
Awesome. Very user friendly,
"My Chart is amazing. The results are on my chart before I leave the building and if I send a message, they get back to me within a day. Very prompt. I love how my family can go to my chart and see what's going on. Thank you for everything Reid.",
"Scattered functionality, keeps crashing on random messages. Not very useful at all. An example what an app should NOT be.",
"The app is very useful for looking up your medical history, but it's not very well written in the sense that if you go into a part of the app you can't get back to the home screen. You have to close the app and go back in",
Great app. Very organized. Very simple. Patient restricted from changing or removing photo from certain medical groups.,
App makes it easy to message my doctors and access labs. I have a lot going on and its nice to have everything centralized in an app for easy access.,
"This is an excellent software, easy to use, and it allows me to communicate easily with my doctor. And I like viewing test results almost instantaneously.",
Problems connecting with server. Only gives intermittent alerts. This used to be a reliable app but it's suddenly terrible.,
Everyone Should have My Chart Great App to Organize your Medical records and Appointments ❤️🩷💙💜🩵,
"Love this for making and keeping appointments, communicating with my doctor, getting test results quickly, refilling scripts, etc. I often get my reports the same day. Love it!",
"Update: Customer support helped resolve issue. Find the app very handy now. Doesnt work, wont allow log-in, does NOT send reset password or username reminder e-mails. Useless.",
"Easy to use for setting up appointments, messages with care providers, updating records, etc. I like that I can read information from my doctor visit as well.",
"It used to be easy to use, with clear indication of what to do. Now it is as clear as mud. I have no idea if my blood sugar and pressures are getting into the system. Back again, if I can find out how to properly exit this survey you might understand.",
"Super easy, very helpful. It is great to be able to review patient information clinical and non clinical with just a few clicks.",
"How useless. I cannot load test results or messages, the main reasons I need the app. It just stalls until it finally times out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it still hasn't solved this issue.",
"Total awesome I absolutely love it! You can get your test results in matters of hours whereas without it I'd have to wait days, weeks sometimes even a months also I can text the doc and receive a reply in hours!! Its wonderful",
This app is sometimes useful and sometimes worthless. It is not well coordinated with all of my providers who say they use it so then I have to connect through gmail. Just annoying!,
Worked well and now no push notification no text notifications. Help desk has no clue. There is a bug so someone needs to fix it.,
I received a message from the developer and was informed that my disappointment is more with my health care provider than the app. Otherwise the app contains useful features but it is frustrating to enter payment information every time.,
"This is a real convenient type of app that I've been enjoying ever since they got this app for their patients. Getting lab results,making appointments,etc is really a breeze and time saver.",
"It's easy to use, I really like this app.",
Very convenient! Can ask questions anytime!,
"Love the my chart app, just when I want to send an email it will automatically show the people, and I can't change it to someone else I need to send it to. I don't like that.",
HORRIBLE!!!! Everytime I try to sign up it keeps telling me they are experiencing problems. Can not communicate with third party. Everytime I try to sign up it ALWAYS FAILS!,
It is so good to actually see letters and results clearly and when you want. Fantastic idea I think it's the best thing for clarity and continuity of care.,
All of a sudden this app doesn't work. It continuously buffers & then the app closes. AppFlash keeps stopping and Market Feedback Agent doesn't work to send feedback.,
"It is an awesome way to keep track of appointments, medications and medical history. It is fast, easy and convenient. You can communicate with your doctor through the app, ask questions and set appointments.",
The latest update to the look of this app is poor. It is more difficult (time consuming) to get to what is being sought. I loathe having to start with a news feed on any app.,
"I find it very easy and so useful to check my appointments, send questions to my doctor and to see all necessary health and medical information in the chart. Really helpful to me.",
I cannot use the video to talk to my Doctor,
Great way to communicate with my health professionals,
It doesn't always want to load but it's what I use to keep all my medical stuff together,
"I generally really like this app, but this past week, I cannot get into it. Logging in via password or fingerprint, it says ""cannot communicate with server, try again later.""",
My chart app is great. Being a kidney recipient it is very important that Yale Transplant and my doctors have access to my medical records. My Chart app makes this possible and very easy to navigate.,
I can't even tell if this app is useful or not because it doesn't even allow me to log in and locks me out of my account everytime i try. I KNOW my log-in information is correct so this system itself needs to be fixed!,
So nice and everything get easier,
Just about worthless. Can't find where to update critical documents - like insurance card. Can't view any documents... Sends you notifications after the fact.. Can't pay on the app..,
"Barely even functional. The options for Healthcare providers is great, but I've tried getting it to send me an email to help me reset my password and I've received nothing.",
"Works fine at first, then every so often it says ""there was a problem communicating with the server"" then I have to remove it and call mychart support. Very irritating.",
"Always a fast easy way to get msgs back & forth to my Dr., Which is great seeing as how their answering service sucks! Lol I make my appts thru this app each time without having to wait on hold to maybe only even reach a voicemail service!",
Easy to use and very convenient. Love the app! Especially how it links your health information to other organizations for easier access.,
"Haven't been able to use the application. The message appears that there seems to be an issue with the server. This isn't true, the website works with no issues. Please correct the issue with the application",
My doctor and I have tried to get into my chart on my phone several times it refuses any and all access I have set it up three times with three different passwords and none of them I am done,
This is a well kept updated app. It's easy to navigate and make appointments. Thank you for making this an easier experience getting with doctor care.,
Easy to use. All your info right there.,
Impossible to login. The verification code email never to arrives (even in spam folder). So you try pressing the resend. Now the code arrives but it is expired. 🙄,
"It's gotten a lot better, but still doesn't let me access all the features I can access with my browser. It's such a pain that I normally don't use the app and use Chrome instead. I don't see any advantage to using the app.",
Exceptional App Easy to use complete medical history,
"Getting test results is OK individually with history plotting is nice, but it would help if there was an option to also results by order so that a series of tests can be easily taken to another doctor to avoid duplicate testing.",
It basically sucks but I was able to access a lot of my test results but not everything shows up. Only use on my tablet otherwise I can't even download the app. If you don't need it don't download.,
"I have no issue with the app. I like everything on it. Checking appointments, tests, results, all bills, meds etc. Great.",
Very informative information,
Locks up and won't let me exit or go back to main menu. Android version does not work well. No problems with my wife's Apple version.,
"This is fantastic, because I can see all my appointments, messages, emails to doctors and both different clinics/hospitals can see all my medical. No more refilling medical forms.",
"I have all my information right there at a click of a button. The best part is I don't have to keep track of anything. It's always there when I need it. It's more than just your health records, you can make appointment, order prescriptions, talk to you Dr. Or ask the staff about general questions. It's so convenient.",
This app is amazing!!! This app allows me to see all of my medical records and updated test results in real time.,
Worst app ever. Impossible to log in. It never lets me in. Please fix this! UPDATE. I was finally able to make contact with customer support for the MyChart app and I am now able to log in.,
Having to have multiple of the same app. One for each organization even if you link them sucks ALOT & is VERY confusing!! But otherwise one of the best & most useful apps ever!!!!,
"Can't read the covid 19 information It's not in English Why is it not in English... Why do I have to reach out to a local health dept. Most people in the Country speak and understand. English...Even Spanish people... And the people that have differant types of ins. Pay your ""organization"" like me. How about you get new job.",
"Just updated the app and nothing seems to work - all i get is system error message, something about their server. Will check back in a day or two to see if its been fixed",
Love it! All my info is there and very convenient,
My account is not updated. Its from 2021. Misrepresents the ability to message your Dr,
"Supposed to be able to schedule appointments through the app, but when i click schedule an appointment i can't get past the spinning before it throws me back to the page asking me if i want to schedule an appointment.",
The iPhone version is great. However the Android version is missing navigation buttons in several places so I have top log out top go back to the main page.,
Very user friendly! Also super convenient and efficient way to communicate with physicians and/or schedule office visits. Love this app!,
"Very useful tool.. my insurance is Anthem and the only issue I have is them showing what I have paid.. not sure If I should pay anthem or each dr.. and that would require me keeping a log on what i paid who I paid and How I paid it, credit card or back account.. but the my chart app I great..",
Glitchy. Letters disappear. Make sure to get screen shots anytime you get a letter you want to save as they will randomly disappear.,
"This has been an amazing way to contact my doctors, keep track of important appointments, medications, and have questions answered without waiting 30min on hold with the office; and maybe getting a reply within a day or two. Great app!!",
Awesome! So easy to navigate!,
The updates from your office visit to the MyChart app are real slow to update. And the messaging to your provider is at times REALLY SLOW to get a response back from them. The MY CHART app. is way more frustrating to use than the Follow My Health app previously used with my provider,
"Great! Very helpful and easy to use. I use it review appointment notes & lab results, to request refills, and communicate with my healthcare provider. Very good app!",
This has been a god send since haven't been able to drive in at the least the last 2 years and transportation has been a big problem.,
"I sent an important message on Essentia MyHealth via MyChart, but it never got to MyHealth. I didn't check on the app until it was too late to reach anyone. My message shows up on MyChart, but not Myhealth. I am deleting this app from my phone.",
Easy to use and very informative,
"This is the most useful app on my phone. All my info in one place and the fastest way to ask questions and get them answered. Also, the ability to easily schedule an appointment is a very valuable tool and much appreciated. Highly recommend it.",
"What happened? Can't access my information. I can login but all the links send me to external sites. Why the dramatic change? No test results, no appointment scheduler, nothing is there. Please bring back the old version.",
It is an easy app to understand and maneuver around. It has beeb a lifesavers for me and my Doctor's. I'm always connected to any of my Doctor's and pharmacy and appointments with a single app. All my appointments and meds and Doctors easy to get to were ever i am .,
"App is clear and efficient, giving access to medical files and enabling easy contact with care providers. Customer service resolved a navigation issue (swipe) quickly. Good stuff.",
"Everytime I try to log in, an error message pops up. It says there's a communication error with the server. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I have the same issue.",
Everything was great and then an update happened and I cant get the medication list to pop up which means I cant get my refills. It's doing the same thing with appointment scheduling. It's a pain.,
"Can't get in, just says couldn't load terms and conditions at this time. Tried on my gfs IPhone, did the same thing there too. Edit; had to use the desktop website in order to get passed the terms and conditions that was crashing the app. Better now",
"Best system to keep track with appointments, test results and communication with the different doctors through email. Really like the system...can see it anywhere and so can the doctors..",
"Cannot login, there us an issue w/the app it is stuck loading. I try to log in w/my password but it states there is a communication problem & 2trt again, later.",
Love it!! So easy to use and get all your medical info appointments messages etc all in one App. Very easy to read and understandable.,
"I love it. It is very useful and easy to make and change appointments, send messages to your doctor, check lab results. Its all in one place very convenient.",
"As an IT developer for 45 years, I've learned to appreciate well designed apps. This is one of the best. It's reliable, well organized and easy to use.",
I LOVE 💕🥰🥰🥰 MY APP !! It's always accurate and it always on time when it comes to messages from my doctor's or appointments and my test results if I have something to show them like if I was in the hospital I can take pictures and send it to them .. I love my doctor's they are so sweet 🥰🥰.. I love this app because I can make or cancel appointments and do video chats due to COVID... I just love it 🥰,
Every time I attempt to use a password to access this app my phone goes into freeze mode I end up having to call 911 which does nothing to help me unlock my phone beware trying to install this app you may have to replace your phone as for medical services I still have not accessed my chart Because this review is negative my phone again has lock me out I have nothing else to do but complain,
Very helpful for me to keep up with my latest medical tests & drs appts,
"Best Medical App I've Used Ever! Well organized, pleasant to look at, various links available for explanations of procedures, keep track of current medications, can sign in biometric, pay a bill ( I never do! Lol )...Thumbs up to Developer!!",
"I had no trouble, setting up the account or accessing it either. I complemented the staff on how quickly the information was updated after two procedure, a test or a visit. Much better than St Luke's process.",
"This app is so easy to use. I like being able to set up appts, get test results, and look back on info from visits. You can also pay your bill so quickly. I use this app everything I need to see my doctor.",
Awful. Access it through cvs app. Once logged out can't get back into cvs app. Then when you want to go into cvs it goes directly to MyChart. Stuck in a never ending loop.,
Update makes it so now I can no longer view any documents. I now have to download the entire file and then it says that there was an error downloading and the file can't be viewed.,
"Supposed to be able to access covid 19 testing results, 10 tests over 2 years. Got 3 results of those tests via the app. 30% success rate is not great especially for this type of app.",
Wouldn't let me log in then when I tried recovering my user name and password which was the same as I entered I tried again and now my whole account has been deactivated and I have to call some B.S. number which is just a unknown voicemail...like when you call it it just says you have reached a mail box please leave a message...no discription of who I'm calling..and it's been 2 days without a word back....just don't do it!,
This site is down more than it is active. Not pleased at all.,
LOVE THIS APP!! Easy to use. Very informative. I love being able to contact any of my doctors and this app makes it very easy to get your meds refilled. This app does it all. I would truly be lost without it... Thank you for all of your help...,
"Not enough words in any vocabulary, or time in the day, to describe to you exactly how much I absuolutely love this app. It is perfect, and I wouldn't change a single thing. Master piece among masterpieces.",
It is an amazing experience !thank you developer for making it simple and easy now i get to see everything in one place My Chart ! Amazing.,
"Love this app ,convenient, easy to use, very helpful when needing to refill medicine, make appointments, test results,and anything else needed to do with your medical needs. Best app to have.",
"This is one of the apps that I find very useful and time saving for me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be more in control of your Dr. Appointments, any med refills , or any upcoming lab work.",
"Great app, I get to see everything the doctor sees as far as tests, visits, messaging, prescriptions and notes about my visits immediately. Usually I see test results before the doctor. It's perfect so far.",
Too many people logging on is causing issues with getting on. Need bigger or better servers and all my medical records are not there because they say they're too old to update. All is fixed. Support was extremely helpfull,
Old app. More user friendly. Easier to find longer lists of appointments covering several months. Not just one month at a time .,
Everything in one place! As a cancer patient I have a lot of appointments and medications. My chart keeps everything organized. I can even request perscription refills! A great App!,
"There's no way to update your own medical information, like current medications, in this app or the site. Depending on the provider using MyChart, even if you can edit your own medications, they can require they approve them before changes are reflected, and as expected, no one ever monitors medication change requests :) Also, there's no way to easily export data, like in CCDA format.",
I love that I can access my medical information and updates on upcoming appointments and information that is needed to transport to other physicians that need information from my past history so that makes it so much better and easier so that you don't have to travel everywhere to get this information you just easily pull it up and send it to the other physician or specialist that needs your info ASAP so thank you very much for making this easy for all who are unable to travel and do all of that,
Enables me to see all test results and review past test results. Appointment reminders are great. All my medical information is handy and available whenever I need. These is a great tool.,
Excellent app for med records quickly 😁. Great way to correspond with your medical staff and get test results quickly. Also great for getting refills sent to your pharmacy quicker. Can't say enough good about this app!,
It's wonderful! Many times I have gotten MRI or bloodwork results before getting home. My Dr.'s and I can contact each other through this app. without bothering anyone else. With MyChart I always have my med. list with me as well as all test results.,
I love having my.medical information available on my phone. Also love the messaging feature. It gives me a chance to give my care providers a heads up for any particular issues that need to be dealt with ahead of time.,
"Used to work just fine, now it keeps saying there is a newer version of mychart and I have to download that, I don't see any other version of mychart, and I'm using the latest updated version.",
"Used to work great on both laptop and Android phone. Still okay, not great on laptop even with rearranging the website BUT the Android app only gets "" Cannot connect to Server"" for weeks now.",
"Absolutely Great! MyChart is a wonderful app! Its easy to use and I get reminders, visit summaries, and test results! Also, I can check on referrals, billing statements and more! Thank you♡",
"Very nice to be able to check lab and test results on ""My Chart"". Helps me to keep track of all my appointments. I like this app very much.",
Very easy and convenient to use,
"Accurate, quick, test results, easy messaging to my doctors, new mychart looks nicer, more options to share medical info. with other providers. Easy appt. scheduling.",
"This is such an amazing app. There are changes I would add, but overall it has been a life saver when other doctors have immediate access to your chart if you are having an immediate need.",
Exceptional and easy to use.,
When it works it rocks but when it doesn't it's a headache. I prefer just removing the App and going online. The error message is now consistently not working.,
"I love being able to message with my providers. However, most anything else has to be done by going to the website. The app won't open a number of items & it's frustrating!",
This is sure has been a great help. Being able to receive test result and also ask questions to my Dr has helped ease up on stressing and worrying. For me this is a big plus. Thank you. You have a great team of medical providers. You're awesome.,
I love being able to go to myChart. It's great,
MyChart provides an excellent platform for patients to keep abreast of their medical status and allows access to their medical records. It even makes it possible to communicate directly with their physicians. Great App!,
"I accidentally removed the widget to MyChart and need to get it back. Though it was logged into with my local email provider, not my Gmail account. I sure hope you can help me. Thanks but I asked my Dr to send a link for the app to my email. It was taken care of the next morning",
"No issues with this app at all! It's easy and super convenient to access my info, to message the doc, to set up an appt, to complete questionnaires, and more.",
"So convenient...I never have to call the doctor's office for anything. If I have a health concern I simply send whichever doctor (PC, OBGYN, Dermatology, etc.) a message & they send one back soon after. There just so much you can do with this App.",
"My app is completely not working as of today. It's asking me to search for my organization (UCLA), huge well known hospital. Showing no results. Also searching all of CA. No results.All my previous information seems to be gone.",
Easy to use and practical to have everything in one place,
This is a great way to speak to your doctor one on one my husband has it and we both are very impressed,
"Awesome App. I was getting my lab test results, while in hospital, before my doctors were. I love having all my medical information in one very handy place. Big help when filing for social security. Can send and receive messages and share your medical files with anyone you wish. Excellent App!",
"I am unable to access the app it keeps saying there is an error with my login, however I can access it online with the very same password. It has worked perfectly up until this week.",
There seems to be 2 versions of the myDH cart and application. Which ever it is they both work as intended and have had no errors or crashes.,
Overall MYCHART is great. The only feature that Montefiore needs to improve is the pre-checkin. If you use it the staff is unaware and get irate when you show them the bar code to scan.,
I enjoy the app a lot it is very useful,
It's so nice to be able to have all my records in one place and my doctor's can see things that were done at other locations who also use this database. So I don't have to keep up with tons of paperwork to bring to every appointment.,
"Confusing security settings for different institutions. Support doesn't respond. Missing attachment bug (listed but cannot download) reported, no response. Can't reset password for one institution. Seriously?",
"I like how it keeps all my medical information at my hands also making appointments is very easy, referrals are easy to look up and and handle it ,the only thing is I wish my new medical had my chart I have to use another app and it's harder to use than my chart.",
Dosent work. I choose my provider and it never goes any further than that. It keeps telling me to switch organizations?!?! Not helpful at all. uninstalled immediately.,
Very easy to use and informative.,
"Great app if the hospitals etal use it correcly. Loyola Chicago uses it well, on the other hand Northwestrrn makes you jump through hoops.... It's not the apps fault, it's the person's who test the software on their iPhone and only iPhone.",
This tool is beyond compare. The ability to keep all of my different doctors in sync reminders for my refills and reminders for my appointments is unparalleled.,
The app doesn't work. So I deleted it. I resorted to manually logging into Parkland website. Their website is unstable but it actually works. That's more than I can say for this app.,
Works well. Needs to let patients dismiss reminders that don't apply. For example I got a mammogram and a CT scan but the system still thinks I need them.,
"Please fix the issues with this app. When I go to eCheck-in, it says it has moved and when I click the link, it can't connect. I'm not sure what type of update was done, but you should have left it alone.",
"I love it ..!! Its perfect easy to understand, you can check in before you have the appointment and any test they do on you , you can see the result fast .. I definitely recommend Thanks☺",
Super useful and user friendly. Highly recommend for helping keep track of things and making communication with providers worlds easier.,
"Satisfied. Easy enough to use. I struggled a bit figuring out the organization that my provider was affiliated with, but after figuring that out using the app was straightforward.",
Life changing everything you need at your fingertips even if you're forgetful you will always get a notification and it's all there in my chart very easy to use and great way to keep up with your health concerns,
"I need to add another child to my account and can NOT figure it out. Very frustrating. Other wise, I do love that I can see test results/doctors notes right away.",
"I love this app! I can see everything about my appointments, lab results, and messages from my doctor. It's easy to use, and I've never encountered an issue since using it for the past 5 years.",
I loved this app but now it won't let me log in. It keeps saying there's a problem communicating with the server and to try again later. I've deleted and reinstalled it multiple times and still nothing 😔,
"App is great, but whenever I try to attach documents in messages my provider says they can't get them to openon their end. I've tried as PDF and Word doc, theycan never open them.",
"Up to now it was working, but now I am really disappointed and annoyed, I wasted my time to reset password, then received a code, in order to get it I left site so now with new code I lost spot where I was and ...... here we go starting over and getting nowhere. I do not care to have my chart . Much better the old way, call me if you need to communicate with me!!",
"This app is great! You can message with your Dr., request refill, see your lab results, get your referrals and many other other very useful tools to have in one spot. So if your provider is linked with MyChart, I highly recommend it, you won't regret it.",
Very weak app. Sends a message stating it is having difficulty getting information. No description of what or where from. Does not offer enough control to user.,
"Good all in one app for tracking your health. Check test results, make doctor appointments, message your health team. Been using it for a few years now with no complaints.",
"Epic/ MyChart is wonderful! Easy to navigate and I can email my doctors and their staff and get a quicker response than trying to call! All of my medical records, tests results, etc all in one place! Absolutely love this!",
Hate online stuff. Have to remember passwords as auto fill isnt available. I find it a real unpleasant chore to use.,
"This app allows me to be more in charge of my healthcare (through Essentia Health) by giving me the ability to view test results, schedule appointments, message my doctor and healthcare team, and manage my children's checkups. Using this app has vastly improved the Essentia experience.",
Please PLEASE provide a FULL expanded receipt for any payments made in the app. Or email it. SOMETHING. I've had my card locked so many times and now every itemized receipt I have requested has never made it to me.,
"If you need to make appointments; or check on lab tests results, or even ask your doc a question ;this is the app to use. What ever the need is; you will receive an answer soon! The best thing that came out from carilion is my chart! Love this app!",
"PITA don't use it. Constantly logs you out simply because you wanted to use data on a different screen that should available. Serious question, do the programmers ever use this app? It would appear they don't.",
Love the fast access to my medical records. Don't like how doctors can make changes to notes without giving any rhythm or reason for it because it causes confusion. I mean it is my LIFE they comment ON most of the time.🙃,
"It could be great, but once you actually have numerous tests from several hospitals and practitioners, the information doesn't sync properly.",
"Normally I don't have issues with the app, but for 2 days now it's saying ""server issues try again later"" I really need to get into it, considering there are messages I need to retrieve concerning my upcoming surgery. PLEASE FIX",
MyChart has been awesome for scheduling appointments and seeing all of my medical records when I need them. Bill pay through the app is also very handy and easy.,
Keep getting an error message stating unable to contact server. I've tried installing and re installing the app and it still does not work.,
"I enjoy having the appt. I however don't see my personal health care inputted, they like to message and show scheduledvisit plus test results the most. I feel all information should be listed,in case it's needed for my benefit..I mean it's mychart.....right??",
Very helpful with all issues and information concerning my Health care. Keep up the excellent work.,
"I keep having the same message, that i need to review and update my contact and personal information. I did that. Why wont it go away. At least put a submit button somewhere. Please fix this problem. My information is the same as it was before i got this message.",
Very ready up navigate. Very easy to get prescriptions refilled. Very easy to see up coming appointments and tests that are due. Great way to get access to test results like blood work test results.,
"Good app. Had trouble using it to pay a bill - there is no ""SUBMIT"" button after entering cc info. Needs a repair/update to the app. Made payment on my computer instead.",
I LOVE IT! EASY TO USE. TIMELY RESPONSES FROM DOC WHEN I HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. ALL MY INFO AT MY FINGERTIPS!,
"Very helpful app, helps a lot, all my info at my fingertips, love being able to fill out paperwork in advance, message my providers, schedule appointments, etc. Very good app",
"Requiring Chrome for video calls is simply unforgivable. If you can't figure out how to do it in-app, then it should work on ALL modern browsers.",
Makes things so much easier!!!,
The app originally was awesome. very convenient. The app is no longer functioning or opening on my Samsung 8. Please fix. I would love to continue to use it.,
Mostly a great app but anytime I try to use my fingerprint to login it crashes. Also should have buttons for navigating between screens (a back button mostly).,
"Easy to use, message your doctors easily and get faster, more personal responses! I love how it keeps track of all my appointments, past and future, as well as my test results and medications.",
"I loved this app until they started trying to segregate my twelve-year-old from me. I live in Nevada, not California. He has mental health issues , but supposedly, he is supposed to go into doctor's appointments and everything else on his own at 12 years old and not allow. Me to have any say in any of it. He's 12. He don't have that say, and what you guys are doing by segregating the parents and telling the parents they can't take care of their children is wrong.",
"Great for looking up things in the past, but the here and now, not so much. Trying to schedule an appointment and the only options it gives me is to schedule a flu shot or a mammogram.",
"After setting a username and password, the app would not let me in. when I tried the ""forgot password"" link it would not accept my information. App eventually locked up. Called CVS and no one answers the phone.",
"Not able to log into the app. Contacted technical support they advised it's an app developer issue as I can log into the site from the webpage. I'd rather use the app, hopefully it will work soon",
"App full of bugs and crashes. Can't view present or past appointments. Crashes when try to view the billing section. This up is ""partially functional""",
Great for staying in contact with my and Evan's UCSF medical teams!,
"I love My Chart... I forget a lot these days and I can just pop on make an appointment pop off. Look @ my med list, read messages, look back @ notes. Keep everything health in it. Very efficient and time conservative.",
App continously states there's a server error!!!! Fingerprint communication error!! No ise having an app one cannot access. There's also no where to access any help :(,
App works well with some major functionality. However small issues with various secondary operations such as: referrals from doctors don't show up on main menu.,
"When the app did work, it was useful....updated it about a month ago and now it won't work at all...cant log in, so its just taking up space on my phone. What a disappointment.",
"LOVE being able to view all my lab results, as a RN I enjoy being able to review them ASAP myself. Plus all the notes, etc. NOT to mention the ability to communicate one-on-one with the doctors",
This app is just wonderful. Very easy to navigate and has been a blessing to have during covid. A very easy way to stay up to date with your doctor without an appointment.,
Password verification is sent long after timeout. Have tried 4 times and each time it fails. Other emails are flowing fine so it's not my connection.,
"Nice app, but whoever did the programming needs to experience the ride. Nothing like being told by the app to arrive at 7AM for an 8:30AM appointment. Had to get up at 5AM so as to leave by 6AM so as to be at my screwed up appointment time. And then to be told that it was a known issue. It is now 8:30 and I am still waiting. Arrived WAY before anyone else, and all who came after have long gone in. Getting ready to leave and come back some other time.",
"Easy to use, good for getting results and letters as soon as possible. Great for communicating and for reminders of upcoming appointments.",
"Very good way to connect to my doctor's, as long as they us it also. I can ask questions from my doctor, it always has an updated list of my medications, I can do virtual visits with my doctors, it has a list of my up coming doctor visits and a current list of the results of my blood tests.",
"This is an Excellent app! It Shows your test results before they even call you. It's Definitely a great app to use for your medical history! I would totally recommend, my doctor suggested this to me and I love it!",
"I haven't been able to login to the app in months. Like others, I am getting the error problem communicating with the server. This sucks because I used to check-in to my appts using my phone. :(",
This is an excellent app. I get results from medical tests and referral approvals so quickly! I can also contact my doctor easily via messages. It truly brings provider/patient relationships into the 21 century!,
Everything at your finger tips makes getting all your info easy and less work for those who need to concentrate on helping the patient . Great Job!!!,
Hard pressure on the keyboard is a must to enter information.,
Easy-to-use. It's and easier way of viewing my information on my appointments. I can also send messages to my doctors. But what I like the best is the how easy it is to order my medicine. They even have an option of sending it to your house and that's where I receive my medicine at home.,
Very helpful tool in keeping appts. Seeing tests that have been done helps to keep on track of things. It gives you a summary of the appts which is nice to have.,
"In the age of Covir19 be able to have a video appointment is almost a necessity since I have an Autoimmune Neuro-muscular condition. Also, communicating with my cellphone and using a 4 digit login is a joy. I highly recommend your site.",
Was great. Now nothing ever works. Just keep getting a pop up banner that says there's an error with the server and it cycles back to the home screen.,
"It's great to be able to send messages, see test results. Everything my chart is about is helpful in everyway.",
"Great, wonderful, some information semi-incorrect. It is able to be corrected and communicated properly. Face to face information can be explained in a scientifically probability of 99.9%.",
Symptom checker is not working. Also very hard to find a location. Default is Iowa and is slow to move.,
Easy to access and understand,
"No network connection - error msg. My phone and app are up to date, I have 5G & wifi, all other apps and calls work. My chart isn't recognizing this.",
Not sure how to make a payment when I don't want to pay balance in full but to pay on balance. Not easily explained and I will have to call it in. This so far is my only problem otherwise I like the features.,
"I generally have not had a great experience using the MyChart App. Today I tried several times to cancel an upcoming appointment using MyChart but nothing seems to happen when I press the ""Cancel Appointment"" button after entering my reason and details.",
Can't erase old messages. App has limited use. Can't do anything other than what they choose,
The app is really nice and easy to use. Really convenient! I love how I can check the summary of the visit almost immediately after the appointment electronically.,
Very helpful and efficient app.,
App would be great if the information was shared with registration. I find myself having to supply the same info over and over again. Intake personnel state that they cannot see the info yet it is in my chart.,
"This app is wonderful! So efficient. As a patient with chronic illness I often have a hard time keeping up with life. This app really helps me keep control of what I need to know, and helps me better follow the instructions provided by the doctor.",
First off they want too much personal information they want too much access than my phone I'm not comfortable with somebody running around in my phone with free access to everything when I did try to log in it told me to call a phone number so I can get an access code via email I thought man that's too much information they want and it's a pain in the ass so I backed out,
"The app works as it says, I can contact my Doctor's, see test results, and keep track of billing. Only negative is sending my blood sugar log as an attachment in messages. Hopefully this option will be added soon.",
Navigation around the site can at times be complicated and not friendly. Bill paying is still treated as a high priority.,
All I wanted to know was the result of my Covid test. Just an email or text would do. Instead I get gobbly-gook about loading apps that did not load. Frustrated and still do not know my test results.,
I used this app all of the time and really liked it but now for the past few days I get a prompt saying there was a problem communicating with the server try again later I have tried for 3 days and get same result.,
"Love this app, I'm able to communicate with my doctors and manage my appointments. I see my results and when I to another doctor if they are not a part of my chart I'm able to show them what's going on with me. My doctors are able to see what each doctor is doing and see what they need to do in their expertise area to rule out any other health concerns",
I truly believe this app is absolutely amazing to say the very least. I've been using it for several years now and find it alot easier than calling the office trying to speak with an actual person.,
My daughter and I both have a my chart I love it as a patient and a mother it makes making appointments easier you don't have to wait in line or on hold and they useally get back in a timely manner with in a day most of the time and I have test results in hours. Love this app,
It's an invaluable tool to have when your family has a lot of medical issues. Everyone's records right at your fingertips. Easy to contact providers and get quick results to diagnostic tests.,
Asked a question about how to switch/add a different hospital using this app and it took their support group over 3 months to finally respond.... I was able to figure it out well before then... app does work okay but hopefully you'll never need their customer support....,
This App is still not working. When is it going to be fixed. It keeps saying cannot communicate with the server. I removed My Chart and reloaded it. It still doesnt work.,
Some test results are not viewable in the app but it asks you to download them so you can view them. Otherwise app is easy to use and very useful,
It would be helpful if people could actually view their messages instead of just watching the loading circle spin until you get the error message.,
This app is good but you need an option to allow printing of letters or documents from the app. I have had to jump through hoops to print.,
Very easy to use and navigate. I now have access to my healthcare records and my childrens which is helpful. Being able to email my providers is wonderful too.,
Constantly getting error reports.,
I love how quick and Easy it is to access everything for me and my children for our medical needs and records,
"The ""new and revised"" version has a few little bugs but is still pretty easy to use and way better than spending time on the phone waiting to get to the right person.",
"Well, I was very pleased with everything about this app. Extremely helpful to me. But, suddenly today I opened My Chart to view and the fingerprint sensor disappeared from the app. What happened?",
Down in the left corner of the app on the front page where everything is listed your name is there plus the number of things you're supposed to look at well no clue on where to look for them because I clicked on everything and anything that was highlighted was checked and then it would come off that list but I can't find all the remaining ones cuz everything I find is totally checked off?? My name is there and a number there is nowhere that tells me what the definition for what that is on the ap,
The app use to work. Now it doesnt let me log in at all. It had me set up a passcode for quicker login. However that doesnt pop up. I also cant log in with user name.,
"I would be lost without this. It adds my Drs appts right to my phone calender (which I have more than I'm proud to admit), I can message my PCP about anything!, Pay balances.....it's just made medical issues easier to deal with and keep track of my own progress.",
"I love this app. It works very well and I haven't had any issues with it. It is convenient to check appointments, test results, messaging doctor and other of other things.",
"Any Hospital not using a system like this in today's medical system needs to evaluate why they are not. It makes communicated with your doctor super easy and efficient. Scheduling is very easy, and seeing your labs and trends in those labs is awesome.",
LOVE this app. Has been very valuable to being in contact with my physicians in getting answers to my health quicker. Making appt. Setting up appt & asking questions. I like that they are Always looking for ways to improve your experience I using the app.,
"MyChart is great! It's unfortunate that we have (at least) 2 MyChart ""servers""...I wish I could unify my logins. The next time I went to my Dr. appt...they helped me get this set up. So now it's just one login (essentially)",
Very impressed with how easy this app makes reporting your condition back to the health service. At first I rolled my eyes at having to use it but now I really enjoy it. Highly recommended!,
"This is Great!!! I love having all mine and my family's health info at my finger tips. I had questions & got answers quickly. You can be reminded of apointments, vacinations, and past due health checks. All my Dr.'s Nurses and Specialists in one place. I can make apointments , Request refills or get a consultation.and see it anywhere Home, Work or on the Go Its awesome",
"Absolutely love how easy I can magae my appoinments, medication, reminders. Even getting a hild of a nurse or my dr is easy with this app!! All my test results comw right up in my phone. Very easy to use.",
I love having access to my children's records when I need them. Easy to navigate and switch between providers and children. Highly recommend!,
"It helps with communicating with your health people, I really like being able to get in touch, because their phone connections center just don't work well.",
Just unistalled it and reinstall it again for issue with connection with the server. Problem is solved. Please try to remove the OPT once authorization by finger print is being set.,
"Excellent Application. User friendly. It's great to have access to your health records along with appointments past and future, doctors notes and test results. I love the ability to message my doctor or his care team for anything ❤️",
"I love Mychart its very easy to use and I can send a message to any of my Doctors at any time. I can request medication or make an appointment. It also reminds me of up coming appointments, lab tests and other helpful reminders.",
MyChart is not needed for telehealth as cell phones already have phones and even video (Facetime or Duo) built in. MyChart merely serves to complicate an otherwise simple process for the patient. Stop!,
Helps me with all my medical needs. Keeps me up to date and on track,
"I have changed my password more times than is reasonable. This app keeps throwing out previous,or I should say active logins and passwords, so all I get out of this is Late information and Much frustration!!",
"After reading the numerous ""cridical"" reviews, I downloaded it anyways-Hey, you can always uninstall it, right? Well, I might have to! My ""primary health care is'nt even listed in the options. The first thing you will notice when you first open the app is it wants to know what your primary health care provider is. Well in San Francisco I could only find 3 health care providers listed!!! Seriously??? In San Francisco??? And I cant even say everything I want to say cause of 500 word limit!!!!",
"0 to 4, depending on how aggrivating it is to determine which of the four logins I have to use. At least I think it's four. Privacy is one thing, this is something else. Probably entirely specified by HIPPA. Grrrrr.",
Updated app and constantly getting server errors. Too slow also. Cannot bring up information about bills. The app is more than happy to take my money but never wants to bring up a bill for review.,
"The app is super spotty. Most times, it won't bring up my information, it just loads forever. But when it works, it's really helpful to have my health data in one place.",
"I see potential, but I first thing I tried to do was add new payment method and got Webpage Not Available error. No way around it. My payment is due on 2/22. I hope you fix this error before then.",
I love MyChart it's very helpful,
"Was a good app, until the update. Now I can not view my test results. Tried downloading a file viewer, now it tells me there are no results. Deleted this app its useless to me now.",
"No help screen at all. Tiny print on many screens, I have covid test results that are over 1 1/22 years, but can't delete them!",
"Login is a disaster. I had to create a user name so I used my name, which is longer than 20 letters and it would not accept it on my phone, so I went home and figured it out on my laptop, then I tried to login on my phone and it locked me out due to the fact that it would not take my username. Now I can't figure out how to unlock it and I have covid results pending, so I can go back to work. Beyond frustrating. I'm so sick of websites.",
"Its a great app to make my appointments, send messages to my health team, & get my test results with PCP explainations. Easy to navigate, update my information, do echeck-in, recieve and respond to my arrival. I also like being able to share my records with my other doctors.",
"This app is a lifesaver for me. I can check past, current & future appointments and lab results with ease. No more losing written down information. Wonderful especially during Covid.",
"It's nice and convenient but if you don't have insurance that covers the absurd virtual appointments ($29 each time for me) you are stuck with absolutely no way to reasonably get in touch with your doctor unless they call you. Then, each doctor treats you with no understanding and refuses to help in ways a standard doctor would, especially if you contact them via message. They are abusing the outbreak to make money hand over fist on the back of us being concerned about hurting other people or our livelihoods. Delete this app as soon as quarantine is done and work with a local provider.",
Way too difficult to set up. Would be nice if it were seemless with FollowMyHealth. I could not get successfully installed an operating. I use FollowMyHealth all the time especially to email my PCP. Now I cannot because of this app.,
I love this app. I use it for my entire family and it's very nice to have everyone and everything in one place. Having a family that has several appointments it is very nice to be able to schedule the appointments online. I like being able to email my providers too.,
"It's pretty good and has been getting better. You may still have to switch between organizations and look for stuff in two places, but if you're patient it has everything.",
I love the MyChart app. It makes it so easy to ask my primary doctor questions and receive quick replies. It's a great communication tool with quick test results posted. Coni Statz.,
So glad our health system switched to the epic. Everything seems pretty easy to navigate. Results are coming in pretty quickly. The best part is your discharge instructions are all uploaded online as well. Love Epic and MyChart.,
"This is simply great. It is easy to use, you can see everything medical that concerns you. You can also connect with other providers through the app. It's awesome!!!",
Does not recognize your password. Won't even send a verification email to you when you request it zero Stars. Worst app ever.update can't even get in touch with support if I had to depend on this app I'd be dead,
"Leaving messages for my doctors is so easy with this app. Refills, making appointments, looking at test results, paying your bill ... everything is so easy to do and is all wrapped up in this app.",
"This app is great except that you can't get rid of reminders and they are obnoxious. I am getting ""reminded"" to do things that don't apply to me or that I don't want to see and I am unable to hide, dismiss, or get rid of that section all together",
Do not use the message function No one answers Drs do not know how to do the job without the app,
So nice and easy to use I love it,
"I work in IT.....with medical records. For scheduling appointments, sending messages, etc, it's fine. For getting/viewing medical records, it's a turd.",
"Appreciate the info available, and the the site is easy to navigate. But the site is slow and has often had server errors.",
"My health center keeps all of my information, test results, future appointments, and prescriptions all in one app. Been using this app for over a month, and so far, I really like it.",
"It's definitely a great opportunity to keep up with your PCP, test results etc! This is soo much needed for all!! No pop up ads is great! Thank you!",
Ever since this last update. I can't log in. It says my password and my username is incorrect. And it's been the same for a year. I have severe medical issues. Sometimes I can't use my voice. I need this app and I can't use it.,
The app is very easy to navigate. I like it a lot.,
It's not really that useful it seems you can access important scan information or link other medical records. Basically only messages about appointments are the only thing it's useful for.,
The app doesn't even let you sign in regardless of whether or not the login is put in correctly. There is more functionality from the webpage and that's limited.,
"This app is great for anyone who wishes to be able to view medical history in one place. In addition, you're able to set appointments and receive reminders. I love the fact that I can message my doctor. I just love it!",
"App is very stupid re location. Demands location access, then assumes current location is where health provider is located. Cannot use app while on travel! DUMB!!!",
Makes keeping up with all health data an easy task. All Covid info as well as diagnostic and test results are also right at your fingertips on the app.,
I love having all my medical history in one place. I can ask questions about anything that is in my chart right inside the app. It makes things easier when seeing a new doctor like today since I didn't have to fill out any paperwork.,
"Not impressed. Before logging in, app asks for my provider. But my provider is not one of the options. When I select the ""not listed"" option I get a server error.",
This is a great service. I enjoy being able to leave a message for my doctor without speaking to 2 or 3 peope first. It is also nice to refer to previous stats from blood work and other test results when I need to.,
"Absolutely terrible. Slow, clunky and counterintuitive. Again, Google, we REALLY need to be able to choose ZERO stars.",
everytime I try to look at my billing it tells me that an error has occurred or it can't connect to the server and goes back to the previous screen please fix.,
"This is an excellent app to use for reference! Test results, upcoming appointments and multiple hospital records are just some of the features I wish I had known about it sooner!",
"Fairly easy to navigate. Could be easier to track meds. Would also be great to store insurance info, and communicate better between Doc and patients.",
The new update is making the app unusable. I restarted the phone and redownload the app but it's runs slowly and the medication tab won't load. Now I'm going to have to spend time and call the doctor.,
Love having all my information available on my phone.,
Who in the hell would make up an app that people can't use except that your technician. You need to go back and fix your app and test it to make sure it's user-friendly and it works. Instead of having morons for doing nothing,
"Peehaps it's me, but I find it difficult to use the app or where I need to go in the app to find what I'm looking for. I don't seem to have issues with other platforms.",
It's great to this app and all your info to explain at your finger tip,
Had the app for a while all of a sudden now it doesn't want to load it just keeps on spinning like it's loading something but nothing happens I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it doesn't want to open to the login,
Terrible. I downloaded this for android and I'm trying to log in but it's telling me that the latest update is available and there clearing is nothing in store that says there's an update that needs to be installed.,
"Have used in past. Now, I get a message that I need to upgrade, but there is no option to upgrade. Uninstalling app and reinstalling results in same message.",
The app reset when I was trying to get into my account and now my provider is no longer listed on MyChart. All of this happened in the span of a few minutes with no warning.,
"I love MyChart and can't figure out why there are so many negative reviews! I've used it for years with no problem. It's convenient, easy to use, never fails. The design is also attractive. I appreciate having all of my medical information at my fingertips.",
Always easy to use. Information easy to follow. Very easy to contact doctors when needed. Lab results are posted quickly. I love this app. Also enables me to use for payments.,
"Google play directes you to my chart and not myceenta. My ceenta had no app obviously. Yet my ceenta Info does not appear on my chart. Myceenta is sent through your email, not good can be easily deleted. Why not an app for myceenta???",
I am unable to pull up MyChart. I tried uninstalling the app and then reinstalling the app and nothing happens. I have a virtual appt in a half hour. This is not good.,
"As an older patient, using this app is easy & greatly appreciated. It's awesome to be able to just view lab results right here & it's so easy to access. Thank you",
"Our experience with this group has been exceptional. I wasn't sure about contact ing my Dr. through the portal vs phone but Dr.S is very responsive and always caring,always gets it, and helpful. What a blessing!",
"With the website 4🌟 it's lacking a constant feed from their system to this system don't know if it's because provider's⁵ aren't releasing them in a timely fashion or what the hiccup is. As far as ER care, not impressed by today's ER doc, he'd was arrogant & highly dismissive of my signs & symptoms. Dr. sent me home after about 2 hours and I'm a dialysis patient that needed urgent treatment!",
"Not sure why my review got deleted. You guys have a major bug to fix. Login isn't working for a lot of people. Why would we contact support over that? We can just use the damn website instead, where our logins work. Read your reviews, your app is broken. Instead of blaming the users, just fix your app.",
"It's a great app,.works fine. However if your medical information is something you'd like to keep private, then you should avoid this system. I have reason to believe it's penetrated with easily aquired spyware.",
Have worked with computers for years but trying to reset the username and password on my chart is a nightmare. Still are not able to login.,
It is an easy program to use once you activate an account. But if you a Sparrow hospital patient good luck with getting an account. You have to call the hospital and get a IT person to give you a code. It is impossible to generate one from the Sparrow website.,
One star until copy paste works for entering passwords on account sign up. This reduces security by causing users to reduce password length and complexity. Your security team is using outdated practices.,
My experience with the app is i forgot my password and it dont let you put in the code they sent for you to change password keep saying incorrect and they keep sending different ones when the first one suppose to expire in an hour,
"Awesome. It's amazing to have test results, appointment information, and access to my doctors so readily accessible and available. I'd like to see notes available at some point, right now I can check that on my providers website, but great job!",
Letters my doctors send me don't come through to me anymore!!! Messages still work but not letters... UPDATE: I unistalled the app and reinstalled. Didn't work right away but the following day my letter finally came through! Working good now! 👍,
It never loads or opens anything and continues to get error messages every time I click something. This is My only way to get in touch with my doctor so the fact that I can't even do that is very upsetting,
"Both the app and web page inaccessible and have been that way for other two months. I've had one correspondence with with a tech support ""person"" with no reply from my last email in over 2 weeks.",
"I have found this app to be useful. My take on the seemingly rather negative comments suggests many users either need more training or trial and error practice to become more efficient in its use. Practice, practice, practice.",
It has helped me with my doctors in Portland and in Grants Pass. I can keep track of my appointments and and I can send messages to them. It also helps went I have to do physical therapy too sometimes.,
Improved from the last couple years. Not intuitive in the message department. Functionality is not the best. Needs improvement asap,
"It rejected my user name and password.Then it put a red rectangle over half my user name so I couldnt see if it is correct. Or redo it. I'm in a hurry and can't resolve it. I want to go to bed! CVS minute clinic says I only have 2 more hours to download my covid test results using this site.. which does not work. I have to go to sleep now. So I guess, after all the hassle and mind numbing steps I went through to get tested, I will never know my results. Or be able to copy them for a record.",
Fantastic! So convenient. Had test yesterday. Results on my chart next day. Of course not all test have a one day turn around. Also able to give approval to other providers to access ur chart. NO fax and gathering info to take to Dr. Huge improvement to medical system.,
"Absolutely love this app. I can contact my Dr with questions or concerns and get a response quickly. I can also schedule an appointment, pay my bill, Check in, pay my copay etc. I think I'd be lost without this app",
"Useful, but inconsistent. SMS Healthcare, billing says click here to pay with app, but then continually tries to redirect me to a website to pay. Make up your mind. Where do I pay? I want to use the app.",
Tried loading information to open account but would never get past loading. I gave up after 30 min. of loading. Pretty bad can't even make it in the app. After the fifth attempt it finally worked.,
app was great newest update won't seem to let me attach .pdf to a message. Would be nice if attachments supported excel as well.,
Getting a cryptic email of a bill requiring to open in this app but never in the correct context of my bill. Horrifically bad user experience.,
"It has helped me to find out things that the doctors have failed to tell me. Example I found out in November 2020 after a hospital visit that I have Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3, doctor said get the my chart app. Using the app I found out that I have had Kidney issues since 2016 and was never told by my doctor's that there was even an issue with my Kidneys. Thankfully the doctor at the hospital told me about my chart and now I can view and send messages to my doctor and even make appts!",
Unable to pay bill anywhere on the app!! Sidenote: you can only pay your bill online using an email address to pay your account if you haven't used that email address to pay a previous account.,
"Easy and fast, except for verifying my number it don't want to send the code to my number unless someone wrote it down wrong. Not sure what us going in there with that. Over all I like using the My Chart app.",
"The app is generally good, but I cannot add a payment method. The app will not accept my city. I've tried on 2 different devices, and tried different city names associated with my postal code. No go",
This is the worst MyChart experience. Not user friendly. For help customer service is mostly robotic Rare instance you can speak to a live person. Difficult to start log in. Have to call my MD office for assistance. Whoever planned and designed this MyChart should take a look at the other hospitals My Chart to see ease of use and efficiency(eg. Baylor MyChart). On a scale of 0 to 10 I will give Methodist My Chart a 1.,
"All Drs under one app for me and my child. Refills, messages, test results and more in one place. Love this app. Very easy to use",
"Ok what's going on? It was fine before. All my organizations were there. Now they're gone and when searching for them, the app can't find them. I even put in my state and get the same problem. Please reverse back to the way it was before the update.",
I love this app. It's keep me up to date on all my Dr's appointments plus you can check in over your phone how cool is that? FRECKIN AWESOME. I also like that fact that all my Dr's are listed. My labs work and medication. Great work,
Excellent way to keep track of appointments and health. I have a little trouble with scheduling appointments through the app though. But that's just a minor issue.,
I love the my chart app! I have all of my info at a touch of a finger. I never miss an appt and can keep up with my meds. I can have virtual appointments with no issues. Thank you my chart!,
"It works well for a little while and then I am having serious problem signing back in even when I reset everything all over again, you are very unreliable for a medical app.",
"Horrible. Tried to update password and it locked my account. Pos. Also the app knew my email address to tell me I had mail, but when I tried to log in it told me my account didn't exist.",
I love the fact to communicate with my Doctors to ask question or concerns. See all your appointments and test result. This is the best app. To be able to schedule or cancel appointments.,
"I had an enjoyable experience while getting my health back at Baptist, and whom ever has said in their long boring comment on this app, well some people just didn't have as hard of a time learning this app and frankly it was easy to get it on my Samsung tablet and other tech gadgets I have. So there is no since in blaming the staff at Baptist for some of us that can't get it.",
"When writing a message it won't let me cut and paste. It says that one can't type special characters such as emoji, but I'm not! I'm just pasting in normal letters.",
"This app is outstanding. Its keeps all your appointments, meds, lab work and resylts just to name a few. You can order refills cia this app. I highly recommond this app.",
I really liked this app until today! I open it and it is a blank screen with nothing to click on. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling and still nothing. it doesnt even ask me for my pass code? help please!,
This app is one of the best. I have had no problems with it you can get your yesterday results without going into the doctor's. You can also message you doctor's without having to call and hassel with getting out on hold.,
"The app is really great. I communicate with my Physicians, Lab & Test results, Xrays, Letters, Diagnostic, Diagnosis, Appointments, Medications, any tests or Injections. I can upload pictures, I can get a lot accomplished thru this app. Thank You",
It's great when it works! I'm at critical point and moving with important test results that I need and I can't access for a primary Dr. I will see in another state.,
This app helps me keep up with my health. I can get on anytime and see what ever appointment with ever doctor and all my medical information that is handy for people that can not remember important information about your health thank you for coming up with the app that is helpful for everyone.,
The app never works u try sending doctor a message the screen closes i have complained for over a month nothing. This app is absolutely the worst app i have seen beings its for something thats very important. They administers need to look into for this app is medical and should not have defaults o bet if they were collecting money it work perfectly fine but life who cars u can just die by usint this app,
"App has a random selection of my medical records. Out of ~40 years with this provider, I have 1 set of lab work, 1 convenient care visit, 1 hospital stay. It says I need vaccines, but PCP says since I had chicken pox, no need to vax. Says I have no bills to pay, hospital disagrees and wants money. What's the point of the app if nothing in it can be trusted?",
"I like customization of My Chart. It is not the same with all healthcare My Chart sites. Not able to ad a photo, and changing the colour and theme, instead of the default green colour I'd rather not use. It does not have those features with all the health organizations using Epic Systems Corp. Can app be similar to the website? Epic Systems software It should be available to use. Some women, men, & non-binarymay wish specific theme colours. Thank you.",
"It won't let me log in. Every time I try it says ""unable to load terms and conditions. Try again later. "" I've even tried uninstalling and installing again, and it continues to do this same thing!",
"It's comprehensive, detailed and convenient. I enjoy having it. Save time from making phone calls and waiting",
This app is almost useless. It doesn't work every time I go to the same doctor. Not all of my lab work shows up. Their was nothing wrong with the last app the doctor's office used. This one sucks.,
Was working great but now suddenly it has forgotten everything it had saved in it and won't even look for hospitals to even let me try and log back in again. I'll go by name zip state and it acts like no hospital exists in that entire state.,
"Cannot login, both on this app and the website online. Tried signing up for a new account to see if it made any difference and still getting error messages.",
"Junk. Only one time have I ever been able to e-check in and begin my visit. The rest, it boots me out mid check in. On top of that, I see no way to schedule an appointment with any other doctor other than my primary. Why wouldn't they allow the option me the option to schedule my appointment with my neurologist?",
"This app is a lifesaver, you have all your medical records and doctors one click away. Best when your children have special care and you can't remember everything. I wish all health facilities use it.",
"Very convenient! It helps keep track of my medications, medical history, all my allergies, and helps me communicate with my doctors easier! Brilliant app! Love it,!",
"I finally checked this out after along time of ignoring them when they would tell me to set this up, well I finally did and it was very simple, didn't take to long and wasn't very painful,actually pain free lol but I do wish that I would have signed and set this up along time ago as has now im asking every doctor I end up seeing for their little thing they use for their patient portholes because I want to connect all my medical thing to the one witch you can do btw...I def recommend this",
"Pisses me off that I get bombarded with reminders for the same appointment. How can I disable that? All communications, messaging and preferences, subheadings should be under one link, but thank you for responding.",
"I like seeing all of my appointments, being able to email my doctors, and being able to access my lab results. My husband did have a problem making an appointment...it was a REQUEST for an appointment and the office did not respond back to him...don't know why. So he had to call the office.",
"Blows up on you when you try to log in: ""Terms and conditions cannot be loaded at this time. Please try again later."" Then just closes on you. Useless. (And yes, I tried all ways of fixing it on my end.)",
Very convenient. Get test results back immediately. You can contact doctors through the app and see billing among other useful tools.,
MyChart has dramatically simplified communication with my wellness team. I especially enjoy having easy access to my key information. This app has been a huge convenience and I am very grateful!,
This app hardly works. I have the Samsung s20 an this app just loads and loads it gives me error messages and won't let me do anything or see anything on it. How am I to use this app for appointments if I get error messages,
"Cannot access any messages, chart or test information using the app. Nothing works pass the dashboard screen. Useless.",
This is a great app to help you keep up with medical records and test results Sometimes this app does have glitches on messages and stuff. That's something needs fixed.,
"I like that i can access meds, med allergies BUT it frustrates me that after accessing med allergies, there is no way to return to the homepage to access another topic. Closing the app evertyime i want to changes topics is REALLY A PAIN IN THE REAR. Bob",
I am very happy with the app. But I would like to be able to update information for kovid when I have a booster shot it's not letting me post it to the my chart.,
"MyChart has become an excellent tool in helping me keep up with my health concerns, questions, appointments, medications and all around medical necessities. Simple to send a letter to any of my specialist, ask a question or for an appointment, get refills for my medications, see my lab results, and update or send any of my important information to other doctors.",
The best medical app I've ever had. Makes my life so much easier. My doctor is not close to me and having this is so nice to have the reminders and to see to call in meds and beable to message them and see updates.,
"Your new update is an issue. Apparently because you don't have https: capability, I can't access my medical info. I would prefer my medical info to be secure & available. I can make appointments when I can't talk on the phone with asthma flare",
"This app would be better if it were customizable. I would like to track my health conditions and standard info like weight, A1C, BP and Cholesterol numbers. It would be helpful to be able to entey own health history as well.",
I really like this app you can comunicate with your dr and see test results go thru your meds and request refills during the shut down i was able to get on the app and talk to my dr in real time and didnt have to leave my couch and can even set up payment arrangements. The only down side is it is only for parkview doctors you cant add any lutheran doctors so if you got doctors in both hospital networks you have to have an app for both,
Awful experience. This app can't even remember my login. Such basic functionality being missing is frustrating to no end. I have enough things to remember.,
"This is a fine app, but it needs a way to upload pictures, like the covid-19 vac card or other cards and documents. That would be very helpful.",
App connection to server extremely unstable and fails nearly 100% with an error message. Unusable on Pixel 3a running Android 10.,
I keep trying to log in and every single time I am getting an error message. I need for this to work at all times so I can share my medical history with other providers that I see. I can log in from my computer but the mobile app does not work.,
"Get with the times people!! Lots of people are on imac's, you know apple computers! Epic doesn't detect my mic or camera even on chrome and the phone is hard to talk to doc. Make a program that works easily on a computer! Edit: worked on phone but DOCTOR couldn't get THEIR system to work and they couldn't see us. The one star rating is too high for visits that I'm PAYING to see the doctor for.",
"Old phone died and had to put in this app as I didn't see the same app I used. Some of my visits and test results are not here. I had a blood test with about 22 results t hat I need for another doctors appt, it's not here on this app.",
Used to like it but for the last few weeks it closes within seconds of logging in. What the hell happened? I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling but same problem!!!,
You can't multi select anything such as messages to delete. Password can't be saved. Only a few test results are actually osted,
"Cannot access this My page app, from an incoming email about ""my page' and a letter to me on my Droid phone. Could not download it , nor could the Presbyterian healthcare customer service give me any help on what the My Page message is/ was ( privacy concerns?) Maybe trying to create a profile or sign in after loading the app on my Apple computer could work. This is not making me a happy customer of the Medicare plan I'm enrolled in as a senior .",
I use to be able to sign in with no problems but now having trouble signing in to this app. I try to uninstall the app and reinstall and nothing. Doesn't work..what is going on? Call someone please tell me thank you,
"I love this app so much! I can easily get a hold of a nurse or ma and I can see my test results, instead of having to call to verify results, the office will just reply. Love it!!!",
"I like this app. It reminds me of Appointments and allows me access to test results, and to ask medical advice. My only complaint is I can't erase old Appointments or test results I no longer need.",
Won't let me sign in with my correct password. Password works via the webpage. Just not the app. Worked the first 3 times. Then stopped.,
Way too difficult to navigate. You get emails saying test results are ready which means you're in the system somewhere but then no login info works and if you sign up for one it says please wait a week. Ummmm?. Just try your doctor directly over the phone instead of this foolishness. I'm sure it works for setting appts and stuff but too complicated otherwise,
"Works great saves me time and from endless headaches from always being on hold trying to call and dealing with robots instead of humans,now i text my doctor and he gets right back to me. Awesome!!!",
"Every time I try to sign onto the app I get an error message saying cannot connect to server. Was told to Uninstaller and reinstall, same issue.",
"Poorly developed. Glitches trying to write an email, medication glitches esp. pre-authororized meds.(built in incorrect info about many ""formulary"" meds which differ from what a doctor may write ie; frequency, amt. of pills per month ect.ect...)! Far too many doctors and staff do not have enough computer science schooling to recognize this and many other similar apps. have very serious problems that can and eventually will cause injury to a patient. Contact a specialized attorney for injury!",
"Liked the app alot, but then if kept asking me to update. Kept getting same message afterwords. could not get any help, so deleting it. Found the sanford app would work for me",
"Are you guys ever going to fix the bug where the app can't open a browser to view things like appointment details? Additionally, I'm having issues viewing anything in MyChart if I am connected to the WiFi of the hospital I am attempting to view info from.",
Found out I had cancer. This app keeps all my appointments organized (adding them to my calendar is awesome). Love that I can see my test results when they come out. Would give 10 stars if I could!,
"It will not let me sign in, saying there is a problem communicating with the server and to try again later. I use this app for my kids and I so not being able to login has been a problem.",
"Love this app. Provides me with superior ability to connect with my Drs, request any of my medications, receive a report of my history with my Drs Office, emergency rooms (within the same network) and more. Also makes it easy for me to coordinate with My Pharmacies with dates provided by My Doctor's Office with date availabilty, so I know just when I am ready to pick up my medication. This has literally and easily became one of the most vital apps that I utilize, pretty much everyday of my life.",
"My community Hospital Doctor's Office seems they hate this form of communication. If you communicate necessary information to them too often, they will call it abuse, because they must keep up with it. They can and will do whatever they want, including letting you go as a patient. Parkview Health is not good. Very controlling in all they do.",
My only issue is not with the program but that I have to go to google play to open the app. No icon on my phone. Other than that i find it very helpful and not to complicated at all.,
"Useless, it won't log in. keep getting ""terms and conditions cannot be uploaded"" and that keeps the app from starting.",
App does not work even with latest update from 5/30/20. For 5 days now terms and conditions are unable to update at this time. This prevents you from logging on. Regular online works fine. Better off there.,
"My doctor added additional lab work and the order never showed up in the app. The app doesn't show current or future orders, just appointments. The website shows both. Will rely on the website from now on.",
"Amazing, all in one place for all.of your medical records. Absolutely love the app. The previous one didn't do nearly as much as this one and it's so much faster.",
The one frustration I have is I cannot view the billing statements. It always says theres a server error or something equivalent. Please fix this.,
This app was good until about a month ago then it just started giving me a blank screen and wouldn't let me sign in. I even re-installed with no changes.,
I think this app could use a little more details. The password reset is hard to configure and sometimes isn't even accurate. This app may not be helpful to doctors because at my visits they do not utilize it and ask same questions and hand me forms to be transported instead of using this app for reference. The help line is automated and wait time is always an hour. And you'll wait the full hour each time,
Not too shabby. While it doesnt have as many options as the main mychart website it's a bit more handy with the fingerprint scanner. I love that i reach my provider.,
"App is fairly decent however the appointment scheduling process leaves much to be desired. User has to provide dates they are available, then the physician sends a message for a scheduled appointment date, with no process to inquire about other available dates.",
Before this site changed I could log in and had no trouble getting my messages. Now i had to redo app and can't get my chart. I need to get my test results. I'm very frustrated,
"Need this app to receive covid test results. Everything was ok and there 10-20, now on 10-21 the organization and my data has been removed from the app. The organization is no longer a choice to select. What now?",
App works fine but it does a horrible job at letting the user find out the actual organization. Mychart owns both the website and the application so there is no real excuse for letting the user search for which my chart their organization is under. QRT code or some code would have been really helpful,
This app is literally the worst. Im an hour in trying to se up my account just to get test results. My covid results should br ready by the time I get logged in. Cant load this or that. Last thing I wanna mess with when I dont feel well.,
"The app is not updating with vaccine info nor covid test results. I was sent a link after my covid test for MyChart (already had and use) but when i go in nothing is updated. Not only that, it doesn't even allow for me to update latest vaccines taken. I need assistance with this app fast!",
I'm not a fan of not being able to switch between my children and myself. I thought the app would be more convenient than going to the website but everytime I want to look at something for my children I have to anyway since the app will only allow me to see my info.,
I have had only positive usage of this app. It has made dealing with appointments and communication with medical staff much easier & convenient.,
I love the ease of being able to use numbers to look in quick. Also the ability to go thru the app with ease.,
"This app is an incredible way to efficiently communicate with your health care organization. Messages, appointments, billing, etc. They notified,scheduled, and prescreened me for my covid vaccine appointments .",
"A great App. Helps you see all your health information, test results, appointments, medications, etc. Allows you to request prescription refills, send messages to the doctor and if your insurance allows you can do an evisit. If it were an option I'd give this App 10 stars!",
MyChart works differently depending on if accessed from the app or if opening from an email. Functions better when accessed from email. Access from the app is limited and awkward.,
"Why is it so difficult to switch between providers!? Since this is a major feature of the service, it s should be better thought out and more easily communicated to users/patients.",
"Onn Only used it 2 months so far. Pretty good, but why does it NOT have a place for me to manually enter my vitals like BP, glucose, etc. This would improve real-time communication between me and my care providers.",
Absolutely LOVE this app!!! I wish every medical place used this one specifically! I brag about it to all my Mom friends of how easy it is to use and how nice it is to have open access to our own information!!,
This app always works for me! Its pretty great as it shows past and upcoming appointments! It also shows test and lad results.,
Sentara and Riversideonline BOTH use the same App. They switch most of the time between them when I want to. Great app that could use only just a bit more work.,
"This app is WONDERFUL!! I'm able to access my test results, upcoming appointments, message my providers, manage my medication list and refills and so much more! Honestly, this app has been such an amazing game changer for my family and I.",
"Great app to keep up with appointments and test results. Notes and summary notes from doctor's and clinic visits too. Keeps you current with needed lab work, tests and vaccines. I updated my review to 5-star because I can now get past clinical notes from other cities as well.",
"Does not show in recent apps therefore you cannot switch between this app and another app, for example a password manager and this app, and that frankly is a pain in the ass!",
I love the new updates for Harris Health I just wish we can schedule our appointments via app like we can cancel. It would be a lot easier for when we can not get a hold of someone to reschedule.,
"CANNOT Transfer App Data to External, SD card?! A Memory Hog: Grows in size! Have To Delete App Every Time I Use It!! Every Time!. Takes Up, e.g., ""Hogs Android's Sys. Memory""! Why?! You Don't Listen To Complaints. Only app for use with my Insurance Co's Hosp. Sys. Useless For All of the Above Reasons! Permissions Change OFTEN! GOOGLE PLAY Users: Check ALL THE App's Critical Ratings!!! See their Respose, below!",
currently unable to see some important billing information that I received an email about this morning. it just won't load. so I'm currently hugely inconvenienced. usually it works well though.,
"Good app, but I don't need 10 appointment reminders a week before my appointment. I made the appointment, I know when it is. I get a text, email, and then the app bugs!. Drives me nuts....",
"This is the best way to communicate with my Healthcare team. Test results are quickly posted, Rx list, appointment notes and scheduling too. My Dr personally answers my questions in less than 24 hours! Absolutely Fabulous app!!!",
"Constant reminders to update contact information. I have gone to the page three times to find my information is correct. There is no way to confirm that offered. Out of date appointment information, comments like ""you are overdue for your eye exam."" How would you know since you know NOTHING ABOUT MY EYECARE, which I do NOT OBTAIN my eye with you! Traveling over three hundred and fifty miles, my husband losing three days of work costing us several hundred dollars, and spending over a hundred do",
"I love having such easy access to my medical care team. They seem to have all the bugs worked out now. I've found some of my health info, a diagnosis actually, by reviewing MyChart that no doc ever told me or discussed!",
I appreciate the quick access to my medical info. I am frustrated that I can't see appointment details with receipts so I can use for medical flex account. It makes paying through the inconvenient. I am less likely to do so in the future.,
The only thing that would make this app better is to make it easier to add the different Dr offices. Other than that this app has helped me so much! I'm so glad that they came up with this. Now I can view my documents and test results for myself.,
"I have downloaded this app several times, but I can't view my medical records because it keeps telling me there's a newer version available. However, I can not find the ""newer version""! How do I ensure that I have the appropriate app?",
It wants me to update my information. Ok no change . Where is the confirmation button ? It only gives me edit or remove. I don't need either. What a confusing waste of time. Why do I get a 3 yr old estimate on a cataract surgery that is complete.?,
"I love MyChart, I go to my healthcare providers regularly and I love having easy access to my medications and upcoming appointments. being able to request refills for medications through the app has been a huge part of making sure I'm taking proper care of myself",
Happy to say my log in problem has been resolved. I really enjoy the ability to send info back and forth to my doctor ... Using my chart makes everything easier!,
"Love love love this app. Have been using it for years. Just had a recent inpatient stay and got constant updates, informational videos to watch and also test results.",
"This is a very convenient app. I use it for my husband and follow the notes, test results and follow ups for him, even communicating with all doctors over concerns.",
"Ok so I left a favorable review, but I've changed my mind While I still love the app I'm very frustrated with it. While my husband and I have the app it's becoming increasingly hard to log in. More than half the time I can't log in with my pass code. So when I finally do get in I change the setting for the pass code and it will work for awhile then I have to do this all again.",
"This app always says ""can't connect with the server, try again later."" I've tried so many times without success. Very frustrating!7",
Yhe online visits on the app is a great thought if they didn't tell you to go in and be seen every time. Also can't cancel appt they tell you to call.. So if everything they offer you have to call or be seen why offer them in the app.,
The red dot alerts remain for hours after an event is viewed. This is a nusiance. Some lab test results do not display in a spreadsheet format permitting comparisons with test results from other dates. This is very inconvenient.,
"What happened? You changed it and now I can't even log in. It goes to some screen where it wants a location, but won't accept or find the one where I get my service. It's now useless.",
"It's nice. Big issue I have is that when my account was made, there was a typo in the username. It took two years for me to figure out what my username was and actually start using this, and that was only cuz my dr made me",
I like using the app an order to stay up-to-date on my health & I can also edit my personal account info too. It would be nice if the share time access was a little bit longer than an hour.,
Completely sucks. Tried to sign up and said it couldn't verify my identity with my information. Tells me to contact customer service but doesn't say how to do that. Disgraceful.,
So helpful! Easier receiving and sending information about test results. Just feel closer and much easier to keep contact with my doctor.,
Easy simple and for somebody with the boo boo brain saying that it should tell you something it's accurate it's awesome it's easy and it is 100% secure which is a big issue with me. I think my chart for many reasons,
"larry lopez, this epic MyChart it's supposed to be an addition to the UCSD MyChart health who sings ask me a bunch of questions instead of it just simply transitioning and updating so that I'm able to look at my record my calendar for appointments and it's not allow me to do that so I'm unsure about this app and right now it sucks.",
Great app no problems. Keep all of my info in one place including appointment reminders. I can even make my appointments on this appointment without calling in,
Bring back the sliding animated Reference range; this long jumbled text reading where I have to search for the word results is not sensible.,
"App isn't intuitive operationally. My information doesn't update, I can't clear notices such as updating my information. Appreciate the access but could be better.",
"Updated review: Mychart let me know that my provider (MERITUS of Hagerstown, MD) most likely is blocking the scheduling of appointments, because each provider sets up their own options 😑. Very inconvenient indeed! --- I can't schedule appointments anymore :(",
"My chart is very dependable. Great flexibility for changing passwords, sending messages to your physician and other medical matters. Please access My Chart. It is a life changer.",
Once i got the hang of it very easy to use. I love the idea that I can see everything all in one place and all my Dr's are all in one place. Very easy to use and communication is also great.,
Can't even enter the app. When I put in my pin or my password it tells me it can't show me the terms and agreement at this time and to try again later. IT'S BEEN 2 WEEKS!!,
"I love ""My Chart"". It is easier to tell the Drs and Staff what I need when the phones just ring and ring. Or after hours when I remember something I should have told the Dr. while I was in the office, but forgot. Also, being able to look at medications and tests that were taken is a help also. Most times I get the results before to he Dr can send me a follow-up message. I don't like when the system says go somewhere, like Pharmacy, and there is no such place to go to. D. Speech 10/29",
"The only After Visit Summary I've encountered was from a visit to Urgent care, but nothing from any of the visits to individual doctors. Either that feature doesn't work or the individual doctors don't summarize my visits, because I've had to call them back repeatedly for information.",
"This app is very easy to use. I can add my appointments to my calender, and it's easy to set multiple reminders for those.",
"It used to be fairly good but now I have trouble navigating the app, pre-appt questionnaires are not popping up and it is slow to load.",
I just set up my chart when i downloaded the app on my phone its so great. Easy access lets see how well this works as time goes on.,
My Chart communicates your medical history really well. It is organized into seperate categories that are easy to read and understand.,
"I think it's great! It has so much information listed, and your able to refill your medications and set up or cancel your appointment easily.",
Not working right after update. Can't locate my doctor or any other doctor in my state. I depend on this app for many things because of my current health issues. I hate it now.,
I can't log in or use the app at all. Keeps telling me password and email are wrong when they are not. I've even changed my pw. Still says it's not right. FIX IT PLEASE,
I'd like the ability to mark notifications in the bell as read. I'd also like to be able to sort messages by doctor.,
The my chart app for android does not work on my on my phone saying Samsung version 7 does not support the AP. Previously it did work with the same version? The QR code does not scan..I am confused.,
"Used to be great. Now with this new update, it says there are messages but when I click on it, they don't show anything. Terrible update.",
I entered my PW wrong and my account was disabled. There aren't any instructions that actually work to regain my access. I'm uninstalling this app because I've had zero responses to my emails from the app developer for support.,
"I had used this app on my old iPhone with no difficulty, but upon installing on my Pixel 3 am unable to log in. Even was able to change the password and still cannot log in.",
"Will not open ""problem communicating with the server. Please try again later"" it's been doing this since Friday 9/13. Was there an update that caused this? Had same thing 2 years ago.",
I'm able to access not only ALL of my medical information along with my children's. I can also send/receive messages through their portal. Best feature is that ALL of my Doctor's can access my important medical information without my running around trying to request & pay for medical records!,
this a really good app. more people should us it. you can check to see what your actual results from your doctor was and it post your nexted appointment if you should forget. you can request a refill on meds to you doctors office or an appointment. it reminds you of yearly checkup you my need. this is and A+ app.,
"Love this !!!! Keeps you updated with your Doctors and can make appointments get medication refills, video appointments with your Doctor, make it nice when it's hard for you to leave your home. If you dont have you truly want to get. It makes my life so much easier. TY!!!!",
Impossibly different than the other my chart system I use..ya think whoevers in charge of medical charts would consolidate them to ATLEAST be similar..i feel this is just another example of the sheer incompetence of the tech side of the medical field as a whole..,
"Needs work. Some personell, do not know how to properly convey messages.Believe some training is in order. If a pre billing question needs answering, appears no place to ask that question. Overall, a good system that needs improvement.",
"Broken, can't connect to server, try later. Several months now & don't bother emailing because the developer doesn't respond. Used to work great.",
Why can't I just Sign into an Account why do I have to choose my service provider all this dumb stuff? This App right off the bad is designed by somebody incompetent I can't imagine an Older person who isn't good with tech doing this. You should be ashamed how BAD this App and how hard it is to even get the app stsrted and working right. 00000000 out of 10 for pissing me off and making a non user friendly App that's EASY and Not ANNOYING to operate. Fire the person who designed this APP,
"Just downloaded it and I'm happy with it so far. It is easy to use, looks clean and simple, and has a lot of great useful functions built in the application.",
One stop shop. All the information I need right at my finger tips. Sometimes it's been a hurdle to make payments. Ease of scheduling amd communicating with providers.,
"Can't log in, keep saying password not correct, when it is correct, same password I use to log into on a PC and it works! Useless for me.",
MyChart makes all the difference. Doctors and staff are able to respond in a more timely manner. Its much easier to take your time and type your request than to phone ; more time for reception to converse with patients on site. Thank you Dr. Rafferty and your staff for always being so prompt with responses.,
I recently had a battle with cancer. This app was a life saver. It kept all my appts for me. I'm able to refill meds and make appts. It really kept everything in one place at my fingertips,
"Im not sure why it will not allow more than one account, it has let me set one up for myself but not for my chold,every time I go to set his up it states he cannot be verified with information I've provided.",
"Brilliant, I can see all my son's test results 😎 Would be nicer if there was a graph plotted with all the blood test results.",
It's a very informative app,
I love this app. I enjoy the fact that most of my medical information is just a finger tip (portal) away. The app seems to be user friendly because I can find my way around easily. I enjoy how quickly things are updated ie. doctor's note(s) from visit.,
I love how I have instant access to me an my children test results and medicines. Its like my records on the go. Can't ask for a better app. I give 5 stars,
"The app did not send 2 of the last 3 refills I requested to the pharmacy. I was asked to email developers, which I did. No response and the problem still exists, it is getting my refill requests to my pharmacy. Very disappointing.",
I like being able to combine all of my Doctors into one app. This is very convenient for me to lookup all of my medical records.,
"Love ""My Chart"". Things are so much easier.",
It's easy to use and gives lots of information.,
Really helps keep all medical records in one place.,
"Helpful overall, really unnecessary to have to log in to different clinics/organizations. Do this in the backend where patients aren't required to navigate, no one knows or cares if their provider is with St Charles or Summit or anywhere else.",
Quality of Life dr in anniston al DOES NOT even use it.,
A huge thank you to Valley Health Milton!!! Dr. Dillon and support staff always helps in anyway they can. My gratitude is overflowing for the help you have given me!!!,
"Very easy to navigate, all the needed information is there, your doctors, appointments, payments, messages",
Not much to say I get the results before the doctor calls to tell what they are,
I've enjoyed this until they added Oklahoma University now it won't let me see most dtuff.,
The app is easy to use and provides quick access to medical information.,
"So nice to have everything from records to test(s) / shot(s) due, Message your MUSC doctors, pay bill, pre check in for upcoming appts, schedule / change / cancel appts all in one spot. User friendly interface. If you deal w/ MUSC - even for a COVID 19 test ... download the app.",
"I like the app,but I lose my password occasionally and I have a hassle getting it to reset,wish this could be fixed its a pain!",
Easy to access and to get in touch with a provider,
Having to reset passwords too often and have a password keeper. Take too much messing around.,
"Used to work but now it doesn't. I can't see my upcoming appointments, look at my test results, or do anything that would help me with my care. The app is up to date, but it doesn't work properly. This is my ONLY way of seeing my appointments. Please fix this.",
Missing helpful features that are available through the mobile website such as viewing the history of lab results and seeing them on a chart.,
"MyChart has made life easier as messaging, ordering prescriptions, seeing test results and appointments coming and scheduling.",
Easy to use and navigate,
"Absolutely LOVE my MyChart! I am able to communicate with my Dr. (Who is also the best Dr. EVER!) I can easily reach my Dr. If I have questions about my medications, any upcoming tests & blood work that needs to be done. This App is laid out perfectly! Reminders are sent to your phone if it is time for prescription refills, & if you run outof refills, you can request more refills online & your Dr. Can quickly get that done. Like I said. it's awesome! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!",
"Excellent app. I love it very easy to access and all your information is safe and secure. I will refer to all my family and the community. Thank You, The creation of this app is 👏👌💯⭐ MRS. ARNOLD",
Makes my life so much easier everything at my fingertips so much information,
Easy to use and very informative,
I must say MyChart is pretty easy. I have had it for several years now. I wish I could have my husband on my account or just handle other adults on the account with there permission because it would be easier to know about appointment's or sending messages to the Dr I just handle all that stuff so we always have someone home to take care of the little ones and don't double book appointment's but I did figure out a loop hole if they send me the message I just put account and password & I'm in.,
"It's easy to use, you can check in for appointments before you arrive so when you do arrive, just give them your name, and you're ready to see the Dr. You can also send and receive messages to and from your providers and request prescription refills. Works for me!!",
"Excellent App, allows me to view my medical results and share said results with any medical providers I have, even during traveling.",
"This actually has been a great app, I also combined it with my UT physicians app so they're like in a group app. I can do that now and it's convenient.",
I like the app it's a great tool to have,
Great tool to find appts and test results,
This app really helps to save time and gives me direct communication with my health care professionals.,
"I love this app! As a cancer patient, I have so many appointments to keep up with, but MyChart makes it incredibly easy to do. I have access to lab results and doctors' notes after each appointment. I am so thankful for the ease and convenience.",
Better communication than phone and emails due to faster results review and medications logging of changes.,
"I love the My Chart App having easy immediate access to my appts, test results, what I need to do as far as setting up appts and the ability to leave a message for my Dr & his nurses. I definitely recommend the app",
"I love this app it's so great to keep track of when my child has a appointment coming up, and I can schedule or message the doctor if I have any concerns or questions.",
Makes it easy to access my information and check in for appointments,
This app is so easy to use. I like that I can log on see my test results and if I need them for any reason I can print them out and I love being able to message my doctor or a nurse and I like that we can now see our radiology images. I also like how I get to schedule an appointment with my Dr or with another Dr.,
My chart is very helpful to keep in touch with my Dr. Easy to use.,
"Very efficient at keeping me up-to-date on labs, lab results & medical appointments.",
Excellent way to see doctor when already a patient and live > 100 miles and no change in status just need checkup. Thank you very much.,
This app is terrible compared to the app I used before for my medical. I don't know why they switched but this sucks.,
The best maintained and performing app out there.,
MyChart is very handy & easy to use.,
Fairly easy to use & navigate,
Excellent for keeping track of medical info,
Having issues logging in. Telling me there is a server issue to try again later. Has been doing this for the last 2 days. Very frustrating when trying to get appointments made.,
An extremely useful app! Has helped me alot concerning management of my appointments and medication.,
Not user friendly and many times bill will not show to be paid,
Love it. It is so nice to keep up with everything,
The app works great the only problem is is the hospitals utilize this format do blatantly disregard keeping the information current and up-to-date well as giving you a format to delete any and all information that you do not want on it when you requested over and over and over again to their persons in charge of this app at the hospital at which it is being utilized for. The CEO each entity hospital represents should get on mid-management and the executive management to address this immediately,
It's easy to use and I love it,
Better than a phone call!,
Very user friendly..No more calls.. We love it.,
I really appreciate being able to have the app as it is very user-friendly.,
Sux. Very hard to navigate when the pages time out and reset.,
It's not easy to use between applications,
"This app helps me keep up with my appointments, medicines, messages to my doctors. Everything! I love it!",
When I can get in it's great but mostly it won't let me in.,
Although I am learning everything about system,
This app is very helpful and I will continue to use it. I have had not problems with it and can view everything I need to and will recommend this app to others.,
"A Great App!! Easy and convenient, I use it all the time!!! A great way to stay connected to your doctor!!!",
"Not happy with app. Has test 4 weeks ago, no updates no eta",
Very easy to use and understand,
"Depending on your diagnosis,or more so what they want your diagnosis to be, one day it's this on no tomorrow it's this yet maybe the next day it could be, but then again, give it a day or two it could be but probably not. You see the confusion they cause. Clear as mud.",
"Trying to login using the exact username and password and instead of giving me a prompt to reset the password and without warning, my account got blocked. Non existing customer service makes this really a negative and frustrating patient-doctor experience .",
Slow and doesn't always work,
Extremely convenient. I can see my complete medical chart. I can message the Dr and request medicine refills. It is fast and easy.,
I enjoy having all my medical information in the palm of my hand. Love it!,
Excellent app. Excellent quality and style very easy to use. Great layout with excellent communication quality.,
User friendly easy to get to what you need,
The username and password don't work. The notification takes over 20 minutes to log in. Only the online works for me,
"I don't really like to give 5 stars. So, this app gets 4. It is convenient, I can reach out to my medical team and they will reply. It is a handy little app to have. The shots are a little frustrating, some them aren't right.",
Easy app to use.,
"I can see all my medical info from my Bon Secours docs, and tie it to my SENTARA app. This way everything is easily connected. I can send messages to my docs, read after visit notes. (This has proven to be VERY GOOD! AND HAS SAVED ME POSSIBLE ILL EFFECTS FROM A PROCEDURE).",
Doesn't include all of my doctor visits. Optical and ortho,
It works great after I had to find out I had the wrong app and had to download this app,
I love this I can check in make appts,
Terrible! Sometimes it will let me sign in THEN NOT!!!!! VERY AGGRAVATING FOR SURE!!?????,
I love my chart. When you have a test done it shows your results. You get the results before your drs. Does.,
Great way of communicating.,
Very convenient and informative!,
"No great for older people. Also, Drs send messages to download and print documents but I have no way to do that",
Doesn't do as much as the website but it's pretty convenient.,
"This app assist with the normal procedures about your case, it saves a lot of paper work that usually can be misplaced, and it gets you informed about clinical research and potential participation opportunities. It can estimate how much your procedure may cost, it can let you updates about their practices, and how you can get involved.",
I Love Love mychart it's very easy to use also to stay up-to-date with your overall health and wellness & even to contact your Doctor/s. If needed.,
Really good App you get your info about your visit fast and your lab results before the doctor.Good appointment maker and reminder,
Seriously. Too much to ask for a simple Q n A.,
"Generally the app is functional . I have found a problem trying to schedule an appointment. How about ""other"" instead of your very specific options.",
I have used the APP for looking at my test results. I also contact my primary care physician when I need questions answered or an explanation about Test Results. I am able to see the answers with an explanation almost immediately. I moved down here from New Jersey. I laugh when I tell them my text results are available within 24 hours. It is tsking some of the doctor's over a week to let the patients. Some one needs to sell them this APP. Love it and thank you.,
This app is the best thing the medical industry has done for us patitients. App is always improving and great for scheduling and requesting refills. Updating info and sending and receiving forms is now digital as well. Highly recommended,
"Can't find allergy info, nothing is up to date.",
I really enjoy this ☺ app for my phone so easy and non stressful,
"Why does the page look and is unusable on windows? I do not want to pay my bill on my phone. I what to use a desktop site. BUT seems that's a bridge too far. The NEW mychart so far not so good. I see you asked another to say which providers site he uses so here, Mine is university health care in Georgia,USA,",
I actually like my chart. I'm not very vocal so it's convenient for me. Thank you.,
Can't schedule appointments Can't get results Wait of time Won't let me see my kids chart nor schedule appointments Very disappointed This app is not what they say it is,
"This is the absolute best app I've ever used. Works much better than anticipated. Far more useful than anticipated. I've been using it a lot and getting excellent results. So far, it keeps me from having to make phone calls, I can get most information I need through messaging in this app.",
A great help when I need to check with my doctor .,
"Love this app. All doctors should use it. Easy to communicate with them, all medical info in one place. Excellent!",
Very user friendly.,
Very easy to use and self explanatory.,
"Very good App, helps me keep up with my Appointments.",
It's so nice having a company actually trying to help people have all of their health information in one place.,
Many times results are not accessible due to server error and the same result is open online. Can you fix it as it's annoying being unable to find out.,
"Very nice to have this app. One area of improvement would be to allow app users to make our own notes for future reference re each entry. Doing so will help make us better, more involved and, therefore, more informed, patients.",
"Easy to Use, and Very Helpful. Thanks 🤗",
"I love mychart. Easy to use, it makes everything easier such as making appointment contacting office and reviewing test results",
User friendly and allows me to communicate with my healthcare providers,
Awesome easy to use charting,
Very user-friendly and convenient.,
This app needs a more human touch a customer service phone,
"I absolutely love this app. Now, wonder ~ What did we do before My Chart?? How many trees did it take for all the printed out paperwork? Carried appointment cards in wallet or a place easy to remember 😉 Then🤔 could couldn't find the card?? SO had to call doc office, with pen and paper in hand so wouldn't miss appointment",
Apps great. But seriously can we quit getting covid shot info now? If we want the vaccine we would've gotten it by now. Maybe have a button on the app that takes covid info off my chart. So some people can still view if they want an others don't if they want.,
Good attitudes all around. You are all very much appreciated. Thanks for all that you do.,
"The app is great for easy access to your medical records and for contacting providers. However, it keeps telling me I need to review and update my personal information every time I open the app.",
Best way to keep in touch with your health care team,
Great source of info at your fingertips.,
I really enjoy MyChart. I get to review how my visits went and when my next appointments are.,
"My Chart is perfect for keeping tract of my appointments, test results, after appointment notes, and being able to receive and send messages to my providers. It's an excellent way for me to keep up with my medical business.",
I use Mychart regularly and I have never had an issue. It is very helpful and accurate.,
Glitchy but easier than calling your doctor's office,
"App is great, but my COVID 19 vaccinations are not visible.",
Easy to navigate. Simple.,
I love my chart because I can get hold of my Dr. Quicker to refill meds or a virtual visit. Or to see lab test results real quick. It is very nice and convienent,
I'm literally a patient of Orlando health and they will not allow me access to my charts. Don't use.,
"Nowhere to pay bills, nor the information needed. Nobody gets back to you when you submit a question. They don't upload your actual documents for the documents page. I can't see my xrays. Not pleased with this app.",
"My chart is very helpful. Since future appointments are included, I can always verify when and where. Appointment notes let me review what was discussed and use the app to ask followup questions .",
Good experience! the only problem is that I cannot do multiple deletions. It's a great application to communicate with my doctors.,
"Very informational, can do a lot of things with this app. Love it",
Easy app to use.,
Really great. Could probably benefit from a senior citizen version however as my grandmother struggles with its functionality.,
The apps great and very helpful,
"Good app, keeps me in connectuon with my team, and lets me check in for appointments without going to the check in desk. It's also a great way to communicate with your team and remember what happens next.",
Why do you have the feature to text the doctor about medical questions when they get mad and tell you to make an apointment.,
App is a good source of information,
It is a very thorough app. I can make doctor appointments through the app Email My Email my doctor. Keep track of my appointments,
My chart is the easiest to use of al medical portals. I'm on four. Only thing I'd like to do is correct medicine be as I've not been in some for a while. Also add to medical allergy lists to update Each doctor seems to have inaccurate items listed,
"Of all the medioapps I've used, this is far and away the worst design. The whole idea of having this app is to make life easier. I refuse to fill out all of this information simply to go for a routine office visit.",
Great tool to access my medical information and Doctors.,
"How to add a Dr into a contact list, I am not able to do this, the only Drs are the one that visited or done an online meeting. Appreciate your help",
I really appreciate that I can text my doctor's and get refills and view all up coming appointments and see my test results and read after visit summaries without having to go to the clinic and it's a more personalized way to stay in touch with the medical staff. Super convenient.,
Great to keep in touch with your doctor,
"Excellence, keep track of your FYI. SIMPLE TO FIND. THANKS 😊",
Love this app! Easy to use and very convenient,
Convenient as well as keeping me updated.,
"Works, but not the most user friendly. Some options are buried and difficult to find.",
"Easy to use, get updates on my test results, and let's you know when you have appointments. Very helpful app with lots of benefits. I highly recommend.",
"This app helps keep me up to date on everything medical with test results, appointments, and medications. After my health issues, I need this app to keep everything organized so I don't forget anything.",
I have access to all my health providers in one app.,
It's wonderful to get test results so fast,
This app is definitely a game changer. It allows you to not only be informed but stay consistently informed.,
easy to use. Get LGH Portal and Penn Medicine to seamlessly work together.p,
This app help me out a whole lot its amazing,
"Very friendly use interface. It has everything you need to schedule, cancel, and change appointments and view everything you need.",
"I just want to log in, in the past I logged in and then my providers show up, now it wants that first, but if it let me log in I wouldn't have to go thru this",
"This app has been so helpful. I am able to actively communicate with my medical providers, review medical appointments, notes, test results and more. I would highly recommend this app for accessing your health portal.",
Very easy to use and helpfull,
Runs slow can't use it often,
Love the convenience of being able to communicate with multiple providers and give access to coordinate my care.,
Easy access super easy to use love this app,
I love this app I can see upcoming apts and results from Dr visits . Awsome,
Absolutely love having full access to all my medical files.,
Clunky and hard to navigate,
Verifying each time becomes tiresome waiting for code.,
"This is the greatest app ever, I love how it connects me with every doctor in the BJC network",
Love it so easy to use and makes getting result so much better.I work at another hospital that has a portal and it is aweful.Your patient portal is so great thank you.,
I use the MyChart for my doctor's office and for CVS covid testing results. This app is easy to use and extremely convenient. I am able to ask questions of my doctor and generally get a less than 24-hour response.,
It's easy to use to refill ur medicine's and make appointments for doctors and read ur summary of what the doctor said bout ur visit and u,
This has made my life so much easier. Highly recommend,
This app has made taking care of my wellness needs so much easier. It allows me to manage my appointments and test results in seconds. Love it!,
Love love love this app! It is so convenient to manage medical appointments/test results/follow-up.,
"Love that I'm connected with all my doctors, I get test results as soon as they are ready and I get reminders for any appointments, I can request refills on medication I can ask any of my doctors questions, I can make payments in a secure way. I can also change or reschedule or cancel any appointment if I need to all on this app !! Plus I've got all my procedures and my health history with the doctors notes in one area and is always there if I need it !!!",
"This is an absolutely fantastic way of communicating with my doctor. It has test results almost immediately, it helps set up, and notifies me of, appointments. Now that I have it I would not want to be without it!",
I love it so easy to make appointments seeing test results,
I love MyChart! Using it is breeze. It's easy to navigate. Making appointments with my various healthcare professionals is a cinch. I highly recommend the app.,
I love this app! It is convenient and very helpful!!!!!,
I love MyChart I always had problems with iris acct. Ty,
It's Amazing helps me stay connected to our doctor and nurses!,
CT scan results were posted on My Chart within an hour of my test! Pre-register is helpful. As is confirmation of my appointments.,
I am very pleased with the service that I receive from my whole team. They are awesome and I feel very comfortable.,
"This app provides me extraordinary access to my health care team, appointments, contact information, Q&A, and other resources important to my treatments and recovery. I can't imagine how I'd function without it.",
Very well organized and helpful,
I can't see how to cancel and change appointments.,
Keeps me up-to-date with all appointments and results.,
Makes everything easier. 12/10,
Excellent way to keep up with appointments,
"Great program, getting better all the time.",
"I loveeee this app! It's very helpful for setting appointments, test results, medication refills! Game changer for sure!",
Love the App! Being able to talk to my doctor or another doctor directly is wonderful. Having access to notes they put in and test results is by far keeping me in check with my health and helping me ask the right questions when I am not sure.,
I find the app most convenient and easy to use. It allows me to keep in contact with my health care providers without the hassle of going through channels of red tape. Thanks 🙃,
"Can't get the app to work on my Android device no matter how many times in uninstall and reinstall or how I answer the prompts. I keep getting a ""Server List Error"".",
Cool features. But responses from staff have been passive aggressive and good stuff like that. I'll probably go back to calling pharmacy as to not get treated that way. App works. The human. Interaction part... Not so much,
This app supplies what most patients with long-term care have been looking for. Intuitive and simple to apply to any device. Thank You 👍👍,
Absolutely LOVE IT!!!,
Has been a real help especially when I got my prescription refilled that I had the doc call in and they sent it to a different cvs the app let me know exactly where my meds was at,
Can't sign Into it even with the current user name and resting the password twice. I tried calling customer service selected option 2 and it just kept repeating itself and still couldn't get ahold of nobody,
Excellent Service! Now I never miss an appointment. I can get and read my test results as soon as the very next day. I also can make appointments right from the app. Also send and receive messages from any one of my doctors. I'd be lost without it! Thanks for such a wonderful tool.,
"My Chart is wonderful. It's nice to be able to look & see your information at the touch of a button. Keeps you updated on your appointments, meds& everything you need to know. Thank You, E.Crisler.",
When I can use it works fine. But there are times when it won't open. Keeps saying connection error. I have internet but still have trouble with app sometimes.,
"Best ever to keep up with payments, correspondence with doctors or staff, test results posted same day (no waiting), renewal of prescriptions instantly. I am a patient of OSU since 2020 and used this app since then. No issues ever!!",
"App just keeps forgetting my credentials and sometimes straight up refuses to let me log in, have to reset my password every time I use it even though I write everything down and keep it in case I find myself forgetting as I don't use it every day.",
Terrific app ..easy to read & navigate.,
Nice to be able to get on app and get everything done I want for example set up booster shot for covid as well as set a appointment with my doctor at the same time I can see all test as soon as they are complete great app,
Audio on video visits is very poor. The constant echo on speech has made it impossible to continue with most sessions. Navigation of Mychart is awkward and doesn't use the same thought processes common to other on line businesses.,
"Like it very much. Have communicated with my primary. Much better than being on hold for 30 minutes plus. I can see my lab results, have learned when I need to be concerned and when not to.",
I love this app. User friendly. Interface is fantastic. I can access all my appointments info and I can precheck in before appointments. I can access my medical information. I highly recommend this app.,
Dr Rider and Nurse Joanne are always friendly and helpful.,
"This is the best app, when it comes to communication and information between you and your Doctor. Is so easy to set up, easy to navigate and use. I feel safe using it. Eliminate so much paperwork.",
I like having my test results and medical information in hand and not have to call and ask.,
"Unable to log in through the app, tells me my password is incorrect even though I'm able to log in just fine on PC. This has been a problem for almost a year.",
Great tool for keeping track of appts and test results. Or to leave messages. Able to check your history or look over notes from visits!,
"The one experience I've had with their remote visit was incredible. The doc was nice, and the process was quick and smooth.",
"I love having this app. It's very helpful for keeping track of doctor visits, test results, and meds. You can message your care team or request prescription refills. Very easy to use.",
Easier than going to an office everytime.,
"This is a very good ap. It keeps track of everything you need in o e place, all tests, immunizations, current medications, allergies, etc. It even alerts you if something is due (test).",
App worked fine until a few weeks ago. Now it just loads and won't let me in. Have done everything possible including getting ahold of tech support for my phone and still no fix. App is awful at this point.,
I enjoy being able to see my records it also helps me understand my medication I take,
"Worthless now. When I go to schedule, my provider is no longer there and when I search they are not listed...it gives me places in other states even when i search by my zip. Complete junk now!!",
Used to work decently. Now it force closes in many of the menus (esp billing) Found an old version (9.2.3) from apkmirror & everything seems to work fine. Hmm why break things?...,
"Love using the app...It's convenient, user-friendly and I'm able to get timely responses from my providers....",
"Good app. My only suggestion is to spread the numbers out a bit more where you enter the pin code to sign in, the numbers are too close to each other and keep pressing the wrong number at times.",
App is very easy to use and I had no problem and when I called customer service to get my MRN they were very polite and very prompt to get it and it was easy and quick!! Thank you very much!!,
"Has definitely made managing my appointments, records, and communicating much easier. Not to mention it's all in one place.",
I receive all my medical appointments in one place. Time saving and easy to use. Love having the ability to connect with my doctors and specialist all in one place.,
"I have been using MyChart for over a year. Recently it requires me to request a code after I have signed in, it is doing it each time and it is very annoying. How do I just sign in without the extra step of obtaining the code.",
Awesome. Very user friendly,
"My Chart is amazing. The results are on my chart before I leave the building and if I send a message, they get back to me within a day. Very prompt. I love how my family can go to my chart and see what's going on. Thank you for everything Reid.",
"Scattered functionality, keeps crashing on random messages. Not very useful at all. An example what an app should NOT be.",
"The app is very useful for looking up your medical history, but it's not very well written in the sense that if you go into a part of the app you can't get back to the home screen. You have to close the app and go back in",
Great app. Very organized. Very simple. Patient restricted from changing or removing photo from certain medical groups.,
App makes it easy to message my doctors and access labs. I have a lot going on and its nice to have everything centralized in an app for easy access.,
"This is an excellent software, easy to use, and it allows me to communicate easily with my doctor. And I like viewing test results almost instantaneously.",
Problems connecting with server. Only gives intermittent alerts. This used to be a reliable app but it's suddenly terrible.,
Everyone Should have My Chart Great App to Organize your Medical records and Appointments ❤️🩷💙💜🩵,
"Love this for making and keeping appointments, communicating with my doctor, getting test results quickly, refilling scripts, etc. I often get my reports the same day. Love it!",
"Update: Customer support helped resolve issue. Find the app very handy now. Doesnt work, wont allow log-in, does NOT send reset password or username reminder e-mails. Useless.",
"Easy to use for setting up appointments, messages with care providers, updating records, etc. I like that I can read information from my doctor visit as well.",
"It used to be easy to use, with clear indication of what to do. Now it is as clear as mud. I have no idea if my blood sugar and pressures are getting into the system. Back again, if I can find out how to properly exit this survey you might understand.",
"Super easy, very helpful. It is great to be able to review patient information clinical and non clinical with just a few clicks.",
"How useless. I cannot load test results or messages, the main reasons I need the app. It just stalls until it finally times out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it still hasn't solved this issue.",
"Total awesome I absolutely love it! You can get your test results in matters of hours whereas without it I'd have to wait days, weeks sometimes even a months also I can text the doc and receive a reply in hours!! Its wonderful",
This app is sometimes useful and sometimes worthless. It is not well coordinated with all of my providers who say they use it so then I have to connect through gmail. Just annoying!,
Worked well and now no push notification no text notifications. Help desk has no clue. There is a bug so someone needs to fix it.,
I received a message from the developer and was informed that my disappointment is more with my health care provider than the app. Otherwise the app contains useful features but it is frustrating to enter payment information every time.,
"This is a real convenient type of app that I've been enjoying ever since they got this app for their patients. Getting lab results,making appointments,etc is really a breeze and time saver.",
"It's easy to use, I really like this app.",
Very convenient! Can ask questions anytime!,
"Love the my chart app, just when I want to send an email it will automatically show the people, and I can't change it to someone else I need to send it to. I don't like that.",
HORRIBLE!!!! Everytime I try to sign up it keeps telling me they are experiencing problems. Can not communicate with third party. Everytime I try to sign up it ALWAYS FAILS!,
It is so good to actually see letters and results clearly and when you want. Fantastic idea I think it's the best thing for clarity and continuity of care.,
All of a sudden this app doesn't work. It continuously buffers & then the app closes. AppFlash keeps stopping and Market Feedback Agent doesn't work to send feedback.,
"It is an awesome way to keep track of appointments, medications and medical history. It is fast, easy and convenient. You can communicate with your doctor through the app, ask questions and set appointments.",
The latest update to the look of this app is poor. It is more difficult (time consuming) to get to what is being sought. I loathe having to start with a news feed on any app.,
"I find it very easy and so useful to check my appointments, send questions to my doctor and to see all necessary health and medical information in the chart. Really helpful to me.",
I cannot use the video to talk to my Doctor,
Great way to communicate with my health professionals,
It doesn't always want to load but it's what I use to keep all my medical stuff together,
"I generally really like this app, but this past week, I cannot get into it. Logging in via password or fingerprint, it says ""cannot communicate with server, try again later.""",
My chart app is great. Being a kidney recipient it is very important that Yale Transplant and my doctors have access to my medical records. My Chart app makes this possible and very easy to navigate.,
I can't even tell if this app is useful or not because it doesn't even allow me to log in and locks me out of my account everytime i try. I KNOW my log-in information is correct so this system itself needs to be fixed!,
So nice and everything get easier,
Just about worthless. Can't find where to update critical documents - like insurance card. Can't view any documents... Sends you notifications after the fact.. Can't pay on the app..,
"Barely even functional. The options for Healthcare providers is great, but I've tried getting it to send me an email to help me reset my password and I've received nothing.",
"Works fine at first, then every so often it says ""there was a problem communicating with the server"" then I have to remove it and call mychart support. Very irritating.",
"Always a fast easy way to get msgs back & forth to my Dr., Which is great seeing as how their answering service sucks! Lol I make my appts thru this app each time without having to wait on hold to maybe only even reach a voicemail service!",
Easy to use and very convenient. Love the app! Especially how it links your health information to other organizations for easier access.,
"Haven't been able to use the application. The message appears that there seems to be an issue with the server. This isn't true, the website works with no issues. Please correct the issue with the application",
My doctor and I have tried to get into my chart on my phone several times it refuses any and all access I have set it up three times with three different passwords and none of them I am done,
This is a well kept updated app. It's easy to navigate and make appointments. Thank you for making this an easier experience getting with doctor care.,
Easy to use. All your info right there.,
Impossible to login. The verification code email never to arrives (even in spam folder). So you try pressing the resend. Now the code arrives but it is expired. 🙄,
"It's gotten a lot better, but still doesn't let me access all the features I can access with my browser. It's such a pain that I normally don't use the app and use Chrome instead. I don't see any advantage to using the app.",
Exceptional App Easy to use complete medical history,
"Getting test results is OK individually with history plotting is nice, but it would help if there was an option to also results by order so that a series of tests can be easily taken to another doctor to avoid duplicate testing.",
It basically sucks but I was able to access a lot of my test results but not everything shows up. Only use on my tablet otherwise I can't even download the app. If you don't need it don't download.,
"I have no issue with the app. I like everything on it. Checking appointments, tests, results, all bills, meds etc. Great.",
Very informative information,
Locks up and won't let me exit or go back to main menu. Android version does not work well. No problems with my wife's Apple version.,
"This is fantastic, because I can see all my appointments, messages, emails to doctors and both different clinics/hospitals can see all my medical. No more refilling medical forms.",
"I have all my information right there at a click of a button. The best part is I don't have to keep track of anything. It's always there when I need it. It's more than just your health records, you can make appointment, order prescriptions, talk to you Dr. Or ask the staff about general questions. It's so convenient.",
This app is amazing!!! This app allows me to see all of my medical records and updated test results in real time.,
Worst app ever. Impossible to log in. It never lets me in. Please fix this! UPDATE. I was finally able to make contact with customer support for the MyChart app and I am now able to log in.,
Having to have multiple of the same app. One for each organization even if you link them sucks ALOT & is VERY confusing!! But otherwise one of the best & most useful apps ever!!!!,
"Can't read the covid 19 information It's not in English Why is it not in English... Why do I have to reach out to a local health dept. Most people in the Country speak and understand. English...Even Spanish people... And the people that have differant types of ins. Pay your ""organization"" like me. How about you get new job.",
"Just updated the app and nothing seems to work - all i get is system error message, something about their server. Will check back in a day or two to see if its been fixed",
Love it! All my info is there and very convenient,
My account is not updated. Its from 2021. Misrepresents the ability to message your Dr,
"Supposed to be able to schedule appointments through the app, but when i click schedule an appointment i can't get past the spinning before it throws me back to the page asking me if i want to schedule an appointment.",
The iPhone version is great. However the Android version is missing navigation buttons in several places so I have top log out top go back to the main page.,
Very user friendly! Also super convenient and efficient way to communicate with physicians and/or schedule office visits. Love this app!,
"Very useful tool.. my insurance is Anthem and the only issue I have is them showing what I have paid.. not sure If I should pay anthem or each dr.. and that would require me keeping a log on what i paid who I paid and How I paid it, credit card or back account.. but the my chart app I great..",
Glitchy. Letters disappear. Make sure to get screen shots anytime you get a letter you want to save as they will randomly disappear.,
"This has been an amazing way to contact my doctors, keep track of important appointments, medications, and have questions answered without waiting 30min on hold with the office; and maybe getting a reply within a day or two. Great app!!",
Awesome! So easy to navigate!,
The updates from your office visit to the MyChart app are real slow to update. And the messaging to your provider is at times REALLY SLOW to get a response back from them. The MY CHART app. is way more frustrating to use than the Follow My Health app previously used with my provider,
"Great! Very helpful and easy to use. I use it review appointment notes & lab results, to request refills, and communicate with my healthcare provider. Very good app!",
This has been a god send since haven't been able to drive in at the least the last 2 years and transportation has been a big problem.,
"I sent an important message on Essentia MyHealth via MyChart, but it never got to MyHealth. I didn't check on the app until it was too late to reach anyone. My message shows up on MyChart, but not Myhealth. I am deleting this app from my phone.",
Easy to use and very informative,
"This is the most useful app on my phone. All my info in one place and the fastest way to ask questions and get them answered. Also, the ability to easily schedule an appointment is a very valuable tool and much appreciated. Highly recommend it.",
"What happened? Can't access my information. I can login but all the links send me to external sites. Why the dramatic change? No test results, no appointment scheduler, nothing is there. Please bring back the old version.",
It is an easy app to understand and maneuver around. It has beeb a lifesavers for me and my Doctor's. I'm always connected to any of my Doctor's and pharmacy and appointments with a single app. All my appointments and meds and Doctors easy to get to were ever i am .,
"App is clear and efficient, giving access to medical files and enabling easy contact with care providers. Customer service resolved a navigation issue (swipe) quickly. Good stuff.",
"Everytime I try to log in, an error message pops up. It says there's a communication error with the server. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I have the same issue.",
Everything was great and then an update happened and I cant get the medication list to pop up which means I cant get my refills. It's doing the same thing with appointment scheduling. It's a pain.,
"Can't get in, just says couldn't load terms and conditions at this time. Tried on my gfs IPhone, did the same thing there too. Edit; had to use the desktop website in order to get passed the terms and conditions that was crashing the app. Better now",
"Best system to keep track with appointments, test results and communication with the different doctors through email. Really like the system...can see it anywhere and so can the doctors..",
"Cannot login, there us an issue w/the app it is stuck loading. I try to log in w/my password but it states there is a communication problem & 2trt again, later.",
Love it!! So easy to use and get all your medical info appointments messages etc all in one App. Very easy to read and understandable.,
"I love it. It is very useful and easy to make and change appointments, send messages to your doctor, check lab results. Its all in one place very convenient.",
"As an IT developer for 45 years, I've learned to appreciate well designed apps. This is one of the best. It's reliable, well organized and easy to use.",
I LOVE 💕🥰🥰🥰 MY APP !! It's always accurate and it always on time when it comes to messages from my doctor's or appointments and my test results if I have something to show them like if I was in the hospital I can take pictures and send it to them .. I love my doctor's they are so sweet 🥰🥰.. I love this app because I can make or cancel appointments and do video chats due to COVID... I just love it 🥰,
Every time I attempt to use a password to access this app my phone goes into freeze mode I end up having to call 911 which does nothing to help me unlock my phone beware trying to install this app you may have to replace your phone as for medical services I still have not accessed my chart Because this review is negative my phone again has lock me out I have nothing else to do but complain,
Very helpful for me to keep up with my latest medical tests & drs appts,
"Best Medical App I've Used Ever! Well organized, pleasant to look at, various links available for explanations of procedures, keep track of current medications, can sign in biometric, pay a bill ( I never do! Lol )...Thumbs up to Developer!!",
"I had no trouble, setting up the account or accessing it either. I complemented the staff on how quickly the information was updated after two procedure, a test or a visit. Much better than St Luke's process.",
"This app is so easy to use. I like being able to set up appts, get test results, and look back on info from visits. You can also pay your bill so quickly. I use this app everything I need to see my doctor.",
Awful. Access it through cvs app. Once logged out can't get back into cvs app. Then when you want to go into cvs it goes directly to MyChart. Stuck in a never ending loop.,
Update makes it so now I can no longer view any documents. I now have to download the entire file and then it says that there was an error downloading and the file can't be viewed.,
"Supposed to be able to access covid 19 testing results, 10 tests over 2 years. Got 3 results of those tests via the app. 30% success rate is not great especially for this type of app.",
Wouldn't let me log in then when I tried recovering my user name and password which was the same as I entered I tried again and now my whole account has been deactivated and I have to call some B.S. number which is just a unknown voicemail...like when you call it it just says you have reached a mail box please leave a message...no discription of who I'm calling..and it's been 2 days without a word back....just don't do it!,
This site is down more than it is active. Not pleased at all.,
LOVE THIS APP!! Easy to use. Very informative. I love being able to contact any of my doctors and this app makes it very easy to get your meds refilled. This app does it all. I would truly be lost without it... Thank you for all of your help...,
"Not enough words in any vocabulary, or time in the day, to describe to you exactly how much I absuolutely love this app. It is perfect, and I wouldn't change a single thing. Master piece among masterpieces.",
It is an amazing experience !thank you developer for making it simple and easy now i get to see everything in one place My Chart ! Amazing.,
"Love this app ,convenient, easy to use, very helpful when needing to refill medicine, make appointments, test results,and anything else needed to do with your medical needs. Best app to have.",
"This is one of the apps that I find very useful and time saving for me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be more in control of your Dr. Appointments, any med refills , or any upcoming lab work.",
"Great app, I get to see everything the doctor sees as far as tests, visits, messaging, prescriptions and notes about my visits immediately. Usually I see test results before the doctor. It's perfect so far.",
Too many people logging on is causing issues with getting on. Need bigger or better servers and all my medical records are not there because they say they're too old to update. All is fixed. Support was extremely helpfull,
Old app. More user friendly. Easier to find longer lists of appointments covering several months. Not just one month at a time .,
Everything in one place! As a cancer patient I have a lot of appointments and medications. My chart keeps everything organized. I can even request perscription refills! A great App!,
"There's no way to update your own medical information, like current medications, in this app or the site. Depending on the provider using MyChart, even if you can edit your own medications, they can require they approve them before changes are reflected, and as expected, no one ever monitors medication change requests :) Also, there's no way to easily export data, like in CCDA format.",
I love that I can access my medical information and updates on upcoming appointments and information that is needed to transport to other physicians that need information from my past history so that makes it so much better and easier so that you don't have to travel everywhere to get this information you just easily pull it up and send it to the other physician or specialist that needs your info ASAP so thank you very much for making this easy for all who are unable to travel and do all of that,
Enables me to see all test results and review past test results. Appointment reminders are great. All my medical information is handy and available whenever I need. These is a great tool.,
Excellent app for med records quickly 😁. Great way to correspond with your medical staff and get test results quickly. Also great for getting refills sent to your pharmacy quicker. Can't say enough good about this app!,
It's wonderful! Many times I have gotten MRI or bloodwork results before getting home. My Dr.'s and I can contact each other through this app. without bothering anyone else. With MyChart I always have my med. list with me as well as all test results.,
I love having my.medical information available on my phone. Also love the messaging feature. It gives me a chance to give my care providers a heads up for any particular issues that need to be dealt with ahead of time.,
"Used to work just fine, now it keeps saying there is a newer version of mychart and I have to download that, I don't see any other version of mychart, and I'm using the latest updated version.",
"Used to work great on both laptop and Android phone. Still okay, not great on laptop even with rearranging the website BUT the Android app only gets "" Cannot connect to Server"" for weeks now.",
"Absolutely Great! MyChart is a wonderful app! Its easy to use and I get reminders, visit summaries, and test results! Also, I can check on referrals, billing statements and more! Thank you♡",
"Very nice to be able to check lab and test results on ""My Chart"". Helps me to keep track of all my appointments. I like this app very much.",
Very easy and convenient to use,
"Accurate, quick, test results, easy messaging to my doctors, new mychart looks nicer, more options to share medical info. with other providers. Easy appt. scheduling.",
"This is such an amazing app. There are changes I would add, but overall it has been a life saver when other doctors have immediate access to your chart if you are having an immediate need.",
Exceptional and easy to use.,
When it works it rocks but when it doesn't it's a headache. I prefer just removing the App and going online. The error message is now consistently not working.,
"I love being able to message with my providers. However, most anything else has to be done by going to the website. The app won't open a number of items & it's frustrating!",
This is sure has been a great help. Being able to receive test result and also ask questions to my Dr has helped ease up on stressing and worrying. For me this is a big plus. Thank you. You have a great team of medical providers. You're awesome.,
I love being able to go to myChart. It's great,
MyChart provides an excellent platform for patients to keep abreast of their medical status and allows access to their medical records. It even makes it possible to communicate directly with their physicians. Great App!,
"I accidentally removed the widget to MyChart and need to get it back. Though it was logged into with my local email provider, not my Gmail account. I sure hope you can help me. Thanks but I asked my Dr to send a link for the app to my email. It was taken care of the next morning",
"No issues with this app at all! It's easy and super convenient to access my info, to message the doc, to set up an appt, to complete questionnaires, and more.",
"So convenient...I never have to call the doctor's office for anything. If I have a health concern I simply send whichever doctor (PC, OBGYN, Dermatology, etc.) a message & they send one back soon after. There just so much you can do with this App.",
"My app is completely not working as of today. It's asking me to search for my organization (UCLA), huge well known hospital. Showing no results. Also searching all of CA. No results.All my previous information seems to be gone.",
Easy to use and practical to have everything in one place,
This is a great way to speak to your doctor one on one my husband has it and we both are very impressed,
"Awesome App. I was getting my lab test results, while in hospital, before my doctors were. I love having all my medical information in one very handy place. Big help when filing for social security. Can send and receive messages and share your medical files with anyone you wish. Excellent App!",
"I am unable to access the app it keeps saying there is an error with my login, however I can access it online with the very same password. It has worked perfectly up until this week.",
There seems to be 2 versions of the myDH cart and application. Which ever it is they both work as intended and have had no errors or crashes.,
Overall MYCHART is great. The only feature that Montefiore needs to improve is the pre-checkin. If you use it the staff is unaware and get irate when you show them the bar code to scan.,
I enjoy the app a lot it is very useful,
It's so nice to be able to have all my records in one place and my doctor's can see things that were done at other locations who also use this database. So I don't have to keep up with tons of paperwork to bring to every appointment.,
"Confusing security settings for different institutions. Support doesn't respond. Missing attachment bug (listed but cannot download) reported, no response. Can't reset password for one institution. Seriously?",
"I like how it keeps all my medical information at my hands also making appointments is very easy, referrals are easy to look up and and handle it ,the only thing is I wish my new medical had my chart I have to use another app and it's harder to use than my chart.",
Dosent work. I choose my provider and it never goes any further than that. It keeps telling me to switch organizations?!?! Not helpful at all. uninstalled immediately.,
Very easy to use and informative.,
"Great app if the hospitals etal use it correcly. Loyola Chicago uses it well, on the other hand Northwestrrn makes you jump through hoops.... It's not the apps fault, it's the person's who test the software on their iPhone and only iPhone.",
This tool is beyond compare. The ability to keep all of my different doctors in sync reminders for my refills and reminders for my appointments is unparalleled.,
The app doesn't work. So I deleted it. I resorted to manually logging into Parkland website. Their website is unstable but it actually works. That's more than I can say for this app.,
Works well. Needs to let patients dismiss reminders that don't apply. For example I got a mammogram and a CT scan but the system still thinks I need them.,
"Please fix the issues with this app. When I go to eCheck-in, it says it has moved and when I click the link, it can't connect. I'm not sure what type of update was done, but you should have left it alone.",
"I love it ..!! Its perfect easy to understand, you can check in before you have the appointment and any test they do on you , you can see the result fast .. I definitely recommend Thanks☺",
Super useful and user friendly. Highly recommend for helping keep track of things and making communication with providers worlds easier.,
"Satisfied. Easy enough to use. I struggled a bit figuring out the organization that my provider was affiliated with, but after figuring that out using the app was straightforward.",
Life changing everything you need at your fingertips even if you're forgetful you will always get a notification and it's all there in my chart very easy to use and great way to keep up with your health concerns,
"I need to add another child to my account and can NOT figure it out. Very frustrating. Other wise, I do love that I can see test results/doctors notes right away.",
"I love this app! I can see everything about my appointments, lab results, and messages from my doctor. It's easy to use, and I've never encountered an issue since using it for the past 5 years.",
I loved this app but now it won't let me log in. It keeps saying there's a problem communicating with the server and to try again later. I've deleted and reinstalled it multiple times and still nothing 😔,
"App is great, but whenever I try to attach documents in messages my provider says they can't get them to openon their end. I've tried as PDF and Word doc, theycan never open them.",
"Up to now it was working, but now I am really disappointed and annoyed, I wasted my time to reset password, then received a code, in order to get it I left site so now with new code I lost spot where I was and ...... here we go starting over and getting nowhere. I do not care to have my chart . Much better the old way, call me if you need to communicate with me!!",
"This app is great! You can message with your Dr., request refill, see your lab results, get your referrals and many other other very useful tools to have in one spot. So if your provider is linked with MyChart, I highly recommend it, you won't regret it.",
Very weak app. Sends a message stating it is having difficulty getting information. No description of what or where from. Does not offer enough control to user.,
"Good all in one app for tracking your health. Check test results, make doctor appointments, message your health team. Been using it for a few years now with no complaints.",
"Epic/ MyChart is wonderful! Easy to navigate and I can email my doctors and their staff and get a quicker response than trying to call! All of my medical records, tests results, etc all in one place! Absolutely love this!",
Hate online stuff. Have to remember passwords as auto fill isnt available. I find it a real unpleasant chore to use.,
"This app allows me to be more in charge of my healthcare (through Essentia Health) by giving me the ability to view test results, schedule appointments, message my doctor and healthcare team, and manage my children's checkups. Using this app has vastly improved the Essentia experience.",
Please PLEASE provide a FULL expanded receipt for any payments made in the app. Or email it. SOMETHING. I've had my card locked so many times and now every itemized receipt I have requested has never made it to me.,
"If you need to make appointments; or check on lab tests results, or even ask your doc a question ;this is the app to use. What ever the need is; you will receive an answer soon! The best thing that came out from carilion is my chart! Love this app!",
"PITA don't use it. Constantly logs you out simply because you wanted to use data on a different screen that should available. Serious question, do the programmers ever use this app? It would appear they don't.",
Love the fast access to my medical records. Don't like how doctors can make changes to notes without giving any rhythm or reason for it because it causes confusion. I mean it is my LIFE they comment ON most of the time.🙃,
"It could be great, but once you actually have numerous tests from several hospitals and practitioners, the information doesn't sync properly.",
"Normally I don't have issues with the app, but for 2 days now it's saying ""server issues try again later"" I really need to get into it, considering there are messages I need to retrieve concerning my upcoming surgery. PLEASE FIX",
MyChart has been awesome for scheduling appointments and seeing all of my medical records when I need them. Bill pay through the app is also very handy and easy.,
Keep getting an error message stating unable to contact server. I've tried installing and re installing the app and it still does not work.,
"I enjoy having the appt. I however don't see my personal health care inputted, they like to message and show scheduledvisit plus test results the most. I feel all information should be listed,in case it's needed for my benefit..I mean it's mychart.....right??",
Very helpful with all issues and information concerning my Health care. Keep up the excellent work.,
"I keep having the same message, that i need to review and update my contact and personal information. I did that. Why wont it go away. At least put a submit button somewhere. Please fix this problem. My information is the same as it was before i got this message.",
Very ready up navigate. Very easy to get prescriptions refilled. Very easy to see up coming appointments and tests that are due. Great way to get access to test results like blood work test results.,
"Good app. Had trouble using it to pay a bill - there is no ""SUBMIT"" button after entering cc info. Needs a repair/update to the app. Made payment on my computer instead.",
I LOVE IT! EASY TO USE. TIMELY RESPONSES FROM DOC WHEN I HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. ALL MY INFO AT MY FINGERTIPS!,
"Very helpful app, helps a lot, all my info at my fingertips, love being able to fill out paperwork in advance, message my providers, schedule appointments, etc. Very good app",
"Requiring Chrome for video calls is simply unforgivable. If you can't figure out how to do it in-app, then it should work on ALL modern browsers.",
Makes things so much easier!!!,
The app originally was awesome. very convenient. The app is no longer functioning or opening on my Samsung 8. Please fix. I would love to continue to use it.,
Mostly a great app but anytime I try to use my fingerprint to login it crashes. Also should have buttons for navigating between screens (a back button mostly).,
"Easy to use, message your doctors easily and get faster, more personal responses! I love how it keeps track of all my appointments, past and future, as well as my test results and medications.",
"I loved this app until they started trying to segregate my twelve-year-old from me. I live in Nevada, not California. He has mental health issues , but supposedly, he is supposed to go into doctor's appointments and everything else on his own at 12 years old and not allow. Me to have any say in any of it. He's 12. He don't have that say, and what you guys are doing by segregating the parents and telling the parents they can't take care of their children is wrong.",
"Great for looking up things in the past, but the here and now, not so much. Trying to schedule an appointment and the only options it gives me is to schedule a flu shot or a mammogram.",
"After setting a username and password, the app would not let me in. when I tried the ""forgot password"" link it would not accept my information. App eventually locked up. Called CVS and no one answers the phone.",
"Not able to log into the app. Contacted technical support they advised it's an app developer issue as I can log into the site from the webpage. I'd rather use the app, hopefully it will work soon",
"App full of bugs and crashes. Can't view present or past appointments. Crashes when try to view the billing section. This up is ""partially functional""",
Great for staying in contact with my and Evan's UCSF medical teams!,
"I love My Chart... I forget a lot these days and I can just pop on make an appointment pop off. Look @ my med list, read messages, look back @ notes. Keep everything health in it. Very efficient and time conservative.",
App continously states there's a server error!!!! Fingerprint communication error!! No ise having an app one cannot access. There's also no where to access any help :(,
App works well with some major functionality. However small issues with various secondary operations such as: referrals from doctors don't show up on main menu.,
"When the app did work, it was useful....updated it about a month ago and now it won't work at all...cant log in, so its just taking up space on my phone. What a disappointment.",
"LOVE being able to view all my lab results, as a RN I enjoy being able to review them ASAP myself. Plus all the notes, etc. NOT to mention the ability to communicate one-on-one with the doctors",
This app is just wonderful. Very easy to navigate and has been a blessing to have during covid. A very easy way to stay up to date with your doctor without an appointment.,
Password verification is sent long after timeout. Have tried 4 times and each time it fails. Other emails are flowing fine so it's not my connection.,
"Nice app, but whoever did the programming needs to experience the ride. Nothing like being told by the app to arrive at 7AM for an 8:30AM appointment. Had to get up at 5AM so as to leave by 6AM so as to be at my screwed up appointment time. And then to be told that it was a known issue. It is now 8:30 and I am still waiting. Arrived WAY before anyone else, and all who came after have long gone in. Getting ready to leave and come back some other time.",
"Easy to use, good for getting results and letters as soon as possible. Great for communicating and for reminders of upcoming appointments.",
"Very good way to connect to my doctor's, as long as they us it also. I can ask questions from my doctor, it always has an updated list of my medications, I can do virtual visits with my doctors, it has a list of my up coming doctor visits and a current list of the results of my blood tests.",
"This is an Excellent app! It Shows your test results before they even call you. It's Definitely a great app to use for your medical history! I would totally recommend, my doctor suggested this to me and I love it!",
"I haven't been able to login to the app in months. Like others, I am getting the error problem communicating with the server. This sucks because I used to check-in to my appts using my phone. :(",
This is an excellent app. I get results from medical tests and referral approvals so quickly! I can also contact my doctor easily via messages. It truly brings provider/patient relationships into the 21 century!,
Everything at your finger tips makes getting all your info easy and less work for those who need to concentrate on helping the patient . Great Job!!!,
Hard pressure on the keyboard is a must to enter information.,
Easy-to-use. It's and easier way of viewing my information on my appointments. I can also send messages to my doctors. But what I like the best is the how easy it is to order my medicine. They even have an option of sending it to your house and that's where I receive my medicine at home.,
Very helpful tool in keeping appts. Seeing tests that have been done helps to keep on track of things. It gives you a summary of the appts which is nice to have.,
"In the age of Covir19 be able to have a video appointment is almost a necessity since I have an Autoimmune Neuro-muscular condition. Also, communicating with my cellphone and using a 4 digit login is a joy. I highly recommend your site.",
Was great. Now nothing ever works. Just keep getting a pop up banner that says there's an error with the server and it cycles back to the home screen.,
"It's great to be able to send messages, see test results. Everything my chart is about is helpful in everyway.",
"Great, wonderful, some information semi-incorrect. It is able to be corrected and communicated properly. Face to face information can be explained in a scientifically probability of 99.9%.",
Symptom checker is not working. Also very hard to find a location. Default is Iowa and is slow to move.,
Easy to access and understand,
"No network connection - error msg. My phone and app are up to date, I have 5G & wifi, all other apps and calls work. My chart isn't recognizing this.",
Not sure how to make a payment when I don't want to pay balance in full but to pay on balance. Not easily explained and I will have to call it in. This so far is my only problem otherwise I like the features.,
"I generally have not had a great experience using the MyChart App. Today I tried several times to cancel an upcoming appointment using MyChart but nothing seems to happen when I press the ""Cancel Appointment"" button after entering my reason and details.",
Can't erase old messages. App has limited use. Can't do anything other than what they choose,
The app is really nice and easy to use. Really convenient! I love how I can check the summary of the visit almost immediately after the appointment electronically.,
Very helpful and efficient app.,
App would be great if the information was shared with registration. I find myself having to supply the same info over and over again. Intake personnel state that they cannot see the info yet it is in my chart.,
"This app is wonderful! So efficient. As a patient with chronic illness I often have a hard time keeping up with life. This app really helps me keep control of what I need to know, and helps me better follow the instructions provided by the doctor.",
First off they want too much personal information they want too much access than my phone I'm not comfortable with somebody running around in my phone with free access to everything when I did try to log in it told me to call a phone number so I can get an access code via email I thought man that's too much information they want and it's a pain in the ass so I backed out,
"The app works as it says, I can contact my Doctor's, see test results, and keep track of billing. Only negative is sending my blood sugar log as an attachment in messages. Hopefully this option will be added soon.",
Navigation around the site can at times be complicated and not friendly. Bill paying is still treated as a high priority.,
All I wanted to know was the result of my Covid test. Just an email or text would do. Instead I get gobbly-gook about loading apps that did not load. Frustrated and still do not know my test results.,
I used this app all of the time and really liked it but now for the past few days I get a prompt saying there was a problem communicating with the server try again later I have tried for 3 days and get same result.,
"Love this app, I'm able to communicate with my doctors and manage my appointments. I see my results and when I to another doctor if they are not a part of my chart I'm able to show them what's going on with me. My doctors are able to see what each doctor is doing and see what they need to do in their expertise area to rule out any other health concerns",
I truly believe this app is absolutely amazing to say the very least. I've been using it for several years now and find it alot easier than calling the office trying to speak with an actual person.,
My daughter and I both have a my chart I love it as a patient and a mother it makes making appointments easier you don't have to wait in line or on hold and they useally get back in a timely manner with in a day most of the time and I have test results in hours. Love this app,
It's an invaluable tool to have when your family has a lot of medical issues. Everyone's records right at your fingertips. Easy to contact providers and get quick results to diagnostic tests.,
Asked a question about how to switch/add a different hospital using this app and it took their support group over 3 months to finally respond.... I was able to figure it out well before then... app does work okay but hopefully you'll never need their customer support....,
This App is still not working. When is it going to be fixed. It keeps saying cannot communicate with the server. I removed My Chart and reloaded it. It still doesnt work.,
Some test results are not viewable in the app but it asks you to download them so you can view them. Otherwise app is easy to use and very useful,
It would be helpful if people could actually view their messages instead of just watching the loading circle spin until you get the error message.,
This app is good but you need an option to allow printing of letters or documents from the app. I have had to jump through hoops to print.,
Very easy to use and navigate. I now have access to my healthcare records and my childrens which is helpful. Being able to email my providers is wonderful too.,
Constantly getting error reports.,
I love how quick and Easy it is to access everything for me and my children for our medical needs and records,
"The ""new and revised"" version has a few little bugs but is still pretty easy to use and way better than spending time on the phone waiting to get to the right person.",
"Well, I was very pleased with everything about this app. Extremely helpful to me. But, suddenly today I opened My Chart to view and the fingerprint sensor disappeared from the app. What happened?",
Down in the left corner of the app on the front page where everything is listed your name is there plus the number of things you're supposed to look at well no clue on where to look for them because I clicked on everything and anything that was highlighted was checked and then it would come off that list but I can't find all the remaining ones cuz everything I find is totally checked off?? My name is there and a number there is nowhere that tells me what the definition for what that is on the ap,
The app use to work. Now it doesnt let me log in at all. It had me set up a passcode for quicker login. However that doesnt pop up. I also cant log in with user name.,
"I would be lost without this. It adds my Drs appts right to my phone calender (which I have more than I'm proud to admit), I can message my PCP about anything!, Pay balances.....it's just made medical issues easier to deal with and keep track of my own progress.",
"I love this app. It works very well and I haven't had any issues with it. It is convenient to check appointments, test results, messaging doctor and other of other things.",
"Any Hospital not using a system like this in today's medical system needs to evaluate why they are not. It makes communicated with your doctor super easy and efficient. Scheduling is very easy, and seeing your labs and trends in those labs is awesome.",
LOVE this app. Has been very valuable to being in contact with my physicians in getting answers to my health quicker. Making appt. Setting up appt & asking questions. I like that they are Always looking for ways to improve your experience I using the app.,
"MyChart is great! It's unfortunate that we have (at least) 2 MyChart ""servers""...I wish I could unify my logins. The next time I went to my Dr. appt...they helped me get this set up. So now it's just one login (essentially)",
Very impressed with how easy this app makes reporting your condition back to the health service. At first I rolled my eyes at having to use it but now I really enjoy it. Highly recommended!,
"This is Great!!! I love having all mine and my family's health info at my finger tips. I had questions & got answers quickly. You can be reminded of apointments, vacinations, and past due health checks. All my Dr.'s Nurses and Specialists in one place. I can make apointments , Request refills or get a consultation.and see it anywhere Home, Work or on the Go Its awesome",
"Absolutely love how easy I can magae my appoinments, medication, reminders. Even getting a hild of a nurse or my dr is easy with this app!! All my test results comw right up in my phone. Very easy to use.",
I love having access to my children's records when I need them. Easy to navigate and switch between providers and children. Highly recommend!,
"It helps with communicating with your health people, I really like being able to get in touch, because their phone connections center just don't work well.",
Just unistalled it and reinstall it again for issue with connection with the server. Problem is solved. Please try to remove the OPT once authorization by finger print is being set.,
"Excellent Application. User friendly. It's great to have access to your health records along with appointments past and future, doctors notes and test results. I love the ability to message my doctor or his care team for anything ❤️",
"I love Mychart its very easy to use and I can send a message to any of my Doctors at any time. I can request medication or make an appointment. It also reminds me of up coming appointments, lab tests and other helpful reminders.",
MyChart is not needed for telehealth as cell phones already have phones and even video (Facetime or Duo) built in. MyChart merely serves to complicate an otherwise simple process for the patient. Stop!,
Helps me with all my medical needs. Keeps me up to date and on track,
"I have changed my password more times than is reasonable. This app keeps throwing out previous,or I should say active logins and passwords, so all I get out of this is Late information and Much frustration!!",
"After reading the numerous ""cridical"" reviews, I downloaded it anyways-Hey, you can always uninstall it, right? Well, I might have to! My ""primary health care is'nt even listed in the options. The first thing you will notice when you first open the app is it wants to know what your primary health care provider is. Well in San Francisco I could only find 3 health care providers listed!!! Seriously??? In San Francisco??? And I cant even say everything I want to say cause of 500 word limit!!!!",
"0 to 4, depending on how aggrivating it is to determine which of the four logins I have to use. At least I think it's four. Privacy is one thing, this is something else. Probably entirely specified by HIPPA. Grrrrr.",
Updated app and constantly getting server errors. Too slow also. Cannot bring up information about bills. The app is more than happy to take my money but never wants to bring up a bill for review.,
"The app is super spotty. Most times, it won't bring up my information, it just loads forever. But when it works, it's really helpful to have my health data in one place.",
"I see potential, but I first thing I tried to do was add new payment method and got Webpage Not Available error. No way around it. My payment is due on 2/22. I hope you fix this error before then.",
I love MyChart it's very helpful,
"Was a good app, until the update. Now I can not view my test results. Tried downloading a file viewer, now it tells me there are no results. Deleted this app its useless to me now.",
"No help screen at all. Tiny print on many screens, I have covid test results that are over 1 1/22 years, but can't delete them!",
"Login is a disaster. I had to create a user name so I used my name, which is longer than 20 letters and it would not accept it on my phone, so I went home and figured it out on my laptop, then I tried to login on my phone and it locked me out due to the fact that it would not take my username. Now I can't figure out how to unlock it and I have covid results pending, so I can go back to work. Beyond frustrating. I'm so sick of websites.",
"Its a great app to make my appointments, send messages to my health team, & get my test results with PCP explainations. Easy to navigate, update my information, do echeck-in, recieve and respond to my arrival. I also like being able to share my records with my other doctors.",
"This app is a lifesaver for me. I can check past, current & future appointments and lab results with ease. No more losing written down information. Wonderful especially during Covid.",
"It's nice and convenient but if you don't have insurance that covers the absurd virtual appointments ($29 each time for me) you are stuck with absolutely no way to reasonably get in touch with your doctor unless they call you. Then, each doctor treats you with no understanding and refuses to help in ways a standard doctor would, especially if you contact them via message. They are abusing the outbreak to make money hand over fist on the back of us being concerned about hurting other people or our livelihoods. Delete this app as soon as quarantine is done and work with a local provider.",
Way too difficult to set up. Would be nice if it were seemless with FollowMyHealth. I could not get successfully installed an operating. I use FollowMyHealth all the time especially to email my PCP. Now I cannot because of this app.,
I love this app. I use it for my entire family and it's very nice to have everyone and everything in one place. Having a family that has several appointments it is very nice to be able to schedule the appointments online. I like being able to email my providers too.,
"It's pretty good and has been getting better. You may still have to switch between organizations and look for stuff in two places, but if you're patient it has everything.",
I love the MyChart app. It makes it so easy to ask my primary doctor questions and receive quick replies. It's a great communication tool with quick test results posted. Coni Statz.,
So glad our health system switched to the epic. Everything seems pretty easy to navigate. Results are coming in pretty quickly. The best part is your discharge instructions are all uploaded online as well. Love Epic and MyChart.,
"This is simply great. It is easy to use, you can see everything medical that concerns you. You can also connect with other providers through the app. It's awesome!!!",
Does not recognize your password. Won't even send a verification email to you when you request it zero Stars. Worst app ever.update can't even get in touch with support if I had to depend on this app I'd be dead,
"Leaving messages for my doctors is so easy with this app. Refills, making appointments, looking at test results, paying your bill ... everything is so easy to do and is all wrapped up in this app.",
"This app is great except that you can't get rid of reminders and they are obnoxious. I am getting ""reminded"" to do things that don't apply to me or that I don't want to see and I am unable to hide, dismiss, or get rid of that section all together",
Do not use the message function No one answers Drs do not know how to do the job without the app,
So nice and easy to use I love it,
"I work in IT.....with medical records. For scheduling appointments, sending messages, etc, it's fine. For getting/viewing medical records, it's a turd.",
"Appreciate the info available, and the the site is easy to navigate. But the site is slow and has often had server errors.",
"My health center keeps all of my information, test results, future appointments, and prescriptions all in one app. Been using this app for over a month, and so far, I really like it.",
"It's definitely a great opportunity to keep up with your PCP, test results etc! This is soo much needed for all!! No pop up ads is great! Thank you!",
Ever since this last update. I can't log in. It says my password and my username is incorrect. And it's been the same for a year. I have severe medical issues. Sometimes I can't use my voice. I need this app and I can't use it.,
The app is very easy to navigate. I like it a lot.,
It's not really that useful it seems you can access important scan information or link other medical records. Basically only messages about appointments are the only thing it's useful for.,
The app doesn't even let you sign in regardless of whether or not the login is put in correctly. There is more functionality from the webpage and that's limited.,
"This app is great for anyone who wishes to be able to view medical history in one place. In addition, you're able to set appointments and receive reminders. I love the fact that I can message my doctor. I just love it!",
"App is very stupid re location. Demands location access, then assumes current location is where health provider is located. Cannot use app while on travel! DUMB!!!",
Makes keeping up with all health data an easy task. All Covid info as well as diagnostic and test results are also right at your fingertips on the app.,
I love having all my medical history in one place. I can ask questions about anything that is in my chart right inside the app. It makes things easier when seeing a new doctor like today since I didn't have to fill out any paperwork.,
"Not impressed. Before logging in, app asks for my provider. But my provider is not one of the options. When I select the ""not listed"" option I get a server error.",
This is a great service. I enjoy being able to leave a message for my doctor without speaking to 2 or 3 peope first. It is also nice to refer to previous stats from blood work and other test results when I need to.,
"Absolutely terrible. Slow, clunky and counterintuitive. Again, Google, we REALLY need to be able to choose ZERO stars.",
everytime I try to look at my billing it tells me that an error has occurred or it can't connect to the server and goes back to the previous screen please fix.,
"This is an excellent app to use for reference! Test results, upcoming appointments and multiple hospital records are just some of the features I wish I had known about it sooner!",
"Fairly easy to navigate. Could be easier to track meds. Would also be great to store insurance info, and communicate better between Doc and patients.",
The new update is making the app unusable. I restarted the phone and redownload the app but it's runs slowly and the medication tab won't load. Now I'm going to have to spend time and call the doctor.,
Love having all my information available on my phone.,
Who in the hell would make up an app that people can't use except that your technician. You need to go back and fix your app and test it to make sure it's user-friendly and it works. Instead of having morons for doing nothing,
"Peehaps it's me, but I find it difficult to use the app or where I need to go in the app to find what I'm looking for. I don't seem to have issues with other platforms.",
It's great to this app and all your info to explain at your finger tip,
Had the app for a while all of a sudden now it doesn't want to load it just keeps on spinning like it's loading something but nothing happens I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it doesn't want to open to the login,
Terrible. I downloaded this for android and I'm trying to log in but it's telling me that the latest update is available and there clearing is nothing in store that says there's an update that needs to be installed.,
"Have used in past. Now, I get a message that I need to upgrade, but there is no option to upgrade. Uninstalling app and reinstalling results in same message.",
The app reset when I was trying to get into my account and now my provider is no longer listed on MyChart. All of this happened in the span of a few minutes with no warning.,
"I love MyChart and can't figure out why there are so many negative reviews! I've used it for years with no problem. It's convenient, easy to use, never fails. The design is also attractive. I appreciate having all of my medical information at my fingertips.",
Always easy to use. Information easy to follow. Very easy to contact doctors when needed. Lab results are posted quickly. I love this app. Also enables me to use for payments.,
"Google play directes you to my chart and not myceenta. My ceenta had no app obviously. Yet my ceenta Info does not appear on my chart. Myceenta is sent through your email, not good can be easily deleted. Why not an app for myceenta???",
I am unable to pull up MyChart. I tried uninstalling the app and then reinstalling the app and nothing happens. I have a virtual appt in a half hour. This is not good.,
"As an older patient, using this app is easy & greatly appreciated. It's awesome to be able to just view lab results right here & it's so easy to access. Thank you",
"Our experience with this group has been exceptional. I wasn't sure about contact ing my Dr. through the portal vs phone but Dr.S is very responsive and always caring,always gets it, and helpful. What a blessing!",
"With the website 4🌟 it's lacking a constant feed from their system to this system don't know if it's because provider's⁵ aren't releasing them in a timely fashion or what the hiccup is. As far as ER care, not impressed by today's ER doc, he'd was arrogant & highly dismissive of my signs & symptoms. Dr. sent me home after about 2 hours and I'm a dialysis patient that needed urgent treatment!",
"Not sure why my review got deleted. You guys have a major bug to fix. Login isn't working for a lot of people. Why would we contact support over that? We can just use the damn website instead, where our logins work. Read your reviews, your app is broken. Instead of blaming the users, just fix your app.",
"It's a great app,.works fine. However if your medical information is something you'd like to keep private, then you should avoid this system. I have reason to believe it's penetrated with easily aquired spyware.",
Have worked with computers for years but trying to reset the username and password on my chart is a nightmare. Still are not able to login.,
It is an easy program to use once you activate an account. But if you a Sparrow hospital patient good luck with getting an account. You have to call the hospital and get a IT person to give you a code. It is impossible to generate one from the Sparrow website.,
One star until copy paste works for entering passwords on account sign up. This reduces security by causing users to reduce password length and complexity. Your security team is using outdated practices.,
My experience with the app is i forgot my password and it dont let you put in the code they sent for you to change password keep saying incorrect and they keep sending different ones when the first one suppose to expire in an hour,
"Awesome. It's amazing to have test results, appointment information, and access to my doctors so readily accessible and available. I'd like to see notes available at some point, right now I can check that on my providers website, but great job!",
Letters my doctors send me don't come through to me anymore!!! Messages still work but not letters... UPDATE: I unistalled the app and reinstalled. Didn't work right away but the following day my letter finally came through! Working good now! 👍,
It never loads or opens anything and continues to get error messages every time I click something. This is My only way to get in touch with my doctor so the fact that I can't even do that is very upsetting,
"Both the app and web page inaccessible and have been that way for other two months. I've had one correspondence with with a tech support ""person"" with no reply from my last email in over 2 weeks.",
"I have found this app to be useful. My take on the seemingly rather negative comments suggests many users either need more training or trial and error practice to become more efficient in its use. Practice, practice, practice.",
It has helped me with my doctors in Portland and in Grants Pass. I can keep track of my appointments and and I can send messages to them. It also helps went I have to do physical therapy too sometimes.,
Improved from the last couple years. Not intuitive in the message department. Functionality is not the best. Needs improvement asap,
"It rejected my user name and password.Then it put a red rectangle over half my user name so I couldnt see if it is correct. Or redo it. I'm in a hurry and can't resolve it. I want to go to bed! CVS minute clinic says I only have 2 more hours to download my covid test results using this site.. which does not work. I have to go to sleep now. So I guess, after all the hassle and mind numbing steps I went through to get tested, I will never know my results. Or be able to copy them for a record.",
Fantastic! So convenient. Had test yesterday. Results on my chart next day. Of course not all test have a one day turn around. Also able to give approval to other providers to access ur chart. NO fax and gathering info to take to Dr. Huge improvement to medical system.,
"Absolutely love this app. I can contact my Dr with questions or concerns and get a response quickly. I can also schedule an appointment, pay my bill, Check in, pay my copay etc. I think I'd be lost without this app",
"Useful, but inconsistent. SMS Healthcare, billing says click here to pay with app, but then continually tries to redirect me to a website to pay. Make up your mind. Where do I pay? I want to use the app.",
Tried loading information to open account but would never get past loading. I gave up after 30 min. of loading. Pretty bad can't even make it in the app. After the fifth attempt it finally worked.,
app was great newest update won't seem to let me attach .pdf to a message. Would be nice if attachments supported excel as well.,
Getting a cryptic email of a bill requiring to open in this app but never in the correct context of my bill. Horrifically bad user experience.,
"It has helped me to find out things that the doctors have failed to tell me. Example I found out in November 2020 after a hospital visit that I have Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3, doctor said get the my chart app. Using the app I found out that I have had Kidney issues since 2016 and was never told by my doctor's that there was even an issue with my Kidneys. Thankfully the doctor at the hospital told me about my chart and now I can view and send messages to my doctor and even make appts!",
Unable to pay bill anywhere on the app!! Sidenote: you can only pay your bill online using an email address to pay your account if you haven't used that email address to pay a previous account.,
"Easy and fast, except for verifying my number it don't want to send the code to my number unless someone wrote it down wrong. Not sure what us going in there with that. Over all I like using the My Chart app.",
"The app is generally good, but I cannot add a payment method. The app will not accept my city. I've tried on 2 different devices, and tried different city names associated with my postal code. No go",
This is the worst MyChart experience. Not user friendly. For help customer service is mostly robotic Rare instance you can speak to a live person. Difficult to start log in. Have to call my MD office for assistance. Whoever planned and designed this MyChart should take a look at the other hospitals My Chart to see ease of use and efficiency(eg. Baylor MyChart). On a scale of 0 to 10 I will give Methodist My Chart a 1.,
"All Drs under one app for me and my child. Refills, messages, test results and more in one place. Love this app. Very easy to use",
"Ok what's going on? It was fine before. All my organizations were there. Now they're gone and when searching for them, the app can't find them. I even put in my state and get the same problem. Please reverse back to the way it was before the update.",
I love this app. It's keep me up to date on all my Dr's appointments plus you can check in over your phone how cool is that? FRECKIN AWESOME. I also like that fact that all my Dr's are listed. My labs work and medication. Great work,
Excellent way to keep track of appointments and health. I have a little trouble with scheduling appointments through the app though. But that's just a minor issue.,
I love the my chart app! I have all of my info at a touch of a finger. I never miss an appt and can keep up with my meds. I can have virtual appointments with no issues. Thank you my chart!,
"It works well for a little while and then I am having serious problem signing back in even when I reset everything all over again, you are very unreliable for a medical app.",
"Horrible. Tried to update password and it locked my account. Pos. Also the app knew my email address to tell me I had mail, but when I tried to log in it told me my account didn't exist.",
I love the fact to communicate with my Doctors to ask question or concerns. See all your appointments and test result. This is the best app. To be able to schedule or cancel appointments.,
"I had an enjoyable experience while getting my health back at Baptist, and whom ever has said in their long boring comment on this app, well some people just didn't have as hard of a time learning this app and frankly it was easy to get it on my Samsung tablet and other tech gadgets I have. So there is no since in blaming the staff at Baptist for some of us that can't get it.",
"When writing a message it won't let me cut and paste. It says that one can't type special characters such as emoji, but I'm not! I'm just pasting in normal letters.",
"This app is outstanding. Its keeps all your appointments, meds, lab work and resylts just to name a few. You can order refills cia this app. I highly recommond this app.",
I really liked this app until today! I open it and it is a blank screen with nothing to click on. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling and still nothing. it doesnt even ask me for my pass code? help please!,
This app is one of the best. I have had no problems with it you can get your yesterday results without going into the doctor's. You can also message you doctor's without having to call and hassel with getting out on hold.,
"The app is really great. I communicate with my Physicians, Lab & Test results, Xrays, Letters, Diagnostic, Diagnosis, Appointments, Medications, any tests or Injections. I can upload pictures, I can get a lot accomplished thru this app. Thank You",
It's great when it works! I'm at critical point and moving with important test results that I need and I can't access for a primary Dr. I will see in another state.,
This app helps me keep up with my health. I can get on anytime and see what ever appointment with ever doctor and all my medical information that is handy for people that can not remember important information about your health thank you for coming up with the app that is helpful for everyone.,
The app never works u try sending doctor a message the screen closes i have complained for over a month nothing. This app is absolutely the worst app i have seen beings its for something thats very important. They administers need to look into for this app is medical and should not have defaults o bet if they were collecting money it work perfectly fine but life who cars u can just die by usint this app,
"App has a random selection of my medical records. Out of ~40 years with this provider, I have 1 set of lab work, 1 convenient care visit, 1 hospital stay. It says I need vaccines, but PCP says since I had chicken pox, no need to vax. Says I have no bills to pay, hospital disagrees and wants money. What's the point of the app if nothing in it can be trusted?",
"I like customization of My Chart. It is not the same with all healthcare My Chart sites. Not able to ad a photo, and changing the colour and theme, instead of the default green colour I'd rather not use. It does not have those features with all the health organizations using Epic Systems Corp. Can app be similar to the website? Epic Systems software It should be available to use. Some women, men, & non-binarymay wish specific theme colours. Thank you.",
"It won't let me log in. Every time I try it says ""unable to load terms and conditions. Try again later. "" I've even tried uninstalling and installing again, and it continues to do this same thing!",
"It's comprehensive, detailed and convenient. I enjoy having it. Save time from making phone calls and waiting",
This app is almost useless. It doesn't work every time I go to the same doctor. Not all of my lab work shows up. Their was nothing wrong with the last app the doctor's office used. This one sucks.,
Was working great but now suddenly it has forgotten everything it had saved in it and won't even look for hospitals to even let me try and log back in again. I'll go by name zip state and it acts like no hospital exists in that entire state.,
"Cannot login, both on this app and the website online. Tried signing up for a new account to see if it made any difference and still getting error messages.",
"Junk. Only one time have I ever been able to e-check in and begin my visit. The rest, it boots me out mid check in. On top of that, I see no way to schedule an appointment with any other doctor other than my primary. Why wouldn't they allow the option me the option to schedule my appointment with my neurologist?",
"This app is a lifesaver, you have all your medical records and doctors one click away. Best when your children have special care and you can't remember everything. I wish all health facilities use it.",
"Very convenient! It helps keep track of my medications, medical history, all my allergies, and helps me communicate with my doctors easier! Brilliant app! Love it,!",
"I finally checked this out after along time of ignoring them when they would tell me to set this up, well I finally did and it was very simple, didn't take to long and wasn't very painful,actually pain free lol but I do wish that I would have signed and set this up along time ago as has now im asking every doctor I end up seeing for their little thing they use for their patient portholes because I want to connect all my medical thing to the one witch you can do btw...I def recommend this",
"Pisses me off that I get bombarded with reminders for the same appointment. How can I disable that? All communications, messaging and preferences, subheadings should be under one link, but thank you for responding.",
"I like seeing all of my appointments, being able to email my doctors, and being able to access my lab results. My husband did have a problem making an appointment...it was a REQUEST for an appointment and the office did not respond back to him...don't know why. So he had to call the office.",
"Blows up on you when you try to log in: ""Terms and conditions cannot be loaded at this time. Please try again later."" Then just closes on you. Useless. (And yes, I tried all ways of fixing it on my end.)",
Very convenient. Get test results back immediately. You can contact doctors through the app and see billing among other useful tools.,
MyChart has dramatically simplified communication with my wellness team. I especially enjoy having easy access to my key information. This app has been a huge convenience and I am very grateful!,
This app hardly works. I have the Samsung s20 an this app just loads and loads it gives me error messages and won't let me do anything or see anything on it. How am I to use this app for appointments if I get error messages,
"Cannot access any messages, chart or test information using the app. Nothing works pass the dashboard screen. Useless.",
This is a great app to help you keep up with medical records and test results Sometimes this app does have glitches on messages and stuff. That's something needs fixed.,
"I like that i can access meds, med allergies BUT it frustrates me that after accessing med allergies, there is no way to return to the homepage to access another topic. Closing the app evertyime i want to changes topics is REALLY A PAIN IN THE REAR. Bob",
I am very happy with the app. But I would like to be able to update information for kovid when I have a booster shot it's not letting me post it to the my chart.,
"MyChart has become an excellent tool in helping me keep up with my health concerns, questions, appointments, medications and all around medical necessities. Simple to send a letter to any of my specialist, ask a question or for an appointment, get refills for my medications, see my lab results, and update or send any of my important information to other doctors.",
The best medical app I've ever had. Makes my life so much easier. My doctor is not close to me and having this is so nice to have the reminders and to see to call in meds and beable to message them and see updates.,
"Your new update is an issue. Apparently because you don't have https: capability, I can't access my medical info. I would prefer my medical info to be secure & available. I can make appointments when I can't talk on the phone with asthma flare",
"This app would be better if it were customizable. I would like to track my health conditions and standard info like weight, A1C, BP and Cholesterol numbers. It would be helpful to be able to entey own health history as well.",
I really like this app you can comunicate with your dr and see test results go thru your meds and request refills during the shut down i was able to get on the app and talk to my dr in real time and didnt have to leave my couch and can even set up payment arrangements. The only down side is it is only for parkview doctors you cant add any lutheran doctors so if you got doctors in both hospital networks you have to have an app for both,
Awful experience. This app can't even remember my login. Such basic functionality being missing is frustrating to no end. I have enough things to remember.,
"This is a fine app, but it needs a way to upload pictures, like the covid-19 vac card or other cards and documents. That would be very helpful.",
App connection to server extremely unstable and fails nearly 100% with an error message. Unusable on Pixel 3a running Android 10.,
I keep trying to log in and every single time I am getting an error message. I need for this to work at all times so I can share my medical history with other providers that I see. I can log in from my computer but the mobile app does not work.,
"Get with the times people!! Lots of people are on imac's, you know apple computers! Epic doesn't detect my mic or camera even on chrome and the phone is hard to talk to doc. Make a program that works easily on a computer! Edit: worked on phone but DOCTOR couldn't get THEIR system to work and they couldn't see us. The one star rating is too high for visits that I'm PAYING to see the doctor for.",
"Old phone died and had to put in this app as I didn't see the same app I used. Some of my visits and test results are not here. I had a blood test with about 22 results t hat I need for another doctors appt, it's not here on this app.",
Used to like it but for the last few weeks it closes within seconds of logging in. What the hell happened? I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling but same problem!!!,
You can't multi select anything such as messages to delete. Password can't be saved. Only a few test results are actually osted,
"Cannot access this My page app, from an incoming email about ""my page' and a letter to me on my Droid phone. Could not download it , nor could the Presbyterian healthcare customer service give me any help on what the My Page message is/ was ( privacy concerns?) Maybe trying to create a profile or sign in after loading the app on my Apple computer could work. This is not making me a happy customer of the Medicare plan I'm enrolled in as a senior .",
I use to be able to sign in with no problems but now having trouble signing in to this app. I try to uninstall the app and reinstall and nothing. Doesn't work..what is going on? Call someone please tell me thank you,
"I love this app so much! I can easily get a hold of a nurse or ma and I can see my test results, instead of having to call to verify results, the office will just reply. Love it!!!",
"I like this app. It reminds me of Appointments and allows me access to test results, and to ask medical advice. My only complaint is I can't erase old Appointments or test results I no longer need.",
Won't let me sign in with my correct password. Password works via the webpage. Just not the app. Worked the first 3 times. Then stopped.,
Way too difficult to navigate. You get emails saying test results are ready which means you're in the system somewhere but then no login info works and if you sign up for one it says please wait a week. Ummmm?. Just try your doctor directly over the phone instead of this foolishness. I'm sure it works for setting appts and stuff but too complicated otherwise,
"Works great saves me time and from endless headaches from always being on hold trying to call and dealing with robots instead of humans,now i text my doctor and he gets right back to me. Awesome!!!",
"Every time I try to sign onto the app I get an error message saying cannot connect to server. Was told to Uninstaller and reinstall, same issue.",
"Poorly developed. Glitches trying to write an email, medication glitches esp. pre-authororized meds.(built in incorrect info about many ""formulary"" meds which differ from what a doctor may write ie; frequency, amt. of pills per month ect.ect...)! Far too many doctors and staff do not have enough computer science schooling to recognize this and many other similar apps. have very serious problems that can and eventually will cause injury to a patient. Contact a specialized attorney for injury!",
"Liked the app alot, but then if kept asking me to update. Kept getting same message afterwords. could not get any help, so deleting it. Found the sanford app would work for me",
"Are you guys ever going to fix the bug where the app can't open a browser to view things like appointment details? Additionally, I'm having issues viewing anything in MyChart if I am connected to the WiFi of the hospital I am attempting to view info from.",
Found out I had cancer. This app keeps all my appointments organized (adding them to my calendar is awesome). Love that I can see my test results when they come out. Would give 10 stars if I could!,
"It will not let me sign in, saying there is a problem communicating with the server and to try again later. I use this app for my kids and I so not being able to login has been a problem.",
"Love this app. Provides me with superior ability to connect with my Drs, request any of my medications, receive a report of my history with my Drs Office, emergency rooms (within the same network) and more. Also makes it easy for me to coordinate with My Pharmacies with dates provided by My Doctor's Office with date availabilty, so I know just when I am ready to pick up my medication. This has literally and easily became one of the most vital apps that I utilize, pretty much everyday of my life.",
"My community Hospital Doctor's Office seems they hate this form of communication. If you communicate necessary information to them too often, they will call it abuse, because they must keep up with it. They can and will do whatever they want, including letting you go as a patient. Parkview Health is not good. Very controlling in all they do.",
My only issue is not with the program but that I have to go to google play to open the app. No icon on my phone. Other than that i find it very helpful and not to complicated at all.,
"Useless, it won't log in. keep getting ""terms and conditions cannot be uploaded"" and that keeps the app from starting.",
App does not work even with latest update from 5/30/20. For 5 days now terms and conditions are unable to update at this time. This prevents you from logging on. Regular online works fine. Better off there.,
"My doctor added additional lab work and the order never showed up in the app. The app doesn't show current or future orders, just appointments. The website shows both. Will rely on the website from now on.",
"Amazing, all in one place for all.of your medical records. Absolutely love the app. The previous one didn't do nearly as much as this one and it's so much faster.",
The one frustration I have is I cannot view the billing statements. It always says theres a server error or something equivalent. Please fix this.,
This app was good until about a month ago then it just started giving me a blank screen and wouldn't let me sign in. I even re-installed with no changes.,
I think this app could use a little more details. The password reset is hard to configure and sometimes isn't even accurate. This app may not be helpful to doctors because at my visits they do not utilize it and ask same questions and hand me forms to be transported instead of using this app for reference. The help line is automated and wait time is always an hour. And you'll wait the full hour each time,
Not too shabby. While it doesnt have as many options as the main mychart website it's a bit more handy with the fingerprint scanner. I love that i reach my provider.,
"App is fairly decent however the appointment scheduling process leaves much to be desired. User has to provide dates they are available, then the physician sends a message for a scheduled appointment date, with no process to inquire about other available dates.",
Before this site changed I could log in and had no trouble getting my messages. Now i had to redo app and can't get my chart. I need to get my test results. I'm very frustrated,
"Need this app to receive covid test results. Everything was ok and there 10-20, now on 10-21 the organization and my data has been removed from the app. The organization is no longer a choice to select. What now?",
App works fine but it does a horrible job at letting the user find out the actual organization. Mychart owns both the website and the application so there is no real excuse for letting the user search for which my chart their organization is under. QRT code or some code would have been really helpful,
This app is literally the worst. Im an hour in trying to se up my account just to get test results. My covid results should br ready by the time I get logged in. Cant load this or that. Last thing I wanna mess with when I dont feel well.,
"The app is not updating with vaccine info nor covid test results. I was sent a link after my covid test for MyChart (already had and use) but when i go in nothing is updated. Not only that, it doesn't even allow for me to update latest vaccines taken. I need assistance with this app fast!",
I'm not a fan of not being able to switch between my children and myself. I thought the app would be more convenient than going to the website but everytime I want to look at something for my children I have to anyway since the app will only allow me to see my info.,
I have had only positive usage of this app. It has made dealing with appointments and communication with medical staff much easier & convenient.,
I love the ease of being able to use numbers to look in quick. Also the ability to go thru the app with ease.,
"This app is an incredible way to efficiently communicate with your health care organization. Messages, appointments, billing, etc. They notified,scheduled, and prescreened me for my covid vaccine appointments .",
"A great App. Helps you see all your health information, test results, appointments, medications, etc. Allows you to request prescription refills, send messages to the doctor and if your insurance allows you can do an evisit. If it were an option I'd give this App 10 stars!",
MyChart works differently depending on if accessed from the app or if opening from an email. Functions better when accessed from email. Access from the app is limited and awkward.,
"Why is it so difficult to switch between providers!? Since this is a major feature of the service, it s should be better thought out and more easily communicated to users/patients.",
"Onn Only used it 2 months so far. Pretty good, but why does it NOT have a place for me to manually enter my vitals like BP, glucose, etc. This would improve real-time communication between me and my care providers.",
Absolutely LOVE this app!!! I wish every medical place used this one specifically! I brag about it to all my Mom friends of how easy it is to use and how nice it is to have open access to our own information!!,
This app always works for me! Its pretty great as it shows past and upcoming appointments! It also shows test and lad results.,
Sentara and Riversideonline BOTH use the same App. They switch most of the time between them when I want to. Great app that could use only just a bit more work.,
"This app is WONDERFUL!! I'm able to access my test results, upcoming appointments, message my providers, manage my medication list and refills and so much more! Honestly, this app has been such an amazing game changer for my family and I.",
"Great app to keep up with appointments and test results. Notes and summary notes from doctor's and clinic visits too. Keeps you current with needed lab work, tests and vaccines. I updated my review to 5-star because I can now get past clinical notes from other cities as well.",
"Does not show in recent apps therefore you cannot switch between this app and another app, for example a password manager and this app, and that frankly is a pain in the ass!",
I love the new updates for Harris Health I just wish we can schedule our appointments via app like we can cancel. It would be a lot easier for when we can not get a hold of someone to reschedule.,
"CANNOT Transfer App Data to External, SD card?! A Memory Hog: Grows in size! Have To Delete App Every Time I Use It!! Every Time!. Takes Up, e.g., ""Hogs Android's Sys. Memory""! Why?! You Don't Listen To Complaints. Only app for use with my Insurance Co's Hosp. Sys. Useless For All of the Above Reasons! Permissions Change OFTEN! GOOGLE PLAY Users: Check ALL THE App's Critical Ratings!!! See their Respose, below!",
currently unable to see some important billing information that I received an email about this morning. it just won't load. so I'm currently hugely inconvenienced. usually it works well though.,
"Good app, but I don't need 10 appointment reminders a week before my appointment. I made the appointment, I know when it is. I get a text, email, and then the app bugs!. Drives me nuts....",
"This is the best way to communicate with my Healthcare team. Test results are quickly posted, Rx list, appointment notes and scheduling too. My Dr personally answers my questions in less than 24 hours! Absolutely Fabulous app!!!",
"Constant reminders to update contact information. I have gone to the page three times to find my information is correct. There is no way to confirm that offered. Out of date appointment information, comments like ""you are overdue for your eye exam."" How would you know since you know NOTHING ABOUT MY EYECARE, which I do NOT OBTAIN my eye with you! Traveling over three hundred and fifty miles, my husband losing three days of work costing us several hundred dollars, and spending over a hundred do",
"I love having such easy access to my medical care team. They seem to have all the bugs worked out now. I've found some of my health info, a diagnosis actually, by reviewing MyChart that no doc ever told me or discussed!",
I appreciate the quick access to my medical info. I am frustrated that I can't see appointment details with receipts so I can use for medical flex account. It makes paying through the inconvenient. I am less likely to do so in the future.,
The only thing that would make this app better is to make it easier to add the different Dr offices. Other than that this app has helped me so much! I'm so glad that they came up with this. Now I can view my documents and test results for myself.,
"I have downloaded this app several times, but I can't view my medical records because it keeps telling me there's a newer version available. However, I can not find the ""newer version""! How do I ensure that I have the appropriate app?",
It wants me to update my information. Ok no change . Where is the confirmation button ? It only gives me edit or remove. I don't need either. What a confusing waste of time. Why do I get a 3 yr old estimate on a cataract surgery that is complete.?,
"I love MyChart, I go to my healthcare providers regularly and I love having easy access to my medications and upcoming appointments. being able to request refills for medications through the app has been a huge part of making sure I'm taking proper care of myself",
Happy to say my log in problem has been resolved. I really enjoy the ability to send info back and forth to my doctor ... Using my chart makes everything easier!,
"Love love love this app. Have been using it for years. Just had a recent inpatient stay and got constant updates, informational videos to watch and also test results.",
"This is a very convenient app. I use it for my husband and follow the notes, test results and follow ups for him, even communicating with all doctors over concerns.",
"Ok so I left a favorable review, but I've changed my mind While I still love the app I'm very frustrated with it. While my husband and I have the app it's becoming increasingly hard to log in. More than half the time I can't log in with my pass code. So when I finally do get in I change the setting for the pass code and it will work for awhile then I have to do this all again.",
"This app always says ""can't connect with the server, try again later."" I've tried so many times without success. Very frustrating!7",
Yhe online visits on the app is a great thought if they didn't tell you to go in and be seen every time. Also can't cancel appt they tell you to call.. So if everything they offer you have to call or be seen why offer them in the app.,
The red dot alerts remain for hours after an event is viewed. This is a nusiance. Some lab test results do not display in a spreadsheet format permitting comparisons with test results from other dates. This is very inconvenient.,
"What happened? You changed it and now I can't even log in. It goes to some screen where it wants a location, but won't accept or find the one where I get my service. It's now useless.",
"It's nice. Big issue I have is that when my account was made, there was a typo in the username. It took two years for me to figure out what my username was and actually start using this, and that was only cuz my dr made me",
I like using the app an order to stay up-to-date on my health & I can also edit my personal account info too. It would be nice if the share time access was a little bit longer than an hour.,
Completely sucks. Tried to sign up and said it couldn't verify my identity with my information. Tells me to contact customer service but doesn't say how to do that. Disgraceful.,
So helpful! Easier receiving and sending information about test results. Just feel closer and much easier to keep contact with my doctor.,
Easy simple and for somebody with the boo boo brain saying that it should tell you something it's accurate it's awesome it's easy and it is 100% secure which is a big issue with me. I think my chart for many reasons,
"larry lopez, this epic MyChart it's supposed to be an addition to the UCSD MyChart health who sings ask me a bunch of questions instead of it just simply transitioning and updating so that I'm able to look at my record my calendar for appointments and it's not allow me to do that so I'm unsure about this app and right now it sucks.",
Great app no problems. Keep all of my info in one place including appointment reminders. I can even make my appointments on this appointment without calling in,
Bring back the sliding animated Reference range; this long jumbled text reading where I have to search for the word results is not sensible.,
"App isn't intuitive operationally. My information doesn't update, I can't clear notices such as updating my information. Appreciate the access but could be better.",
"Updated review: Mychart let me know that my provider (MERITUS of Hagerstown, MD) most likely is blocking the scheduling of appointments, because each provider sets up their own options 😑. Very inconvenient indeed! --- I can't schedule appointments anymore :(",
"My chart is very dependable. Great flexibility for changing passwords, sending messages to your physician and other medical matters. Please access My Chart. It is a life changer.",
Once i got the hang of it very easy to use. I love the idea that I can see everything all in one place and all my Dr's are all in one place. Very easy to use and communication is also great.,
Can't even enter the app. When I put in my pin or my password it tells me it can't show me the terms and agreement at this time and to try again later. IT'S BEEN 2 WEEKS!!,
"I love ""My Chart"". It is easier to tell the Drs and Staff what I need when the phones just ring and ring. Or after hours when I remember something I should have told the Dr. while I was in the office, but forgot. Also, being able to look at medications and tests that were taken is a help also. Most times I get the results before to he Dr can send me a follow-up message. I don't like when the system says go somewhere, like Pharmacy, and there is no such place to go to. D. Speech 10/29",
"The only After Visit Summary I've encountered was from a visit to Urgent care, but nothing from any of the visits to individual doctors. Either that feature doesn't work or the individual doctors don't summarize my visits, because I've had to call them back repeatedly for information.",
"This app is very easy to use. I can add my appointments to my calender, and it's easy to set multiple reminders for those.",
"It used to be fairly good but now I have trouble navigating the app, pre-appt questionnaires are not popping up and it is slow to load.",
I just set up my chart when i downloaded the app on my phone its so great. Easy access lets see how well this works as time goes on.,
My Chart communicates your medical history really well. It is organized into seperate categories that are easy to read and understand.,
"I think it's great! It has so much information listed, and your able to refill your medications and set up or cancel your appointment easily.",
Not working right after update. Can't locate my doctor or any other doctor in my state. I depend on this app for many things because of my current health issues. I hate it now.,
I can't log in or use the app at all. Keeps telling me password and email are wrong when they are not. I've even changed my pw. Still says it's not right. FIX IT PLEASE,
I'd like the ability to mark notifications in the bell as read. I'd also like to be able to sort messages by doctor.,
The my chart app for android does not work on my on my phone saying Samsung version 7 does not support the AP. Previously it did work with the same version? The QR code does not scan..I am confused.,
"Used to be great. Now with this new update, it says there are messages but when I click on it, they don't show anything. Terrible update.",
I entered my PW wrong and my account was disabled. There aren't any instructions that actually work to regain my access. I'm uninstalling this app because I've had zero responses to my emails from the app developer for support.,
"I had used this app on my old iPhone with no difficulty, but upon installing on my Pixel 3 am unable to log in. Even was able to change the password and still cannot log in.",
"Will not open ""problem communicating with the server. Please try again later"" it's been doing this since Friday 9/13. Was there an update that caused this? Had same thing 2 years ago.",
I'm able to access not only ALL of my medical information along with my children's. I can also send/receive messages through their portal. Best feature is that ALL of my Doctor's can access my important medical information without my running around trying to request & pay for medical records!,
this a really good app. more people should us it. you can check to see what your actual results from your doctor was and it post your nexted appointment if you should forget. you can request a refill on meds to you doctors office or an appointment. it reminds you of yearly checkup you my need. this is and A+ app.,
"Love this !!!! Keeps you updated with your Doctors and can make appointments get medication refills, video appointments with your Doctor, make it nice when it's hard for you to leave your home. If you dont have you truly want to get. It makes my life so much easier. TY!!!!",
Impossibly different than the other my chart system I use..ya think whoevers in charge of medical charts would consolidate them to ATLEAST be similar..i feel this is just another example of the sheer incompetence of the tech side of the medical field as a whole..,
"Needs work. Some personell, do not know how to properly convey messages.Believe some training is in order. If a pre billing question needs answering, appears no place to ask that question. Overall, a good system that needs improvement.",
"Broken, can't connect to server, try later. Several months now & don't bother emailing because the developer doesn't respond. Used to work great.",
Why can't I just Sign into an Account why do I have to choose my service provider all this dumb stuff? This App right off the bad is designed by somebody incompetent I can't imagine an Older person who isn't good with tech doing this. You should be ashamed how BAD this App and how hard it is to even get the app stsrted and working right. 00000000 out of 10 for pissing me off and making a non user friendly App that's EASY and Not ANNOYING to operate. Fire the person who designed this APP,
"Just downloaded it and I'm happy with it so far. It is easy to use, looks clean and simple, and has a lot of great useful functions built in the application.",
One stop shop. All the information I need right at my finger tips. Sometimes it's been a hurdle to make payments. Ease of scheduling amd communicating with providers.,
"Can't log in, keep saying password not correct, when it is correct, same password I use to log into on a PC and it works! Useless for me.",
MyChart makes all the difference. Doctors and staff are able to respond in a more timely manner. Its much easier to take your time and type your request than to phone ; more time for reception to converse with patients on site. Thank you Dr. Rafferty and your staff for always being so prompt with responses.,
I recently had a battle with cancer. This app was a life saver. It kept all my appts for me. I'm able to refill meds and make appts. It really kept everything in one place at my fingertips,
"Im not sure why it will not allow more than one account, it has let me set one up for myself but not for my chold,every time I go to set his up it states he cannot be verified with information I've provided.",
Easy to use. Love the previsit log in.,
I have a very good experience with this app and found it very useful until this week when the app was changed. Now there is no fingerprint login option. BJC is my provider.,
"There is no need for hold times via the phone or anxiously waiting for the return call from your Dr or his nurse any longer. You can virtually get every answer to any question or access to all of your medical information so any current or past info you may need regarding your medical , is at your fingertips. Incredibly convenient is the words that come to mind.",
I downloaded the app and have yet to be able to use it. Everytime I log in it tells me that the Terms and Conditions could not be loaded to try back a later time. Well its been a week now and still the same message...,
I can't look at my messages or even look at my medication or send a message just started acting up this week,
"Every time I attempt getting into the ""medications"" section, I get logged out of the application. Messages saying ""server error"" pop up in almost every section. Not helpful.",
Fantastic my test result is lost in this app. 3hrs waiting in line just to get qtips up my nose. The app doesn't recognize my username and refuse to let me reset the damn password meanwhile you call those people nobody answer and you wonder why NY have to worst case of covid out there. I'm walking out there no knowing my status. Women have kits for pregnancy let us have ours for this and leave us alone with your bad service,
Ready to use and understand,
"It is great multiple main medical providers use this app.( Wellstar / Tsnner and Emory) are the 4 I know of. Ot easy to use for refilling meds , packing to a nurse seeing yest results and making appointments. I think it is a great app. More medical providers need to use ot.",
"Makes everything about all my doctors etc so much easier. I can send messages, get prescription refills pay bills and keep track of all my appointments. I haven't had any issues!",
"I did not give this application permission to be installed. Furthermore, the suspect transaction that triggered this makes no sense, as no personally significant healthcare provider is listed. Something is quite wrong. Uninstalled as soon as this is posted.",
I like the messaging part. The app still shows a surgery referral although I had that surgery almost a year ago and the referring person no longer works there. Slightly annoying.,
You can view your blood work faster and you can look up Dr appointments. Love it !!,
"It is great! So easy leave a message and the doctor's call you back, I feel this makes my life stress free! I've got doctors , dentist, and my orthopedic doctors all on one app! Thank you for making my life a little easier!!",
"This portal is a lifesaver to me..My providers answer quickly. No more calling them and waiting for calls back, test results can be reviewed, meds, and so much more. I can't say enough good things about it..",
"This app has been a god send, My husband had a long stay in the hospital, and this app had all the information I needed to stay up to date when I couldn't be there. It is also very easy to message with Doc's and schedule appointments.",
"Was a good app, just stopped working randomly. I have been trying to log in for days now and it just will not let me because of the terms and conditions not want to load. I have new and important messages to read there but I can't see them. How can I fix this?",
I don't know where I would be without my MyChart... It keeps track of all my doctor's appointments and physical therapy. And if I have a question it's right there for an answer. Happy,
"Setup password, tried to log in and it failed 5 times, setup another, same thing, tried to setup a third password, and everyone did the same thing. I can't give it a lower rating or I would..",
"My new OBGYN introduced me to this app. &text it to my phone to show me how to set it up. It's super user friendly, very informative & I love that you can receive results w/in a few hrs & also chat w/your Doctor. I will definitely make sure my family members & friends are using this app. I would give it more than 5 stars 🌟 if I could.",
"The app does not tell you what/where to find the new message/ test result/appointment/prescription refill... It simply lets you know that SOMETHING has been updated/ sent to your chart, then you have to go to 5-7 places to find out what it is.",
I'm glad to be able to have this app it saves a lot of time and worries,
Excellent app to have so one has access to their medical records. Past and future appointment records. Meds through pharmacy are easily refilled through app. Give on control to allowing others granted access as wanted.,
"App seems to be getting better. However, app collects a lot of personal data like email, 1st & last name etc. to sell. I am not ok with this.",
I couldn't load my messages or past or future appointments for me or my son on the app but was able to access them on the browser but it takes a long time for it to load. It has been very helpful when it works properly.,
Won't let me pay bills in app. I log in and it says I have a balance soni click on it to pay. It asks for the card information but when I enter it there is to option to submit or continue. The only options available are back and cancel.,
What are the best apps very satisfied with my chart I recommended for everyone signed Bob welke,
Love that I can go on my chart to see upcoming apts and don't have to call into he clinic and wait for a long time and hold up the lines for someone else who might have a need that is more urgent than mine.,
"I HIGHLY recommend MyChart!! I love being able to get tests results within a few hours, e-checking in for appointments, and going back to check results from a few years ago to make comparisons. I am my husband's caregiver and I honestly don't know what I'd do without MyChart!!!",
"Everything I need is in one place. I can easily communicate with my Doctor(s), schedule appointments, review my test results, etc., for me it that's important.",
"Great system for keeping all your medical records in one spot, and to keep track of appointments. I use both the Android and Windows versions.",
it only lists 2 of my doctors and I cannot add the others... plus when I checked in for an appointment I had to manually add all of my medical history and then none of it saved in the MyChart app... so I am going to have to do it again.. . this is ridiculousness..,
"This app is easy to use, I can access my test results and easy to make/cancel future appointments. When I message my doctor I get fast responses. Today tho I cannot get on due to error but could be the system is down.",
"I thought I could just log in with the user ID and password I used to register through CVS's website. However, it asked for my state and then listed participating healthcare facilities in that state - and I did not see CVS among them.",
I would rate this app a 5 star; however I have tried multiple times to verify my phone number by having a text sent to my phone and it NEVER sends the code. It's very annoying to have to have it sent to my email instead,
Extremely pleased for the support through the app.,
Best app for staying in contact with my doctors and getting the test results in an efficient manner. Kudos to the development team and the coding specialists,
Compared to many other medical applications I am forced to use. This one is a really nice change. It works well does what it is intended to do and gives me an easy and quick portal to access my doctor and doctor's office,
"Frustrated!! I downloaded, created an account, log in, pass and when I attempt to log in for results, it says log in not valid. Keeps bouncing me around and can't get in. Is there something I should know? Poss. Doing something wrong? Ugghh",
This has been wonderful having all my health information at my fingertips. Being able to see notes from the doctor is great. Alot less waiting & wondering what is going on,
"We've been with the same insurance company for many, many years & when this app began getting used by medical personnel & their notes about visits, appointments, messages and request refills for medicines; I saw the potential for fewer medical errors & this app gives control back to the patients! #YayIris [Additional optional info below, I answered via the star rating, the first being 5☆ bc to my knowledge there aren't any ads inside the app, idt!]",
"Very easy to use, makes communication with my Doctor super easy. I also get to schedule appointments and check on all lab results through the app.",
"Excellent App. Get confirmations of hospital visits, test results, etc. straight away without having to wait weeks for a letter! All medical appointments etc together in one place.",
"MyChart used to have a tab to keep the username. It doesn't have that feature on the new updated MyChart. Every app has a ""Remember Me"" feature, except MyChart. It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying.",
"This app now takes up more storage than Facebook! If you made it like that, you could at least program it so it can be put on an SD card!!! I have space issues and may have to delete it.",
"Easy to use. For people complaining about the screenshots use the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner to access the app preferences, I there you can enable screenshots.",
"VERY POOR scheduling feature. Too easy to schedule doctor appointment for the wrong day, which is of course, medically dangerous. There ought to be safeguards for a sick person trying to schedule. I WILL NEVER USE THAT FEATURE AGAIN. It's not worth the risk!",
"Very confusing, multiple entries",
POS app. I can use the MyChart web page just fine. However the app has been impossible to recognize my account. The user interface for creating an account without an access code appears to be created by amatures.,
Very easy to get around in once you figure it all out,
Junk. Says there is a new version right out of the box. Edit 13/7: Still garbage. Unusable because it says there's a newer version available even after a fresh install from the store.,
This was so hard to navigate I tried several times to set it up and had difficulty every time. I'm not sure whether I actually got it set up or not. All I want to know if the results of my covid test,
Could not create an account didn't like my name and password that I used to try to log in. Kept trying to figure out what was wrong and eventually it just bomed my account totally. Says to contact my chart. Gives no info how to contact them.,
Very attentive with patients..,
It's not bad. Can't clear reminders. My doc ordered a test. 6 months ago. I had the test done. Results were loaded into my chart by testing facility. Reminder to have testing done is still there.,
I love that I can connect with my Dr. and see all of my health information.,
I absolutely love this! I can get in touch with my doctors of I don't have a chance to actually call with no background noise. I can also see test results and records from prior visits which helps when you don't have the greatest memory.,
"Fantastic app, keeps track of all my appointments, past,present and future! I receive all my test results as fast as the doctor gets them! The only thing I am still waiting for is an update of my vaccinations.",
"I absolutely love My Chart. I like being able to get my test results faster, having access to all of my records, but most of all, I like being able to make, change, and confirm my appointments online without have to wait on the phone forever to talk to someone. I can get answers to my questions right from my Dr so much faster then waiting for someone in the office to call me back. I also like knowing that if I have to go to another hospital for emergency treatment, that my Dr can see those notes",
"Can't find where I can print from a mobile device. I always like to keep a copy of my lab work. Also, having trouble viewing past ""relpy"" messages from my doctors. I have to find my original message that I sent.",
Have to use it wish there was something better. Give me an alert to schedule but then tells me I am ineligible. Can't dismiss the alert so it clutters the screen. Hard to navigate,
I like having my information easily accessible. I would like to add a picture on my own instead of having one taken off of the internet. Being to change that would be very helpful.,
App is awful. Great that one can view test results but the video never works for appointments....I've ensured the permissions allow for mic and camera...nothing.,
"Useful! Message doctors and Healthcare providers directly. Analyze your med exam results directly on the website/app. The app itself crashes sometimes, but much more useful than literally millions of other apps!",
User friendly and very convenient!,
It's very convenient and you can do it all through the app,
"The UM clinic phones have changed to a main distribution center then they route to clinic, horrible experience everytime! The app will give you quicker responce times then the phone most of the time since the phones changed.",
"I've had to make appointments/cancel appointments and check test results. This app has made it easy for me to get the information I need without haveing to call, get transferred and waiting on hold. I would recommend it to anyone.",
"Very useful in keeping up on your health. It's nice to be able to communicate with your care team via the app, schedule appointments and check any test results you may have.",
"It really bothers me that my vaccines and preventative services, (ie. Colonoscopies, bone density , mammograms ...) are NEVER correct on MyChart. I have had them ALL but there is no way to update any of them except for the flu vaccine. Even after Dr. visits these do not get updated. Frustrating!",
"Absolutely useless! Doesnt tell you anything , doesnt even let you delete wrong or old meds but will delete if you swipe on diagnosis to see if it give you definition which it doesnt. Billing even stinks ! No dates of service just a total of what THEY say. Worst app Iv ever used seriously.",
I find this app very helpful and easy to use,
"Once I was able to figure it out, for the most part, it had been wonderful to be able to refer back to it to talk with new doctors or urgent care or the ER. It's nice to have all of my medical info in one location.",
Very nice app but since not all my doctors are using it. I thinks I don't have health care visits set. It would be great to be able to add providers appointments not affiliated with Englewood Hospital. My regular doctor isn't affiliated with any hospital.,
Well its extremely hard to use. Notifications never come to my phone. Things don't get updated. I'm left in the dark because everything is done through the app so basically my health-care is worse than before this app,
"Love this app. Has everything I need for appointments at my hands. However, it will not let me verify my phone number. I click verify so it can send a code via text and nothing happens.",
It's so helpful everything is right there when needed to be found,
"Very handy and a huge time saver for non-urgent inquiries, reviewing results, and so forth. There is a bug in the biometric login: when you enable biometrics login for one organization it breaks it for other organizations.",
"Smartest Idea in a long time! Easy Contact with Entire medical team. No calls for Refills,just Request. Many Hospitals involved,Your Drs( most) are connected to one of them usually. Easy also,..Well Done..Try it FYI.. IF not working on your Device, I can safely say,The App Is Strong,well made. Clean Ur device/ CK Permissions. Promise,It's Solid!",
"Wow?????!!! Just installed and entered my password and keep getting an error message that terms and conditions could not be loaded. Multiple times. So far, just like Honor Health, this app is awful.",
I haven't been able to login through the app. constantly tells me my info is wrong and when I select to reset it I get an error message. I'm not even sure this app is available and running.,
"Easy to navigate and find or make schedules for appointments, for someone who forgets most the time the alarm function has been helping a lot .",
Doctor Penhall is very good and I enjoy my appointment.,
"I keep getting emails about updates to my record. When i go to MyChart to see them, there is nothing new and/or no clue where the new info would be. Its a waste of time!",
I can see my results before dr visit and its a history of medical records plus appt and ability to ask nurse questions.,
Great to have health information quickly. Menu navigation a little tricky. Some reminders stay too long. Follow up with practice if no response rarely needed.,
Very easy to use and extremely helpful. You get messages to remind you of certain things that you need done such as vaccines and wellness screening. Love this app!,
The best way to keep track and understand your medical,
It's SO frustrating that I can't change any settings. I've paid my bills by mail for 45+ years and this downgrade to only communicating with my phone is disappointing!,
1. I'd like to scroll thru my Lab results INSTEAD OF viewing 1 result at a time. 2. I'd like to Bookmark more than 1 message at a time. 3. I'd like the Bookmarked messages moved to its own page(s). 4. I'd like to Delete more than 1 message at a time. 5. How long do I have to RESTORE Deleted messages???,
MyChart has become easier to access and use. It's easy to leave a message for Provider Team although it may take 24 hrs or more to receive a reply. I like MyChart very much now compared to 4 or 5 yrs ago. The three questions below can't be fully read.,
Long delays accessing information.,
I appreciate this app. Test results at my finger tips . I have a direct line of communication with my entire health care team . I simply leave a message in the app and they message me back within an hour . Great job Wake Forest for using MyChart. Believe me I have shared this with them,
"Excellent for scheduling appointments, and communicating with my provider. I do wish the reminders could actually be removed instead of sleeping and keep coming back.",
"MyChart is very easy to use. I like being able to send messages back and forth with my doctor or the nurse, rather than calling. It helps to keep up with appointment dates, past and future. All your doctors on one App! Awesome!",
get uptodate info before it arrives in the post very good app,
"Very convenient for checking test results, refill prescriptions, Dr. appointments.",
Easy to navigate. Fast. New data arrives quickly. Layout quite good.,
Makes you able to access medical records and send messages to doctors. Even gives you access to images from testing. Essential for reviewing and sharing medical records and obtaining documentation from visits/tests. Allows doctors across different organizations to review all MyChart records through linked accounts.,
Amazing and timely,
I did really like how it worked and used it frequently. Especially while at a Dr visit for dates and discuss ion but since last update it is slower and I even have problems bringing it up it takes forever. Not really happy right now.,
"Great app. All your records on your phone. Well managed. Love being able to ask questions and get a quick response, schedule appointments, and request med refills.",
"App has really come a long way. I can message with my doctor, schedule appointments, see my records, and do the same for family members in my care. Seems to have strong security in place, too, while being relatively easy to use.",
Some appointments can make online but earlier ones are found by calling nurse. Has messages to doctor and test results. Would be nice to have access to doctor notes and which medicines not to take or what to do after check ups. 4/5! Edit.. Cant contact mental services or doctor. Video phone appts are questionable and sometimes cancelled. Need to inform patients when services are closed for holiday to be able to go to er. Other options are hidden and dont work or send you out of app. Needsupdate!,
My Chart is a very awesome app. It makes sure that you get your test results on time. I'm really happy that I downloaded it and installed it. Such a great app. Thank you for making it for me ok. Dennis DiLullo,
"Super easy and helpful when going through my chart, history, and upcoming appointments. Grateful that I have this to go by when I'm on the go as my days have been scheduled. Thank You for having this option to go to.",
App will not work & let me connect to see my results or information because my hospital is not listed & theres no way to add providers that aren't on the list. Well thought out plan guys! Worst app I've ever put on my phone.... congrats,
I REALLY love this app! I have two other medical app systems I use with other doctors. My Chart is by far the easiest and best one out of the three! I LOVE the fact I can help keep my medical and pharmaceutical information current.,
"Fast and easy to get ahold of anyone for help , and instantly notified when you have a next appointment, test results everything on your phone when you need to check ✔ the ladies at the clinic are so helpful & kind. Would definitely recommend 👌",
Easy to use & get in touch with your doc.,
Easy to navigate and great to connect multiple hospitals and portals to have quick access to all your records in one place,
"Very useful app. I am able to schedule, cancel and reschedule appointments with my doctor. I can communicate directly through the app with my doctor any time.",
It's very helpful and useful and very convenient,
"Discrimimating people based on their income - saying there's a newer version although I just downloaded it. I'm sure it's because of code error, not liking my older smartphone with Android 4.4. Not everyone should have the newest gadgets to track their health!",
"It was good for awhile, and then cant sign in everytime i try it say there is a problem with the server , so i had to unistall and delete, it sucks now. I try to sign in way too many time isntall and unistall and make no diference , i was happy at the begining when i srart using it now its bad too bad.",
It is amazing when you have everthing in one place. Never missed an appointment with and less calls made to the doctors office because of this app. It's just great and I'm happy about it.,
"Useless for me right now. Won't let you sign in unless you select a healthcare facility. I don't have one, just wanted to see my MinuteClinic chart but couldn't get past the ""select a facility and sign in"" stage.",
It is exceptionally designed and easy to use. I live being able to do ally pre-visit check in questions before I arrive and also take care of any co-payments. I have used another health organizations mobile app and MyChart is far superior. Well done!,
I absolutely dislike this new MyChart I love the old portal. I cannot email my doctor. It has the wrong as my primary and I cannot change it. I've been trying to refill my medication for 3 weeks I can't get anyone to respond back through the charts or through calling or through Walgreens sending a request. I want the old one back so I can email my doctor directly. Totally dissatisfied,
"When it works, it's fine. However, this app is rarely able to load. Most of the time I get an error message and cannot retrieve new information regarding my care. However, it always works well on my pc.",
"As a senior citizen. I love MyChart. It has all my medications, notes from my doctor's, test results, and all my upcoming appointments all at the tap of my finger. I can easily email my doctor with any questions I might have. It makes my life easier and I love that.",
I will not use this app or give a damn about this app this help you try to download it and then wait for 4 hours or better to talk to a representative to make sure that you are hooked up to the app truly unsatisfactory noise can do better but the employees is just feeling a little too soft and they can just don't answer the phone or call you back when they feel like it I don't have the time this is an app that I would not use or recommend anyone use,
"I really appreciate being able to casually communicate with my health providers, receive messages from them that I can review at my leisure, schedule appointments where I find the best available time, and see my medical history at a glance. It really is helping me keep up with important medical information for my better health.",
"The concept is ideal. Though it would be helpful to be able to schedule more services. Such as testing, lab work, nurse visits..etc. Being charged for ""email/messaging"" your Doctor's through MyChart? Why? Frequently the responses you receive are from nurses or other members of their staff. The nice thing is that you can access test results and are able to schedule some appointments.",
So very useful. I keep track of my appointments and my mother's and scheduling/rescheduling is very easy. I really like the fact that I can see the results of all of her tests and reports on her procedures within hours.,
This app is subpar and has no development oversight. The update email and phone number doesn't work after you confirm. This is restrictive and prohibiting proper access to my medical information. Is that on purpose? Who is accountable?,
I have a new Android so I don't know why I have the problems I have. I try to go to one subject and messaging or tests and it just thinks and thinks and thinks and then goes back to the home screen takes me forever to get any information from this app. If I'm the only one that has this problem I'm sorry I wrote this.,
Works great. Love the trending.,
Easy to use. Messaging and setting up appointments in app is easy. Love that all notes and results are in one place.,
"easy to use, love that I can read my own results",
"This app makes it easy to make appointments, message my doctor, and request refills. It is better and cheaper than going to the doctor's office every time I have a question. The app works smoothly and it is user friendly.",
There's no back button! I get stuck on a page and can't go back to home page. I've even tried the back button on my pull down screen on my LG phone. Previously it worked. But now I can only tap it once. Please fix this issue.,
You can't change the doctor that you want to see. You are forced to select whomever is selected which is only one person in the list. The practice has many doctors. Not sure why you are not allowed to choose others. Poor programming and/or business design.,
A really useful app. It allows real-time access to lab reports and reminders of up coming appointments along with very useful notes on doctors visits. Best app of all my physicians.,
This is a necessary app to have when you are experiencing many health issues. My information is handily available with a click which includes test results and other important items. You should add this to your list!! I highly recommend...,
Mr. Johnson has been a great help to me and appreciate the work he has done for me.,
Try your best to use an IHC hospital everything about them seems to be better. In their app as soon as the labs are tests are done I can see them whether the doctor is seen them or not and it's been that way for years this one it can take days and weeks for results to show up.,
"I don't even know what purpose this app is supposed to serve, since I literally can't access any useful information, message my provider, request an appointment or anything else the app advertises. I just wasted my time signing up for this app because it doesn't actually do anything.",
"I love this option. I was calling the office with my questions and waiting for a callback. Now I just type it in & hit ""send"". I usually get an answer within 48 hrs. My phone will tell me when I have a message ""waiting"". It's great 😃. Saves a lot of time and now I don't have to bug the nurses.",
"I love this app! I'm very forgetful alot of the time and being able to log in and see my appointments makes my life easier. Also, it is great being able to email your doctor instead of having to call on the phone.",
Great app for medical aid 🔥,
"I love this app! It keeps track of all of my appointments, my test results, my medications, and my extensive medical history. I'm able to schedule appointments and email my doctors. Don't change a thing!",
I really enjoy using this app. It offers quick support. You get information updated on the go. You can reach out to your Healthcare provider within the app. All your information in one place. You basically take your records with you wherever you go. Love it.,
"I always have problems logging in using the app, making it unusable 90% of the time. No issues logging into the MyChart desktop site, only the app.",
"This application has always an issue with keeping you to constantly prompt you to update your cellphone and you do follow command and IT DOESN'T WORK? what a waste of time, you'll need to something about this??? Thank you.",
"It's complicated, but I do utilize it, & appreciate it. I'd like to see more functions, with simple patient knowledge. Like, bloodtype for instance, various ailments diagnosed already, etc...",
Great easy user-friendly navigation,
This app is awful to use . I have t change my password at last 2 times a month. This should not be happening. It's a hot mess,
This app really helps me keep up with my appointments and medication,
Been a great app. Then now I can't even get a code to look at my chart. Which I need so I don't have to look up all my papers for new doctor. Need to fix it. I'll just delete it and keep my old way of records. Thank,
"Couldn't remember user name, called help desk (man was very polite) but information given was incorrect and completly useless. Tried to call back within 5 minutes and all I get is a recording.",
Easy way to keep track of ALL medical issues. I absolutely LOVE this app. I can communicate with my Dr.& all the clinicians that are part of my health care very easily. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,
Good and useful with some issues and glitches. Last issue I encountered was booking a test/procedure that requires physical presence but only telephone appointment option was available.,
Very helpful. Easy navigation,
I like this app because it helps me with my appointments. The main issue is trying to log into my account. I kept getting an error telling me that there is a problem with the login and to try again. I did and got the same thing over and over. Needs fixing urgently.,
"I like it,its so simple,except having to wait 48 hours for a question to be answered",
It's been fine can you send me some contact lenses,
"Never had any issues until march 22,2021 The app now is crashing every time I launch it. Unless I uninstall and reinstall then it works for that time . Not sure how to fix the problem.",
It used to be a good app but it removed one of my children's account without my permission and I no longer have access to his information. Like how you gonna remove a child without my permission. He has a huge medical history that has been easily accessible until recently.,
"It's very easy to use, gives to quick access to test results, direct communication with your doctor, the ability to share your medical history quickly. It's just a nice app.",
super slow with poor results. NOT HAPPY can someone get on the stick and fix all these problems. good lord this is totally just terrible. your app does work at all and no communacation of letting us know that you're even looking into this. damm good thing we did not pay for this. come on!! fix it.,
"My chart tells you to call phone numbers that cannot be completed as failed, never answered, or send you on a 4 phone chase that ends up with person answers, they have no idea why you were giving that number. The land lines cannot receive texts. Revive appointment 1 day before.",
"Like the easy use but if someone inputs incorrect information, it is impossible to correct or remove it & no one is knowledgeable for correcting this. Such as updating ""Coverage Details"" or ""COVID Vaccinating Record"". This needs to be updated.",
"After clicking on any link, there is no way to get back to the home screen...very frustrating because I have to close and reopen the app. Also, it would be nice to be able to upload a photo or document.",
"Not dependable. Most everytime I use it I get a 500 message, something about the server. Not sure who has the problem. It's a wonderful tool, if it worked.",
"This is the most awesome app I have ever experienced!! All my health records, tests, Dr's visits, their notes, etc... available with just access to the internet!!! And it works! That software company needs to be contracted by the Florifa DEO to fix their reemployment system!!?",
"Very good app but the reminders a bit overdone, I only need one..Also they should clean up the opening screen, some of the stuff seems a bit too overbearing.",
"You can't pay your bills anymore! I just got a ""60 days late"" notice from my clinic, and there's STILL no billing information on the app! I know I used to pay through here, and it was *brilliant* - I don't know what's changed. There's no info on the website version either, so SOMETHING has gone horribly sideways. What happened, y'all?",
"Love this app! I can communicate with my doctor and the nurse is so much easier. I get quick responses, better than if I would call. You can see results of your test and your x-rays way before you see your doctor. Helps you worry less.",
"I get notifications saying I have a new messages but I can't find them. Messages sometimes disappears. I don't get all my test results. Being a heart transplant patient, I'm afraid I'll miss something important so it's useless to me.",
I've been using this app for over a year & have loved using it!My old Dr.used to work for University Healthcare & was always available to message if I needed any questions answered on this app!I would get this app & install it on your phone if you have a MyChart account!I can also message my former nurse/care manager on this app as well!Get this app & install it!You won't be steered wrong!,
"Too many Drs on it and it gets crazy and too hard to navigate. It's not clear where to go, and using back button spits you back out. I really hate using my chart but every Dr wants me to and requires it almost. I hate this app.",
"Clear on all of the information for your appointments, easy to read and if any questions there are numbers to call. Very helpful and you can read all of the notes about your visits. Can also schedule, cancel or reschedule appointments.",
It's great to be able to see all your appointments and test results,
It's good. Makes thing go faster.,
"Love this app, it makes everything so much easier to access.",
"This is the most user friendly, informative, convenient app I've ever used for my healthcare. Definitely worth downloading and using for all of your healthcare and communication needs. Excellent!!!",
I really appreciate the MyChart app. It is so helpful to have all my Parkview Doctors notes and test results in one place ! It's so easy to use and has made my life easier when it comes to my health care. Thank you !!,
"The app is awesome! It's nice being able to access your medical records without having to call the doctor's office, request the records, go to the office to pick them up or wait for staff to fax or email them. It's also, a great way to communicate directly with all of your doctor's. I highly recommend downloading the app.",
Love the app. Use it daily due to chronic illness. Only suggestion I have would be the ability to upload a pic so a Dr can see if you need an appt asap or it can wait. And for drs to be able to upload images from scans would be nice. But it's a really good app.,
I don't like the updated version of mychart . When u msg ur Dr. It doesn't spell out ur msg correctly it scrambles ur msg up very Badly and u can't update your address everything is all mixed up 🤔 put it back to the way it was and u can't get current doctor appts !! what's going on this isn't right.,
"Will not open. It said it cannot comunicate with server. Works on the web. They keep changing the format, and they get worse every time. If you want to send a message, you can't see what you type..",
"I had recent brain surgery & this app has made managing appointments, doctor's notes & payments easy. It's so helpful to have everything in one place. I use this app every day. I love it, thank you.",
Fantastic app. Highly recommend for everyone,
"Functionally worthless. Slow, clunky UI. Your information doesn't update. When things start going wrong with the app, there's no way to get help in the app. Why was I required to get this garbage?",
"Keeps me abreast of my Dr. Appts. and health status. Also, gives me the option to send my Drs. a message without having to wait on the phone. It would be nice if there was an option to recognize an employee for a special service that he or she performed!",
Always at your fingertips and up to date. Love the pre check in. If all the marbles are rolling in the right direction your messages are promptly answered. Easy peasy!,
"My Chart gives me access to any of my records & test results. I like being able to have & control of my own records, test results, & Drs notes. I'm able to make appts, ask a ?, Or refill meds online. I've always got answers the same day I've contacted the Dr. It has a reminder for all my appts which is nice if you have a lot of appts with different Drs. If you have a busy life or busy taking care of children MyChart helps to make sure your taking care of yourself as well.",
"Server has been down for a few weeks now, can't read my messages from the doctor",
"This is a great app, as long as your team is the one to receive your messages. They respond quickly and are ready to help. The only flaw is when your team is unavailable, your message goes unanswered for days, if it ever gets answered at all.",
I no longer can connect through this app. I don't understand what's wrong. I've done everything since the latest update and it has completely failed and no one can help me so incredibly disappointed.,
"Easy to use, and is updated instantly. There seems to be no possibility to input something myself, like it tells me that my wellness visit is overdue, but I went and apparently the Dr.'s office did not enter it.",
"Naming the app ""my"" is obnoxiously possessive. With minimal configurability and only allowing epic based data sources I removed the app as soon as I got my results. Big brother still has them I'm sure but so it goes.",
Great app everything is all safely stored in one place. Only issue i have is requesting my refills. You have to make an appointment to see your doctor to get your refills. Still it's a awesome app.,
"I absolutely love getting access any records or appointment information I need right from an app. You can schedule and check dates for appointments, send messages to your doctors, refill prescriptions, and even access medical files like x-rays and lab results!",
"Sub par, appointments need to update once completed. Update: per your reply, old or past appointments should not show unless you search under past visits and not be clumped in ALL visits.",
Easy to use with complete access to information.,
"Would have been five star but, there are a couple dates that are wrong and list of procedures that were never done, that says were done. Accuracy is not 100%. Other than that it's a great app",
"Very helpful app. for keeping track of all of my appointments, test results, and referrals.",
"This is an awesome application. It allows my doctors to coordinate directly with me and for me to interface directly with them. I can see my medication, I can ask questions, and there's an assortment of other tasks that can be done. I suppose there are privacy concerns that are important to many but frankly I'm not sure there are any secrets anymore anyway. I do believe however, that the developers did their best to keep confidential information confidential. Dave Merritt, Chester, Virginia",
"The previous version made sense and was simple to use, but this is just a mess and doesn't work half the time. Sometimes I wish I could just look at a calendar to see where my appointments are but it doesn't have that option.",
All of your medical info in one place associated with docs who interact with MyChart. Very well organized and convenient. Covid vaccine records are there in QR scan form for traveling purposes. The app does a national database search for the info. Medication list is there plus all medical records and appt attended.,
Great app to have to manage your healthcare needs!,
I didn't have any trouble with my televisits but then since this spring I haven't been able to connect with my provider at all and now it's June and I have tried once a month for the last 3 or 4 months and I still cannot get a hold of him. This is very frustrating.,
"It is so convenient to access notes from my doctor(s), test results, appointment reminders, and pre-appointment check in available on my phone. I also line the convenience of my children's ""Charts"" linked to mine.",
"At first the app would not download from the Play Store despite numerous attempts on different dates. So finally it download from Chrome browser on mobile device, attempted logging into numerous my chart accounts (in app) from different facilities, but message stated ”app out of date, before proceeding needed to update the app"". What gives?",
I love that I can see my info any time day or nite!,
"Great app! So easy to schedule and cancel appointments, read prescriptions, check appointment history, change medical coverage information etc. Very glad to have this app.",
"I absolutely LOVE this app! It's positively WONDERFUL about submitting scripts for refills! Instead of leaving a message for a busy nurse to sit down & hear messages @ the end of a tiring day & THEN send them to the Dr to approve the NEXT day, all info is right in front of them & instead of the prerequisite ""allow 72 business hours"".....blah blah blah. I've seen me put it in late on a Sunday night & get a text from my pharmacy BEFORE noon the following morning! Totally awesome dude 👍🏻",
The app is very nice but im trying to change photo but is not working thanks,
"📌 Sharpen your crayons kids and go back to the drawing board. This app sucks. 5 out of 5 doctors agree. That's really not fair, one of them should not be a doctor, but I digress. The app is ridiculous. It emails me constantly and when I log in there's nothing. Also it has so many mistakes in my history. After what it took to get my name spelled right. I hate it. Why is there no place for the patient to leave notes or correct our doctor's lies and innuendos. Godspeed-",
I have had difficulty changing info. I tried to change my emergency contact and it froze on the County when I was entering her address. I tried it multiple different time periods....very frustrating. I will just have it changed in an office.,
Difficult 2 get in. Keeps saying error or going back 2 sign in page.,
I can't pay my bill through the app. It just redirects you back to the start. I've called on this and have to wait on hold to pay my bill. I had been able to pay using the app but now I can't and it's since been 2yrs.,
"After update, my insurance keeps clearing after I input it. Have input it multiple times now and when doing pre visit steps, it states no coverage on file.",
"I check to see results of tests but when I ask a question it never goes through. It comes back to ""ask a question"". I find if this doesn't work then it is useless to me. Fix it !!",
"Love it for scheduling appointments, because ARC DOES NOT 🚫 answer the phone. Also good for getting results of test and office visits. Bonus! You can add others to your Account so you can see whole family in one login.",
"Overall, this is a fabulous app and a wonderful way to coordinate all my Healthcare. HOWEVER - It seems ridiculous to have the app check me in, and then I still have to check in at the desk. What a waste of my time to check in on the app at all.",
For some reason everytime i open app it takes me to play store then have to hit open?,
"There was a lot of information coming at me and my family while I was in the hospital. The MyChart app made things much easier to understand, as well as being able to forward info to other healthcare providers. Total transparency, a very powerful tool.",
It been good so far haven't had any problems,
I live this app. Everything u need to know like test results or appointments,
"Server always seems to be down, I can hardly ever see my after visit Sunday or doctor's notes",
This app is not only very useful but informative too. It reminds you of appointments you may not have or in your diary and you can read all of your medical information. From letters following scans to post op observations.,
Doesn't even save your log in. Your browser is MUCH better than this worthless app. Ironically reading the positive reviews they mistake the app for the service. It IS great in your web browser. But as I mentioned don't WASTE your time with the app.,
This app has been a lifeline for me and my health needs. Works great.,
"Really like my chart, great way to correspond with my Doctor.",
"There should be an option to remove the section that lists goals on the main home screen of the app, as mine lists personal information that I would not want anyone else who may within the viewable distance from my screen to see.",
Great app links everyone. Everything in one place is awsome,
Me an my family has been treated with care an compassion while dealing with my cancer an this app is a massive blessing keeping up with everything.,
It would be better if there was a way to double check whether providers received requests for appointments. I have sent 2 requests to the same provider for an appointment with no response... Did they get it? No idea.,
Great App User Friendly Very helpful for all to use.,
Always happy with the amount of time of response to questions.,
Make things easier Like to comunique with them !!,
"Love this app very easy, keeps me informed of all my past,present,and future medical information.",
Needs more features maybe even a video call/meeting option.,
I always have to re-verify even though I'm using my finger print. I was thinking that I was talking to my daughter's doctors office. Someone else messaged me back saying that I needed to contact her doctors office 😐 ......I was under the impression that this app was linked to the doctors office portal.....they shouldn't tell people that this is a quick and easy way to speak with your child's medical team because it's just a flat out lie....🤨😐😑😶🤦🏾‍♀️🤔,
Great way to learn and understand better our medical health but don't fool yourself into believing what you read because the ways and means of any professional practice are far beyond our ability to assess and interpret. But the service is the next best thing for all curious patients.,
A pain to use. The Email notification log in worked well. With the stupid new app when I go back in to the regular one it gets in a loop. Useless. I di not need a disfunctional app.,
I love having all my test or appt info all in one,
I love the convienance of having access to all of my medical records in one place.,
"Can not schedule an appointment. It prompts me to select appointment type, but the screen is blank. Do not have the ability to send messages to my dr. App says ""no available recipient"".",
It doesn't work most of the time. I log in and I get the first page with menu then when i try to see something it doesn't load,
"It's great helps me keep up with appointments, and even reminds me of new ones. Also gives you information about the appointment you just finished. You ask questions and even sign up for assistance if you need it.",
Seamless control of everything medical! Great app.,
Why can I NEVER make an appointment through this app!? It's ridiculous!,
"Upgrade made it impossible to sign in with my code # , very annoying",
I enjoy my virtual visits with Dr.G Khuns.& it's so convenient and it's so nice to go on there for my prescriptions set up an appointment with my doctor or the hospital is wonderful I love that MyChart and it saves time.,
"I use MyChart a lot. I just moved cities, so I like I can have my old city MyChart to get to past records and the new city MyChart to see my new Dr's items.",
This App is very very helpful and give you all the important info you need right in your hands I recomend this App,
Great app! Saves time & travel,
Easy to communicate with your Doctors and their staff.,
Very easy to use!,
Simple and very informative,
The security code doesn't copy to the log in just started doing this,
"Can't link accounts between WA state organization and a TX organization. Spent all day with MyChart teams of either org and still NOTHING. App and web browser MyChart login of old org says ""cannot authenticate external acct"" of new org. New org MyChart doesn't even give search option to link accts. Both teams at a loss to troubleshoot after 7 phone calls.",
Very nice and helpful to have this,
"My Advent Health provider wanted me to download this app and once you try and select a health provider, Advent Health or even Aetna is not an option....something isn't right, so one star review it is.",
"I'm not able to schedule appointments, only cancel them",
Wonderful app! Easy and efficient!,
"Excellent app. Make appts, cancel appts, receive reminders about health matters, send notes to your medical team, see your lab results, see which prescriptions you are prescribed... Great app!!",
Very good setup and easy to use.,
Easy to navigate through.,
I have not been able to access my info it says server error please fix,
Very well thought out and detailed layout. Easy communication with my MD's. Each update gets better.,
Great app to help and keep up with appointments and questions,
"Comprehensive, and easy to use!",
Awesome. I don't miss my appointments with this app.,
"This is the best thing for me, do to I can get my family medical history.",
I can keep up with all my appointments very good app,
I love having access to see all of my records and billing in one place. It makes it so easy to manage my Healthcare. Thank you.,
"A very useful app! Since update, however, it is very slow to load, and stays on the main screen for several minutes. Not sure why",
Absolute garbage. Make an account MULTIPLE TIMES and can never ever sign in. All I want are my covid results. It's BS that they can text you 100x leading up to the covid test and then when it's time to see the results you all the sudden need this account? Why not text them to me you f*****s!,
"I would be lost without this app. So much information and all my appts..past and present. My test results.. everything I can think of at my finger tips..all my doctors..medication.. even suggestions of vaccines, scans & test needed. Approaching my age I appreciate all the help and aid I can get. Thanks MyChart.",
Sometimes I have a hard time accessing. But I enjoy the convenience of accessing my information and my providers.,
"The app is extremely convenient for communicating with my doctors for setting appointments, asking questions and receiving lab results, not to mention virtual visits. A must have app for me...",
Doctors keep being removed from messaging/scheduling.,
"Brilliant, I can see all my son's test results 😎 Would be nicer if there was a graph plotted with all the blood test results.",
It's a very informative app,
I love this app. I enjoy the fact that most of my medical information is just a finger tip (portal) away. The app seems to be user friendly because I can find my way around easily. I enjoy how quickly things are updated ie. doctor's note(s) from visit.,
I love how I have instant access to me an my children test results and medicines. Its like my records on the go. Can't ask for a better app. I give 5 stars,
"The app did not send 2 of the last 3 refills I requested to the pharmacy. I was asked to email developers, which I did. No response and the problem still exists, it is getting my refill requests to my pharmacy. Very disappointing.",
I like being able to combine all of my Doctors into one app. This is very convenient for me to lookup all of my medical records.,
"Love ""My Chart"". Things are so much easier.",
It's easy to use and gives lots of information.,
Really helps keep all medical records in one place.,
"Helpful overall, really unnecessary to have to log in to different clinics/organizations. Do this in the backend where patients aren't required to navigate, no one knows or cares if their provider is with St Charles or Summit or anywhere else.",
Quality of Life dr in anniston al DOES NOT even use it.,
A huge thank you to Valley Health Milton!!! Dr. Dillon and support staff always helps in anyway they can. My gratitude is overflowing for the help you have given me!!!,
"Very easy to navigate, all the needed information is there, your doctors, appointments, payments, messages",
Not much to say I get the results before the doctor calls to tell what they are,
I've enjoyed this until they added Oklahoma University now it won't let me see most dtuff.,
The app is easy to use and provides quick access to medical information.,
"So nice to have everything from records to test(s) / shot(s) due, Message your MUSC doctors, pay bill, pre check in for upcoming appts, schedule / change / cancel appts all in one spot. User friendly interface. If you deal w/ MUSC - even for a COVID 19 test ... download the app.",
"I like the app,but I lose my password occasionally and I have a hassle getting it to reset,wish this could be fixed its a pain!",
Easy to access and to get in touch with a provider,
Having to reset passwords too often and have a password keeper. Take too much messing around.,
"Used to work but now it doesn't. I can't see my upcoming appointments, look at my test results, or do anything that would help me with my care. The app is up to date, but it doesn't work properly. This is my ONLY way of seeing my appointments. Please fix this.",
Missing helpful features that are available through the mobile website such as viewing the history of lab results and seeing them on a chart.,
"MyChart has made life easier as messaging, ordering prescriptions, seeing test results and appointments coming and scheduling.",
Easy to use and navigate,
"Absolutely LOVE my MyChart! I am able to communicate with my Dr. (Who is also the best Dr. EVER!) I can easily reach my Dr. If I have questions about my medications, any upcoming tests & blood work that needs to be done. This App is laid out perfectly! Reminders are sent to your phone if it is time for prescription refills, & if you run outof refills, you can request more refills online & your Dr. Can quickly get that done. Like I said. it's awesome! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!",
"Excellent app. I love it very easy to access and all your information is safe and secure. I will refer to all my family and the community. Thank You, The creation of this app is 👏👌💯⭐ MRS. ARNOLD",
Makes my life so much easier everything at my fingertips so much information,
Easy to use and very informative,
I must say MyChart is pretty easy. I have had it for several years now. I wish I could have my husband on my account or just handle other adults on the account with there permission because it would be easier to know about appointment's or sending messages to the Dr I just handle all that stuff so we always have someone home to take care of the little ones and don't double book appointment's but I did figure out a loop hole if they send me the message I just put account and password & I'm in.,
"It's easy to use, you can check in for appointments before you arrive so when you do arrive, just give them your name, and you're ready to see the Dr. You can also send and receive messages to and from your providers and request prescription refills. Works for me!!",
"Excellent App, allows me to view my medical results and share said results with any medical providers I have, even during traveling.",
"This actually has been a great app, I also combined it with my UT physicians app so they're like in a group app. I can do that now and it's convenient.",
I like the app it's a great tool to have,
Great tool to find appts and test results,
This app really helps to save time and gives me direct communication with my health care professionals.,
"I love this app! As a cancer patient, I have so many appointments to keep up with, but MyChart makes it incredibly easy to do. I have access to lab results and doctors' notes after each appointment. I am so thankful for the ease and convenience.",
Better communication than phone and emails due to faster results review and medications logging of changes.,
"I love the My Chart App having easy immediate access to my appts, test results, what I need to do as far as setting up appts and the ability to leave a message for my Dr & his nurses. I definitely recommend the app",
"I love this app it's so great to keep track of when my child has a appointment coming up, and I can schedule or message the doctor if I have any concerns or questions.",
Makes it easy to access my information and check in for appointments,
This app is so easy to use. I like that I can log on see my test results and if I need them for any reason I can print them out and I love being able to message my doctor or a nurse and I like that we can now see our radiology images. I also like how I get to schedule an appointment with my Dr or with another Dr.,
My chart is very helpful to keep in touch with my Dr. Easy to use.,
"Very efficient at keeping me up-to-date on labs, lab results & medical appointments.",
Excellent way to see doctor when already a patient and live > 100 miles and no change in status just need checkup. Thank you very much.,
This app is terrible compared to the app I used before for my medical. I don't know why they switched but this sucks.,
The best maintained and performing app out there.,
MyChart is very handy & easy to use.,
Fairly easy to use & navigate,
Excellent for keeping track of medical info,
Having issues logging in. Telling me there is a server issue to try again later. Has been doing this for the last 2 days. Very frustrating when trying to get appointments made.,
An extremely useful app! Has helped me alot concerning management of my appointments and medication.,
Not user friendly and many times bill will not show to be paid,
Love it. It is so nice to keep up with everything,
The app works great the only problem is is the hospitals utilize this format do blatantly disregard keeping the information current and up-to-date well as giving you a format to delete any and all information that you do not want on it when you requested over and over and over again to their persons in charge of this app at the hospital at which it is being utilized for. The CEO each entity hospital represents should get on mid-management and the executive management to address this immediately,
It's easy to use and I love it,
Better than a phone call!,
Very user friendly..No more calls.. We love it.,
I really appreciate being able to have the app as it is very user-friendly.,
Sux. Very hard to navigate when the pages time out and reset.,
Easy to use. Love the previsit log in.,
I have a very good experience with this app and found it very useful until this week when the app was changed. Now there is no fingerprint login option. BJC is my provider.,
"There is no need for hold times via the phone or anxiously waiting for the return call from your Dr or his nurse any longer. You can virtually get every answer to any question or access to all of your medical information so any current or past info you may need regarding your medical , is at your fingertips. Incredibly convenient is the words that come to mind.",
I downloaded the app and have yet to be able to use it. Everytime I log in it tells me that the Terms and Conditions could not be loaded to try back a later time. Well its been a week now and still the same message...,
I can't look at my messages or even look at my medication or send a message just started acting up this week,
"Every time I attempt getting into the ""medications"" section, I get logged out of the application. Messages saying ""server error"" pop up in almost every section. Not helpful.",
Fantastic my test result is lost in this app. 3hrs waiting in line just to get qtips up my nose. The app doesn't recognize my username and refuse to let me reset the damn password meanwhile you call those people nobody answer and you wonder why NY have to worst case of covid out there. I'm walking out there no knowing my status. Women have kits for pregnancy let us have ours for this and leave us alone with your bad service,
Ready to use and understand,
"It is great multiple main medical providers use this app.( Wellstar / Tsnner and Emory) are the 4 I know of. Ot easy to use for refilling meds , packing to a nurse seeing yest results and making appointments. I think it is a great app. More medical providers need to use ot.",
"Makes everything about all my doctors etc so much easier. I can send messages, get prescription refills pay bills and keep track of all my appointments. I haven't had any issues!",
"I did not give this application permission to be installed. Furthermore, the suspect transaction that triggered this makes no sense, as no personally significant healthcare provider is listed. Something is quite wrong. Uninstalled as soon as this is posted.",
I like the messaging part. The app still shows a surgery referral although I had that surgery almost a year ago and the referring person no longer works there. Slightly annoying.,
You can view your blood work faster and you can look up Dr appointments. Love it !!,
"It is great! So easy leave a message and the doctor's call you back, I feel this makes my life stress free! I've got doctors , dentist, and my orthopedic doctors all on one app! Thank you for making my life a little easier!!",
"This portal is a lifesaver to me..My providers answer quickly. No more calling them and waiting for calls back, test results can be reviewed, meds, and so much more. I can't say enough good things about it..",
"This app has been a god send, My husband had a long stay in the hospital, and this app had all the information I needed to stay up to date when I couldn't be there. It is also very easy to message with Doc's and schedule appointments.",
"Was a good app, just stopped working randomly. I have been trying to log in for days now and it just will not let me because of the terms and conditions not want to load. I have new and important messages to read there but I can't see them. How can I fix this?",
I don't know where I would be without my MyChart... It keeps track of all my doctor's appointments and physical therapy. And if I have a question it's right there for an answer. Happy,
"Setup password, tried to log in and it failed 5 times, setup another, same thing, tried to setup a third password, and everyone did the same thing. I can't give it a lower rating or I would..",
"My new OBGYN introduced me to this app. &text it to my phone to show me how to set it up. It's super user friendly, very informative & I love that you can receive results w/in a few hrs & also chat w/your Doctor. I will definitely make sure my family members & friends are using this app. I would give it more than 5 stars 🌟 if I could.",
"The app does not tell you what/where to find the new message/ test result/appointment/prescription refill... It simply lets you know that SOMETHING has been updated/ sent to your chart, then you have to go to 5-7 places to find out what it is.",
I'm glad to be able to have this app it saves a lot of time and worries,
Excellent app to have so one has access to their medical records. Past and future appointment records. Meds through pharmacy are easily refilled through app. Give on control to allowing others granted access as wanted.,
"App seems to be getting better. However, app collects a lot of personal data like email, 1st & last name etc. to sell. I am not ok with this.",
I couldn't load my messages or past or future appointments for me or my son on the app but was able to access them on the browser but it takes a long time for it to load. It has been very helpful when it works properly.,
Won't let me pay bills in app. I log in and it says I have a balance soni click on it to pay. It asks for the card information but when I enter it there is to option to submit or continue. The only options available are back and cancel.,
What are the best apps very satisfied with my chart I recommended for everyone signed Bob welke,
Love that I can go on my chart to see upcoming apts and don't have to call into he clinic and wait for a long time and hold up the lines for someone else who might have a need that is more urgent than mine.,
"I HIGHLY recommend MyChart!! I love being able to get tests results within a few hours, e-checking in for appointments, and going back to check results from a few years ago to make comparisons. I am my husband's caregiver and I honestly don't know what I'd do without MyChart!!!",
"Everything I need is in one place. I can easily communicate with my Doctor(s), schedule appointments, review my test results, etc., for me it that's important.",
"Great system for keeping all your medical records in one spot, and to keep track of appointments. I use both the Android and Windows versions.",
it only lists 2 of my doctors and I cannot add the others... plus when I checked in for an appointment I had to manually add all of my medical history and then none of it saved in the MyChart app... so I am going to have to do it again.. . this is ridiculousness..,
"This app is easy to use, I can access my test results and easy to make/cancel future appointments. When I message my doctor I get fast responses. Today tho I cannot get on due to error but could be the system is down.",
"I thought I could just log in with the user ID and password I used to register through CVS's website. However, it asked for my state and then listed participating healthcare facilities in that state - and I did not see CVS among them.",
I would rate this app a 5 star; however I have tried multiple times to verify my phone number by having a text sent to my phone and it NEVER sends the code. It's very annoying to have to have it sent to my email instead,
Extremely pleased for the support through the app.,
Best app for staying in contact with my doctors and getting the test results in an efficient manner. Kudos to the development team and the coding specialists,
Compared to many other medical applications I am forced to use. This one is a really nice change. It works well does what it is intended to do and gives me an easy and quick portal to access my doctor and doctor's office,
"Frustrated!! I downloaded, created an account, log in, pass and when I attempt to log in for results, it says log in not valid. Keeps bouncing me around and can't get in. Is there something I should know? Poss. Doing something wrong? Ugghh",
This has been wonderful having all my health information at my fingertips. Being able to see notes from the doctor is great. Alot less waiting & wondering what is going on,
"We've been with the same insurance company for many, many years & when this app began getting used by medical personnel & their notes about visits, appointments, messages and request refills for medicines; I saw the potential for fewer medical errors & this app gives control back to the patients! #YayIris [Additional optional info below, I answered via the star rating, the first being 5☆ bc to my knowledge there aren't any ads inside the app, idt!]",
"Very easy to use, makes communication with my Doctor super easy. I also get to schedule appointments and check on all lab results through the app.",
"Excellent App. Get confirmations of hospital visits, test results, etc. straight away without having to wait weeks for a letter! All medical appointments etc together in one place.",
"MyChart used to have a tab to keep the username. It doesn't have that feature on the new updated MyChart. Every app has a ""Remember Me"" feature, except MyChart. It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying.",
"This app now takes up more storage than Facebook! If you made it like that, you could at least program it so it can be put on an SD card!!! I have space issues and may have to delete it.",
"Easy to use. For people complaining about the screenshots use the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner to access the app preferences, I there you can enable screenshots.",
"VERY POOR scheduling feature. Too easy to schedule doctor appointment for the wrong day, which is of course, medically dangerous. There ought to be safeguards for a sick person trying to schedule. I WILL NEVER USE THAT FEATURE AGAIN. It's not worth the risk!",
"Very confusing, multiple entries",
POS app. I can use the MyChart web page just fine. However the app has been impossible to recognize my account. The user interface for creating an account without an access code appears to be created by amatures.,
Very easy to get around in once you figure it all out,
Junk. Says there is a new version right out of the box. Edit 13/7: Still garbage. Unusable because it says there's a newer version available even after a fresh install from the store.,
This was so hard to navigate I tried several times to set it up and had difficulty every time. I'm not sure whether I actually got it set up or not. All I want to know if the results of my covid test,
Could not create an account didn't like my name and password that I used to try to log in. Kept trying to figure out what was wrong and eventually it just bomed my account totally. Says to contact my chart. Gives no info how to contact them.,
Very attentive with patients..,
It's not bad. Can't clear reminders. My doc ordered a test. 6 months ago. I had the test done. Results were loaded into my chart by testing facility. Reminder to have testing done is still there.,
I love that I can connect with my Dr. and see all of my health information.,
I absolutely love this! I can get in touch with my doctors of I don't have a chance to actually call with no background noise. I can also see test results and records from prior visits which helps when you don't have the greatest memory.,
"Fantastic app, keeps track of all my appointments, past,present and future! I receive all my test results as fast as the doctor gets them! The only thing I am still waiting for is an update of my vaccinations.",
"I absolutely love My Chart. I like being able to get my test results faster, having access to all of my records, but most of all, I like being able to make, change, and confirm my appointments online without have to wait on the phone forever to talk to someone. I can get answers to my questions right from my Dr so much faster then waiting for someone in the office to call me back. I also like knowing that if I have to go to another hospital for emergency treatment, that my Dr can see those notes",
"Can't find where I can print from a mobile device. I always like to keep a copy of my lab work. Also, having trouble viewing past ""relpy"" messages from my doctors. I have to find my original message that I sent.",
Have to use it wish there was something better. Give me an alert to schedule but then tells me I am ineligible. Can't dismiss the alert so it clutters the screen. Hard to navigate,
I like having my information easily accessible. I would like to add a picture on my own instead of having one taken off of the internet. Being to change that would be very helpful.,
App is awful. Great that one can view test results but the video never works for appointments....I've ensured the permissions allow for mic and camera...nothing.,
"Useful! Message doctors and Healthcare providers directly. Analyze your med exam results directly on the website/app. The app itself crashes sometimes, but much more useful than literally millions of other apps!",
User friendly and very convenient!,
It's very convenient and you can do it all through the app,
"The UM clinic phones have changed to a main distribution center then they route to clinic, horrible experience everytime! The app will give you quicker responce times then the phone most of the time since the phones changed.",
"I've had to make appointments/cancel appointments and check test results. This app has made it easy for me to get the information I need without haveing to call, get transferred and waiting on hold. I would recommend it to anyone.",
"Very useful in keeping up on your health. It's nice to be able to communicate with your care team via the app, schedule appointments and check any test results you may have.",
"It really bothers me that my vaccines and preventative services, (ie. Colonoscopies, bone density , mammograms ...) are NEVER correct on MyChart. I have had them ALL but there is no way to update any of them except for the flu vaccine. Even after Dr. visits these do not get updated. Frustrating!",
"Absolutely useless! Doesnt tell you anything , doesnt even let you delete wrong or old meds but will delete if you swipe on diagnosis to see if it give you definition which it doesnt. Billing even stinks ! No dates of service just a total of what THEY say. Worst app Iv ever used seriously.",
I find this app very helpful and easy to use,
"Once I was able to figure it out, for the most part, it had been wonderful to be able to refer back to it to talk with new doctors or urgent care or the ER. It's nice to have all of my medical info in one location.",
Very nice app but since not all my doctors are using it. I thinks I don't have health care visits set. It would be great to be able to add providers appointments not affiliated with Englewood Hospital. My regular doctor isn't affiliated with any hospital.,
Well its extremely hard to use. Notifications never come to my phone. Things don't get updated. I'm left in the dark because everything is done through the app so basically my health-care is worse than before this app,
"Love this app. Has everything I need for appointments at my hands. However, it will not let me verify my phone number. I click verify so it can send a code via text and nothing happens.",
It's so helpful everything is right there when needed to be found,
"Very handy and a huge time saver for non-urgent inquiries, reviewing results, and so forth. There is a bug in the biometric login: when you enable biometrics login for one organization it breaks it for other organizations.",
"Smartest Idea in a long time! Easy Contact with Entire medical team. No calls for Refills,just Request. Many Hospitals involved,Your Drs( most) are connected to one of them usually. Easy also,..Well Done..Try it FYI.. IF not working on your Device, I can safely say,The App Is Strong,well made. Clean Ur device/ CK Permissions. Promise,It's Solid!",
"Wow?????!!! Just installed and entered my password and keep getting an error message that terms and conditions could not be loaded. Multiple times. So far, just like Honor Health, this app is awful.",
I haven't been able to login through the app. constantly tells me my info is wrong and when I select to reset it I get an error message. I'm not even sure this app is available and running.,
"Easy to navigate and find or make schedules for appointments, for someone who forgets most the time the alarm function has been helping a lot .",
Doctor Penhall is very good and I enjoy my appointment.,
"I keep getting emails about updates to my record. When i go to MyChart to see them, there is nothing new and/or no clue where the new info would be. Its a waste of time!",
I can see my results before dr visit and its a history of medical records plus appt and ability to ask nurse questions.,
Great to have health information quickly. Menu navigation a little tricky. Some reminders stay too long. Follow up with practice if no response rarely needed.,
Very easy to use and extremely helpful. You get messages to remind you of certain things that you need done such as vaccines and wellness screening. Love this app!,
The best way to keep track and understand your medical,
It's SO frustrating that I can't change any settings. I've paid my bills by mail for 45+ years and this downgrade to only communicating with my phone is disappointing!,
1. I'd like to scroll thru my Lab results INSTEAD OF viewing 1 result at a time. 2. I'd like to Bookmark more than 1 message at a time. 3. I'd like the Bookmarked messages moved to its own page(s). 4. I'd like to Delete more than 1 message at a time. 5. How long do I have to RESTORE Deleted messages???,
MyChart has become easier to access and use. It's easy to leave a message for Provider Team although it may take 24 hrs or more to receive a reply. I like MyChart very much now compared to 4 or 5 yrs ago. The three questions below can't be fully read.,
Long delays accessing information.,
I appreciate this app. Test results at my finger tips . I have a direct line of communication with my entire health care team . I simply leave a message in the app and they message me back within an hour . Great job Wake Forest for using MyChart. Believe me I have shared this with them,
"Excellent for scheduling appointments, and communicating with my provider. I do wish the reminders could actually be removed instead of sleeping and keep coming back.",
"MyChart is very easy to use. I like being able to send messages back and forth with my doctor or the nurse, rather than calling. It helps to keep up with appointment dates, past and future. All your doctors on one App! Awesome!",
get uptodate info before it arrives in the post very good app,
"Very convenient for checking test results, refill prescriptions, Dr. appointments.",
Easy to navigate. Fast. New data arrives quickly. Layout quite good.,
Makes you able to access medical records and send messages to doctors. Even gives you access to images from testing. Essential for reviewing and sharing medical records and obtaining documentation from visits/tests. Allows doctors across different organizations to review all MyChart records through linked accounts.,
Amazing and timely,
I did really like how it worked and used it frequently. Especially while at a Dr visit for dates and discuss ion but since last update it is slower and I even have problems bringing it up it takes forever. Not really happy right now.,
"Great app. All your records on your phone. Well managed. Love being able to ask questions and get a quick response, schedule appointments, and request med refills.",
"App has really come a long way. I can message with my doctor, schedule appointments, see my records, and do the same for family members in my care. Seems to have strong security in place, too, while being relatively easy to use.",
Some appointments can make online but earlier ones are found by calling nurse. Has messages to doctor and test results. Would be nice to have access to doctor notes and which medicines not to take or what to do after check ups. 4/5! Edit.. Cant contact mental services or doctor. Video phone appts are questionable and sometimes cancelled. Need to inform patients when services are closed for holiday to be able to go to er. Other options are hidden and dont work or send you out of app. Needsupdate!,
My Chart is a very awesome app. It makes sure that you get your test results on time. I'm really happy that I downloaded it and installed it. Such a great app. Thank you for making it for me ok. Dennis DiLullo,
"Super easy and helpful when going through my chart, history, and upcoming appointments. Grateful that I have this to go by when I'm on the go as my days have been scheduled. Thank You for having this option to go to.",
App will not work & let me connect to see my results or information because my hospital is not listed & theres no way to add providers that aren't on the list. Well thought out plan guys! Worst app I've ever put on my phone.... congrats,
I REALLY love this app! I have two other medical app systems I use with other doctors. My Chart is by far the easiest and best one out of the three! I LOVE the fact I can help keep my medical and pharmaceutical information current.,
"Fast and easy to get ahold of anyone for help , and instantly notified when you have a next appointment, test results everything on your phone when you need to check ✔ the ladies at the clinic are so helpful & kind. Would definitely recommend 👌",
Easy to use & get in touch with your doc.,
Easy to navigate and great to connect multiple hospitals and portals to have quick access to all your records in one place,
"Very useful app. I am able to schedule, cancel and reschedule appointments with my doctor. I can communicate directly through the app with my doctor any time.",
It's very helpful and useful and very convenient,
"Discrimimating people based on their income - saying there's a newer version although I just downloaded it. I'm sure it's because of code error, not liking my older smartphone with Android 4.4. Not everyone should have the newest gadgets to track their health!",
"It was good for awhile, and then cant sign in everytime i try it say there is a problem with the server , so i had to unistall and delete, it sucks now. I try to sign in way too many time isntall and unistall and make no diference , i was happy at the begining when i srart using it now its bad too bad.",
It is amazing when you have everthing in one place. Never missed an appointment with and less calls made to the doctors office because of this app. It's just great and I'm happy about it.,
"Useless for me right now. Won't let you sign in unless you select a healthcare facility. I don't have one, just wanted to see my MinuteClinic chart but couldn't get past the ""select a facility and sign in"" stage.",
It is exceptionally designed and easy to use. I live being able to do ally pre-visit check in questions before I arrive and also take care of any co-payments. I have used another health organizations mobile app and MyChart is far superior. Well done!,
I absolutely dislike this new MyChart I love the old portal. I cannot email my doctor. It has the wrong as my primary and I cannot change it. I've been trying to refill my medication for 3 weeks I can't get anyone to respond back through the charts or through calling or through Walgreens sending a request. I want the old one back so I can email my doctor directly. Totally dissatisfied,
"When it works, it's fine. However, this app is rarely able to load. Most of the time I get an error message and cannot retrieve new information regarding my care. However, it always works well on my pc.",
"As a senior citizen. I love MyChart. It has all my medications, notes from my doctor's, test results, and all my upcoming appointments all at the tap of my finger. I can easily email my doctor with any questions I might have. It makes my life easier and I love that.",
I will not use this app or give a damn about this app this help you try to download it and then wait for 4 hours or better to talk to a representative to make sure that you are hooked up to the app truly unsatisfactory noise can do better but the employees is just feeling a little too soft and they can just don't answer the phone or call you back when they feel like it I don't have the time this is an app that I would not use or recommend anyone use,
"I really appreciate being able to casually communicate with my health providers, receive messages from them that I can review at my leisure, schedule appointments where I find the best available time, and see my medical history at a glance. It really is helping me keep up with important medical information for my better health.",
"The concept is ideal. Though it would be helpful to be able to schedule more services. Such as testing, lab work, nurse visits..etc. Being charged for ""email/messaging"" your Doctor's through MyChart? Why? Frequently the responses you receive are from nurses or other members of their staff. The nice thing is that you can access test results and are able to schedule some appointments.",
So very useful. I keep track of my appointments and my mother's and scheduling/rescheduling is very easy. I really like the fact that I can see the results of all of her tests and reports on her procedures within hours.,
This app is subpar and has no development oversight. The update email and phone number doesn't work after you confirm. This is restrictive and prohibiting proper access to my medical information. Is that on purpose? Who is accountable?,
I have a new Android so I don't know why I have the problems I have. I try to go to one subject and messaging or tests and it just thinks and thinks and thinks and then goes back to the home screen takes me forever to get any information from this app. If I'm the only one that has this problem I'm sorry I wrote this.,
Works great. Love the trending.,
Easy to use. Messaging and setting up appointments in app is easy. Love that all notes and results are in one place.,
"easy to use, love that I can read my own results",
"This app makes it easy to make appointments, message my doctor, and request refills. It is better and cheaper than going to the doctor's office every time I have a question. The app works smoothly and it is user friendly.",
There's no back button! I get stuck on a page and can't go back to home page. I've even tried the back button on my pull down screen on my LG phone. Previously it worked. But now I can only tap it once. Please fix this issue.,
You can't change the doctor that you want to see. You are forced to select whomever is selected which is only one person in the list. The practice has many doctors. Not sure why you are not allowed to choose others. Poor programming and/or business design.,
A really useful app. It allows real-time access to lab reports and reminders of up coming appointments along with very useful notes on doctors visits. Best app of all my physicians.,
This is a necessary app to have when you are experiencing many health issues. My information is handily available with a click which includes test results and other important items. You should add this to your list!! I highly recommend...,
Mr. Johnson has been a great help to me and appreciate the work he has done for me.,
Try your best to use an IHC hospital everything about them seems to be better. In their app as soon as the labs are tests are done I can see them whether the doctor is seen them or not and it's been that way for years this one it can take days and weeks for results to show up.,
"I don't even know what purpose this app is supposed to serve, since I literally can't access any useful information, message my provider, request an appointment or anything else the app advertises. I just wasted my time signing up for this app because it doesn't actually do anything.",
"I love this option. I was calling the office with my questions and waiting for a callback. Now I just type it in & hit ""send"". I usually get an answer within 48 hrs. My phone will tell me when I have a message ""waiting"". It's great 😃. Saves a lot of time and now I don't have to bug the nurses.",
"I love this app! I'm very forgetful alot of the time and being able to log in and see my appointments makes my life easier. Also, it is great being able to email your doctor instead of having to call on the phone.",
Great app for medical aid 🔥,
"I love this app! It keeps track of all of my appointments, my test results, my medications, and my extensive medical history. I'm able to schedule appointments and email my doctors. Don't change a thing!",
I really enjoy using this app. It offers quick support. You get information updated on the go. You can reach out to your Healthcare provider within the app. All your information in one place. You basically take your records with you wherever you go. Love it.,
"I always have problems logging in using the app, making it unusable 90% of the time. No issues logging into the MyChart desktop site, only the app.",
"This application has always an issue with keeping you to constantly prompt you to update your cellphone and you do follow command and IT DOESN'T WORK? what a waste of time, you'll need to something about this??? Thank you.",
"It's complicated, but I do utilize it, & appreciate it. I'd like to see more functions, with simple patient knowledge. Like, bloodtype for instance, various ailments diagnosed already, etc...",
Great easy user-friendly navigation,
This app is awful to use . I have t change my password at last 2 times a month. This should not be happening. It's a hot mess,
This app really helps me keep up with my appointments and medication,
Been a great app. Then now I can't even get a code to look at my chart. Which I need so I don't have to look up all my papers for new doctor. Need to fix it. I'll just delete it and keep my old way of records. Thank,
"Couldn't remember user name, called help desk (man was very polite) but information given was incorrect and completly useless. Tried to call back within 5 minutes and all I get is a recording.",
Easy way to keep track of ALL medical issues. I absolutely LOVE this app. I can communicate with my Dr.& all the clinicians that are part of my health care very easily. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,
Good and useful with some issues and glitches. Last issue I encountered was booking a test/procedure that requires physical presence but only telephone appointment option was available.,
Very helpful. Easy navigation,
I like this app because it helps me with my appointments. The main issue is trying to log into my account. I kept getting an error telling me that there is a problem with the login and to try again. I did and got the same thing over and over. Needs fixing urgently.,
"I like it,its so simple,except having to wait 48 hours for a question to be answered",
It's been fine can you send me some contact lenses,
"Never had any issues until march 22,2021 The app now is crashing every time I launch it. Unless I uninstall and reinstall then it works for that time . Not sure how to fix the problem.",
It used to be a good app but it removed one of my children's account without my permission and I no longer have access to his information. Like how you gonna remove a child without my permission. He has a huge medical history that has been easily accessible until recently.,
"It's very easy to use, gives to quick access to test results, direct communication with your doctor, the ability to share your medical history quickly. It's just a nice app.",
super slow with poor results. NOT HAPPY can someone get on the stick and fix all these problems. good lord this is totally just terrible. your app does work at all and no communacation of letting us know that you're even looking into this. damm good thing we did not pay for this. come on!! fix it.,
"My chart tells you to call phone numbers that cannot be completed as failed, never answered, or send you on a 4 phone chase that ends up with person answers, they have no idea why you were giving that number. The land lines cannot receive texts. Revive appointment 1 day before.",
"Like the easy use but if someone inputs incorrect information, it is impossible to correct or remove it & no one is knowledgeable for correcting this. Such as updating ""Coverage Details"" or ""COVID Vaccinating Record"". This needs to be updated.",
"After clicking on any link, there is no way to get back to the home screen...very frustrating because I have to close and reopen the app. Also, it would be nice to be able to upload a photo or document.",
"Not dependable. Most everytime I use it I get a 500 message, something about the server. Not sure who has the problem. It's a wonderful tool, if it worked.",
"This is the most awesome app I have ever experienced!! All my health records, tests, Dr's visits, their notes, etc... available with just access to the internet!!! And it works! That software company needs to be contracted by the Florifa DEO to fix their reemployment system!!?",
"Very good app but the reminders a bit overdone, I only need one..Also they should clean up the opening screen, some of the stuff seems a bit too overbearing.",
"You can't pay your bills anymore! I just got a ""60 days late"" notice from my clinic, and there's STILL no billing information on the app! I know I used to pay through here, and it was *brilliant* - I don't know what's changed. There's no info on the website version either, so SOMETHING has gone horribly sideways. What happened, y'all?",
"Love this app! I can communicate with my doctor and the nurse is so much easier. I get quick responses, better than if I would call. You can see results of your test and your x-rays way before you see your doctor. Helps you worry less.",
"I get notifications saying I have a new messages but I can't find them. Messages sometimes disappears. I don't get all my test results. Being a heart transplant patient, I'm afraid I'll miss something important so it's useless to me.",
I've been using this app for over a year & have loved using it!My old Dr.used to work for University Healthcare & was always available to message if I needed any questions answered on this app!I would get this app & install it on your phone if you have a MyChart account!I can also message my former nurse/care manager on this app as well!Get this app & install it!You won't be steered wrong!,
"Too many Drs on it and it gets crazy and too hard to navigate. It's not clear where to go, and using back button spits you back out. I really hate using my chart but every Dr wants me to and requires it almost. I hate this app.",
"Clear on all of the information for your appointments, easy to read and if any questions there are numbers to call. Very helpful and you can read all of the notes about your visits. Can also schedule, cancel or reschedule appointments.",
It's great to be able to see all your appointments and test results,
It's good. Makes thing go faster.,
"Love this app, it makes everything so much easier to access.",
"This is the most user friendly, informative, convenient app I've ever used for my healthcare. Definitely worth downloading and using for all of your healthcare and communication needs. Excellent!!!",
I really appreciate the MyChart app. It is so helpful to have all my Parkview Doctors notes and test results in one place ! It's so easy to use and has made my life easier when it comes to my health care. Thank you !!,
"The app is awesome! It's nice being able to access your medical records without having to call the doctor's office, request the records, go to the office to pick them up or wait for staff to fax or email them. It's also, a great way to communicate directly with all of your doctor's. I highly recommend downloading the app.",
Love the app. Use it daily due to chronic illness. Only suggestion I have would be the ability to upload a pic so a Dr can see if you need an appt asap or it can wait. And for drs to be able to upload images from scans would be nice. But it's a really good app.,
I don't like the updated version of mychart . When u msg ur Dr. It doesn't spell out ur msg correctly it scrambles ur msg up very Badly and u can't update your address everything is all mixed up 🤔 put it back to the way it was and u can't get current doctor appts !! what's going on this isn't right.,
"Will not open. It said it cannot comunicate with server. Works on the web. They keep changing the format, and they get worse every time. If you want to send a message, you can't see what you type..",
"I had recent brain surgery & this app has made managing appointments, doctor's notes & payments easy. It's so helpful to have everything in one place. I use this app every day. I love it, thank you.",
Fantastic app. Highly recommend for everyone,
"Functionally worthless. Slow, clunky UI. Your information doesn't update. When things start going wrong with the app, there's no way to get help in the app. Why was I required to get this garbage?",
"Keeps me abreast of my Dr. Appts. and health status. Also, gives me the option to send my Drs. a message without having to wait on the phone. It would be nice if there was an option to recognize an employee for a special service that he or she performed!",
Always at your fingertips and up to date. Love the pre check in. If all the marbles are rolling in the right direction your messages are promptly answered. Easy peasy!,
"My Chart gives me access to any of my records & test results. I like being able to have & control of my own records, test results, & Drs notes. I'm able to make appts, ask a ?, Or refill meds online. I've always got answers the same day I've contacted the Dr. It has a reminder for all my appts which is nice if you have a lot of appts with different Drs. If you have a busy life or busy taking care of children MyChart helps to make sure your taking care of yourself as well.",
"Server has been down for a few weeks now, can't read my messages from the doctor",
"This is a great app, as long as your team is the one to receive your messages. They respond quickly and are ready to help. The only flaw is when your team is unavailable, your message goes unanswered for days, if it ever gets answered at all.",
I no longer can connect through this app. I don't understand what's wrong. I've done everything since the latest update and it has completely failed and no one can help me so incredibly disappointed.,
"Easy to use, and is updated instantly. There seems to be no possibility to input something myself, like it tells me that my wellness visit is overdue, but I went and apparently the Dr.'s office did not enter it.",
"Naming the app ""my"" is obnoxiously possessive. With minimal configurability and only allowing epic based data sources I removed the app as soon as I got my results. Big brother still has them I'm sure but so it goes.",
Great app everything is all safely stored in one place. Only issue i have is requesting my refills. You have to make an appointment to see your doctor to get your refills. Still it's a awesome app.,
"I absolutely love getting access any records or appointment information I need right from an app. You can schedule and check dates for appointments, send messages to your doctors, refill prescriptions, and even access medical files like x-rays and lab results!",
"Sub par, appointments need to update once completed. Update: per your reply, old or past appointments should not show unless you search under past visits and not be clumped in ALL visits.",
Easy to use with complete access to information.,
"Would have been five star but, there are a couple dates that are wrong and list of procedures that were never done, that says were done. Accuracy is not 100%. Other than that it's a great app",
"Very helpful app. for keeping track of all of my appointments, test results, and referrals.",
"This is an awesome application. It allows my doctors to coordinate directly with me and for me to interface directly with them. I can see my medication, I can ask questions, and there's an assortment of other tasks that can be done. I suppose there are privacy concerns that are important to many but frankly I'm not sure there are any secrets anymore anyway. I do believe however, that the developers did their best to keep confidential information confidential. Dave Merritt, Chester, Virginia",
"The previous version made sense and was simple to use, but this is just a mess and doesn't work half the time. Sometimes I wish I could just look at a calendar to see where my appointments are but it doesn't have that option.",
All of your medical info in one place associated with docs who interact with MyChart. Very well organized and convenient. Covid vaccine records are there in QR scan form for traveling purposes. The app does a national database search for the info. Medication list is there plus all medical records and appt attended.,
Great app to have to manage your healthcare needs!,
I didn't have any trouble with my televisits but then since this spring I haven't been able to connect with my provider at all and now it's June and I have tried once a month for the last 3 or 4 months and I still cannot get a hold of him. This is very frustrating.,
"It is so convenient to access notes from my doctor(s), test results, appointment reminders, and pre-appointment check in available on my phone. I also line the convenience of my children's ""Charts"" linked to mine.",
"At first the app would not download from the Play Store despite numerous attempts on different dates. So finally it download from Chrome browser on mobile device, attempted logging into numerous my chart accounts (in app) from different facilities, but message stated ”app out of date, before proceeding needed to update the app"". What gives?",
I love that I can see my info any time day or nite!,
"Great app! So easy to schedule and cancel appointments, read prescriptions, check appointment history, change medical coverage information etc. Very glad to have this app.",
"I absolutely LOVE this app! It's positively WONDERFUL about submitting scripts for refills! Instead of leaving a message for a busy nurse to sit down & hear messages @ the end of a tiring day & THEN send them to the Dr to approve the NEXT day, all info is right in front of them & instead of the prerequisite ""allow 72 business hours"".....blah blah blah. I've seen me put it in late on a Sunday night & get a text from my pharmacy BEFORE noon the following morning! Totally awesome dude 👍🏻",
The app is very nice but im trying to change photo but is not working thanks,
"📌 Sharpen your crayons kids and go back to the drawing board. This app sucks. 5 out of 5 doctors agree. That's really not fair, one of them should not be a doctor, but I digress. The app is ridiculous. It emails me constantly and when I log in there's nothing. Also it has so many mistakes in my history. After what it took to get my name spelled right. I hate it. Why is there no place for the patient to leave notes or correct our doctor's lies and innuendos. Godspeed-",
I have had difficulty changing info. I tried to change my emergency contact and it froze on the County when I was entering her address. I tried it multiple different time periods....very frustrating. I will just have it changed in an office.,
Difficult 2 get in. Keeps saying error or going back 2 sign in page.,
I can't pay my bill through the app. It just redirects you back to the start. I've called on this and have to wait on hold to pay my bill. I had been able to pay using the app but now I can't and it's since been 2yrs.,
"After update, my insurance keeps clearing after I input it. Have input it multiple times now and when doing pre visit steps, it states no coverage on file.",
"I check to see results of tests but when I ask a question it never goes through. It comes back to ""ask a question"". I find if this doesn't work then it is useless to me. Fix it !!",
"Love it for scheduling appointments, because ARC DOES NOT 🚫 answer the phone. Also good for getting results of test and office visits. Bonus! You can add others to your Account so you can see whole family in one login.",
"Overall, this is a fabulous app and a wonderful way to coordinate all my Healthcare. HOWEVER - It seems ridiculous to have the app check me in, and then I still have to check in at the desk. What a waste of my time to check in on the app at all.",
For some reason everytime i open app it takes me to play store then have to hit open?,
"There was a lot of information coming at me and my family while I was in the hospital. The MyChart app made things much easier to understand, as well as being able to forward info to other healthcare providers. Total transparency, a very powerful tool.",
It been good so far haven't had any problems,
I live this app. Everything u need to know like test results or appointments,
"Server always seems to be down, I can hardly ever see my after visit Sunday or doctor's notes",
This app is not only very useful but informative too. It reminds you of appointments you may not have or in your diary and you can read all of your medical information. From letters following scans to post op observations.,
Doesn't even save your log in. Your browser is MUCH better than this worthless app. Ironically reading the positive reviews they mistake the app for the service. It IS great in your web browser. But as I mentioned don't WASTE your time with the app.,
This app has been a lifeline for me and my health needs. Works great.,
"Really like my chart, great way to correspond with my Doctor.",
"There should be an option to remove the section that lists goals on the main home screen of the app, as mine lists personal information that I would not want anyone else who may within the viewable distance from my screen to see.",
Great app links everyone. Everything in one place is awsome,
Me an my family has been treated with care an compassion while dealing with my cancer an this app is a massive blessing keeping up with everything.,
It would be better if there was a way to double check whether providers received requests for appointments. I have sent 2 requests to the same provider for an appointment with no response... Did they get it? No idea.,
Great App User Friendly Very helpful for all to use.,
Always happy with the amount of time of response to questions.,
Make things easier Like to comunique with them !!,
"Love this app very easy, keeps me informed of all my past,present,and future medical information.",
Needs more features maybe even a video call/meeting option.,
I always have to re-verify even though I'm using my finger print. I was thinking that I was talking to my daughter's doctors office. Someone else messaged me back saying that I needed to contact her doctors office 😐 ......I was under the impression that this app was linked to the doctors office portal.....they shouldn't tell people that this is a quick and easy way to speak with your child's medical team because it's just a flat out lie....🤨😐😑😶🤦🏾‍♀️🤔,
Great way to learn and understand better our medical health but don't fool yourself into believing what you read because the ways and means of any professional practice are far beyond our ability to assess and interpret. But the service is the next best thing for all curious patients.,
A pain to use. The Email notification log in worked well. With the stupid new app when I go back in to the regular one it gets in a loop. Useless. I di not need a disfunctional app.,
I love having all my test or appt info all in one,
I love the convienance of having access to all of my medical records in one place.,
"Can not schedule an appointment. It prompts me to select appointment type, but the screen is blank. Do not have the ability to send messages to my dr. App says ""no available recipient"".",
It doesn't work most of the time. I log in and I get the first page with menu then when i try to see something it doesn't load,
"It's great helps me keep up with appointments, and even reminds me of new ones. Also gives you information about the appointment you just finished. You ask questions and even sign up for assistance if you need it.",
Seamless control of everything medical! Great app.,
Why can I NEVER make an appointment through this app!? It's ridiculous!,
"Upgrade made it impossible to sign in with my code # , very annoying",
I enjoy my virtual visits with Dr.G Khuns.& it's so convenient and it's so nice to go on there for my prescriptions set up an appointment with my doctor or the hospital is wonderful I love that MyChart and it saves time.,
"I use MyChart a lot. I just moved cities, so I like I can have my old city MyChart to get to past records and the new city MyChart to see my new Dr's items.",
This App is very very helpful and give you all the important info you need right in your hands I recomend this App,
Great app! Saves time & travel,
Easy to communicate with your Doctors and their staff.,
Very easy to use!,
Simple and very informative,
The security code doesn't copy to the log in just started doing this,
"Can't link accounts between WA state organization and a TX organization. Spent all day with MyChart teams of either org and still NOTHING. App and web browser MyChart login of old org says ""cannot authenticate external acct"" of new org. New org MyChart doesn't even give search option to link accts. Both teams at a loss to troubleshoot after 7 phone calls.",
Very nice and helpful to have this,
"My Advent Health provider wanted me to download this app and once you try and select a health provider, Advent Health or even Aetna is not an option....something isn't right, so one star review it is.",
"I'm not able to schedule appointments, only cancel them",
Wonderful app! Easy and efficient!,
"Excellent app. Make appts, cancel appts, receive reminders about health matters, send notes to your medical team, see your lab results, see which prescriptions you are prescribed... Great app!!",
Very good setup and easy to use.,
Easy to navigate through.,
I have not been able to access my info it says server error please fix,
Very well thought out and detailed layout. Easy communication with my MD's. Each update gets better.,
Great app to help and keep up with appointments and questions,
"Comprehensive, and easy to use!",
Awesome. I don't miss my appointments with this app.,
"This is the best thing for me, do to I can get my family medical history.",
I can keep up with all my appointments very good app,
I love having access to see all of my records and billing in one place. It makes it so easy to manage my Healthcare. Thank you.,
"A very useful app! Since update, however, it is very slow to load, and stays on the main screen for several minutes. Not sure why",
Absolute garbage. Make an account MULTIPLE TIMES and can never ever sign in. All I want are my covid results. It's BS that they can text you 100x leading up to the covid test and then when it's time to see the results you all the sudden need this account? Why not text them to me you f*****s!,
"I would be lost without this app. So much information and all my appts..past and present. My test results.. everything I can think of at my finger tips..all my doctors..medication.. even suggestions of vaccines, scans & test needed. Approaching my age I appreciate all the help and aid I can get. Thanks MyChart.",
Sometimes I have a hard time accessing. But I enjoy the convenience of accessing my information and my providers.,
"The app is extremely convenient for communicating with my doctors for setting appointments, asking questions and receiving lab results, not to mention virtual visits. A must have app for me...",
Doctors keep being removed from messaging/scheduling.,
"Brilliant, I can see all my son's test results 😎 Would be nicer if there was a graph plotted with all the blood test results.",
It's a very informative app,
I love this app. I enjoy the fact that most of my medical information is just a finger tip (portal) away. The app seems to be user friendly because I can find my way around easily. I enjoy how quickly things are updated ie. doctor's note(s) from visit.,
I love how I have instant access to me an my children test results and medicines. Its like my records on the go. Can't ask for a better app. I give 5 stars,
"The app did not send 2 of the last 3 refills I requested to the pharmacy. I was asked to email developers, which I did. No response and the problem still exists, it is getting my refill requests to my pharmacy. Very disappointing.",
I like being able to combine all of my Doctors into one app. This is very convenient for me to lookup all of my medical records.,
"Love ""My Chart"". Things are so much easier.",
It's easy to use and gives lots of information.,
Really helps keep all medical records in one place.,
"Helpful overall, really unnecessary to have to log in to different clinics/organizations. Do this in the backend where patients aren't required to navigate, no one knows or cares if their provider is with St Charles or Summit or anywhere else.",
Quality of Life dr in anniston al DOES NOT even use it.,
A huge thank you to Valley Health Milton!!! Dr. Dillon and support staff always helps in anyway they can. My gratitude is overflowing for the help you have given me!!!,
"Very easy to navigate, all the needed information is there, your doctors, appointments, payments, messages",
Not much to say I get the results before the doctor calls to tell what they are,
I've enjoyed this until they added Oklahoma University now it won't let me see most dtuff.,
The app is easy to use and provides quick access to medical information.,
"So nice to have everything from records to test(s) / shot(s) due, Message your MUSC doctors, pay bill, pre check in for upcoming appts, schedule / change / cancel appts all in one spot. User friendly interface. If you deal w/ MUSC - even for a COVID 19 test ... download the app.",
"I like the app,but I lose my password occasionally and I have a hassle getting it to reset,wish this could be fixed its a pain!",
Easy to access and to get in touch with a provider,
Having to reset passwords too often and have a password keeper. Take too much messing around.,
"Used to work but now it doesn't. I can't see my upcoming appointments, look at my test results, or do anything that would help me with my care. The app is up to date, but it doesn't work properly. This is my ONLY way of seeing my appointments. Please fix this.",
Missing helpful features that are available through the mobile website such as viewing the history of lab results and seeing them on a chart.,
"MyChart has made life easier as messaging, ordering prescriptions, seeing test results and appointments coming and scheduling.",
Easy to use and navigate,
"Absolutely LOVE my MyChart! I am able to communicate with my Dr. (Who is also the best Dr. EVER!) I can easily reach my Dr. If I have questions about my medications, any upcoming tests & blood work that needs to be done. This App is laid out perfectly! Reminders are sent to your phone if it is time for prescription refills, & if you run outof refills, you can request more refills online & your Dr. Can quickly get that done. Like I said. it's awesome! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!",
"Excellent app. I love it very easy to access and all your information is safe and secure. I will refer to all my family and the community. Thank You, The creation of this app is 👏👌💯⭐ MRS. ARNOLD",
Makes my life so much easier everything at my fingertips so much information,
Easy to use and very informative,
I must say MyChart is pretty easy. I have had it for several years now. I wish I could have my husband on my account or just handle other adults on the account with there permission because it would be easier to know about appointment's or sending messages to the Dr I just handle all that stuff so we always have someone home to take care of the little ones and don't double book appointment's but I did figure out a loop hole if they send me the message I just put account and password & I'm in.,
"It's easy to use, you can check in for appointments before you arrive so when you do arrive, just give them your name, and you're ready to see the Dr. You can also send and receive messages to and from your providers and request prescription refills. Works for me!!",
"Excellent App, allows me to view my medical results and share said results with any medical providers I have, even during traveling.",
"This actually has been a great app, I also combined it with my UT physicians app so they're like in a group app. I can do that now and it's convenient.",
I like the app it's a great tool to have,
Great tool to find appts and test results,
This app really helps to save time and gives me direct communication with my health care professionals.,
"I love this app! As a cancer patient, I have so many appointments to keep up with, but MyChart makes it incredibly easy to do. I have access to lab results and doctors' notes after each appointment. I am so thankful for the ease and convenience.",
Better communication than phone and emails due to faster results review and medications logging of changes.,
"I love the My Chart App having easy immediate access to my appts, test results, what I need to do as far as setting up appts and the ability to leave a message for my Dr & his nurses. I definitely recommend the app",
"I love this app it's so great to keep track of when my child has a appointment coming up, and I can schedule or message the doctor if I have any concerns or questions.",
Makes it easy to access my information and check in for appointments,
This app is so easy to use. I like that I can log on see my test results and if I need them for any reason I can print them out and I love being able to message my doctor or a nurse and I like that we can now see our radiology images. I also like how I get to schedule an appointment with my Dr or with another Dr.,
My chart is very helpful to keep in touch with my Dr. Easy to use.,
"Very efficient at keeping me up-to-date on labs, lab results & medical appointments.",
Excellent way to see doctor when already a patient and live > 100 miles and no change in status just need checkup. Thank you very much.,
This app is terrible compared to the app I used before for my medical. I don't know why they switched but this sucks.,
The best maintained and performing app out there.,
MyChart is very handy & easy to use.,
Fairly easy to use & navigate,
Excellent for keeping track of medical info,
Having issues logging in. Telling me there is a server issue to try again later. Has been doing this for the last 2 days. Very frustrating when trying to get appointments made.,
An extremely useful app! Has helped me alot concerning management of my appointments and medication.,
Not user friendly and many times bill will not show to be paid,
Love it. It is so nice to keep up with everything,
The app works great the only problem is is the hospitals utilize this format do blatantly disregard keeping the information current and up-to-date well as giving you a format to delete any and all information that you do not want on it when you requested over and over and over again to their persons in charge of this app at the hospital at which it is being utilized for. The CEO each entity hospital represents should get on mid-management and the executive management to address this immediately,
It's easy to use and I love it,
Better than a phone call!,
Very user friendly..No more calls.. We love it.,
I really appreciate being able to have the app as it is very user-friendly.,
Sux. Very hard to navigate when the pages time out and reset.,
"I believe that the most chart is fanbestic. As you can see in the woods missing and misspelled that it's not perfect. Anyway, it's nice to have this personal contact with the doctor and I think it gets a 4 but it's still can be improved. That is why I did not give it a fi very much. Appreciate your effort. I wish I was much younger so I could Give it a perfect record in time. And maybe I will be able to. Because i'm only seventy and I hope to be here for at least another twenty years as long as",
I love ❤️ this app its a blog blessing. For the simple fact that I can stay In continus contact an religiously check this app an I love the simplicity of the app really simple to use. Which the Healow app would be compatible an able to link to my chart. I wish they would push up the date on when you will be able to link both epic my chart and Healow as one. I'm so stoked when that happens.,
You need a camera to take pictures of the results of the app because no screenshot is allowed The health care providers can hold up the results until you require them to release the results If you get a 1.54 am message and it rambles on for 2 pages you know they made a bad mistake. Trying to convince you not to pursue the matter. Trying to sign the documents they require is impossible. Doesn't work on either of 2 a13 samsung,
Extremely slow doesn't matter if I use Wi-Fi or cell service and have tried multiple Wi-Fi networks. Enjoy all the info being in one place but even moving from 1 area in the app to another is so slow.,
Update: thank you for the help in locating the passcode option and for your quick response! I used to be able to sign in using a Passcode on my old phone. Since installing on my new phone this option doesn't seem to be available. Super annoying to have to remember all my different login and passwords for my different doctors,
"Great Idea, but with limited benefits! Allows you to view scheduled appointments or communication. But, it removes those appointment or communications after viewing them, unless you book marking them. Sad but no appointment reminding abilities or scheduling conflicts between facilities or within facilities!",
"Takes forever to load things, sometimes it just flat out refuses to work. I have cleared the cache for the app, force stopped, switched to data instead of WiFi, and restarted my phone. Fairly garbage considering it's a patient portal.",
Like having access to medication list and to test results but very frustrated that it won't let me correct or remove wrong information on me. Continue using this app but I don't really like it it's difficult to find information there's a lot of info I would just like to remove it's like junk mail,
Love the app but recently it required me to verify my phone number which is not a big deal but I never get the text for verification after multiple attempts and verification of my phone number. The app will not allow me to schedule any appts without this step being completed. Frustrating.,
As Central. Ever since I signed up I get ads every time I turn my phone on. Even when I'm trying to answer a call. I'm constantly getting ads in the middle of watching something. I'm ready to drop this app and hope I can remember my appointments,
"Totally awesome for all medical From Records to easy and simple for anyone wanting to communicate with there health team. Works flawlessly always for me , so easy to navigate as well.Thank you for everything and making a reliable up to date App for Android at least that's what I use and can speak for.",
Poor functionality! I get alerts saying I have a letter or message but the app will never fully load and mostly just gives error messages. Definitely needs major improvements especially considering it contains pertinent and often time sensitive health care data,
"Fantastic way to keep in touch with your care team and have records. Appreciate the ease of switching between different facilities also, as long as they're enrolled.",
"Very easy to navigate and allows me to access everything I need, from scheduling to test results to communicating with my providers. Having everything in one place is great.",
"The app doesn't show any bills at att. It says I owe nothing but they finally sent me an email back 7 months later saying I owe over $5,500. They need to make sure that people are doing their jobs right but they can't. I will be contacting my attorney about this huge problem. I will also be looking for a new doctor elsewhere and leaving Ascension.",
"Features are usable and convenient. Everything you need to know at your fingertips. Really like how you can send non urgent messages, check balances due and see results.",
"I used the Same phone, that I used in my visit to Bellevue. However My Chart keeps telling me that I cannot login What a flawed app I use a standard Android phone . Both with a cell phone plan with a major provider. The company that sells This app does a great job ,of sales. And a poor job of integration with other data bases",
"Current in house! For such a large facility that the wifi is so touch and go! My last three visits it's been hard for me to video with my family. For some patients this may be there only way to see out of town relatives. For the most part I like the upgrades and I haven't had the problem other's have had! I hope that wifi will be addressed at some point! Not sure about adds yet...ok, I see the adds, I've seen 3-4 adds while waiting for them to stop channel 58 hln.. forensic files... 0300-0315",
"Great app, with some short commings. Would be nice to be able to update procedures, meds, etc that were performed by non MyChart providers. My personal chart is always behind, not up to date and no way to correct.",
"I've had MyChart for close over 10 years but recently, in the last 3 years, this App has gotten noticably Worse! It's confusing and irritating most of the time. Plus to make it worse, I've had all my information leaked or cyber scammed on more than 3 different occasions and that's Scary to me. Right Now, on the App, I'm not able to find any of medical history information or any of my previous doctors or anything. That's Not Good but what other options do I have!?",
"MyChart is wonderful for so many reasons. Checking in to appointments ahead of time is very helpful and saves time. Records are easily accessible, and you can look at what the doctor noted, when your appointments and procedures were and more. Test results are posted on MyChart, so if I am waiting for something important I know right away (and then the doctor calls to explain the results). Making payments is so fast and easy on MyChart too!",
"This is a great idea. It's nice to be able to view your medical records. Only problem is, they're in Doctor speak, so I have no idea what it means. The other thing I find curious, is that no one mentions or explains what it means to me when my results are not in the normal range. Few doctors talk to you at all, much less explain issues that might have come up in testing. Or what I could or should do to correct them. UPDATE: Very limited app. still disappointed.",
A great resource but more often than not when I try to log in with biomedical i get a message saying there was a change to your saved biometric. Please log in and re-enable biometrics. So frustrating!,
"Love it! Convenient, easy to use and the ability to give my husband access is wonderful! As a parent, it is super helpful to have access to my sons records. Can pull shot records, or whatever is needed, anytime I need it.",
Very handy having my medical history instantly accessable. I appreciate the features of being able to see lab results immediately as well. I would seriously recommend this to any and every one.,
"This app gives patients a unique and valuable service. I keep appointments and providers straight for multiple people using MyChart. I'm able to access test results, double check locations, meds, instructions and more. One of my most valuable apps.",
"I never had any app as useful as MyChart to stay in touch with my health care. From visits, test results, reports from each doctor, list of your medications, plus a message system for questions you may have. I would strongly recommend signing up for this app.",
"I LOVE MyChart! It's easy to navigate, keeps your medical info at your fingertips, and has most medical providers utilizing the EPIC program so multiple hospital systems are all in one place and you can allow your doctors to communicate and share your results. If it's offered, I highly recommend to take advantage of this free app.",
"It seems IMPOSSIBLE to get from one screen to another sometimes. The ""How to use"" video shows a back button that is non existence on most screens. This app needs to be more user friendly.",
"Difficult. Confusing I went into Phoenix, Oregon branch and staff helped me to sign up. Now, I have to sign up for MORE information you need. You make everything impossible and complicated: Access codes, biometric sign up, 2 step verifications. I hate it. I am mentally unable to use this new technology...I am old, live alone, no family, and Isolated. I hate this system. NOW I can't figure out how to access my own account. My user code and password should be enough to access my own account.",
"This app is great. It lets you do everything you need to do with out calling someone. Can order meds, make appointments, cancel appointment,see test results quickly, see you past history, send msg to you health team and many more things.",
"During my previous employment, I added a person to my chart. I have repeatedly requested that the additional person be deleted from my chart as she is not related to me. I have not been able to get her removed and I no longer work for that Organization. I continue to receive communication about the added person despite contacting help twice for this problem.",
it would be nice if I didn't have to sign into every single hospital location individually and it would also be nice if my chart and epic you know communicated with each other between organizations instead of just being a giant roadblock in my health care I don't want to have to put in a password I don't care if someone sees my medical record it should be your choice. or at the very least you should get more than two attempts at opening it with a fingerprint before it deletes the fingerprint,
"This has helped me get and stay in touch with my doctor better than I ever did on my own. I am able to see results for tests that I always stress about even when there is no reason to worry which has eliminated so much anxiety. Could not recommend using MyChart more, it's been fantastic.",
"It really is good, it's just that l get a reminder 3-4 times a week! One reminder is plenty. Also it has u go through the whole thing, when nothing has changed. Thanks, Deb",
On point. Everything you need at your finger tips . This app keeps you up to date with upcoming and past visit. Helps you locate urgent care close by and virtual doctors visit depending on the situation you may be having. I'm so glad that MyChart is available 24hours a day for my family and me. Give it a try . Trust me it worth it . Keep track of meds and med management. Refill request to doctor.,
"The app is terrible, I can never pay co-pays on it or sign documents. The location settings don't ever seem to work. The clinics and hospitals who partner with this app don't seem to be pushing to make it better.",
"Finally they worked the kinks out and it is wonderful. I have everything medically in one place, and now the site works great. I used to have a hard time getting into MyChart, but whatever they did with the update is perfect. The ease of using this is now patient friendly.",
"To me it's just so far away from the experience I want from my doctor. I get times are changing but you should be able to have to to explain things to me on the phone , if you have time to type all that out you have time to call. I find it useful for some stuff, but mostly just feels like another way to just push you off.",
Most time when trying to view something I keep getting a message saying an error has occurred please try again later. HIGHLY ANNOYING. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but the same thing keeps happening.,
"Getting worse. My last review was three stars, now it's so unfunctional I can't use it at all. My main reason for having it is the messaging function and access to records, but just keep being met with ""server error"".",
Generally easy to us. It can get a bit complicated for non routine scheduling. It reminds me of appointments and delivers after vist summaries without visiting the main web site. I use the wed site for appointments most of the time . It's a good tool to have on my phone to access current medications information .,
I like the convenience of having easy access to my medical history and doctors' notes in one place. I was using the web browser based system but prefer the app for the layout. Thanks for a great tool!,
"I think this app is great, however I feel that it should be expanded to include the other hospitals in the Ottawa area instead of having to look them up in another application. Some information is outdated such as COVID vaccinations and flu shots.",
Doesn't have the option to print you messages or test results. It only will let you screen shot or save as PDF file. I don't have enough memory on my phone for those options.,
"Hi everyone,this app is so convenient especially if you contact your Dr and what not. Downside is if you have tests to do tests you should be able to have the option of scheduling your appointment with out having to call customer service and wait on the phone for a long while or even having to call the referral department if one of your test requests expires..other than that I enjoy using this app. Thank you",
"It's great to use but you can't make appointments, they NEVER RESPOND TO A REQUEST. You're outta luck to get a doctor to respond to a question or request, it's like it was never written to them. Basically it's only good for personal use not to stay on top of things like appointment, conversation ECT.",
Great app for keeping track of medical information. Recently my friend had a family member have an emergency and the information was updating faster than the doctor could inform them. This caused a panic. I would recommend having emercency medicine updating after a set amount of time.,
When I first started using the app it was awesome. Here lately when I attempt to access my messages I get a server error and to try again later to no avail. Less than ideal having to using a browser when you have an app.,
My only sugghestion is when there is something new posted a marker is given on the icon showing the number of new posts. That is good. Better is to also show a new posting indicater in the main menu on each of the threads where new postings happened like new posting to messages would have an indication on the icon. As I get use to the system ill have more to say. So far it is good.,
"I love being able to contact Dr.'s, e-check in, pay, and have my medical records in the palm of my hands when and if I need it! Being able to link accounts together and keep the information available to whomever I am seeing keeps me from butchering whatever medical information I need to tell another provider. The convenience of these apps is amazing!",
"Very easy to use, covers everything from booking appointments to paying your bills, even offers customizable payment options, and you don't have to spend forever waiting on hold to get results/answers, xfinity needs to copy this blueprint for their services",
"My Chart is amazing! I enrolled in the program when I lived in Hawaii. A nurse told me about it. She connected me. I could see all my lab results, upcoming appointments, and everything that was important for me to see. I moved to California and was able to connect to My Chart here. I can message my Dr's. Also, receive important messages. Everyone should be connected to My Chart.",
"I believe that the most chart is fanbestic. As you can see in the woods missing and misspelled that it's not perfect. Anyway, it's nice to have this personal contact with the doctor and I think it gets a 4 but it's still can be improved. That is why I did not give it a fi very much. Appreciate your effort. I wish I was much younger so I could Give it a perfect record in time. And maybe I will be able to. Because i'm only seventy and I hope to be here for at least another twenty years as long as",
I love ❤️ this app its a blog blessing. For the simple fact that I can stay In continus contact an religiously check this app an I love the simplicity of the app really simple to use. Which the Healow app would be compatible an able to link to my chart. I wish they would push up the date on when you will be able to link both epic my chart and Healow as one. I'm so stoked when that happens.,
You need a camera to take pictures of the results of the app because no screenshot is allowed The health care providers can hold up the results until you require them to release the results If you get a 1.54 am message and it rambles on for 2 pages you know they made a bad mistake. Trying to convince you not to pursue the matter. Trying to sign the documents they require is impossible. Doesn't work on either of 2 a13 samsung,
Extremely slow doesn't matter if I use Wi-Fi or cell service and have tried multiple Wi-Fi networks. Enjoy all the info being in one place but even moving from 1 area in the app to another is so slow.,
Update: thank you for the help in locating the passcode option and for your quick response! I used to be able to sign in using a Passcode on my old phone. Since installing on my new phone this option doesn't seem to be available. Super annoying to have to remember all my different login and passwords for my different doctors,
"Great Idea, but with limited benefits! Allows you to view scheduled appointments or communication. But, it removes those appointment or communications after viewing them, unless you book marking them. Sad but no appointment reminding abilities or scheduling conflicts between facilities or within facilities!",
"Takes forever to load things, sometimes it just flat out refuses to work. I have cleared the cache for the app, force stopped, switched to data instead of WiFi, and restarted my phone. Fairly garbage considering it's a patient portal.",
Like having access to medication list and to test results but very frustrated that it won't let me correct or remove wrong information on me. Continue using this app but I don't really like it it's difficult to find information there's a lot of info I would just like to remove it's like junk mail,
Love the app but recently it required me to verify my phone number which is not a big deal but I never get the text for verification after multiple attempts and verification of my phone number. The app will not allow me to schedule any appts without this step being completed. Frustrating.,
As Central. Ever since I signed up I get ads every time I turn my phone on. Even when I'm trying to answer a call. I'm constantly getting ads in the middle of watching something. I'm ready to drop this app and hope I can remember my appointments,
"Totally awesome for all medical From Records to easy and simple for anyone wanting to communicate with there health team. Works flawlessly always for me , so easy to navigate as well.Thank you for everything and making a reliable up to date App for Android at least that's what I use and can speak for.",
Poor functionality! I get alerts saying I have a letter or message but the app will never fully load and mostly just gives error messages. Definitely needs major improvements especially considering it contains pertinent and often time sensitive health care data,
"Fantastic way to keep in touch with your care team and have records. Appreciate the ease of switching between different facilities also, as long as they're enrolled.",
"Very easy to navigate and allows me to access everything I need, from scheduling to test results to communicating with my providers. Having everything in one place is great.",
"The app doesn't show any bills at att. It says I owe nothing but they finally sent me an email back 7 months later saying I owe over $5,500. They need to make sure that people are doing their jobs right but they can't. I will be contacting my attorney about this huge problem. I will also be looking for a new doctor elsewhere and leaving Ascension.",
"Features are usable and convenient. Everything you need to know at your fingertips. Really like how you can send non urgent messages, check balances due and see results.",
"I used the Same phone, that I used in my visit to Bellevue. However My Chart keeps telling me that I cannot login What a flawed app I use a standard Android phone . Both with a cell phone plan with a major provider. The company that sells This app does a great job ,of sales. And a poor job of integration with other data bases",
"Current in house! For such a large facility that the wifi is so touch and go! My last three visits it's been hard for me to video with my family. For some patients this may be there only way to see out of town relatives. For the most part I like the upgrades and I haven't had the problem other's have had! I hope that wifi will be addressed at some point! Not sure about adds yet...ok, I see the adds, I've seen 3-4 adds while waiting for them to stop channel 58 hln.. forensic files... 0300-0315",
"Great app, with some short commings. Would be nice to be able to update procedures, meds, etc that were performed by non MyChart providers. My personal chart is always behind, not up to date and no way to correct.",
"I've had MyChart for close over 10 years but recently, in the last 3 years, this App has gotten noticably Worse! It's confusing and irritating most of the time. Plus to make it worse, I've had all my information leaked or cyber scammed on more than 3 different occasions and that's Scary to me. Right Now, on the App, I'm not able to find any of medical history information or any of my previous doctors or anything. That's Not Good but what other options do I have!?",
"MyChart is wonderful for so many reasons. Checking in to appointments ahead of time is very helpful and saves time. Records are easily accessible, and you can look at what the doctor noted, when your appointments and procedures were and more. Test results are posted on MyChart, so if I am waiting for something important I know right away (and then the doctor calls to explain the results). Making payments is so fast and easy on MyChart too!",
"This is a great idea. It's nice to be able to view your medical records. Only problem is, they're in Doctor speak, so I have no idea what it means. The other thing I find curious, is that no one mentions or explains what it means to me when my results are not in the normal range. Few doctors talk to you at all, much less explain issues that might have come up in testing. Or what I could or should do to correct them. UPDATE: Very limited app. still disappointed.",
A great resource but more often than not when I try to log in with biomedical i get a message saying there was a change to your saved biometric. Please log in and re-enable biometrics. So frustrating!,
"Love it! Convenient, easy to use and the ability to give my husband access is wonderful! As a parent, it is super helpful to have access to my sons records. Can pull shot records, or whatever is needed, anytime I need it.",
Very handy having my medical history instantly accessable. I appreciate the features of being able to see lab results immediately as well. I would seriously recommend this to any and every one.,
"This app gives patients a unique and valuable service. I keep appointments and providers straight for multiple people using MyChart. I'm able to access test results, double check locations, meds, instructions and more. One of my most valuable apps.",
"I never had any app as useful as MyChart to stay in touch with my health care. From visits, test results, reports from each doctor, list of your medications, plus a message system for questions you may have. I would strongly recommend signing up for this app.",
"I LOVE MyChart!

An excellent easy to use app. Keeps all the info together. Only criticism is that it is not always possible to access records for amendments. Also it would be useful if the user could send messages/emails the Hospital departments.,
The app worked just fine before. Now I can't even access it. It keeps asking for access to my location which I have no interest in allowing. When I try to select a country or enter a medical organization it won't allow/find/accept any entry and I can't get past that screen. I can no longer access my medical information or submit/request anything. Roll your update back because this is a danger to patient health.,
Terrible app coding. Especially for sign up. Multiple attempted at creating profiles. Create>login> doesn't exist. Completely pointless. What's the point of a login if the private server doesn't even save your info to know that you have a profile to login in with,
"This is a nice App to have but I have noticed that it lacks the ability to be able to print a medication list or any document as a print feature is not available, as to my knowledge, as there is on the full webpage. Therefore I struggle in giving it a full 5 star review.",
"Thanks to a cancer diagnosis, I use this app way more than I would prefer. It is amazingly useful and fairly well designed. It's a bit annoying that it redirects to the website for some things, and a few things are missing, like historical test result comparisons, but overall this is a class A app.",
"So easy to use and so handy to have quick access to chart notes and reminders. If you take the time to set it up (just answer the questions) and get your meds in, it will save you and the nurses so much time going forward. I check in for my appts in the system, usually while I'm watching tv the evening before.",
SERIOUSLY NEEDS WORK!!! I'm rating it 4 star SOLELY because of its potential. A cloud based medical chart system that allows medical providers to see your charts from all providers. I was in hospital recently for 10 days. Tge hospital is EH medical provider but my PCP is RU. In the perfect world they could both see my records for both. They don't sync. Day 3 of my stay I ask why I have received my regular meds. They didn't see any listed. So! EPIC! Get on the ball and fix it.,
"Poor functionality, I thought I was having trouble getting my test results because I hadn't updated the app in a while, but once I updated I can't even find my provider anymore. I uninstalled the app rather than deal with the frustration.",
unable to load into my Samsung galaxy tablet. uninstalled several times as well as rebooted. once loaded it kept freezing at the consent for location. really poor and not usable. I know mychart as I have it on my iPhone. I know it works but not for android.,
"Very convenient. I really appreciate being able to see the summary of all of my visits as well as visit reminders, vaccine info and so much more. It can be a bit intimidating as a patient to comprehend all the medical jargon, but being able to look at notes and test results and be able to research every detail is life changing.",
"I use the MyChart app, and I find it to be incredibly helpful. It streamlines messages to and from all of my different healthcare providers. It keeps me updated on appointments and medications, and gives me immediate access to my health info. It is excellent!",
"I really like this app. Very easy to use, plus if you have any questions about how to use the app they have alot of videos on YouTube explaining how to use the app. This app keeps you updated on everything from medications to appointments past, and future. You can also send messages to your doctor, link all of your doctors together. Very useful app. I would give it 10 ⭐'s if I could.",
it would certainly be helpful if it worked considering it's the only way for me to contact my care providers: it tells me I'm disconnected if I try to join video calls & then kicks me even when it's 100% sure I'm connected､ as well as that now that I have a new phone it doesn't let me log in at all､ giving me the try again later error for days. reinstalling doesn't help & it's just completely broken & has been for years now,
I'm changing my original review from 5 stars to 3. It is difficult to navigate with no navigation buttons. The yellow/orange background color is terrible and you cannot customize it. It keeps telling me that I have to edit and confirm my phone and email but I have nothing to confirm and I can't take the message off. It doesn't actually connect with the clinics so don't try to cancel an appointment through this. However it's not completely useless and I like having it all in one place.,
"No longer working. For a long time this app was convenient and easy to navigate. But about 2 weeks ago it stopped working. I can no longer sign in. It won't load after I put in my password. I have uninstalled it twice to see if that makes a difference. No luck, I now have to sign in on my computer.",
"This app is extremely slow and seems to take forever to upload. It is difficult to navigate and not reliable during doctor's visits. Using this app is like going back to using a modem to connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the app three times before I could get it to do anything at all. Now I am still getting an error message every time I try to read a new message on My Chart on my mobile phone. If I could give the mobile app a different rating, I would give it a 0 instead of a 1.",
Test results have no time stamp which renders some of them almost useless. If blood work is repeated multiple times a day you cannot see the trend (if things are improving or getting worse) as I've found they dont come up in chronological order and no time is indicated to help determine the correct order.,
"I was cross checking some facts in course of writing a message to my provider. The app timed out before I could finish my message. I found no way of editing, and completing my message. I don't know if the message is sent or not. And whether I have to write and send a new message again!",
"There are reminders on the first page that have been done but you can't get off, which is very annoying. Test results are great to get. Very hard to combine previous doctors visits, test results, surgeries from another state with current information.",
"I love this app. It makes life so much easier and saves on unnecessary use of paper. I always know what's happening with my health, labs, medications, and appointments. My provider messages me information which also saves on unnecessary office visits. I recommend this to everyone. I even have my children's added to mine. Try it ! You are missing out.",
App sucks if you don't remember your password and you have to go through the email process which requires you to go out of application causing the application to to refresh at the beginning of giving your three bits of information and you've repeated this process over and over and over again causing your account to be disabled. It sucks.,
"This is a great app, couple complaints thoug. Some things I do have to log on to the actual website for my provider to read some results, or letters. Also with this most recent update, it won't allow me to save my fingerprint, so I have to type in my password every time. Minor complaints, I'm hoping it can be fixed soon :)",
"There is just to much that you can't change, correct, or cancel. It's really troublesome using this. I went in to update for an appointment and started having problems with my sign in. I don't live on this site so it's difficult when you think you know your sign in and you're forced to change it before you can get in. I need to finish now cause I probably could continue so I'm stopping.",
"It is too large to fit on one page but too small to read. Don't know what the fix would be exactly but can think about it and make suggestions, maybe one section at a time and tap 2 to get second section? Messages would be a good first section to appear! In my humble opinion of course",
Can be a little challenging to understand when you first install. Once you learn the app the convience of knowing your test results first hand without the dreaded wait for the doctor to call with them is a plus. Being I have no medical knowledge the results can be a little difficult to read from a layman's view. I do enjoy the accessibility if the app tough.,
"It's worked well and the appointment reminders are nice. It isn't possible to pay for those appointments on the app because the interface is very difficult to navigate. It wants your info but doesn't ever have a ""continue"" button.",
"Works well! Lot's of resources and information. Linking to different provider groups is great. Features available depend on what the provider organization has implemented, not all the same. I recommend this app, it keeps getting better.",
"I really like this app it's easy to keep up with my medical appointments, as well as my large list of medications. I'm a millennial so I don't like to spend a lot of time talking on the phone, with this app you can send and receive messages with your medical provider. One of my favorite features is the e-check in that let's you pre check into your appointment as well as pay your co-pay. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has to spend a lot of time at medical appointments.",
"This app saves me time trying to connect with my physician just to ask a question and allows the physician to be more efficient. I get timely answers that I can understand. I love having new scripts written for me with this app. Many times I think of the refills or the questions that I need to ask my doctor after they're working hours, sometimes in the middle of the night I'll remember something and I just use my app to take care of business. The app is constantly being updated w/ great features",
"Awesome app. Keeps up with messages back and forth to the doctor and nurses, appointment, and test results as well as appointments summary. Medications. Every test and x-ray from any facility can be added. I use it a lot. And depend on it to remind of my appointment and all my communicate I have to do on here. Thanks!!!",
This app sucks. I hate that my hospital forces us to use it. It is hard to find any of your info on it. Sigh up is hard and different for every hospital. I turned off notifications but it still harasses me. When I try to find a new doc it only lest me see new doctor in tx and I don't live in Texas. This app is frustrating. It's like the built an app for patients based on what the billing department wanted.,
"Useful app but every time I try to sign in it tells me my password is wrong. I have to force it to autofill the password, which is the same password I typed in, and it finally lets me on. **UPDATE** I decided it was not worth the aggravation so I just uninstalled it. Disappointing experience!",
"I love mychart it allows me to keep track of my appointments and medications. I can request refills and information. But getting my test results so quickly is the best feature. There was a time you waited for a call, letter or next appt. Sometimes it's hard to remember everything you discuss so the summary and reviews are good. Now it does depend a lot on the Dr.(office) as well. I'm fortunate I have an awesome Dr. who is very detailed.",
"Love it, it's so easy to setup appointments, text your Doctor and switch to your child's profile to do all those things. Responses from medical side come fast. Not sure why they have option for contacting technical and billing side from the app, you will never hear from them.",
I loved using this app when I can't access to a computer while being out of town or going to appointments. And now it keeps saying there's a newer version to download but I don't see any every time I go look for it or uninstall this app and reinstall it but still keeps saying there's a newer version,
"Love/hate relationship with this app. I love being able to access my information and schedule appointments. However, I HATE that I'm unable to to get the video feature for virtual appointments to work. I have contacted the developers who provided NO HELP WHATSOEVER. I have to use someone else's phone for my appointments.",
"nothing loads up. im trying to access my messages, test results ect...nothing. Nothing loads!!!!??? please fix everything about this app bc it would be really useful to have something that actually works.. also why even bother having an app that says ""server having problems"" EVERY DAMN TIME I TRY TO READ MESSAGES ?!?!?!. but it will notify ypy wheb u habe a message like 2 weeks after the message was sent to you. FIX IT OR DONT BOTHER!!",
"I can no longer log in to my account through the My chart app... any time I log in on the actual my chart website that is associated with my care provider I can log in just fine, but when attempting to log in through that app I am met with a message saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."". Hope this is fixed soon, otherwise it's a great app.",
"훌륭한 앱 I have been using (MyChart) this app since mid-late 2014 and never have I ever experienced any trouble with this app until now, that's why I am reinstalling MyChart back onto my phone as we speak. Idk if the creator of app is doing an update on it but everytime I was trying to login. It kept giving me a message about the server is experiencing technical difficulties please try again later. I have been trying and trying still no luck like what's up with that. #MyChartNeedsFixingPorFavor 💋",
"Who in their right mind thought, that blocking screenshots was a good idea. If you need to be able to save a message there is physically no way to do that. So frustrating; I uninstalled the app and went back to the website because of it",
"This is great, because I'm a patient of 2 different medical center and I merge both accounts with this app, and all my doctors now have access to all of my records. The only thing I have to provide are the images from studies (MRI, CT etc) everything else, any of them can see it no matter what medical center is.",
"This app thinks I'm a nomad. Everytime I sign in it wants me to update all my personal info that is up to date. Irritating. Now I just ignore it. Why don't they say, IF there are changes with your personal info please update. Overall it's a handy app and at least lets me input info without printing and filling in forms like some other medical apps.",
"It's impossible to speak to a physician because of my chart. The office relies 99% on this app for oatien lieu of interacting with [this] patient. I can not book, change my own appts. I've been blocked from using the Wait List option. There are so many mistakes in my chart that have been ignored, test results never discussed with me. Its showing Appts canceled I never made. Exclusive use of an App for patient care is not a fair substitute for doctor/patient interaction.",
"Does get confusing with the menu and where to get back to messages that appear on the home screen, are not in the Messaging tab. Update: Now that I've used this program much longer, it far exceeds my expectations.",
Getting more cumbersome with some providers (St. Luke's in KC MO) who force you into huge menu list before you get into the app. Effectively they force the user to select my chart twice before you can get to password/biometric screen. When I have to use that provider I just log into that provider on my laptop where they don't force that nonsense on the user.,
"I love it. Instead of dealing with phone calls or leaving messages that sometimes never get received, I realized that doctor's prefer this method as it is easier for them and a lot quicker for me to get a response back. I also love making my own appointments on My Chart. Super easy!! It's great 👍",
"Most generally this app works well. But to do any e-check ins, looking at financial aspects, confirming appointments or making a payment, it will continually come up and say there is an error on the server. Try again later. This is also doing the exact same thing for my wife. It gets aggrating as heck. And it isn't any certain time of day either., it is continuous. 😡",
So so slow/doesnt load. I like the idea of this app and all the options available. But it's useless if it does not work. This is my most frequent app that I have to close and reopen and update and do anything I can think of to make work.,
"I love it, if I forget to order my meds I can do it on the go with my phone. Easy to use. Access to all my test results appointments, etc... Smooth flow between screens no clunky slow load ups. Tech support is also spot on if you need anything",
"If you're editing an email to send to a doctor and you set the phone down, the app times out and deletes the draft instead of saving it. there is no function to save drafts. Completely unacceptable behavior for an app designed for professional correspondance with medical providers. deserves zero stars",
"It's only just ok. UI menu needs to include a menu to navigate to other sections on the app. In its current state, I need to switch accounts and log back in so I can get to my dashboard which is a bit frustrating.",
"I love the MyChart app. The functionality is great. To name a few; paperless, chart sharing across multiple hospital systems, I can communicate with my doctor's on my time and they can respond on their time, appointment reminders, veiw test results, med list, etc. The list goes on...",
One thing that would be really helpful would be a search function for test results. It would be great to see what that test looks like over time. Scrolling is very tedious and may be impossible for tests done quarterly or annually,
This app will not allow me to log in anymore. It always presents me with a change password option. I do not want to change my password as it works on my computers quite fine. It is already secure. I am trained in Security+ and this password already passed all parameters for being secure.,
"So far it is very easy to use and I love the fact that every Stitch of record that is in my medical file that I can view is at my fingertips and that all appointments and everything is scheduled and it's everything shows up on my chart is awesome thing that they have created and that I'd recommend it to anybody thank you for such a great app, the fact that I can see my files and look at myself at my test results and everything I think is an awesome thing even though I can't understand them.",
The app has a warning as soon as I open it asking me to confirm my email address. I've confirmed it a bunch of times but the warning won't go away. This app has been extremely helpful for me. I have sickle cell and see a few different doctors so it's nice to be able to look over my lab results and keep track of my appointments. Getting refills is a lot easier with the app as well.,
"Admittedly, I was skeptical at first. But I love the convenience. My provider normally replies to questions, or messages within a short time (generally 2 hours or less). I like that I can see test results the same day, even before my Doctor does. I really like the convenience of being able to get med refills basically with the click of a button. I needed refills so I messaged yesterday and this morning the pharmacy called, telling me they were ready.",
"Very smooth app! Easy to use, navigate, and it's intuitive. No real glitches I have noticed yet. This is an awesome option for a care provider and allows great access and information to medical information for me as a patient!",
"Great app for me and my family! It's so much more convenient to schedule an appointment or send a message to my doctor through the app than to have to spend time on the phone with the clinic. I love that I can easily check immunization history and past visit summaries when I need them, and that I can see all of my info from the 3 different clinics/hospitals I've been seen at all from one login.",
My Chart is one of my favorite apps ever. Medical records at a touch whenever I need them. Current medications list. Ability to make appointments without a phone call. I can message any of my doctors anytime of the day or night and they will respond within a reasonable time frame. Don't know how I ever did without this app.,
"The app crashes and returns you to the login screen when trying to login, pressing new user, or inputting a username. This does not appear to be a personal device issue, this seems like a software problem. Please fix. My details of the issue have been stated above.^",
"Worst updates I have ever seen in my life. You can't go back when your in the mobile version, I'm stuck on a preference page right now and no way to get out, I get multiple notifications on test results and there ends up just being one test result back once I log in and I could go on but why bother, the developers don't care -- it works for them so they don't care about what works or doesn't work for their customers.",
Absolutely love my chart! Easy to get results and information on visits and even schedule appointments. I may be fortunate to have a pcp who is responsive to messages through my chart but it has made my care so much easier without having to wait weeks for an appt just to have a question answered.,
"Very tedious. I am happy to be able to e mail my providers and see test results quickly. Having to submit the questionairres, and receiving CONSTANT, MULTIPLE REMINDERS is very irritating. The I.T. developers and facility need to keep the customer experience in mind.",
This app is probably the best thing AHS has offered. Being able to see my imaging reports as soon as they are ready and sharing my insights with my GP and other care providers is so handy. I haven't experienced any glitches with the app since having it for the past 2 years. 4 stars only because I wish it went further back in time for certain results and showed hospital imaging results and showed hospital stays and discharge notes,
"Of all the apps I have his one is the most useful. It's important to be able to communicate with your doctors with out making an appointment, or bothering with a ph call, it's everything in one place to help keep on top of your health, tests or prescriptions. This concept was a brilliant idea!",
"The apps is super easy to use, yet very powerful that it includes all my medical information with Kelsey, including visit notes, labs, imagings and medication. I certainly appreciate the future appointments and med refill reminders features. Only suggestion is that I wish all kinds of appointments woud be included and reminded as well.",
It's great! Fairly easy to use as in I would encourage anyone using it for the first time to thoroughly explore all the options. You can do everything from this app including prescription ordering. Absolutely the best I've experienced.,
"Genuinely useful way of accessing medical records, visit information, prescriptions, etc. It also works with many providers in this area and I can link them all. Occasionally some information may be slightly hidden, UI is good but imperfect.",
"This app is good...when it works. For the past week, I keep getting ""There is a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" There is nothing wrong with my login, because it works on the web version of MyChart. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not help.",
"I love having test results and after visit notes available at my fingertips! No more waiting for a call. Less time wasted checking in. And I can even leave messages for my doc. Its great if you have all services through the same organization, makes communication between all providers so much easier!",
I was extremely skeptical of using this app but I gotta admit its a game changer. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It's stocked full of information and scheduling of appointments to filling/picking up prescips. Reaching a medical professionals is easy as well via email.,
"This is by far one of the best Medical apps I have ever used. Much, much better than what I expected. I love the fact that labs and diagnostic tests results are documented in the app. and easy to review. Many more features are part of the app as well. Billing, messages, appointments (past and future) and more. Very well done. Thank you.",
This app is very difficult to maneuver through you can't go back sometimes it blocks you from going forward and it's just very frustrating now I am uninstalling the app so that I could reinstall the app so that I could go to my doctor's office this is an ongoing situation I've been using the MyChart for years and it's just every single time it's something thank you,
I use my chart for my OSF hospital records as well as doctors records in any health care I have had. My chart isn't easy to use although at times very complicated and complex and drawn out procedures to get done simple tasks. My chart once set up is very very informative. Although a little complex to set up very very useful in the end and very worth the time,
"Easy communication vehicle with medical staff. App is geared to staff not patient. 1.Must enter data, then epress Enter key on keyboard and follow that by pressing OK on app menu else data is not saved. Keyboard Enter and OK buttons are not synced as with other apps. 2 Account times out too quickly. 3.Friends & Family Access may or may not work. 4. Video appt has to be on Website cause dies not work on smartphone. Other than that a great concept.",
"I really like except: 1) annoying that can't clear alerts from bell icon or doesn't auto update after alert is viewed; 2) keep tapping on icons w/ red ! thinking it must be something new but it isn't, just repeat of alerts under (1); 3) start a message w a lot of important data, switch apps to verify drug, date, take a call & no draft saved! Completely disappears & have to start all over again UGH!!! Some have hard time typing. NO reason for this w app security! 4) No feedback option in app.",
I love that I have access to all of my test results and have to ability to contact my doctor but the app falls short when you need an e-visit. I've attempted to contact my doctor twice in regards to an upper respiratory issue and either it hasn't gone thru or there is no way to check or follow up. I hope I don't get charged twice.,
I keep getting 500 internal server error whenever I sometimes go to messages or if I go to appointments and then switch back to messages. I've voiced my concern with customer service technical support and they told me there's nothing they could do on their end. It happened after an update.,
The new upgrade bugs need to be addressed ASAP. Being in the digital area we are in. The system should not give an error everytime someone would log in. After log in. The system continue to give more errors by not letting you see anything in your account. Please fix ASAP. I don't want to arrive at the doctor's office and have to sit in my car trying to reset the app due to errors.,
"Remove the splash page and just have the login page again to reduce wasting time and extra clicks. Have updates via the mobile actually get updated. Offer a quick printable patient overview with immunization history via the app for travel, sports athlete, camp, and other organization health submissions. Allow other M Health Fairview organizations to use the app for consolidated record access scheduling, billing, etc. Example-Fairview Home Infusions. It's dumb your affiliates aren't included.",
"Doesn't work. When I try to open it, it does nothing and then says internet connection not available and closes. So I tried Facebook and my Google search and a couple other apps that require internet service to run and everything is just fine so I tried again and same results.",
"If I try to use the medication refill button from the screen with shortcuts, it errors EVERY TIME. But, I figured out that if I go to Menu first, and Medication refills from THAT screen, it goes through. Otherwise, I LOVE having this access!!",
"It's so convenient to have all my doctors, appointments, visit notes, medications, test results, etc. all in one spot. Plus, there is an easy messaging center so I can ask a quick question, order refills, etc. Very user friendly.",
I really love how easy it is to navigate and I get results as the medical team receives them without the wait and worry and I can call if I have any questions. This really has made things easier to keep track of and reminds me what's coming up and what I need for the year. The new update makes it even more simple to use!!,
"This is a great app except they will block you in the beginning if you don't answer one little questionnaire they have hidden in an obscure place. I had to call them twice to find it after being locked out of my child's account. I didn't appreciate this. If you want something answered that badly, put it right up front.",
"Limited app. It will not let you do any updating, medication list, problem list, doesn't show the message I sent, did not show my last labs results (out of the office), health reminders (drug test screening, etc) that do not pertain to me. To be such a LARGE medical system, it is limited.",
"I was finally able to change my password . Having perused through this App, it seems quite comprehensive. I have heard some negative rumblings about MyChart, but that was in the beginning. Everything seems fine, and the info is detailed and correct.",
This app works great I haven't had any problems with it at all. I'm glad I have a MyChart it's so convenient no paperwork to carry around everything goes in here even if you are seen at an outside facility you can connect them so the info from that facility can go to your MyChart. Test results and the reason why you went to medical facility in the first place.,
"Can't actually activate features advertised. I get multiple notifications and emails that features such as ""Appointment Arrival"" are available to be activated, yet only RARELY do they actually exist on the page or list described in the instructions. Super annoying. Please stop insisting I activate imaginary features!",
"User interface update is nice. But the app logs you out constantly so it's easier just to open it on browser. Can't get password managers to work with it, but that may just be my problem and not others.",
This app has given me the opportunity to communicate with my doctors easier as well as getting my teat results and making appointment fast and convenient. I can't have my phone on me at work and typically work before and after office hours. This app makes it to were I can schedule my appointments late at night hassle-free.,
"If I were a major Hospital and this was my app I would be so embarrassed it would not be released. Half the menu selections are not available. The log out button is hidden two deep in the menu, and then not even a true menu item. This whole app is a disaster.",
My Chart is an excellent service to interact with your doctors and medical care professionals as well as keep up with all your appointments and medications. I was able to have some doctor's appointments through the app with Zoom which worked out very well. I highly recommend this app.,
"Decent, But BUGGY. I like that I can schedule appointments and view most lab results (there's apparently a bug that precludes viewing all results). I dislike that the app will show a notification dot when there is nothing new added.",
I love this private app and it really keeps me on track with most of my appointments. Only works if you're with WVU Medicine... For example: Not Charleston area. I personally can't always remember test results or appointments but with this app I can easily share with my husband and he can review my results for himself and help me keep up with my appointments 💓 Thank you,
"I have no problems using it for Cone Health for myself but when I added my minor son to manage his account nothing ever shows up for him. Plus, I have to switch organizations to my Wake Health for my son every time I try to sign in it always tells me I have the wrong username and password even though I know it's correct because I have it written down. It says it'll send me a link to my email to reset everything and it never does! So I ALWAYS have to call the help line & them reset it!",
"Love it! Very convenient. You don't have to worry about calendars, appointment cards, etc. Everything from doctors notes to letters and appointments right there at your fingertips. Also you can schedule your own appointment and message your doc without having to go to the office.",
"Every day at 4:59am it alerts me my daughter has a new test result when she doesn't. Not all tests are viewable like some are missing. It has had an alert for the last week she has a new appointment but has not. She is a very sick kids gets admitted a week at a time per month. This system is unreliable. It even shows she is under the care of doctors she has been transferred from, never seen, but doesn't show her correct and current team!",
"This app sucks! It says my username and password are incorrect even though they aren't, I can log in online just fine but app absolutely refuses to work! I've reached out to customer service and they tried to help but I literally tried everything they suggested and nothing worked! Very disappointed, I was hoping to use this app to make my life easier.",
It's so hard to find anything. I keep looking for doctors note to me & each time I just run across them by pure luck. They are not under messages. Or notes. Only thing I can find is test results & upcoming appointments if there are any. I don't feel like it's user friendly.,
"This app is awesome for scheduling appointments, contacting your doctors, viewing you medical history, and much more! I personally feel like it could use a few touch-ups in terms of aesthetics.",
"Drives me nuts, keep getting push notifications that there is new information but after logging in there is nothing there. Also, get push notifications for my wife's account instead of just mine! And it keeps bugging me to go paperless, I don't want to go paperless, but I can't disable the request.",
"I wish all my providers used this app. It is easy and convenient. I can do online check ins, manage apponents, send messages, and review test results. It also allows the syncing of multiple providers. Love it",
"I love MyChart! It's so useful as a patient to track appointments, view my medication list, message providers, and more! I only wish my primary organization implemented more features, such as expanded self-scheduling and letting me update my medical info (med list, etc.).",
Awful. Created an account but every time I try accessing I'm told wrong password. When I try to rectify I'm put into frustrating [politically correct term] loop. Cannot get a live person in cust service either. You can literally die using this system. I have no idea why I'm writing this as I'm positive NO ONE will respond.,
"Perfect Medical Organization App! Everything in once place for the whole family. Easy to use and navigate. Privacy ensured, yet easy to login with a print. Easy to use at check-in for appointments at clinics and hospitals. Send messages directly to nurses or doctors.",
"I love that I can access all my appointments,and check in ahead of time. As well as seeing all my test results when they come back all in one place. I can make, cancel and change appointments as needed also. This app is wonderful!",
I absolutely LOVE this app!! I feel like communication between you and the providers you deal with are so much quicker than having to call and wait on the phone to talk to someone. Yes there are times that even on the app you have to wait for a response but it's not as bad as having to wait on the phone. I use the app more than having to call my providers. Soooo easy to deal with especially when you also have to deal with small children at the same time. I would DEFINITELY recommend this app!!,
"The reminder for tasks done is stuck. Even though the task is done,it reminds me everyday to do the task. It's been 2 months of repeating and no way to stop it! No ads, which is good. Also doesn't connect to my doctor. My doctor doesn't exist on the app.",
"Easy idea, but far from what it should be. Can't access basic things on the app. You get redirected to use the web page for some things instead of the app When I go to the web page, I get stuck in a loop on how to recover my user name when I didn't request to do so. Shouldn't be this hard to use an app when you spend so much money on health care. The app should be almost, if not, perfect to use.",
"Hard to use. Also, scheduled a Dr. Appointment because my provider doesn't have a direct like apparently, and the day of the appointment, I take time off work and go in and they have no appointment for me. On the app, it said that the appointment was success and to arrive 15 minutes early. Couldn't screenshot it for privacy reasons disclosed on app (how convenient), so I had no way to prove I had scheduled it. Just physically go in to schedule or wait forever on the phone with the scheduling.",
"Great for the most part. I keep getting a popup saying ""We're having issues getting data from your linked accounts."" My providers say they can't see records from my previous organizations - have 4 in total. Are there instructions on fixing? I unlinked all and relinked, or do I need to wait awhile inbetween? Or, do you need to do something on your end?",
For a week it will not allow me to log in on my or my husband's phone. This app use to be great but not anymore. Keeps saying there is a problem connecting to the server. In this time we need access to remote health care. I have uninstalled and redownloaded twice to no avail.,
This app helps with alot of different things. For example you can schedule appointments or you can get refills for your medications. Not to mention it allows you to see and review all of your test results. This app has really made things easier to manage.,
"Painful to use. The homepage keeps insisting they need to verify my email address when it is already in the system and they email me all the time. For example, ""you have a new test result, go to mychart to review."" And I always respond. Email address confirmed!!!! Also it wants to verify my cell phone number by sending a one-time code to my landline number. Good luck with that! And it will NEVER have my cell phone number so it can sdnd me BS reminders constantly! Also keeps reminding me I",
"No back or menu button. Must constantly exit the app and then log back in. Total pain in the posterior. Was this a high school programming project? Swipe sideways? Gee why didn't I think of that (sarcasm)? Doesn't work. Also, why can I delete prescriptions but not add new ones. I'm pretty sure now that high schoolers would have done a better job.",
"It was much easier to navigate before. You have to remember that you are dealing with 65-70 year old people. When sending a message, there's a big block at the top that will not move and the keyboard below! That leaves you about a 1/4 inch to write in and if you want to read it back, you have to scroll up and down using that 1/4 inch!",
I like the idea of being able to check my results so quickly. Except the app never lets me login! Keeps telling me there was trouble connecting to the server. My data works on every other app so I know its not just my phone.,
"Not always easy to navigate, difficult to figure out what the New Message is, and to get rid of Notices on my screen that are useless to me; Would like to clean up the general messages sent, when I choose not to answer or navigate through them.",
"This is an excellent app. It keeps me connected with my primary doctor and specialist too. It reminds me of my appointments, medications, and I can get advice, refill medications, letters, make appointments and schedule an emergency visit to. It also gives me the summeries after the visit. This app is almost like having a Doctor twenty-four hours seven days a week. Love it.",
"I was struck how easy it is to use the MyChart app. Access to my providers' notes, labs, X-ray interpretation, and medications ordered gives me the ability to have a current status report on my health status. Beyond the clinical features, the reminders of upcoming appointments and billing information have been extremely helpful.",
"I love this app it's super helpful to see everything in one place. Makes a busy life a lot easier to manage. ^,^ It would be nice if it had a spot to log things like glucose, food, and BP for doctors if that's something you habe to track but I mean it's not a big deal to just wrote it down old school style. (:",
"Sorry guys, but it can't be that you are not able to connect to server for straight 2 weeks now. Have uninstalled the app, re-installed, checked my internet connections, no matter which device (also my husband and his account): nothing! 2weeks no access to myChart through the app and still counting.",
"navigation is horrendous. It forces you to logout and login when viewing different screens. I use the fingerprint login feature. If its a Hippa issue, you should be able to verify the user on the next screen you want to view whether it be by password or fingerprint, not force you to log out and login.",
"I like the app alot. Get answers to questions without having to wait on hold or keep calling an office. A plethora of resources to access like end of life and health issues info. One place to access my records from multiple providers in different health systems. One small negative, wish my med list could separate prn from regular meds.",
"Great app! It's easy to use, I can easily export upcoming appointments to my calendar. I can check in to appointments the day of the appointment. Best of all, I get notified when my test results are available and I can view them from the app.",
"It is very convenient and fast. I like doing the paperwork via MyChart so you don't have to rush filling out handwriting the forms in the waiting room trying to get done before they call your name. Also, it is so convenient to find or send records. Love it!",
"Best Med Chart App! I've used several & this one is not only the easiest to navigate, it's also the easiest to teach someone to use. Updates are supper smooth, no ads popping up, just all the info I need in one spot. Love it.",
I think this is the best app ever!! I can send a message to my Dr's & get a response quick. I use to be able to view the notes from my visits and I can't now 😕.I use my chart app all the time. especially my upcoming appt's... can't seem to get the virtual video to work maybe it's just me ...,
"It is not logical. Random items are lsted. Cant update items such as - Can't add a vaccine that isn't listed. Items are listed that don't make sense. Such as a change in how to take an rx. It says theres a change but doesn't tell you what the change is. The ""change"" is mis information and should say rx was renewed by provider.",
"Gets worse after each update to ""improve"" the app. After last one things won't load, the screen goes blank when trying to pay bill and it keeps saying server error. It becomes less and less user friendly.",
Whenever I try to log in from the application. It's never worked for me anymore. I get the notification but when I log in that stupid thing never opens. I have to go into my mail and open it from the link. It's so fursutared. Can someone just fix that? It's very annoying now !!,
"This app has made staying in touch with my team of doctors and surgeons super easy. Besides being able to talk to my doctors when I have questions, I can also see my test results when they are available, make appointments, find new providers, and a few other things. That's kind of awesome because doctors get busy easily and this app, I believe, allows them the time they need to respond, without feeling completely swamped. I don't know though. I do know it's made my care a lot better. TY PPLZ!",
An excellent easy to use app. Keeps all the info together. Only criticism is that it is not always possible to access records for amendments. Also it would be useful if the user could send messages/emails the Hospital departments.,
The app worked just fine before. Now I can't even access it. It keeps asking for access to my location which I have no interest in allowing. When I try to select a country or enter a medical organization it won't allow/find/accept any entry and I can't get past that screen. I can no longer access my medical information or submit/request anything. Roll your update back because this is a danger to patient health.,
Terrible app coding. Especially for sign up. Multiple attempted at creating profiles. Create>login> doesn't exist. Completely pointless. What's the point of a login if the private server doesn't even save your info to know that you have a profile to login in with,
"This is a nice App to have but I have noticed that it lacks the ability to be able to print a medication list or any document as a print feature is not available, as to my knowledge, as there is on the full webpage. Therefore I struggle in giving it a full 5 star review.",
"Thanks to a cancer diagnosis, I use this app way more than I would prefer. It is amazingly useful and fairly well designed. It's a bit annoying that it redirects to the website for some things, and a few things are missing, like historical test result comparisons, but overall this is a class A app.",
"So easy to use and so handy to have quick access to chart notes and reminders. If you take the time to set it up (just answer the questions) and get your meds in, it will save you and the nurses so much time going forward. I check in for my appts in the system, usually while I'm watching tv the evening before.",
SERIOUSLY NEEDS WORK!!! I'm rating it 4 star SOLELY because of its potential. A cloud based medical chart system that allows medical providers to see your charts from all providers. I was in hospital recently for 10 days. Tge hospital is EH medical provider but my PCP is RU. In the perfect world they could both see my records for both. They don't sync. Day 3 of my stay I ask why I have received my regular meds. They didn't see any listed. So! EPIC! Get on the ball and fix it.,
"Poor functionality, I thought I was having trouble getting my test results because I hadn't updated the app in a while, but once I updated I can't even find my provider anymore. I uninstalled the app rather than deal with the frustration.",
unable to load into my Samsung galaxy tablet. uninstalled several times as well as rebooted. once loaded it kept freezing at the consent for location. really poor and not usable. I know mychart as I have it on my iPhone. I know it works but not for android.,
"Very convenient. I really appreciate being able to see the summary of all of my visits as well as visit reminders, vaccine info and so much more. It can be a bit intimidating as a patient to comprehend all the medical jargon, but being able to look at notes and test results and be able to research every detail is life changing.",
"I use the MyChart app, and I find it to be incredibly helpful. It streamlines messages to and from all of my different healthcare providers. It keeps me updated on appointments and medications, and gives me immediate access to my health info. It is excellent!",
"I really like this app. Very easy to use, plus if you have any questions about how to use the app they have alot of videos on YouTube explaining how to use the app. This app keeps you updated on everything from medications to appointments past, and future. You can also send messages to your doctor, link all of your doctors together. Very useful app. I would give it 10 ⭐'s if I could.",
it would certainly be helpful if it worked considering it's the only way for me to contact my care providers: it tells me I'm disconnected if I try to join video calls & then kicks me even when it's 100% sure I'm connected､ as well as that now that I have a new phone it doesn't let me log in at all､ giving me the try again later error for days. reinstalling doesn't help & it's just completely broken & has been for years now,
I'm changing my original review from 5 stars to 3. It is difficult to navigate with no navigation buttons. The yellow/orange background color is terrible and you cannot customize it. It keeps telling me that I have to edit and confirm my phone and email but I have nothing to confirm and I can't take the message off. It doesn't actually connect with the clinics so don't try to cancel an appointment through this. However it's not completely useless and I like having it all in one place.,
"No longer working. For a long time this app was convenient and easy to navigate. But about 2 weeks ago it stopped working. I can no longer sign in. It won't load after I put in my password. I have uninstalled it twice to see if that makes a difference. No luck, I now have to sign in on my computer.",
"This app is extremely slow and seems to take forever to upload. It is difficult to navigate and not reliable during doctor's visits. Using this app is like going back to using a modem to connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the app three times before I could get it to do anything at all. Now I am still getting an error message every time I try to read a new message on My Chart on my mobile phone. If I could give the mobile app a different rating, I would give it a 0 instead of a 1.",
Test results have no time stamp which renders some of them almost useless. If blood work is repeated multiple times a day you cannot see the trend (if things are improving or getting worse) as I've found they dont come up in chronological order and no time is indicated to help determine the correct order.,
"I was cross checking some facts in course of writing a message to my provider. The app timed out before I could finish my message. I found no way of editing, and completing my message. I don't know if the message is sent or not. And whether I have to write and send a new message again!",
"There are reminders on the first page that have been done but you can't get off, which is very annoying. Test results are great to get. Very hard to combine previous doctors visits, test results, surgeries from another state with current information.",
"I love this app. It makes life so much easier and saves on unnecessary use of paper. I always know what's happening with my health, labs, medications, and appointments. My provider messages me information which also saves on unnecessary office visits. I recommend this to everyone. I even have my children's added to mine. Try it ! You are missing out.",
App sucks if you don't remember your password and you have to go through the email process which requires you to go out of application causing the application to to refresh at the beginning of giving your three bits of information and you've repeated this process over and over and over again causing your account to be disabled. It sucks.,
"This is a great app, couple complaints thoug. Some things I do have to log on to the actual website for my provider to read some results, or letters. Also with this most recent update, it won't allow me to save my fingerprint, so I have to type in my password every time. Minor complaints, I'm hoping it can be fixed soon :)",
"There is just to much that you can't change, correct, or cancel. It's really troublesome using this. I went in to update for an appointment and started having problems with my sign in. I don't live on this site so it's difficult when you think you know your sign in and you're forced to change it before you can get in. I need to finish now cause I probably could continue so I'm stopping.",
"It is too large to fit on one page but too small to read. Don't know what the fix would be exactly but can think about it and make suggestions, maybe one section at a time and tap 2 to get second section? Messages would be a good first section to appear! In my humble opinion of course",
Can be a little challenging to understand when you first install. Once you learn the app the convience of knowing your test results first hand without the dreaded wait for the doctor to call with them is a plus. Being I have no medical knowledge the results can be a little difficult to read from a layman's view. I do enjoy the accessibility if the app tough.,
"It's worked well and the appointment reminders are nice. It isn't possible to pay for those appointments on the app because the interface is very difficult to navigate. It wants your info but doesn't ever have a ""continue"" button.",
"Works well! Lot's of resources and information. Linking to different provider groups is great. Features available depend on what the provider organization has implemented, not all the same. I recommend this app, it keeps getting better.",
"I really like this app it's easy to keep up with my medical appointments, as well as my large list of medications. I'm a millennial so I don't like to spend a lot of time talking on the phone, with this app you can send and receive messages with your medical provider. One of my favorite features is the e-check in that let's you pre check into your appointment as well as pay your co-pay. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has to spend a lot of time at medical appointments.",
"This app saves me time trying to connect with my physician just to ask a question and allows the physician to be more efficient. I get timely answers that I can understand. I love having new scripts written for me with this app. Many times I think of the refills or the questions that I need to ask my doctor after they're working hours, sometimes in the middle of the night I'll remember something and I just use my app to take care of business. The app is constantly being updated w/ great features",
"Awesome app. Keeps up with messages back and forth to the doctor and nurses, appointment, and test results as well as appointments summary. Medications. Every test and x-ray from any facility can be added. I use it a lot. And depend on it to remind of my appointment and all my communicate I have to do on here. Thanks!!!",
This app sucks. I hate that my hospital forces us to use it. It is hard to find any of your info on it. Sigh up is hard and different for every hospital. I turned off notifications but it still harasses me. When I try to find a new doc it only lest me see new doctor in tx and I don't live in Texas. This app is frustrating. It's like the built an app for patients based on what the billing department wanted.,
"Useful app but every time I try to sign in it tells me my password is wrong. I have to force it to autofill the password, which is the same password I typed in, and it finally lets me on. **UPDATE** I decided it was not worth the aggravation so I just uninstalled it. Disappointing experience!",
"I love mychart it allows me to keep track of my appointments and medications. I can request refills and information. But getting my test results so quickly is the best feature. There was a time you waited for a call, letter or next appt. Sometimes it's hard to remember everything you discuss so the summary and reviews are good. Now it does depend a lot on the Dr.(office) as well. I'm fortunate I have an awesome Dr. who is very detailed.",
"Love it, it's so easy to setup appointments, text your Doctor and switch to your child's profile to do all those things. Responses from medical side come fast. Not sure why they have option for contacting technical and billing side from the app, you will never hear from them.",
I loved using this app when I can't access to a computer while being out of town or going to appointments. And now it keeps saying there's a newer version to download but I don't see any every time I go look for it or uninstall this app and reinstall it but still keeps saying there's a newer version,
"Love/hate relationship with this app. I love being able to access my information and schedule appointments. However, I HATE that I'm unable to to get the video feature for virtual appointments to work. I have contacted the developers who provided NO HELP WHATSOEVER. I have to use someone else's phone for my appointments.",
"nothing loads up. im trying to access my messages, test results ect...nothing. Nothing loads!!!!??? please fix everything about this app bc it would be really useful to have something that actually works.. also why even bother having an app that says ""server having problems"" EVERY DAMN TIME I TRY TO READ MESSAGES ?!?!?!. but it will notify ypy wheb u habe a message like 2 weeks after the message was sent to you. FIX IT OR DONT BOTHER!!",
"I can no longer log in to my account through the My chart app... any time I log in on the actual my chart website that is associated with my care provider I can log in just fine, but when attempting to log in through that app I am met with a message saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."". Hope this is fixed soon, otherwise it's a great app.",
"훌륭한 앱 I have been using (MyChart) this app since mid-late 2014 and never have I ever experienced any trouble with this app until now, that's why I am reinstalling MyChart back onto my phone as we speak. Idk if the creator of app is doing an update on it but everytime I was trying to login. It kept giving me a message about the server is experiencing technical difficulties please try again later. I have been trying and trying still no luck like what's up with that. #MyChartNeedsFixingPorFavor 💋",
"Who in their right mind thought, that blocking screenshots was a good idea. If you need to be able to save a message there is physically no way to do that. So frustrating; I uninstalled the app and went back to the website because of it",
"This is great, because I'm a patient of 2 different medical center and I merge both accounts with this app, and all my doctors now have access to all of my records. The only thing I have to provide are the images from studies (MRI, CT etc) everything else, any of them can see it no matter what medical center is.",
"This app thinks I'm a nomad. Everytime I sign in it wants me to update all my personal info that is up to date. Irritating. Now I just ignore it. Why don't they say, IF there are changes with your personal info please update. Overall it's a handy app and at least lets me input info without printing and filling in forms like some other medical apps.",
"It's impossible to speak to a physician because of my chart. The office relies 99% on this app for oatien lieu of interacting with [this] patient. I can not book, change my own appts. I've been blocked from using the Wait List option. There are so many mistakes in my chart that have been ignored, test results never discussed with me. Its showing Appts canceled I never made. Exclusive use of an App for patient care is not a fair substitute for doctor/patient interaction.",
"Does get confusing with the menu and where to get back to messages that appear on the home screen, are not in the Messaging tab. Update: Now that I've used this program much longer, it far exceeds my expectations.",
Getting more cumbersome with some providers (St. Luke's in KC MO) who force you into huge menu list before you get into the app. Effectively they force the user to select my chart twice before you can get to password/biometric screen. When I have to use that provider I just log into that provider on my laptop where they don't force that nonsense on the user.,
"I love it. Instead of dealing with phone calls or leaving messages that sometimes never get received, I realized that doctor's prefer this method as it is easier for them and a lot quicker for me to get a response back. I also love making my own appointments on My Chart. Super easy!! It's great 👍",
"Most generally this app works well. But to do any e-check ins, looking at financial aspects, confirming appointments or making a payment, it will continually come up and say there is an error on the server. Try again later. This is also doing the exact same thing for my wife. It gets aggrating as heck. And it isn't any certain time of day either., it is continuous. 😡",
So so slow/doesnt load. I like the idea of this app and all the options available. But it's useless if it does not work. This is my most frequent app that I have to close and reopen and update and do anything I can think of to make work.,
"I love it, if I forget to order my meds I can do it on the go with my phone. Easy to use. Access to all my test results appointments, etc... Smooth flow between screens no clunky slow load ups. Tech support is also spot on if you need anything",
"If you're editing an email to send to a doctor and you set the phone down, the app times out and deletes the draft instead of saving it. there is no function to save drafts. Completely unacceptable behavior for an app designed for professional correspondance with medical providers. deserves zero stars",
"It's only just ok. UI menu needs to include a menu to navigate to other sections on the app. In its current state, I need to switch accounts and log back in so I can get to my dashboard which is a bit frustrating.",
"I love the MyChart app. The functionality is great. To name a few; paperless, chart sharing across multiple hospital systems, I can communicate with my doctor's on my time and they can respond on their time, appointment reminders, veiw test results, med list, etc. The list goes on...",
One thing that would be really helpful would be a search function for test results. It would be great to see what that test looks like over time. Scrolling is very tedious and may be impossible for tests done quarterly or annually,
This app will not allow me to log in anymore. It always presents me with a change password option. I do not want to change my password as it works on my computers quite fine. It is already secure. I am trained in Security+ and this password already passed all parameters for being secure.,
"So far it is very easy to use and I love the fact that every Stitch of record that is in my medical file that I can view is at my fingertips and that all appointments and everything is scheduled and it's everything shows up on my chart is awesome thing that they have created and that I'd recommend it to anybody thank you for such a great app, the fact that I can see my files and look at myself at my test results and everything I think is an awesome thing even though I can't understand them.",
The app has a warning as soon as I open it asking me to confirm my email address. I've confirmed it a bunch of times but the warning won't go away. This app has been extremely helpful for me. I have sickle cell and see a few different doctors so it's nice to be able to look over my lab results and keep track of my appointments. Getting refills is a lot easier with the app as well.,
"Admittedly, I was skeptical at first. But I love the convenience. My provider normally replies to questions, or messages within a short time (generally 2 hours or less). I like that I can see test results the same day, even before my Doctor does. I really like the convenience of being able to get med refills basically with the click of a button. I needed refills so I messaged yesterday and this morning the pharmacy called, telling me they were ready.",
"Very smooth app! Easy to use, navigate, and it's intuitive. No real glitches I have noticed yet. This is an awesome option for a care provider and allows great access and information to medical information for me as a patient!",
"Great app for me and my family! It's so much more convenient to schedule an appointment or send a message to my doctor through the app than to have to spend time on the phone with the clinic. I love that I can easily check immunization history and past visit summaries when I need them, and that I can see all of my info from the 3 different clinics/hospitals I've been seen at all from one login.",
My Chart is one of my favorite apps ever. Medical records at a touch whenever I need them. Current medications list. Ability to make appointments without a phone call. I can message any of my doctors anytime of the day or night and they will respond within a reasonable time frame. Don't know how I ever did without this app.,
"The app crashes and returns you to the login screen when trying to login, pressing new user, or inputting a username. This does not appear to be a personal device issue, this seems like a software problem. Please fix. My details of the issue have been stated above.^",
"Worst updates I have ever seen in my life. You can't go back when your in the mobile version, I'm stuck on a preference page right now and no way to get out, I get multiple notifications on test results and there ends up just being one test result back once I log in and I could go on but why bother, the developers don't care -- it works for them so they don't care about what works or doesn't work for their customers.",
Absolutely love my chart! Easy to get results and information on visits and even schedule appointments. I may be fortunate to have a pcp who is responsive to messages through my chart but it has made my care so much easier without having to wait weeks for an appt just to have a question answered.,
"Very tedious. I am happy to be able to e mail my providers and see test results quickly. Having to submit the questionairres, and receiving CONSTANT, MULTIPLE REMINDERS is very irritating. The I.T. developers and facility need to keep the customer experience in mind.",
This app is probably the best thing AHS has offered. Being able to see my imaging reports as soon as they are ready and sharing my insights with my GP and other care providers is so handy. I haven't experienced any glitches with the app since having it for the past 2 years. 4 stars only because I wish it went further back in time for certain results and showed hospital imaging results and showed hospital stays and discharge notes,
"Of all the apps I have his one is the most useful. It's important to be able to communicate with your doctors with out making an appointment, or bothering with a ph call, it's everything in one place to help keep on top of your health, tests or prescriptions. This concept was a brilliant idea!",
"The apps is super easy to use, yet very powerful that it includes all my medical information with Kelsey, including visit notes, labs, imagings and medication. I certainly appreciate the future appointments and med refill reminders features. Only suggestion is that I wish all kinds of appointments woud be included and reminded as well.",
It's great! Fairly easy to use as in I would encourage anyone using it for the first time to thoroughly explore all the options. You can do everything from this app including prescription ordering. Absolutely the best I've experienced.,
"Genuinely useful way of accessing medical records, visit information, prescriptions, etc. It also works with many providers in this area and I can link them all. Occasionally some information may be slightly hidden, UI is good but imperfect.",
"This app is good...when it works. For the past week, I keep getting ""There is a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" There is nothing wrong with my login, because it works on the web version of MyChart. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not help.",
"I love having test results and after visit notes available at my fingertips! No more waiting for a call. Less time wasted checking in. And I can even leave messages for my doc. Its great if you have all services through the same organization, makes communication between all providers so much easier!",
I was extremely skeptical of using this app but I gotta admit its a game changer. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It's stocked full of information and scheduling of appointments to filling/picking up prescips. Reaching a medical professionals is easy as well via email.,
"This is by far one of the best Medical apps I have ever used. Much, much better than what I expected. I love the fact that labs and diagnostic tests results are documented in the app. and easy to review. Many more features are part of the app as well. Billing, messages, appointments (past and future) and more. Very well done. Thank you.",
This app is very difficult to maneuver through you can't go back sometimes it blocks you from going forward and it's just very frustrating now I am uninstalling the app so that I could reinstall the app so that I could go to my doctor's office this is an ongoing situation I've been using the MyChart for years and it's just every single time it's something thank you,
I use my chart for my OSF hospital records as well as doctors records in any health care I have had. My chart isn't easy to use although at times very complicated and complex and drawn out procedures to get done simple tasks. My chart once set up is very very informative. Although a little complex to set up very very useful in the end and very worth the time,
"Easy communication vehicle with medical staff. App is geared to staff not patient. 1.Must enter data, then epress Enter key on keyboard and follow that by pressing OK on app menu else data is not saved. Keyboard Enter and OK buttons are not synced as with other apps. 2 Account times out too quickly. 3.Friends & Family Access may or may not work. 4. Video appt has to be on Website cause dies not work on smartphone. Other than that a great concept.",
"I really like except: 1) annoying that can't clear alerts from bell icon or doesn't auto update after alert is viewed; 2) keep tapping on icons w/ red ! thinking it must be something new but it isn't, just repeat of alerts under (1); 3) start a message w a lot of important data, switch apps to verify drug, date, take a call & no draft saved! Completely disappears & have to start all over again UGH!!! Some have hard time typing. NO reason for this w app security! 4) No feedback option in app.",
I love that I have access to all of my test results and have to ability to contact my doctor but the app falls short when you need an e-visit. I've attempted to contact my doctor twice in regards to an upper respiratory issue and either it hasn't gone thru or there is no way to check or follow up. I hope I don't get charged twice.,
I keep getting 500 internal server error whenever I sometimes go to messages or if I go to appointments and then switch back to messages. I've voiced my concern with customer service technical support and they told me there's nothing they could do on their end. It happened after an update.,
The new upgrade bugs need to be addressed ASAP. Being in the digital area we are in. The system should not give an error everytime someone would log in. After log in. The system continue to give more errors by not letting you see anything in your account. Please fix ASAP. I don't want to arrive at the doctor's office and have to sit in my car trying to reset the app due to errors.,
"Remove the splash page and just have the login page again to reduce wasting time and extra clicks. Have updates via the mobile actually get updated. Offer a quick printable patient overview with immunization history via the app for travel, sports athlete, camp, and other organization health submissions. Allow other M Health Fairview organizations to use the app for consolidated record access scheduling, billing, etc. Example-Fairview Home Infusions. It's dumb your affiliates aren't included.",
"Doesn't work. When I try to open it, it does nothing and then says internet connection not available and closes. So I tried Facebook and my Google search and a couple other apps that require internet service to run and everything is just fine so I tried again and same results.",
"If I try to use the medication refill button from the screen with shortcuts, it errors EVERY TIME. But, I figured out that if I go to Menu first, and Medication refills from THAT screen, it goes through. Otherwise, I LOVE having this access!!",
"It's so convenient to have all my doctors, appointments, visit notes, medications, test results, etc. all in one spot. Plus, there is an easy messaging center so I can ask a quick question, order refills, etc. Very user friendly.",
I really love how easy it is to navigate and I get results as the medical team receives them without the wait and worry and I can call if I have any questions. This really has made things easier to keep track of and reminds me what's coming up and what I need for the year. The new update makes it even more simple to use!!,
"This is a great app except they will block you in the beginning if you don't answer one little questionnaire they have hidden in an obscure place. I had to call them twice to find it after being locked out of my child's account. I didn't appreciate this. If you want something answered that badly, put it right up front.",
"Limited app. It will not let you do any updating, medication list, problem list, doesn't show the message I sent, did not show my last labs results (out of the office), health reminders (drug test screening, etc) that do not pertain to me. To be such a LARGE medical system, it is limited.",
"I was finally able to change my password . Having perused through this App, it seems quite comprehensive. I have heard some negative rumblings about MyChart, but that was in the beginning. Everything seems fine, and the info is detailed and correct.",
This app works great I haven't had any problems with it at all. I'm glad I have a MyChart it's so convenient no paperwork to carry around everything goes in here even if you are seen at an outside facility you can connect them so the info from that facility can go to your MyChart. Test results and the reason why you went to medical facility in the first place.,
"Can't actually activate features advertised. I get multiple notifications and emails that features such as ""Appointment Arrival"" are available to be activated, yet only RARELY do they actually exist on the page or list described in the instructions. Super annoying. Please stop insisting I activate imaginary features!",
"User interface update is nice. But the app logs you out constantly so it's easier just to open it on browser. Can't get password managers to work with it, but that may just be my problem and not others.",
This app has given me the opportunity to communicate with my doctors easier as well as getting my teat results and making appointment fast and convenient. I can't have my phone on me at work and typically work before and after office hours. This app makes it to were I can schedule my appointments late at night hassle-free.,
"If I were a major Hospital and this was my app I would be so embarrassed it would not be released. Half the menu selections are not available. The log out button is hidden two deep in the menu, and then not even a true menu item. This whole app is a disaster.",
My Chart is an excellent service to interact with your doctors and medical care professionals as well as keep up with all your appointments and medications. I was able to have some doctor's appointments through the app with Zoom which worked out very well. I highly recommend this app.,
"Decent, But BUGGY. I like that I can schedule appointments and view most lab results (there's apparently a bug that precludes viewing all results). I dislike that the app will show a notification dot when there is nothing new added.",
I love this private app and it really keeps me on track with most of my appointments. Only works if you're with WVU Medicine... For example: Not Charleston area. I personally can't always remember test results or appointments but with this app I can easily share with my husband and he can review my results for himself and help me keep up with my appointments 💓 Thank you,
"I have no problems using it for Cone Health for myself but when I added my minor son to manage his account nothing ever shows up for him. Plus, I have to switch organizations to my Wake Health for my son every time I try to sign in it always tells me I have the wrong username and password even though I know it's correct because I have it written down. It says it'll send me a link to my email to reset everything and it never does! So I ALWAYS have to call the help line & them reset it!",
"Love it! Very convenient. You don't have to worry about calendars, appointment cards, etc. Everything from doctors notes to letters and appointments right there at your fingertips. Also you can schedule your own appointment and message your doc without having to go to the office.",
"Every day at 4:59am it alerts me my daughter has a new test result when she doesn't. Not all tests are viewable like some are missing. It has had an alert for the last week she has a new appointment but has not. She is a very sick kids gets admitted a week at a time per month. This system is unreliable. It even shows she is under the care of doctors she has been transferred from, never seen, but doesn't show her correct and current team!",
"This app sucks! It says my username and password are incorrect even though they aren't, I can log in online just fine but app absolutely refuses to work! I've reached out to customer service and they tried to help but I literally tried everything they suggested and nothing worked! Very disappointed, I was hoping to use this app to make my life easier.",
It's so hard to find anything. I keep looking for doctors note to me & each time I just run across them by pure luck. They are not under messages. Or notes. Only thing I can find is test results & upcoming appointments if there are any. I don't feel like it's user friendly.,
"This app is awesome for scheduling appointments, contacting your doctors, viewing you medical history, and much more! I personally feel like it could use a few touch-ups in terms of aesthetics.",
"Drives me nuts, keep getting push notifications that there is new information but after logging in there is nothing there. Also, get push notifications for my wife's account instead of just mine! And it keeps bugging me to go paperless, I don't want to go paperless, but I can't disable the request.",
"I wish all my providers used this app. It is easy and convenient. I can do online check ins, manage apponents, send messages, and review test results. It also allows the syncing of multiple providers. Love it",
"I love MyChart! It's so useful as a patient to track appointments, view my medication list, message providers, and more! I only wish my primary organization implemented more features, such as expanded self-scheduling and letting me update my medical info (med list, etc.).",
Awful. Created an account but every time I try accessing I'm told wrong password. When I try to rectify I'm put into frustrating [politically correct term] loop. Cannot get a live person in cust service either. You can literally die using this system. I have no idea why I'm writing this as I'm positive NO ONE will respond.,
"Perfect Medical Organization App! Everything in once place for the whole family. Easy to use and navigate. Privacy ensured, yet easy to login with a print. Easy to use at check-in for appointments at clinics and hospitals. Send messages directly to nurses or doctors.",
"I love that I can access all my appointments,and check in ahead of time. As well as seeing all my test results when they come back all in one place. I can make, cancel and change appointments as needed also. This app is wonderful!",
I absolutely LOVE this app!! I feel like communication between you and the providers you deal with are so much quicker than having to call and wait on the phone to talk to someone. Yes there are times that even on the app you have to wait for a response but it's not as bad as having to wait on the phone. I use the app more than having to call my providers. Soooo easy to deal with especially when you also have to deal with small children at the same time. I would DEFINITELY recommend this app!!,
"The reminder for tasks done is stuck. Even though the task is done,it reminds me everyday to do the task. It's been 2 months of repeating and no way to stop it! No ads, which is good. Also doesn't connect to my doctor. My doctor doesn't exist on the app.",
"Easy idea, but far from what it should be. Can't access basic things on the app. You get redirected to use the web page for some things instead of the app When I go to the web page, I get stuck in a loop on how to recover my user name when I didn't request to do so. Shouldn't be this hard to use an app when you spend so much money on health care. The app should be almost, if not, perfect to use.",
"Hard to use. Also, scheduled a Dr. Appointment because my provider doesn't have a direct like apparently, and the day of the appointment, I take time off work and go in and they have no appointment for me. On the app, it said that the appointment was success and to arrive 15 minutes early. Couldn't screenshot it for privacy reasons disclosed on app (how convenient), so I had no way to prove I had scheduled it. Just physically go in to schedule or wait forever on the phone with the scheduling.",
"Great for the most part. I keep getting a popup saying ""We're having issues getting data from your linked accounts."" My providers say they can't see records from my previous organizations - have 4 in total. Are there instructions on fixing? I unlinked all and relinked, or do I need to wait awhile inbetween? Or, do you need to do something on your end?",
For a week it will not allow me to log in on my or my husband's phone. This app use to be great but not anymore. Keeps saying there is a problem connecting to the server. In this time we need access to remote health care. I have uninstalled and redownloaded twice to no avail.,
This app helps with alot of different things. For example you can schedule appointments or you can get refills for your medications. Not to mention it allows you to see and review all of your test results. This app has really made things easier to manage.,
"Painful to use. The homepage keeps insisting they need to verify my email address when it is already in the system and they email me all the time. For example, ""you have a new test result, go to mychart to review."" And I always respond. Email address confirmed!!!! Also it wants to verify my cell phone number by sending a one-time code to my landline number. Good luck with that! And it will NEVER have my cell phone number so it can sdnd me BS reminders constantly! Also keeps reminding me I",
"No back or menu button. Must constantly exit the app and then log back in. Total pain in the posterior. Was this a high school programming project? Swipe sideways? Gee why didn't I think of that (sarcasm)? Doesn't work. Also, why can I delete prescriptions but not add new ones. I'm pretty sure now that high schoolers would have done a better job.",
"It was much easier to navigate before. You have to remember that you are dealing with 65-70 year old people. When sending a message, there's a big block at the top that will not move and the keyboard below! That leaves you about a 1/4 inch to write in and if you want to read it back, you have to scroll up and down using that 1/4 inch!",
I like the idea of being able to check my results so quickly. Except the app never lets me login! Keeps telling me there was trouble connecting to the server. My data works on every other app so I know its not just my phone.,
"Not always easy to navigate, difficult to figure out what the New Message is, and to get rid of Notices on my screen that are useless to me; Would like to clean up the general messages sent, when I choose not to answer or navigate through them.",
"This is an excellent app. It keeps me connected with my primary doctor and specialist too. It reminds me of my appointments, medications, and I can get advice, refill medications, letters, make appointments and schedule an emergency visit to. It also gives me the summeries after the visit. This app is almost like having a Doctor twenty-four hours seven days a week. Love it.",
"I was struck how easy it is to use the MyChart app. Access to my providers' notes, labs, X-ray interpretation, and medications ordered gives me the ability to have a current status report on my health status. Beyond the clinical features, the reminders of upcoming appointments and billing information have been extremely helpful.",
"I love this app it's super helpful to see everything in one place. Makes a busy life a lot easier to manage. ^,^ It would be nice if it had a spot to log things like glucose, food, and BP for doctors if that's something you habe to track but I mean it's not a big deal to just wrote it down old school style. (:",
"Sorry guys, but it can't be that you are not able to connect to server for straight 2 weeks now. Have uninstalled the app, re-installed, checked my internet connections, no matter which device (also my husband and his account): nothing! 2weeks no access to myChart through the app and still counting.",
"navigation is horrendous. It forces you to logout and login when viewing different screens. I use the fingerprint login feature. If its a Hippa issue, you should be able to verify the user on the next screen you want to view whether it be by password or fingerprint, not force you to log out and login.",
"I like the app alot. Get answers to questions without having to wait on hold or keep calling an office. A plethora of resources to access like end of life and health issues info. One place to access my records from multiple providers in different health systems. One small negative, wish my med list could separate prn from regular meds.",
"Great app! It's easy to use, I can easily export upcoming appointments to my calendar. I can check in to appointments the day of the appointment. Best of all, I get notified when my test results are available and I can view them from the app.",
"It is very convenient and fast. I like doing the paperwork via MyChart so you don't have to rush filling out handwriting the forms in the waiting room trying to get done before they call your name. Also, it is so convenient to find or send records. Love it!",
"Best Med Chart App! I've used several & this one is not only the easiest to navigate, it's also the easiest to teach someone to use. Updates are supper smooth, no ads popping up, just all the info I need in one spot. Love it.",
I think this is the best app ever!! I can send a message to my Dr's & get a response quick. I use to be able to view the notes from my visits and I can't now 😕.I use my chart app all the time. especially my upcoming appt's... can't seem to get the virtual video to work maybe it's just me ...,
"It is not logical. Random items are lsted. Cant update items such as - Can't add a vaccine that isn't listed. Items are listed that don't make sense. Such as a change in how to take an rx. It says theres a change but doesn't tell you what the change is. The ""change"" is mis information and should say rx was renewed by provider.",
"Gets worse after each update to ""improve"" the app. After last one things won't load, the screen goes blank when trying to pay bill and it keeps saying server error. It becomes less and less user friendly.",
Whenever I try to log in from the application. It's never worked for me anymore. I get the notification but when I log in that stupid thing never opens. I have to go into my mail and open it from the link. It's so fursutared. Can someone just fix that? It's very annoying now !!,
"This app has made staying in touch with my team of doctors and surgeons super easy. Besides being able to talk to my doctors when I have questions, I can also see my test results when they are available, make appointments, find new providers, and a few other things. That's kind of awesome because doctors get busy easily and this app, I believe, allows them the time they need to respond, without feeling completely swamped. I don't know though. I do know it's made my care a lot better. TY PPLZ!",
An excellent easy to use app. Keeps all the info together. Only criticism is that it is not always possible to access records for amendments. Also it would be useful if the user could send messages/emails the Hospital departments.,
The app worked just fine before. Now I can't even access it. It keeps asking for access to my location which I have no interest in allowing. When I try to select a country or enter a medical organization it won't allow/find/accept any entry and I can't get past that screen. I can no longer access my medical information or submit/request anything. Roll your update back because this is a danger to patient health.,
Terrible app coding. Especially for sign up. Multiple attempted at creating profiles. Create>login> doesn't exist. Completely pointless. What's the point of a login if the private server doesn't even save your info to know that you have a profile to login in with,
"This is a nice App to have but I have noticed that it lacks the ability to be able to print a medication list or any document as a print feature is not available, as to my knowledge, as there is on the full webpage. Therefore I struggle in giving it a full 5 star review.",
"Thanks to a cancer diagnosis, I use this app way more than I would prefer. It is amazingly useful and fairly well designed. It's a bit annoying that it redirects to the website for some things, and a few things are missing, like historical test result comparisons, but overall this is a class A app.",
"So easy to use and so handy to have quick access to chart notes and reminders. If you take the time to set it up (just answer the questions) and get your meds in, it will save you and the nurses so much time going forward. I check in for my appts in the system, usually while I'm watching tv the evening before.",
SERIOUSLY NEEDS WORK!!! I'm rating it 4 star SOLELY because of its potential. A cloud based medical chart system that allows medical providers to see your charts from all providers. I was in hospital recently for 10 days. Tge hospital is EH medical provider but my PCP is RU. In the perfect world they could both see my records for both. They don't sync. Day 3 of my stay I ask why I have received my regular meds. They didn't see any listed. So! EPIC! Get on the ball and fix it.,
"Poor functionality, I thought I was having trouble getting my test results because I hadn't updated the app in a while, but once I updated I can't even find my provider anymore. I uninstalled the app rather than deal with the frustration.",
unable to load into my Samsung galaxy tablet. uninstalled several times as well as rebooted. once loaded it kept freezing at the consent for location. really poor and not usable. I know mychart as I have it on my iPhone. I know it works but not for android.,
"Very convenient. I really appreciate being able to see the summary of all of my visits as well as visit reminders, vaccine info and so much more. It can be a bit intimidating as a patient to comprehend all the medical jargon, but being able to look at notes and test results and be able to research every detail is life changing.",
"I use the MyChart app, and I find it to be incredibly helpful. It streamlines messages to and from all of my different healthcare providers. It keeps me updated on appointments and medications, and gives me immediate access to my health info. It is excellent!",
"I really like this app. Very easy to use, plus if you have any questions about how to use the app they have alot of videos on YouTube explaining how to use the app. This app keeps you updated on everything from medications to appointments past, and future. You can also send messages to your doctor, link all of your doctors together. Very useful app. I would give it 10 ⭐'s if I could.",
it would certainly be helpful if it worked considering it's the only way for me to contact my care providers: it tells me I'm disconnected if I try to join video calls & then kicks me even when it's 100% sure I'm connected､ as well as that now that I have a new phone it doesn't let me log in at all､ giving me the try again later error for days. reinstalling doesn't help & it's just completely broken & has been for years now,
I'm changing my original review from 5 stars to 3. It is difficult to navigate with no navigation buttons. The yellow/orange background color is terrible and you cannot customize it. It keeps telling me that I have to edit and confirm my phone and email but I have nothing to confirm and I can't take the message off. It doesn't actually connect with the clinics so don't try to cancel an appointment through this. However it's not completely useless and I like having it all in one place.,
"No longer working. For a long time this app was convenient and easy to navigate. But about 2 weeks ago it stopped working. I can no longer sign in. It won't load after I put in my password. I have uninstalled it twice to see if that makes a difference. No luck, I now have to sign in on my computer.",
"This app is extremely slow and seems to take forever to upload. It is difficult to navigate and not reliable during doctor's visits. Using this app is like going back to using a modem to connect to the internet. I had to reinstall the app three times before I could get it to do anything at all. Now I am still getting an error message every time I try to read a new message on My Chart on my mobile phone. If I could give the mobile app a different rating, I would give it a 0 instead of a 1.",
Test results have no time stamp which renders some of them almost useless. If blood work is repeated multiple times a day you cannot see the trend (if things are improving or getting worse) as I've found they dont come up in chronological order and no time is indicated to help determine the correct order.,
"I was cross checking some facts in course of writing a message to my provider. The app timed out before I could finish my message. I found no way of editing, and completing my message. I don't know if the message is sent or not. And whether I have to write and send a new message again!",
"There are reminders on the first page that have been done but you can't get off, which is very annoying. Test results are great to get. Very hard to combine previous doctors visits, test results, surgeries from another state with current information.",
"I love this app. It makes life so much easier and saves on unnecessary use of paper. I always know what's happening with my health, labs, medications, and appointments. My provider messages me information which also saves on unnecessary office visits. I recommend this to everyone. I even have my children's added to mine. Try it ! You are missing out.",
App sucks if you don't remember your password and you have to go through the email process which requires you to go out of application causing the application to to refresh at the beginning of giving your three bits of information and you've repeated this process over and over and over again causing your account to be disabled. It sucks.,
"This is a great app, couple complaints thoug. Some things I do have to log on to the actual website for my provider to read some results, or letters. Also with this most recent update, it won't allow me to save my fingerprint, so I have to type in my password every time. Minor complaints, I'm hoping it can be fixed soon :)",
"There is just to much that you can't change, correct, or cancel. It's really troublesome using this. I went in to update for an appointment and started having problems with my sign in. I don't live on this site so it's difficult when you think you know your sign in and you're forced to change it before you can get in. I need to finish now cause I probably could continue so I'm stopping.",
"It is too large to fit on one page but too small to read. Don't know what the fix would be exactly but can think about it and make suggestions, maybe one section at a time and tap 2 to get second section? Messages would be a good first section to appear! In my humble opinion of course",
Can be a little challenging to understand when you first install. Once you learn the app the convience of knowing your test results first hand without the dreaded wait for the doctor to call with them is a plus. Being I have no medical knowledge the results can be a little difficult to read from a layman's view. I do enjoy the accessibility if the app tough.,
"It's worked well and the appointment reminders are nice. It isn't possible to pay for those appointments on the app because the interface is very difficult to navigate. It wants your info but doesn't ever have a ""continue"" button.",
"Works well! Lot's of resources and information. Linking to different provider groups is great. Features available depend on what the provider organization has implemented, not all the same. I recommend this app, it keeps getting better.",
"I really like this app it's easy to keep up with my medical appointments, as well as my large list of medications. I'm a millennial so I don't like to spend a lot of time talking on the phone, with this app you can send and receive messages with your medical provider. One of my favorite features is the e-check in that let's you pre check into your appointment as well as pay your co-pay. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has to spend a lot of time at medical appointments.",
"This app saves me time trying to connect with my physician just to ask a question and allows the physician to be more efficient. I get timely answers that I can understand. I love having new scripts written for me with this app. Many times I think of the refills or the questions that I need to ask my doctor after they're working hours, sometimes in the middle of the night I'll remember something and I just use my app to take care of business. The app is constantly being updated w/ great features",
"Awesome app. Keeps up with messages back and forth to the doctor and nurses, appointment, and test results as well as appointments summary. Medications. Every test and x-ray from any facility can be added. I use it a lot. And depend on it to remind of my appointment and all my communicate I have to do on here. Thanks!!!",
This app sucks. I hate that my hospital forces us to use it. It is hard to find any of your info on it. Sigh up is hard and different for every hospital. I turned off notifications but it still harasses me. When I try to find a new doc it only lest me see new doctor in tx and I don't live in Texas. This app is frustrating. It's like the built an app for patients based on what the billing department wanted.,
"Useful app but every time I try to sign in it tells me my password is wrong. I have to force it to autofill the password, which is the same password I typed in, and it finally lets me on. **UPDATE** I decided it was not worth the aggravation so I just uninstalled it. Disappointing experience!",
"I love mychart it allows me to keep track of my appointments and medications. I can request refills and information. But getting my test results so quickly is the best feature. There was a time you waited for a call, letter or next appt. Sometimes it's hard to remember everything you discuss so the summary and reviews are good. Now it does depend a lot on the Dr.(office) as well. I'm fortunate I have an awesome Dr. who is very detailed.",
"Love it, it's so easy to setup appointments, text your Doctor and switch to your child's profile to do all those things. Responses from medical side come fast. Not sure why they have option for contacting technical and billing side from the app, you will never hear from them.",
I loved using this app when I can't access to a computer while being out of town or going to appointments. And now it keeps saying there's a newer version to download but I don't see any every time I go look for it or uninstall this app and reinstall it but still keeps saying there's a newer version,
"Love/hate relationship with this app. I love being able to access my information and schedule appointments. However, I HATE that I'm unable to to get the video feature for virtual appointments to work. I have contacted the developers who provided NO HELP WHATSOEVER. I have to use someone else's phone for my appointments.",
"nothing loads up. im trying to access my messages, test results ect...nothing. Nothing loads!!!!??? please fix everything about this app bc it would be really useful to have something that actually works.. also why even bother having an app that says ""server having problems"" EVERY DAMN TIME I TRY TO READ MESSAGES ?!?!?!. but it will notify ypy wheb u habe a message like 2 weeks after the message was sent to you. FIX IT OR DONT BOTHER!!",
"I can no longer log in to my account through the My chart app... any time I log in on the actual my chart website that is associated with my care provider I can log in just fine, but when attempting to log in through that app I am met with a message saying ""We couldn't log you in right now. Please try again."". Hope this is fixed soon, otherwise it's a great app.",
"훌륭한 앱 I have been using (MyChart) this app since mid-late 2014 and never have I ever experienced any trouble with this app until now, that's why I am reinstalling MyChart back onto my phone as we speak. Idk if the creator of app is doing an update on it but everytime I was trying to login. It kept giving me a message about the server is experiencing technical difficulties please try again later. I have been trying and trying still no luck like what's up with that. #MyChartNeedsFixingPorFavor 💋",
"Who in their right mind thought, that blocking screenshots was a good idea. If you need to be able to save a message there is physically no way to do that. So frustrating; I uninstalled the app and went back to the website because of it",
"This is great, because I'm a patient of 2 different medical center and I merge both accounts with this app, and all my doctors now have access to all of my records. The only thing I have to provide are the images from studies (MRI, CT etc) everything else, any of them can see it no matter what medical center is.",
"This app thinks I'm a nomad. Everytime I sign in it wants me to update all my personal info that is up to date. Irritating. Now I just ignore it. Why don't they say, IF there are changes with your personal info please update. Overall it's a handy app and at least lets me input info without printing and filling in forms like some other medical apps.",
"It's impossible to speak to a physician because of my chart. The office relies 99% on this app for oatien lieu of interacting with [this] patient. I can not book, change my own appts. I've been blocked from using the Wait List option. There are so many mistakes in my chart that have been ignored, test results never discussed with me. Its showing Appts canceled I never made. Exclusive use of an App for patient care is not a fair substitute for doctor/patient interaction.",
"Does get confusing with the menu and where to get back to messages that appear on the home screen, are not in the Messaging tab. Update: Now that I've used this program much longer, it far exceeds my expectations.",
Getting more cumbersome with some providers (St. Luke's in KC MO) who force you into huge menu list before you get into the app. Effectively they force the user to select my chart twice before you can get to password/biometric screen. When I have to use that provider I just log into that provider on my laptop where they don't force that nonsense on the user.,
"I love it. Instead of dealing with phone calls or leaving messages that sometimes never get received, I realized that doctor's prefer this method as it is easier for them and a lot quicker for me to get a response back. I also love making my own appointments on My Chart. Super easy!! It's great 👍",
"Most generally this app works well. But to do any e-check ins, looking at financial aspects, confirming appointments or making a payment, it will continually come up and say there is an error on the server. Try again later. This is also doing the exact same thing for my wife. It gets aggrating as heck. And it isn't any certain time of day either., it is continuous. 😡",
So so slow/doesnt load. I like the idea of this app and all the options available. But it's useless if it does not work. This is my most frequent app that I have to close and reopen and update and do anything I can think of to make work.,
"I love it, if I forget to order my meds I can do it on the go with my phone. Easy to use. Access to all my test results appointments, etc... Smooth flow between screens no clunky slow load ups. Tech support is also spot on if you need anything",
"If you're editing an email to send to a doctor and you set the phone down, the app times out and deletes the draft instead of saving it. there is no function to save drafts. Completely unacceptable behavior for an app designed for professional correspondance with medical providers. deserves zero stars",
"It's only just ok. UI menu needs to include a menu to navigate to other sections on the app. In its current state, I need to switch accounts and log back in so I can get to my dashboard which is a bit frustrating.",
"I love the MyChart app. The functionality is great. To name a few; paperless, chart sharing across multiple hospital systems, I can communicate with my doctor's on my time and they can respond on their time, appointment reminders, veiw test results, med list, etc. The list goes on...",
One thing that would be really helpful would be a search function for test results. It would be great to see what that test looks like over time. Scrolling is very tedious and may be impossible for tests done quarterly or annually,
This app will not allow me to log in anymore. It always presents me with a change password option. I do not want to change my password as it works on my computers quite fine. It is already secure. I am trained in Security+ and this password already passed all parameters for being secure.,
"So far it is very easy to use and I love the fact that every Stitch of record that is in my medical file that I can view is at my fingertips and that all appointments and everything is scheduled and it's everything shows up on my chart is awesome thing that they have created and that I'd recommend it to anybody thank you for such a great app, the fact that I can see my files and look at myself at my test results and everything I think is an awesome thing even though I can't understand them.",
The app has a warning as soon as I open it asking me to confirm my email address. I've confirmed it a bunch of times but the warning won't go away. This app has been extremely helpful for me. I have sickle cell and see a few different doctors so it's nice to be able to look over my lab results and keep track of my appointments. Getting refills is a lot easier with the app as well.,
"Admittedly, I was skeptical at first. But I love the convenience. My provider normally replies to questions, or messages within a short time (generally 2 hours or less). I like that I can see test results the same day, even before my Doctor does. I really like the convenience of being able to get med refills basically with the click of a button. I needed refills so I messaged yesterday and this morning the pharmacy called, telling me they were ready.",
"Very smooth app! Easy to use, navigate, and it's intuitive. No real glitches I have noticed yet. This is an awesome option for a care provider and allows great access and information to medical information for me as a patient!",
"Great app for me and my family! It's so much more convenient to schedule an appointment or send a message to my doctor through the app than to have to spend time on the phone with the clinic. I love that I can easily check immunization history and past visit summaries when I need them, and that I can see all of my info from the 3 different clinics/hospitals I've been seen at all from one login.",
My Chart is one of my favorite apps ever. Medical records at a touch whenever I need them. Current medications list. Ability to make appointments without a phone call. I can message any of my doctors anytime of the day or night and they will respond within a reasonable time frame. Don't know how I ever did without this app.,
"The app crashes and returns you to the login screen when trying to login, pressing new user, or inputting a username. This does not appear to be a personal device issue, this seems like a software problem. Please fix. My details of the issue have been stated above.^",
"Worst updates I have ever seen in my life. You can't go back when your in the mobile version, I'm stuck on a preference page right now and no way to get out, I get multiple notifications on test results and there ends up just being one test result back once I log in and I could go on but why bother, the developers don't care -- it works for them so they don't care about what works or doesn't work for their customers.",
Absolutely love my chart! Easy to get results and information on visits and even schedule appointments. I may be fortunate to have a pcp who is responsive to messages through my chart but it has made my care so much easier without having to wait weeks for an appt just to have a question answered.,
"Very tedious. I am happy to be able to e mail my providers and see test results quickly. Having to submit the questionairres, and receiving CONSTANT, MULTIPLE REMINDERS is very irritating. The I.T. developers and facility need to keep the customer experience in mind.",
This app is probably the best thing AHS has offered. Being able to see my imaging reports as soon as they are ready and sharing my insights with my GP and other care providers is so handy. I haven't experienced any glitches with the app since having it for the past 2 years. 4 stars only because I wish it went further back in time for certain results and showed hospital imaging results and showed hospital stays and discharge notes,
"Of all the apps I have his one is the most useful. It's important to be able to communicate with your doctors with out making an appointment, or bothering with a ph call, it's everything in one place to help keep on top of your health, tests or prescriptions. This concept was a brilliant idea!",
"The apps is super easy to use, yet very powerful that it includes all my medical information with Kelsey, including visit notes, labs, imagings and medication. I certainly appreciate the future appointments and med refill reminders features. Only suggestion is that I wish all kinds of appointments woud be included and reminded as well.",
It's great! Fairly easy to use as in I would encourage anyone using it for the first time to thoroughly explore all the options. You can do everything from this app including prescription ordering. Absolutely the best I've experienced.,
"Genuinely useful way of accessing medical records, visit information, prescriptions, etc. It also works with many providers in this area and I can link them all. Occasionally some information may be slightly hidden, UI is good but imperfect.",
"This app is good...when it works. For the past week, I keep getting ""There is a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later."" There is nothing wrong with my login, because it works on the web version of MyChart. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not help.",
"I love having test results and after visit notes available at my fingertips! No more waiting for a call. Less time wasted checking in. And I can even leave messages for my doc. Its great if you have all services through the same organization, makes communication between all providers so much easier!",
I was extremely skeptical of using this app but I gotta admit its a game changer. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It's stocked full of information and scheduling of appointments to filling/picking up prescips. Reaching a medical professionals is easy as well via email.,
"This is by far one of the best Medical apps I have ever used. Much, much better than what I expected. I love the fact that labs and diagnostic tests results are documented in the app. and easy to review. Many more features are part of the app as well. Billing, messages, appointments (past and future) and more. Very well done. Thank you.",
This app is very difficult to maneuver through you can't go back sometimes it blocks you from going forward and it's just very frustrating now I am uninstalling the app so that I could reinstall the app so that I could go to my doctor's office this is an ongoing situation I've been using the MyChart for years and it's just every single time it's something thank you,
I use my chart for my OSF hospital records as well as doctors records in any health care I have had. My chart isn't easy to use although at times very complicated and complex and drawn out procedures to get done simple tasks. My chart once set up is very very informative. Although a little complex to set up very very useful in the end and very worth the time,
"Easy communication vehicle with medical staff. App is geared to staff not patient. 1.Must enter data, then epress Enter key on keyboard and follow that by pressing OK on app menu else data is not saved. Keyboard Enter and OK buttons are not synced as with other apps. 2 Account times out too quickly. 3.Friends & Family Access may or may not work. 4. Video appt has to be on Website cause dies not work on smartphone. Other than that a great concept.",
"I really like except: 1) annoying that can't clear alerts from bell icon or doesn't auto update after alert is viewed; 2) keep tapping on icons w/ red ! thinking it must be something new but it isn't, just repeat of alerts under (1); 3) start a message w a lot of important data, switch apps to verify drug, date, take a call & no draft saved! Completely disappears & have to start all over again UGH!!! Some have hard time typing. NO reason for this w app security! 4) No feedback option in app.",
I love that I have access to all of my test results and have to ability to contact my doctor but the app falls short when you need an e-visit. I've attempted to contact my doctor twice in regards to an upper respiratory issue and either it hasn't gone thru or there is no way to check or follow up. I hope I don't get charged twice.,
I keep getting 500 internal server error whenever I sometimes go to messages or if I go to appointments and then switch back to messages. I've voiced my concern with customer service technical support and they told me there's nothing they could do on their end. It happened after an update.,
The new upgrade bugs need to be addressed ASAP. Being in the digital area we are in. The system should not give an error everytime someone would log in. After log in. The system continue to give more errors by not letting you see anything in your account. Please fix ASAP. I don't want to arrive at the doctor's office and have to sit in my car trying to reset the app due to errors.,
"Remove the splash page and just have the login page again to reduce wasting time and extra clicks. Have updates via the mobile actually get updated. Offer a quick printable patient overview with immunization history via the app for travel, sports athlete, camp, and other organization health submissions. Allow other M Health Fairview organizations to use the app for consolidated record access scheduling, billing, etc. Example-Fairview Home Infusions. It's dumb your affiliates aren't included.",
"Doesn't work. When I try to open it, it does nothing and then says internet connection not available and closes. So I tried Facebook and my Google search and a couple other apps that require internet service to run and everything is just fine so I tried again and same results.",
"If I try to use the medication refill button from the screen with shortcuts, it errors EVERY TIME. But, I figured out that if I go to Menu first, and Medication refills from THAT screen, it goes through. Otherwise, I LOVE having this access!!",
"It's so convenient to have all my doctors, appointments, visit notes, medications, test results, etc. all in one spot. Plus, there is an easy messaging center so I can ask a quick question, order refills, etc. Very user friendly.",
I really love how easy it is to navigate and I get results as the medical team receives them without the wait and worry and I can call if I have any questions. This really has made things easier to keep track of and reminds me what's coming up and what I need for the year. The new update makes it even more simple to use!!,
"This is a great app except they will block you in the beginning if you don't answer one little questionnaire they have hidden in an obscure place. I had to call them twice to find it after being locked out of my child's account. I didn't appreciate this. If you want something answered that badly, put it right up front.",
"Limited app. It will not let you do any updating, medication list, problem list, doesn't show the message I sent, did not show my last labs results (out of the office), health reminders (drug test screening, etc) that do not pertain to me. To be such a LARGE medical system, it is limited.",
"I was finally able to change my password . Having perused through this App, it seems quite comprehensive. I have heard some negative rumblings about MyChart, but that was in the beginning. Everything seems fine, and the info is detailed and correct.",
This app works great I haven't had any problems with it at all. I'm glad I have a MyChart it's so convenient no paperwork to carry around everything goes in here even if you are seen at an outside facility you can connect them so the info from that facility can go to your MyChart. Test results and the reason why you went to medical facility in the first place.,
"Can't actually activate features advertised. I get multiple notifications and emails that features such as ""Appointment Arrival"" are available to be activated, yet only RARELY do they actually exist on the page or list described in the instructions. Super annoying. Please stop insisting I activate imaginary features!",
"User interface update is nice. But the app logs you out constantly so it's easier just to open it on browser. Can't get password managers to work with it, but that may just be my problem and not others.",
This app has given me the opportunity to communicate with my doctors easier as well as getting my teat results and making appointment fast and convenient. I can't have my phone on me at work and typically work before and after office hours. This app makes it to were I can schedule my appointments late at night hassle-free.,
"If I were a major Hospital and this was my app I would be so embarrassed it would not be released. Half the menu selections are not available. The log out button is hidden two deep in the menu, and then not even a true menu item. This whole app is a disaster.",
My Chart is an excellent service to interact with your doctors and medical care professionals as well as keep up with all your appointments and medications. I was able to have some doctor's appointments through the app with Zoom which worked out very well. I highly recommend this app.,
"Decent, But BUGGY. I like that I can schedule appointments and view most lab results (there's apparently a bug that precludes viewing all results). I dislike that the app will show a notification dot when there is nothing new added.",
I love this private app and it really keeps me on track with most of my appointments. Only works if you're with WVU Medicine... For example: Not Charleston area. I personally can't always remember test results or appointments but with this app I can easily share with my husband and he can review my results for himself and help me keep up with my appointments 💓 Thank you,
"I have no problems using it for Cone Health for myself but when I added my minor son to manage his account nothing ever shows up for him. Plus, I have to switch organizations to my Wake Health for my son every time I try to sign in it always tells me I have the wrong username and password even though I know it's correct because I have it written down. It says it'll send me a link to my email to reset everything and it never does! So I ALWAYS have to call the help line & them reset it!",
"Love it! Very convenient. You don't have to worry about calendars, appointment cards, etc. Everything from doctors notes to letters and appointments right there at your fingertips. Also you can schedule your own appointment and message your doc without having to go to the office.",
"Every day at 4:59am it alerts me my daughter has a new test result when she doesn't. Not all tests are viewable like some are missing. It has had an alert for the last week she has a new appointment but has not. She is a very sick kids gets admitted a week at a time per month. This system is unreliable. It even shows she is under the care of doctors she has been transferred from, never seen, but doesn't show her correct and current team!",
"This app sucks! It says my username and password are incorrect even though they aren't, I can log in online just fine but app absolutely refuses to work! I've reached out to customer service and they tried to help but I literally tried everything they suggested and nothing worked! Very disappointed, I was hoping to use this app to make my life easier.",
It's so hard to find anything. I keep looking for doctors note to me & each time I just run across them by pure luck. They are not under messages. Or notes. Only thing I can find is test results & upcoming appointments if there are any. I don't feel like it's user friendly.,
"This app is awesome for scheduling appointments, contacting your doctors, viewing you medical history, and much more! I personally feel like it could use a few touch-ups in terms of aesthetics.",
"Drives me nuts, keep getting push notifications that there is new information but after logging in there is nothing there. Also, get push notifications for my wife's account instead of just mine! And it keeps bugging me to go paperless, I don't want to go paperless, but I can't disable the request.",
"I wish all my providers used this app. It is easy and convenient. I can do online check ins, manage apponents, send messages, and review test results. It also allows the syncing of multiple providers. Love it",
"I love MyChart! It's so useful as a patient to track appointments, view my medication list, message providers, and more! I only wish my primary organization implemented more features, such as expanded self-scheduling and letting me update my medical info (med list, etc.).",
Awful. Created an account but every time I try accessing I'm told wrong password. When I try to rectify I'm put into frustrating [politically correct term] loop. Cannot get a live person in cust service either. You can literally die using this system. I have no idea why I'm writing this as I'm positive NO ONE will respond.,
"Perfect Medical Organization App! Everything in once place for the whole family. Easy to use and navigate. Privacy ensured, yet easy to login with a print. Easy to use at check-in for appointments at clinics and hospitals. Send messages directly to nurses or doctors.",
"I love that I can access all my appointments,and check in ahead of time. As well as seeing all my test results when they come back all in one place. I can make, cancel and change appointments as needed also. This app is wonderful!",
I absolutely LOVE this app!! I feel like communication between you and the providers you deal with are so much quicker than having to call and wait on the phone to talk to someone. Yes there are times that even on the app you have to wait for a response but it's not as bad as having to wait on the phone. I use the app more than having to call my providers. Soooo easy to deal with especially when you also have to deal with small children at the same time. I would DEFINITELY recommend this app!!,
"The reminder for tasks done is stuck. Even though the task is done,it reminds me everyday to do the task. It's been 2 months of repeating and no way to stop it! No ads, which is good. Also doesn't connect to my doctor. My doctor doesn't exist on the app.",
"Easy idea, but far from what it should be. Can't access basic things on the app. You get redirected to use the web page for some things instead of the app When I go to the web page, I get stuck in a loop on how to recover my user name when I didn't request to do so. Shouldn't be this hard to use an app when you spend so much money on health care. The app should be almost, if not, perfect to use.",
"Hard to use. Also, scheduled a Dr. Appointment because my provider doesn't have a direct like apparently, and the day of the appointment, I take time off work and go in and they have no appointment for me. On the app, it said that the appointment was success and to arrive 15 minutes early. Couldn't screenshot it for privacy reasons disclosed on app (how convenient), so I had no way to prove I had scheduled it. Just physically go in to schedule or wait forever on the phone with the scheduling.",
"Great for the most part. I keep getting a popup saying ""We're having issues getting data from your linked accounts."" My providers say they can't see records from my previous organizations - have 4 in total. Are there instructions on fixing? I unlinked all and relinked, or do I need to wait awhile inbetween? Or, do you need to do something on your end?",
For a week it will not allow me to log in on my or my husband's phone. This app use to be great but not anymore. Keeps saying there is a problem connecting to the server. In this time we need access to remote health care. I have uninstalled and redownloaded twice to no avail.,
This app helps with alot of different things. For example you can schedule appointments or you can get refills for your medications. Not to mention it allows you to see and review all of your test results. This app has really made things easier to manage.,
"Painful to use. The homepage keeps insisting they need to verify my email address when it is already in the system and they email me all the time. For example, ""you have a new test result, go to mychart to review."" And I always respond. Email address confirmed!!!! Also it wants to verify my cell phone number by sending a one-time code to my landline number. Good luck with that! And it will NEVER have my cell phone number so it can sdnd me BS reminders constantly! Also keeps reminding me I",
"No back or menu button. Must constantly exit the app and then log back in. Total pain in the posterior. Was this a high school programming project? Swipe sideways? Gee why didn't I think of that (sarcasm)? Doesn't work. Also, why can I delete prescriptions but not add new ones. I'm pretty sure now that high schoolers would have done a better job.",
"It was much easier to navigate before. You have to remember that you are dealing with 65-70 year old people. When sending a message, there's a big block at the top that will not move and the keyboard below! That leaves you about a 1/4 inch to write in and if you want to read it back, you have to scroll up and down using that 1/4 inch!",
I like the idea of being able to check my results so quickly. Except the app never lets me login! Keeps telling me there was trouble connecting to the server. My data works on every other app so I know its not just my phone.,
"Not always easy to navigate, difficult to figure out what the New Message is, and to get rid of Notices on my screen that are useless to me; Would like to clean up the general messages sent, when I choose not to answer or navigate through them.",
"This is an excellent app. It keeps me connected with my primary doctor and specialist too. It reminds me of my appointments, medications, and I can get advice, refill medications, letters, make appointments and schedule an emergency visit to. It also gives me the summeries after the visit. This app is almost like having a Doctor twenty-four hours seven days a week. Love it.",
"I was struck how easy it is to use the MyChart app. Access to my providers' notes, labs, X-ray interpretation, and medications ordered gives me the ability to have a current status report on my health status. Beyond the clinical features, the reminders of upcoming appointments and billing information have been extremely helpful.",
"I love this app it's super helpful to see everything in one place. Makes a busy life a lot easier to manage. ^,^ It would be nice if it had a spot to log things like glucose, food, and BP for doctors if that's something you habe to track but I mean it's not a big deal to just wrote it down old school style. (:",
"Sorry guys, but it can't be that you are not able to connect to server for straight 2 weeks now. Have uninstalled the app, re-installed, checked my internet connections, no matter which device (also my husband and his account): nothing! 2weeks no access to myChart through the app and still counting.",
"navigation is horrendous. It forces you to logout and login when viewing different screens. I use the fingerprint login feature. If its a Hippa issue, you should be able to verify the user on the next screen you want to view whether it be by password or fingerprint, not force you to log out and login.",
"I like the app alot. Get answers to questions without having to wait on hold or keep calling an office. A plethora of resources to access like end of life and health issues info. One place to access my records from multiple providers in different health systems. One small negative, wish my med list could separate prn from regular meds.",
"Great app! It's easy to use, I can easily export upcoming appointments to my calendar. I can check in to appointments the day of the appointment. Best of all, I get notified when my test results are available and I can view them from the app.",
"It is very convenient and fast. I like doing the paperwork via MyChart so you don't have to rush filling out handwriting the forms in the waiting room trying to get done before they call your name. Also, it is so convenient to find or send records. Love it!",
"Best Med Chart App! I've used several & this one is not only the easiest to navigate, it's also the easiest to teach someone to use. Updates are supper smooth, no ads popping up, just all the info I need in one spot. Love it.",
I think this is the best app ever!! I can send a message to my Dr's & get a response quick. I use to be able to view the notes from my visits and I can't now 😕.I use my chart app all the time. especially my upcoming appt's... can't seem to get the virtual video to work maybe it's just me ...,
"It is not logical. Random items are lsted. Cant update items such as - Can't add a vaccine that isn't listed. Items are listed that don't make sense. Such as a change in how to take an rx. It says theres a change but doesn't tell you what the change is. The ""change"" is mis information and should say rx was renewed by provider.",
"Gets worse after each update to ""improve"" the app. After last one things won't load, the screen goes blank when trying to pay bill and it keeps saying server error. It becomes less and less user friendly.",
Whenever I try to log in from the application. It's never worked for me anymore. I get the notification but when I log in that stupid thing never opens. I have to go into my mail and open it from the link. It's so fursutared. Can someone just fix that? It's very annoying now !!,
"This app has made staying in touch with my team of doctors and surgeons super easy. Besides being able to talk to my doctors when I have questions, I can also see my test results when they are available, make appointments, find new providers, and a few other things. That's kind of awesome because doctors get busy easily and this app, I believe, allows them the time they need to respond, without feeling completely swamped. I don't know though. I do know it's made my care a lot better. TY PPLZ!",
"It was my best app until 6/27 when I was forced to reset/change my password 😑. Why? But outside of that, I like MyChart 👍🏼.",
"Love this app, so easy to contact my providers.",
"It is very helpful, easy to use, very intuitive",
"Love it when it works! Half the time I can't get into the individual sections. It keeps saying something about server error try again later. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.",
"I'm a completely new user so these are just first impressions. App seems impressively well-designed & I look forward to its overall utility but holy hell, devs... if I'm picking a state/COUNTY then do *not* force me to scroll through 100+ [non-US] options!😵 Some sort of search bar or alphabetical shortcut should be incorporated, albeit idk how that would be achieved as is when they're drop-down menus; best to let them extract from zip or be basic text like city is imo. Also: DARK MODE please😓",
"The Android version of this app is horrible. I realize epic is a giant company, but instead of asking hospitals what should be in the app, have your pm staff spend a few days in the hospital trying to keep track of their care using the app. They will come out with a whole new attitude about how the app should look and feel. I also know that you want to have 1 interface that works for everyone, the result is a disaster. Everyone is saddled with an interface for for a 100 year old senial person.",
It's a one stop shop. Make appointments. Reorder prescriptions. And message the Doctor anytime and have a response within a reasonable time.,
Very informative about appointment scheduling and cancelation.,
Love this App. I can view my Healthcare with just a click.,
I love seeing my results of testing and remindings for appointments!,
Best health service portal and derivery I have ever come across.,
Great customer service. Have great doctors. But your hospital doesn't take Aetna Better health care plans any more so I had to leave,
I really like the my chart it's so convenient and you get your results before you see your doctor and don't have to be worried or in suspense wondering what is wrong with you,
Great place to keep track of everything medical.,
very simple to navigate and easy to use,
"This has been such help for me because I am always on the go. If any of my son's teachers need a result, I am able to show them, and I save Gas ! Thank You Alta-Med !",
"I love how easy it is to organize my family health records and bills. I like how I can jump to another hospital's Mychart, it is very convenient.",
"Easy to understand UI, great for scheduling, Test results, visit notes, visit summary, sending messages and plenty more.",
Mychart provides my medical information no matter where I happen to be. I can just bring up my medical information to any provider. Even if I don't remember the name of the medication that I'm on I can just bring up the app and there it is. It is wonderful,
Love EVERYTHING about it. Specially how it REMINDS YOU of upcoming appointments. And it gives you test results. Absolutely necessary 💯💯💯💯%%% HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,
Keeps freezing when pulling up messages. Haven't been able to send or read any for a while .,
Everything is so simple 😌 2 used n understand iam just learning how 2 use computers mychart great app,
Unable to change answers if you make a mistake. This caused a great deal of confusion and extra paperwork in an already confusing system,
Been using this app for several years to communicate and keep up with my medical stuff. It's easy to use and updates immediately . I highly recommend this application.,
Really helpful and informative very convenient.,
Quick and easy way to contact the office,
"I have been using MyChart for awhile now and it sure makes it easy for me to see all my doctors, appointments and labs needed! Thank you MyChart",
All the information was present for me to view. All the future and past visits were there for me to check anytime I wanted or needed to review my appointments.,
Have MyChart has been a great feature! Being able to message your doctor or look at recent visits or being updated on needed results has been excellent!,
For a person who is impatient this app helps get me my results quicker refills and scheduling piece of cake,
Most of the time works well and provides better doctor patients communication.,
Very user friendly and easy to maneuver.,
"It would be a 5, if I could get some help figuring out why I have been having difficulty reading letters and summaries!",
"I see that others are getting a blank screen after they log-in. I can't even get that far. The app gives me an error when I TRY to log in, so I cannot log-in at all. In a reply it sounded like it was an issue the developers of this app are having with Android. Might wanna prioritize addressing the problem because this is pretty unacceptable.",
"It is a fantabulous app for most of your medical needs, questions, scheduling app'ts and messaging your health care professionals. CCF is always finding ways to improve this app by refining existing formats & adding new features!",
Needs to be updated not showing latest test results.,
"Would be good if it worked. Trying to pay a bill, option doesn't work. Can't find account number info for bill. Put in payment info and app takes me back to first page. Send email for help, they say there are no problems, and send number to pay by phone.??? Why have the app? The ability to schedule appointment works occasionally. Would be great thing to have if it worked like it should. Customer service is no help.",
Easiest way to keep track of appointments and message doctors. Also links to the website so I can also use my computer and it is all the same,
"Awesome, this app helps you make appointments, get medicine refills, read the after appointment notes to keep you informed if you haven't installed it yet do it it's great",
"So convenient! I wish you could access letters and download them from the app, but other than that, I think it's a great app.",
I absolutely love this app! Add had a double transplant of the kidney and pancreas. I have so many doctors appointments that is hard to keep track. MyChart helps me keep track of every appointment. I also get to see my blood work often before the doctor does. The lab results goes into detail for those of us that did not go to college to become a nurse or a doctor. I am not going to lie but I am very dependent upon this app. Lol being a single mom I'm juggling all of our stuff is crazy.,
"Great app for communicating with your care team for planning visits, refilling prescriptions and especially as a repository for your health care history. Why a 4-star review: Since covid I have been getting vaccinations at my local CVS. The CVS vaccinations are not available to my health care provider even though I have both organizations in Mychart. So my healthcare provider keeps recommending vaccines such as for shingles or pneumonia for me even though I have gotten them from CVS.",
"Sometimes, this is a little difficult to work with. May be my misunderstanding of the electronic system. It does, however, give me an avenue to speak with my provider so I can get answers immediately at times. I get the opportunity to place refill of medication order when needed. Gives my provider an opportunity to speak to me and answer questions as well as ask them.",
Easy to view upcoming apps. And pre-register,
"Great, I love seeing all the red flags the doctors don't question! My chart works better than the doctors that put the information into it!",
I love this app it is very convenient to use and contact my PCP via messages and Labs for blood work and easy way to get your test results back also.,
"Since update can no longer view clinical notes and when I try to view images I now get an error message when I click on the link (takes me to a nilread site that doesnt work). Used to be awesome now its basically useless. No one can tell me who to contact or how to fix or what happened and Im extremely frustrated because having the ability to view notes and images was the only way I knew what was actually going on because most of the staff here are new, young, undertrained and clueless.",
Excellent app up to date app.real time services of appts.,
Wonderful and easy to use. Helps me remember things. It's great for making my appointments. I'm very happy that all my doctors belong to The Everett Clinic. I've been with them since moving here to Washington.,
"Well designed, ease of use... Love it.",
It isnt the best when medical staff fail to use the features provided in the app. If you sell an app. the medical team should be required to follow up with patients.,
I like the app. When I lose my papers this app helps with appointments,
"The message center, you should be able to send to any doctor you have, but you can't. Then you only have a few days to Rey or is grayed out. You send a message and no reply.",
Really easy to use and read,
Great app very useful n helps me with all my medical needs.,
Great for contacting medical without a lot of phone tag!!,
Great app if your service provider is useing it they choose wisely. It keeps you updated on your appointments and you can see your blood work test asap and much more. Overall it a great app. It great to have your medical information at your own fingertips. Great way to communicate with your medical staff. If you have a question you can message it to the doctor. My doctor responds fast which is cool. You can also set up appointments without the annoyance of having to call some automated service.,
Great app. Love referring to my results so I can discuss issues or questions with my doctor. The updates have been excellent.,
Great. Makes it so easy to get a hold of my Dr's and their teams.,
Very informative as well as helpful.,
"This is, by far, one of my favorite apps! Getting relevant information and the available opportunity to communicate with questions regarding my health is top notch!",
I truly had the best care in ICU! Everyone who came in from nurses to those doing testing was wonderful.,
I really like that you're not left wondering about your tests...and that you can access so much...,
Itseems thatheres noway to view past msgs/letters (fersumreasin they're 2diff formats but basikly conveying the same communications??) once they're read theyseemto disahpear & cai8nt be retrieved/reviewd later ifone whantsto be reminded of sumthg thatwuz containd inthem????,
"They would like you to go paperless on bills, but after 3 months app still not fixed so you can pay it. Did put out a message about 2 1/2 months after that they know it is not working, but still have not sent a paper bill during the down time. Good at tracking appointments, was easy for seeing test results, just would like them to fix the bugs.",
so easy to keep up with appts records and labs,
This app is good except where you're notified that you need to schedule an upcoming appointment - it doesn't tell you for what! It needs to tell you what it's in reference to.,
Pretty solid all around. And definately works amazingly well... provided the care you're receiving utilizes it. Hit a Home Run with the 'Proxy access' so I can help manage my partners complex medical care. Enabling it was fast and secure. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the ability enter records of my own from non-Epic medical office visits. Bonus points if you can enable any kind of basic document reading / rendering. The UI could stand to be a bit more modern too.,
Very informative & easy to use. I highly recommend it.,
Very easy to use and really convenient.,
Love love love this app! It makes it so easy in every aspect to know and get my medical history. The only small issue is that when you receive new notifications they seem to change location within the app. For example I received a new message from my Dr attached to a pathology report and after reading it it was moved from the front screen to appointme to and test results. Just a little confusing but all in all great app!,
"this app is pure Spyware...it actually tracks patients' movement everywhere. It has ability to automatically check you in when you walk into Dr office/clinic/group. The only way that happens is using tracking. Perhaps it's the phone pinging the location which is, again, Spyware tracking. What other uses will this ability be used for? This was bound to be used despite denial at release... bullcrap.",
"There are several convenient features to this app, however the annoyances overshadow those conveniences. I am continually asked to review my personal information. I do the review, nothing has changed, but the app keeps asking. Very annoying. Also I have successfully linked my My Chart account with CVSHealth, but every couple of months it unlinks and I have to re-link again.",
"It's a good app when it functions right, but I've been locked out of my account because of a bad password no less than 3 times now and I've had to change it (even though I was 100% positive I was entering the correct one) every time, and my account was not compromised. Further, I've had past issues that inexplicably KEPT me locked out of MyChart for upwards of 2 weeks at a time for reasons unknown, and said reasons were never made privy to me. I was simply ""able to login again"" one random day.",
"This app is riddled with bugs. I can no longer sign in with biometrics, it always gives a password error. I am also no longer able to modify a payment plan or pay for services through the app. I once found the app somewhat useful but it is buggy and broken now. I'm not confident that such a bug-ridden app should be trusted with personal health information.",
"This app has been invaluable to me. Recent health issues have resulted in many many hospital & office visits in the past year. MyChart has made every aspect of my associations with Providence accessible to me around the clock. Appointments entered directly into my calendar at the push of a button, test results, medical history, medications, and visit notes available for review, plus the ability to message my provider - MyChart provides all of this in a user-friendly, well designed format. Kudos!",
"This app has been great in handling all my family medical appointments and billing. Wish dentist, pathologist and smaller medical providers would use this.",
Easy app to look up your medical history records orders that is secure⚕️,
"Am happy I'm able to see all my test results, after summary notes etc on this app. Only bad thing is the Dr's that don't use it",
Have had great experience with the MyChart it great to have communication with my doctor and staff,
"I love the convenience of this App to manage my healthcare. The only complaint I have is; I'm not sure which it is, When my computer updates, or they do updates to the app my UN and PW isn't recognized. Not sure which it is. I do put a slip in with IT. My computer updated 2 days ago. But I could get on the app yesterday. Last night I could no longer access my information. I find it frustrating because it always seems to occur when there are results and/or a message from my PCP.",
The staff here is awesome!! Dr. Keller is my favorite. He always pays attention to you when your explaining what is wrong with you and ask all the right questions. The staff is great with keeping you informed about what's going on. The ladies in the Catscan room were very helpful with explaining the process and letting me know what to expect during my procedure. I will always come to this hospital for my medical care. Keep up the good work 👏,
My star rating reflects the fact that the MyChart app doesn't save FORMS that are completed during e-check-in. It takes about 30 mins to complete the check-in with forms. When I arrive at my appt. I'm checked in manually (another 10 min) The paper version of the form that I completed on line is then handed to me for completion. I've advised the staff of this issue several times and nothing has changed. I decided to enter a review after the same thing occurred for an upcoming appointment.,
"The app itself is ok I suppose. What I oppose to is when your appt. that you've been looking forward to gets canceled at the last minuet for no real obvious reason. I waited a good while for the appt. that's of extreme importance to me. Trying to get hold of an actual human being over the phone is almost unheard of these days. No one wants to interact with a man made machine. Pick up the phone ladies, there are actual people who really NEED the service.",
"Overall, a medium ranking...seems more convenient, but until every care provider adopts it, I find it dysfunctional. I have missed appts because My Chart only has partial info, and oftentimes, unhelpful because of lack of input. WHy can't my counseling appts be included? I have some unknown amt of loss of cognitive function...I don't need an array of specialized apps to do this, My Chart was built for this, I believe. Very dissappointed in it's overall performance. I just missed an appt, and thi",
"I'm very disappointed with how things have went with the app lately. There was recently a breach, preventing me from logging in. I had to start a completely new account, put in the verification code emailed to me only to have the app tell me it couldn't verify my information and a code would be sent by mail. This is ridiculous...",
"I like being able to see my health care plan along with medical record notes from each appointments. It is really convenient for making appointments or changing them as well. Very easy to manage and refill my prescriptions, sending and receiving messages back with easy access to my health care provider and team without having to call them. I can access my test results with detailed information. I also can pay my medical bills through this app with the option of making automatic monthly payment",
"Very good ... I Appreciate my info being organized and all in one place . The doctors have my info and now so do I and can refer back to it any time. My only complaint is the test results. I can't effectively read them nor do I understand the symbols along the margin of some of the results - especially the ! - in a circle that leads you to believe it needs immediate attention ,causing upset. There should be a page or call center for a quick explanation of how to interpret the symbols etc.on app.",
"This app is great, simple to navigate and receive my results fast. I receive notifications by email and text, which is great. I can access most of records. Only problem... wish you can see all past testing (not just the past year) to make comparisons to most current/recent test records.",
"Love this app. Appts, lab and test results, doctors visit comments which is nice as sometimes I forget some of what was discussed in the appointment.",
I love this app!!! I am in control of my medical appointments records and I can also review and message my doctor it's GREAT!!!!,
Works well to make appointments and get test results back really fast. Haven't had any issues.,
"Worst app on my phone. Difficult to use & navigate. I work in tech & have owned cell phone and internet companies. I do internet cabling and tech for international airports. I use apps, phones etc all day. This is the worst app I've been forced to use. Maybe the developers are looking to give a child-like experience? Idk, but the bubbles and transitions suck. This is medical. We need straightforward & concise. This app is anything but!!! Clean it up. Make it simple.",
The app provides useful and timely information to my health condition,
Very easy to use and informative,
This app is very convenient. It allows me to look at my doctor's notes and any other Dr office can see it too.,
"Great app that allows easy access to my past medical information, future appointments, and communication with my medical team.",
Having too much trouble con nnecting to umc for e-check in,
"This app makes it easy it easy to see up coming appts, refill rxs, schedul appts and check your test results.... When it's working. I've been having a lot of trouble with accessing my medication and checking my messages on the app for a few weeks now. Prior to this trouble the app was working perfectly and took a lot of the anxiety out of dealing with all of my drs, scheduling appts and refilling my rxs. I'm not sure what's changed... Maybe the latest update? Idk",
Very helpful tool to look at and manage my Healthcare,
It's a wonderful app You can do everything on you can cancel appointments on there you can do E-Check ins they let you know when your appointments are it's just a great app to have on your phone and you get your test results on here too which is really nice,
"It's nice to have access to your children's records all in one place, no papers to clutter at home. I really enjoy MyChart for my girls!",
"Why can't the items that need attention show up on the main screen so that if you have say two messages a number 2 would show on the main screen on the message icon, etc. I had two letters that I was not aware of them until just recently. For prescriptions and appointments my chart works great but it could stand some major changes to be easier to use.",
"Since the latest update receiving multiple ""server error"" messages. Have made several attempts to send refill requests to my doctor's office. All unsuccessful even though I receive a confirmation page. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Can not currently trust this app for anything. Update: April. No improvement, app or website. App uninstall. Back to the 90's and the telephone. Also, brand new phone in recent days. Android 11. Not the issue, or shouldn't be.",
"They bill you, but never say what the bill us for. they say you owe money, but never give a visit summary or treatment code for the bill. My bill came in nearly 6 months after my last visit with no explanation as to why I was getting billed. Also, paperless billing was turned on for my account. I never turned it on. I liked it better when they gave bill summaries, but this seems to have went away when U of M took over.",
My Chart is a great communication tool and is accessible for all my needs. Very consistent.,
"My chart keeps me up to date with all of my appointments and test results, scheduling and canceling if need be!! It's ALL here!!",
"Love everything about the app but the last few days we have been unable to log into both my and my husband's MyChart. Keep getting an error message that says ""we couldn't log you in right now, please try again later"". Our login name and password are correct on both accounts but for some reason the app is NOT working and it is VERY frustrating as we need to see the cancer marker test results!!! We have already sent an email to Epic MyChart Support regarding this issue.",
"It's great to be able to track my health, appointments, and medications.",
Information is there for you quickly. Scheduling is nice and effortless. Nice job!!!,
"I love being able to refill meds, ask my doctors questions and schedule my own basic appointments. As a disabled mother-of-three, MyChart helps me keep everybody's medical issues and medicinal needs at the tip of my fingers. I love how quick I can reach out to our doctors and get a response back. I absolutely hate sitting on the phone, most people have problems understanding me, my mouth spasms a lot and sometimes it's a lot easier for both me and the doctor / nurse with less confusion.",
The app is awesome in general with a lot of information and ability to communicate. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the checkin process. It is excruciatingly long and tedious answering/reviewing all the same info every time. Then walking inside and still needing to read and sign papers with the same info just verified in the app. My insurance and ID are also stored in the app but they still want to see the cards and make copies.,
I like being able to read my chart better than speaking to someone on the phone and I can go back and read past appointments.,
I love this app. Tou can see and do anything you need or want to do here!!! I love having access to my test results and being able to see the notes that the Soctors have written concerning your case.,
"It was an ok health app before, but now even trying to do something as simple as scheduling an appointment with my primary care physician is rediculously overcomplicated. Now, in order to schedule an appointment, I have to go to schedule, find the right location out of all hospitals in the system, pick a category, and then sort through all available appointments with all the professionals that work at that location. And my doctor usually STILL isn't in that list. Review edited due to response.",
"The app is good for looking at test results with the updated way it uses graphics. The app works ok for scripts that are good for an extended time. I do not find the app to align easily with scripts that change. My pharmacy goes out of it's way to help manage costs. It may be my phone, my lack of skill, and changes in gov rules but the app reduces my confidence in communicating with my physician's office. The office is well run. Like here, #of characters is limited. Attachments sometimes work",
Just wonderful ..very quick to update and plus all my information is right here at my fingertips..100%,
This is a good app to have because it lets you see test results and upcoming appointments,
It makes things convenient and easier.,
This is a very useful and well put together app. It is very easy to use. Makes the doctors visit so much easier. 👍👍👍,
"This is one of, if not the best app for medical appointments, test results, and all other aspects of managing my health!!!",
"I am happy with Mychart. Harrison Co. Hospital is affiliated with Norton's but test results, etc. are not showing up on Norton's MyChart page.",
"It has some useful features that aren't available when I access my chart directly thru UCLA online. But it doesn't give me the option of deleting or marking as completed old appointment reminders. Also, redundant lab results aren't available for viewing. But it's useful in that I can do video appointments with my doctor.",
"Love it the best way set appointment, talk to doctors, and not have to spend time talking to automated systems 😁 10/10",
"App is very annoying while trying to sign in. Asks for a PIN. Then asks for verification code sent via email. Doesn't come. You resend code, no code. You do it again. Three emails come with the same verification code. Code doesn't work. When you get to use the app, it's only good for checking on appointments. If you want to MAKE an appointment, they tell you to call. Then why is it an option? They made an app they don't care about apparently. UPDATE: Same thing happened today. Didn't receive a code for 15 minutes, then multiple codes came via email. None worked and now I'm locked out of my account. Worthless. Update: They can't unlock me. Ask your health care provider. They won't help anymore. Beyond worthless.",
"New version looks no better & still missing Dark mode. Many functions fail to load the information requested, instead returning a vague error that it failed. When they do work the app is very slow. Way too many functions still only supported via web browser making the app semi-useless. Don't release it until you've got it all working.",
"To many hoops to access it , should be able to delete after reading something and not have it pop back up",
Mix things a lot easier to get a hold of your doctor and get messages across and interact without making a million phone calls definitely useful for me,
Awesome app. I know test results and appointments before they do most the time. Very useful and efficient.,
Very easy to keep up with appointments,
"It's fine, but a lot of the features don't work. For example, I can enter all of my payment information to pay a bill, but there's no button or way to submit the payment. There's just a ""Back"" and ""Cancel"" button. Very irritating. Not to mention the other features that take you to the website, just to turn around and say that the feature isn't available right now, and to logout and try again. It's honestly just a half-assed app that's been poorly put together.",
Terrible unable to log in and no response,
Extremely glitchy. Signed up and access the application successfully once. Since then it has not worked. Nor does it interface with the applications of other medical networks like it is supposed to. Other networks show that it cannot connect to the server for this app. Really irritating since I need to verify information for an upcoming Hospital procedure.,
"Fairly happy with it; some rough edges: 1. No message drafts and can't see what I'm replying to. 15 min writing reply, pop out to re-read the message or test result, poof! Gone. 2. Getting a reminder for the flu vaccine from one provider after I got the shot at at another. Edit: 3. Stuck in ""500 - Internal Server Error"" on trying to fill out a pre-visit questionnaire. Seems to have cleared itself. 4. The ""logout"" button looks like a ""send message"" button, and dumps the message you were writing.",
"This app is very helpful, especially during hospital stays.",
For several weeks I have been informed that my account is disabled. I have tried resetting my password but without success. I have not changed my user name and password because it was automatically saved on my PC and I am sure it is correct. It has been the same since I joined MyChart. I would greatly appreciate feedback from whoever is responsible for sorting out these glitches. I'm awaiting news of the results of various scans and blood tests as well as news of my next appointment.,
It's a lot easier to get in touch with the my doctor and make appointments,
It is a lot easier to request refills on your medication. You also get a quick response if you have questions for your physician or about your medication. You can also see when your next appointment is and what your test results are.,
"Fair app. It would be much better and much more useful if we could select our insurance companies from a drop-down box. For example, I have two insurance companies and every time I use one, when I go somewhere else that doesn't accept it but they accept the other, it defaults to the last one selected and there is no way to change it. Therefore, this app has become useless because I can no longer check in or pay because it is defaulted to the wrong insurance company. Please fix this ASAP!",
Really enjoy this app even a trip to er shows everything they didn't tell me,
I personally very much so like this app for the fact that it's a for sure way that you can for sure know that your doctors team is getting your messages compared to actually having to call the office or clinic and someone else takes your messages and info but you never hear back from the doctor and they say that they didn't get the message that the person must've got busy and forgot to give it to the team . Although I don't like the part about how the labs or diagnosis are put in here but there',
like the app but has a big problem once something is entered to it you can't get it changed have made numerous calls and inquiries all to no help.,
"Unfortunately, I'm dealing with several health issues that require me to see several physicians. Using MyChart allows me to easily add appointments to my Google calendar. It also gives easy access to records, test results, and a easy way to communicate with my providers. MyChart is probably the most used app on my phone, I would be lost without this truly useful app. Bill Nolan",
"It is very convenient for me to be able to message questions to my Dr rather call and wait for a call back, I believe it saves time for the practitioner also",
"I love this app, all your information from multiple medical facilities in one place. I will say it is 100% the best of all apps.",
"I find this app very useful for checking appointment dates, lab scheduling and results, and for messagjng my physicians with brief questions that do not require a visit.",
"The my chart app is so convenient and easy to use and understand. I can Make my appointments in the app, email the Dr. Get my test results. I can update it anytime I have to. I'm having surgery this month and I already have everything scheduled in my chart. The directions and all. This app is the best thing to have. It also saves me time on everything. I love it",
They are always very kind and always have my medications. They also helped me with my vacation medications. I recommend them to anyone!!,
"Top app for organizing life. No matter if you are healthy and rarely see a physician or if you are getting daily treatments. This will help you stay organized and less stressed. Create appointments, go to video visits and refill meds all from here. My favorite part is it will send appointments over to Google calendar. I just wish it would sync all appointments, instead of me telling it to do each one. Maybe update that....",
I love my chart. Very easy to navigate.,
"Easy, comprehensive & detailed.",
"This is such a great app. It's easy to navigate and track everything! Even my entire family, which is very helpful. I can go back years and clearly see the doctors I saw, what tests I took and the results. I can locate tests results hours after getting my blood drawn. Haven't used a better system really!",
I do not prefer the new dashboard/homepage setup. My brain doesn't want to recognize all the circles and weird design format. I don't want pretty and artistic from my medical provider. I want easy access and lists I can choose dropdowns to get what I need fast. Still grateful for the access and the idea but not a fan of the updated version. Meh.,
The care I received was excellent! Outstanding physician and Dr Cardoza-Kellog was thorough and very professional!,
"This app would be great if only messages were actually accessible consistently. I'm notified of new messages but every time I log in to the app it's always a toss up whether or not the messages center is even visible from the menu. The inconsistency is the strangest part of this bug, and it seemed to have only started when my provider released their own app that supposedly links to my MyChart info, so this may be an issue caused by my provider and not the app itself.",
"Very, very simple to use. All of my Dr's name and info is readily accesible with pictures of each individual. The appointments part is equally helpful. The time, date, location and with cleveland clinic at least the desk location. Making appointments and prescription drug reordering couldn't get much easier. Also, not only upcoming appointments but it's very easy to look at past ones also. This is a very handy and as mentioned easy, convienent, and available anytime that I want to obtain info.",
MyChart is a Great App. to communicate with your medical professionals.,
Modern app for the modern day patient. Just the fact that it's so easy to pull up on my phone and check/send messages to any of my health care providers. Or check where and when that schedule was supposed to be. I get notifications whenever a test result is submitted so I can literally pull up the app anytime. I love it.,
I would like to be able to update my own information such as testing completed instead of receiving numerous texts and emails as reminders,
"I like the app, but I find difficulty with it. There a 4 on my app, I don't know why, and my ent cannot see my results",
"I guess things were going great for a while, so I guess they decided they didnt need to keep the developer on payroll. App takes forever to login, that is when it feels like it, then it either cant connect to the server or loads so slow it times out the connection. Not to mention there's the cancerous method of resetting your password that should be revamped up from the mid 90's method.",
"I absolutely love this app. It's so easy to use and keep up with my all my doctors appointments, my medications, and being able to send messages.",
SIMPLE - EASY - SECURE I saw one guy say he had to completely close the app and restart because he couldn't back out of anything so was forced to restart to go back. Well that really made me hesitant about downloading the app but figured I could always delete. Come to find out that's not the case. Not sure if he has a really old phone or isn't use to using the back button but you can totally go back to previous page without closing the app and starting over. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
"Every time there is a new message or a new lab result, all the lab results are listed as new. Online on my PC, every message which links to a lab result is marked in bold as unread. I open them and read them, then with the next email notification, all the previously read messages are in bold and unread, even though I already looked at them. On the app there is no differentiation between read and unread lab results. The message icon shows a number and I have to open every msg to erase the numbe",
"I can't think of anything that could be more complex than trying to manage patient records, appointments and interactions with my doctor and his staff, since these activities can include documenting so many different bodily processes, maladies, treatment options, tests, etc., etc. The creators of this app have somehow eliminated the complexity of all this and made an intuitive, easy to use, yet detailed and comprehensive tool! That is a stunning achievement! Well done, developers!",
"I love that you can get any information like test results, etc, a lot faster than waiting for the doctor's office to get a hold of you.",
"The app changed and now I am unable to see my upcoming appointments a month ahead. I had to call the doctor's office for dates and times. I can only see 2 weeks ahead which is very unhelpful. I used this app to keep track of all the families appointments, but now I am going to have to go back to inputting the manually into my google calendar app. Also I wish there was an option to export appointments into your preferred calendar app. It would make keeping track of all appointments easier.",
It works for the most part except when using a VPN then it kicks me off at every button press.,
"Excellent service , so simple to use",
There only one thing rong has far as I am concerned with this app you can't stop unwanted items from sowing up like the one tell you you need some shot (shots) I don't get vaccinated for the Corona19 booster's aka(CCP virus) Flu ect.......... other than that I really like this app,
I absolutely love this app! I have a lot of medical issues and this allows me to keep all of my information in one place. Being able to communicate with my doctor's without having to leave messages at the front desk is a godsend! I can pull up anything I need at anytime I want and can add my appointments to my calendar with one click. The convenience is amazing!,
"Love being able to access my medical info so quickly. I also love the after visit summaries, sometimes you can't quite remember what the doctor said or remember the medical term as it was explained. So it's nice to be able to reference that when we need to and the appointments being on my chart. You can also personalize how you want reminders either by text or email. It is the perfect back-up and support system to our busy lives. 5 stars from me!",
"""Your contact information and notification preferences need review..."" This refuses to go away. I've hit update then closed it again multiple times. There is no button to confirm my info, just a close button and a few edit buttons. ------- items that cannot be launched within the app should at least have a description of what they are, rather than simply directing the user to an external browser, for example sharing->Lucy, growth charts, advance directive.",
This app sucks! Worst app ever. Be warned that if you as a parent have an account then there is no way to get access to your kids account. They say its easy it is not!,
It's great having access to your medical records and all of your doctors and prescriptions via this app. I highly recommend.,
Awesome app minus android swip left to right to get back neck page only iPhone has the back space 🔑 Epic please fix the no black space on test results 😀 and couple of other pages.,
Best thing is I get a response from my Dr.'s office so much faster than calling! But quick access to a list of my meds and test results is super nice as well.,
Very helpful sometimes even better than calling to get meds refilled,
My mother is 80 With dementia and I am 48 AND HER SOLE CARE TAKER Can't recommend THIS APP strong enough My chart Has put her care right in the palm of my hand Literally Test results medicine upcoming visits All of it is SUPER EASY TO FIND AND REMEMBER solely due to this app I'D BE LOST WITHOUT IT It's a blessing DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE,
This app is extremely helpful in keeping all your medical info in one location. Easy to navigate.,
"Don't know if it's the app or the technologically incompetent staff at my hospital, but if you're going to implement an option to pay your bill through this app, make it work. Edit: Got a response from the app developer, which is rare and much appreciated. However, if the hospital determines that it doesn't want to allow payment options through your app, then disappear the pay button and any other payment related tabs, etc. Too easy.",
Amazing! Easy to keep up with appointments test results visits what I'm due and more! So easy for me to deal with!,
Looking at test results is horrible. Last telehealth visit was unsuccessful. Never had these issues before. There needs to be an update to correct these issues. The latest issue was log in not accepting my password when it was correct. Had to use PC to fix it. App not working well on my tablet anymore. I mainly use this to speak to my specialist via telehealth. Keeps me from driving all the was to KU.,
"What would really impove your app would be to have an option to see your historical data. Say I want to see my hemoglobin levels from the past year to view trends. I have to go into each and every lab labeled ""Chemistry"" (and most of them are labeled that generically) to find my numbers. Mayo Clinics app provides a clickable link to see a chart of your trends. So much easier and user friendly.",
Cannot see son's invoices. He is 13. I've been calling back and forth with healthcare provider and it seems to be a programming issue with mychart. Keeps asking me to verify phone,
"Love this app. Easy to use and maneuver so you can see all appointments, results and even schedule new apps.",
It's perfect because I can see all my appointments all my test results and even messages from the doctor it's just what we need to keep up with everything.,
"My Dr. Kenny Hawk is the best NP there. Taylor Shahan is a wonderful nursing asset. Both so kind, caring and polite. However, GMG has changed and not for the better since Ruby took over. It's no longer the small home town feel and most are vwey rude. Your just a number to Ruby.",
"Love this app and all of it's features. It's great to keep organized, the appointment reminders are a huge help as well! I can't emphasize enough what a great help it's been having all my doctors appointments, updated list of medications and dosing instructions, blood work, test results(ie. MRI, CT scans, echocardiograms, X-rays etc), as well as any doctors notes, you can read all notes the doctor or nurse may have made in regards to your visit/after visit summery.",
"The app does not provide you with any type of search capability, nor does it allow you to go back to a main menu or to the main screen you're stuck on whatever screen you end up on which is extremely frustrating. This really should be fixed because I at this point am about to delete it from my phone",
"My Chart is Amazing! Highly Recommended This! Makes everything easy to organize and follow up on. I love being able to communicate with my health team at the touch of a button! Scheduling appointments online is so helpful and staying in step with lab results is comforting. Super helpful app, I recommend everyone to use it.",
Extremely useful in documenting and keeping up with my medical care. It is also invaluable in keeping in contact with my providers. Very convenient and looking up results of tests that have been run. These results remain available to consider for review whenever necessary.,
"Downloaded app today. Tried to look at my information. Lots of Tiff files. They disappeared when I went to save them. Multiple times. Did some research. Turns out Tiff files are big picture files used by book publishers. Probably too big for my Android phone's memory. What use is an app that I can't use to look up my information? Disappointed, I uninstalled the app. Will try to use the internet browser to access my information instead of the app.",
My chart is great. It has all my appt doctors and results. You don't have to wait for a phone call from them. You just check your chart. You can leave them messages also. I gave a 4 stars. Nothing is perfect One flaw... when the doctor is messaging you with results of findings blood work etc. They need to explain it In English so we can understand it. I love having my chart..,
"I love being able to see test results as they are posted. Also, the ability to see all my appointments helps me to be to all of my appointments on time. There are other parts of my chart that are very helpful, especially being able to cancel appointments or leave the dr. a message.",
"I love it. I live about 45 minutes away from both Tennessee & Kentucky. So to be able to do most of what I need to, even visits, is a god send. UVA did a Deep Brain Stimulation surgery on me for a neurological disorder I have, so traveling there every 6 months was taxing & I'd always looks worse than I would have otherwise. I could find another doctor, but a good one is hard to find. So when I find a good one, I hold onto them as long as I can. Lol. I've never had any problems with the app.",
Best medical patient portal ! User friendly easy to navigate. Easy to understand.,
"This has been a wonderful app for keeping all my medical records, Dr's, appointments, referrals, and more within just a few clicks away for me to quickly access. I really do use it constantly. It notifies schedules, re-schedules, and cancels appointments in real time, too. 5/5 stars!",
"App generally works well, allows you to access your medical info, and even message your providers. My only complaint is that the bill paying feature never seems to work. I always have to call the clinic's billing dept and pay over the phone.",
"It's incredibly difficult to adhere to, and at times very repetitive and excruciatingly harassing. It's a good idea in theory, but in reality very impractical, especially since it is now a requirement to either use the app or just don't go to the doctor, that's your two options. It would be helpful if you could be allowed to type in more than 500 words on the review, but. Apparently they don't want to know 🙂 how about that.",
"Y'all need to update and fix the delay and delivery issues. I just now got messages. Also, log in issues with second sign in security feature has a major lagging problem. Updates are a constant and need to be resolved immediately, or it rendered your app useless.",
"So easy to use once it is set up. It's a bit difficult to actually get it set up if you have more than one person on the account. But once you have them on there, everything's under one app and it's easy to switch from person to person or just message directly to your provider.",
"This app seems to be filled with bugs and errors. It seems more likely than not that it will fail when I try to use it. At the moment, I received an email telling me that the provider has sent a message in the app. But when I try to check messages, it says there is an error and try again later. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a choice of apps.",
"This app is easy to use. I love sending and receiving messages from my doctors. If I have a question, I can send it at any hour. When they get to the office, it will be waiti g on them. I don't have to worry about missing a phone call. Also, I can view my test results or look up notes from a previous visit. I have never seen an ad in the app.",
Love MyChart! Having access to my medical test results in a quick turnaround time is very useful. Having accèss to the calendar of upcoming medical appointments helps alot as well. The app is intuitive and easy to use. Overall love it.,
"This is a unicorn; competence boardering on mythical. The app works. It gives me access to important information virtually at the same speed it is processed at the hospital. Easy and effective interface, no excessive security, timely with push notifications... honestly it is remarkable. My only comment is the initial screen of selecting health networks was confusing. Frankly I'm shocked this quality of tool is being used in the Ontario Health Care system! :-)",
it works pretty good for test results and some appointment reminders. but I can't seem to get any of the other features to on the app to work. and I can't get the app to sync even with itself,
"Haven't had any issues with the app, it is quite comprehensive in detail as well as user friendliness. Presumably, any issues run into are related to the age of my device, and available connection.",
"The system is very restrictive, making it difficult to move between pages. You can't message a Physician on MC unless you have already been seen by them. That makes setting appointments difficult. The system must not interact with the epic patient system, as you must complete copious redundant questionnaires everytime you set a new appointment.",
"I Like being able to see my test results in real time, even before seeing my doctor. It helps me with learning what they mean by researching on the internet. Doctors don't always have time to go over all my test results. I've learned a lot by researching what certain tests mean. Moreover, it allows me to understand & engage with my doctor in a more proactive, productive, efficient way. It helps me take more control over my total well-being.",
"I was depending on this app to help me keep up with appointments and communication with my medical team. However, the app now will not let me access my information without setting up 2-step verification, which is a terrible idea and NOT secure for someone who is affected by mental illness, economic hardship and tech access instability. I don't have enough characters to explain all the ways I've already been locked out of 2-step verification on other apps unable to access a code every login...",
"This app is so wonderful & helpful in soooo many ways! I love being able to look at the test results as soon as they're in & the Dr's notes make the patient/ doctor relationship a little more personal and easier to understand. The learning library is awesome as it gives you links to definitions and explanations to some of those ""Big Dr. Words"" that only they could pronounce/ comprehend! E-checkin is probably the 2nd best thing I love abt this app! No lines, No hassle! I'd give 6 stars if I could",
"It definitely comes in handy, it would just be nice if every provider used the same app, because I am missing huge gaps with my Neurology, and I don't know how to go about accessing all that information since it's across three states. But it's very nice to connect with your physician and get answers generally the same day you submit them.",
"Excellent for those who frequent OSF Hospitals and have Doctors within OSF. You can do all sorts of things now in the app that used to be a pain to do otherwise. You can message your doctor, request refills, and see all sorts of valuable information. The only thing I wish is that you could take screenshots in the app because that would super handy, but I understand it's a security issue. 5/5 Edit: Actually it turns out you can enable screenshots in the settings",
"Simple and easy to understand. Access all of your needed resources in one place, and you can communicate with your doctor(s) through messaging, or are able to schedule an/your appointments. I highly recommend using this app for your medical needs :)",
"Extremely dependable,I really like how quickly the nurses get back to you with your answers! I'm able to print my doctor excuses and whatever else I have on there. There are so many options on there. I would recommend this in a heartbeat!!! It is very useful if your if your taking care of your family and having permission to go on their my chart to see their medications to determine what to give them. Thanks for making things alot easier and more understandable.",
"This app is very, helpful and resourceful, easy to manage and use. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be able to use this app; and learning the ins and outs of it. Thank you sincerely, Jose Brown",
"Very easy to use, an excellent tool to keep your Heath in check. Ideal quick access.",
Hard to read results every time.,
"The unified experience is awesome! I can now link my portal accounts from multiple hospitals across the country, and see my past appointment and test histories all in one place. Now all it needs is graphing for labs, and a gernic ""health journal"" option for things like migraine and sleep tracking. (Custom flowsheets just don't cut it)",
My Chart works great... Especially when I'm up to speed on using it. It keeps getting better!,
Edited to add: At no point in my review did I say I got a new phone or redownload the app. Nothing has changed on my end. Developer response unhelpful and assumes user error. I have set biometric login back up but that was not the point. -- Went to log in and biometric login no longer available. Why just remove the login I've been using for so long with no warning? Needed information quickly but have to reset everything. Very frustrating.,
I like being able to ask a question and get an answer back without phone calls. Takes a lot less time to receive a response back. I give this app 5 stars,
Easy to use and convenient..,
Outstanding app for all communications.,
"It has NEVER been easier to request refills, see lab results, see or schedule upcoming appointments, message the doctor and actually get a reply within a day (guess that's doctor depending tho.) Interface is easy to use and intuitive; it makes me extremely happy that my main doctor/hospital offer this service. My psychiatrist uses a different app and while it works okay, nothing like MyChart!",
Great Application. You can see all your appointments and test results here. Also their all easy to understand.,
"Not the best, server error is all I get. Not able to read letters sent or even leave a message for my health care provider.",
Great way to view all your medical in one place from site to site! Love it! Easy to use! Perfect for my medical needs!,
Scheduling for med refills is easy; but i can't seem to be able to schedule a routine office visit in person or online.,
It really helps to be able to send your doctors team a message and you can get a lot of answers from a well kept chart. I have logged into a different chart system at another doctors office and struggled to send a message or use the program. I had to call and wait a long time to get a simple answer. This chart system is much easier in functionality.,
Most times doesn't work. Always error message.... it is convenient and good idea but poor execution,
"The app worked for me 2 weeks ago, now I receive a message that a newer version is available, but there is not. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall app, but it made no difference. Cannot access at all. Last update shows as Dec 13, 2016. Also shows as incompatible with my older Samsung tablet when previously it was.",
"How does one switch between provider networks? I have providers in two different systems that both use your backend. The websites allowed me to link the accounts, but the app can't seem to find the other account, and won't access the other system to log in after logging out of the app. Yet, both send me to the exact same Google Play entry. I'm not going to clear data every time I need to check things on both systems. You know my data, show it to me!",
"I have several Doctors and a few different apps for these doctorsn,. My Chart is by far the most informative and easy-to use",
"I feel like there are so many potentially good features and options in the app, but it seems as though most of them don't work! It's great that you can show me all the types of medical appointments I am overdue for, but no way to make said appointments. Seems like a waste. Tons of options, few that are helpful.",
"Love using this app, I communicate with my Dr's and see all my appointments",
"MyChart is super convenient, and you know results before your Dr even gets the chance to call and talk over them. I enjoy this app alot.",
You need to stop changing the app. It is very hard on people who have visual problem is when you no longer marked the area where there is new information. It's hard to find the newest things added to a chart.,
"Simple to use if one takes their time. Easy installation off app helps when going for doctors visits and get medication filled. Keeping track of my health and understanding what is going on with my health is great when using this app. Every doctor I visit, clinic, or hospital has my medical information that I can provide just by logging in and sharing.",
Love this app. Easy to use and communicate with doctor.,
Great reminder and good for receiving info about your health,
MyChart is awesome. It keeps me informed of my appts and gives me results of tests etc. Thank you so much for my access to this app. I check it often. Janice Taft,
"While this app has worked well in the past, now that I have providers at both UW and GHC, many times the app does not sync with the GHC. I count on this information to be available so I can keep in touch with my providers, appointments and meds. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that it often times does not sync up. This happens with the MyChart website as well. I've been told by Devs that GHC has a separate app. No, they do not. It's all in MyChart. Please fix these reoccurring issues.",
Excellent! It makes it very easy to stay up to date with appointments and see test results.,
"Really a zero star for zero Function - won't install. I've checked every setting, security feature, playstore settings, etc. Called for a new patient appointment at 11 a.m. roughly, now nearly 9 pm. app is still NOT installed. Just spins and ""waiting for download"". Completely useless to me. Advise to simply use website. Not as convenient but it is clearly functional and accessible. Wifi makes no difference and a setting adjustment on the device; they've all been applied in attempts. Note 9.",
Always useful. Wouldn't be without it. Very easy to use.,
Wish for a little better explanation on the things but quite happy with the application,
"Sorry, I thought this was a great idea initially. But I've now spent a month trying to get my doctor to respond. I need diabetic supplies and I get zero response here. If I ignore the app and call to the office, they were able to say 'oh I see you put in a message 7 days ago' what good is that to me. (edit) bump up a bit, not sure of the exact break in communication, but wish I had a 'read' option like texts. so I could say if app is failing, or just being ignored on the other end.",
Trouble everytime I switch organizations. Epic says contact hospital and vice versa.,
I think it is great to find all my chart records. I have had no problem finding information I need. For some reason lately it does NOT give notifications anymore when I have a provider message. Maybe an update? I like getting notifications. Hope it gets fixed with next update. Update: thank you for the response. It works great now. Update to 5 stars!,
"I'm trying to sign up, But I can't!!! I'm getting a ""You must answer the CAPCHA"" error message, and I already answer it thousands times!! And there is no support after 4pm to help 🙂",
My chart is awesome. Any of your care team you can get in touch with at any time and all of your appointments are there as well as any information on anything done.,
"This app needs major improvement. They need to fill a few ridiculous gaps that make it occasionally dysfunctional of an app. It can do lots of cool things and make your medical records and whatnot very convenient, but the app just stalls a lot, fails to load things, takes forever to update your test statuses what whatnotconsistently, and overall is just a very rocky experience.",
Some of it works. Sometimes the screen goes blank and you have to back out to get to where you need. Of course we are forced to use it,
Very helpful app and user friendly,
Frankly awful app. Glitches and inconsistent. 1) Have to log in more than once when I should be able to stay in. 2) Switching between organizations requires new log-in for each! Shouldn't I be IN with one log-in? 3) Can't do screenshot or select text to copy. Reason in error code message has to do with privacy. That IS NOT something that is in the HIPAA rules. I should be able to copy using my phone that I'm logged in to for purposes of communicating and keeping my own notes.,
"Constantly get ""unable to connect to server"" error message when trying to complete the ""E/check"" questionaire requested before each drs visit. Very frustrating 1-29-22 still getting ""an error has occurred"" in addition to ""unable to connect to server"" when trying to send a message, schedule an appt or look at test results. The app works sporadically but tech services have no advice other than to login thru my browser instead of the app.",
"I just love this app. It is easy to use and navigate through the site. You can schedule appointments as well as cancel them. You can also use e-check in and answer questionnaire to save time at your appointments. It also keeps all letters of referrals or any letters the doctor has written for you, such as clearance for elective surgeries that a letter is required. You can really do it all on this app, and see all documents in regards to your health-care. I 100% recommend this app.",
I absolutely love this app. It makes communication easy as well as scheduling & canceling my appointments convenient. I have sickle cell disease which is super painful & unpredictable. My hematologist has started using the medication feature. The pharmacy I go to notifies me when my scripts are put in & ready for pick up! I give the app a/an 5!+,
"The new app makes it hard to tell what news & messages are new vs. the read ones. The distinction between email, test results, etc., are bad once you get in the app to check for *only* new mail. You need to make a little envelope to help us focus on the newest mail, etc and an ""x"" or something once read. The bright colors and huge font makes it worse to get to the info we need right away. It really needs some QC & feedback all the time b/c each visit i find more problems",
"This app is very useful. I can see my test results and get reminders of yearly appointments I need to make without having to get on a computer. the best part used to be being able to make appointments from the phone. But lately, every time I try, an error occurs. The big pull seems to be broken.",
My chart is in my opinion next to my banking app one of the greatest app ever created it's one click information about all your latest test results request medication refills send your health team request etc etc .awesome app,
"I love this app, my Dr. gets back to me very quickly. I can order my medicine with ease, I can contact my Dr. with ease, absolutely love it.",
After newest update keeps crashing. S23 Ultra,
"It's super easy to use this app to schedule any appointments for my kids at both their primary doctor and with the texas children's hospital. It also keeps tract of when their appointments are so that I know when they are. Super easy to add a second child. It's also super easy to change your information (phone number, address, ect.)",
"Easy and convenient! I can send pictures of minor rashes and things I have questions about without having to make an appointment or go to urgent care. Having quick access to my kids' records for things like weight, height, and immunizations without having to sit on hold or driving by to pick up a hard copy has been a life saver! Also having all of information in one portal and being able to make appointments for all of us without holding on the phone forever is amazing! Will use this forever!",
"Can't return to previous screen or to main menu. Is this a problem in all android devices or just Pixel? Ok, update to prior comments. There is no navigation button at the bottom of the device on any screen in the app to return to the main men. And the gesture navigation works about 1 out of 5 swipes, only if you touch it close enough to the hidden arrow. So I guess it works, just not really well. I'm extremely grateful my hospital system has something like this nonetheless. 4 stars, not 3",
Nice way to keep track with medical needs!,
Everytime I try to login it gives me a hard time so I don't use it but I keep getting annoying notifications on my email 📨 😞 clutters up my email,
"Amazing, very helpful, and easy to use",
It's very limited in what it can do. I get messages from my doc telling me to log into the website to do to whatever it is they want. Messages has an attachment button but no one sees/receives them. Ifyou want to check lab values or appointments then it's okay. I can make an appointment but still need to talk to the office anyway. May as well call.,
"Very informative, easy to use app.",
Love being able to contact my providers at any time of the day or week and then they get back to me in a timely manner.,
Great app! Easy to use and very convenient,
"This rating is for the Android app, so I'll limit the comments to just the Android specific points. The web portal is well integrated. The Android app is one of a few apps which never concern me about security. I have never seen it do anything I recognized as insecure. It provides me with everything I need, plus a bit more. Even when using only cellular data, the app stays responsive.",
Great app helps track medical appointments and alot more,
"MyChart App works amazing well, especially if you already have some tech savvy to you. I could see were it might be a little difficult for someone who is new to the tech world though, as going from one page to another is not always a smooth process. But on the Pro side I have seen worse & I think MyChart does a really good job at giving you all the info you need, plus all the ability to interface with your medical people. It just takes a little getting use to, then you're off & running with.",
On a phone the print is extremely small. Entering your password is frustrating. I have had to re-enter mine at times 4 or 5 times. I have had to reset it a time or 2. The app is very useful. I wish results could be printed. After visit reports are not on MyChart. Would be nice to have that.,
Extremely easy way to get & share medical info!,
I really like having all of my information in one place. Having the ability to message my provider is so convenient. Most of the features are great but I tried to verify my phone number for a new provider and even though they had the correct number the text didn't come through with the verification number. I tried several times and still didn't work. The only reason I'm a bit concerned is because I have a video appointment on Monday and it's Friday so there's no way to get in touch with them,
"Paste is disabled on password fields, which negates my password manager. This means the app promotes weak passwords that I can easily manually type in.",
Simple and straight forward to use,
So helpful and truly easy to use.,
It's great getting test results so easily.,
"overall pretty good app except for bugs with logging in that never have been resolved. will randomly log u out then tell u your password is wrong even when it is right. then when u make a new one it gives errors like ""must be 8 to 20 characters"" when the one I put in was 10 characters. pretty sure that's in their range",
Excellent ap. Gives patient access to all of their personal medical information quickly and easily.,
"While there are elements of this app that are ok the UI is extremely cumbersome to use if you have many appointments and messages and you waste a lot of time. You should be able to swipe messages left or right to delete and archive. Too many taps to manage messages, appointments and the like. Needs to be simpler.",
"The 2 step verification is Awful. While my husband is in the hospital, I check my chart often. The two step is a real pain.",
I enjoy using it has everything I need to see and use right at my finger tips,
way too much useless repetative verbage. Nag notifications never stop even after clearing message. most messages won't clear. l,
Mychart is usually amazing however Mount Sinai is now pushing their own version which is not compatible with other organizations. There was nothing wrong with mychart that called for a change. And also the layout change now does not have the visits tab on the front page. Future/past visits should not be hidden in the drop down menu. It should be on the opening page or at least allow customization on the main menu.,
"Love the app easy to use, and it is very helpful.",
"Makes me feel like I have my medical care providers available 24 hrs per day. It is very reliable, and allows me to see everything for myself. I am able to see my progress over the time I needed care.",
"Very helpful. Useful for keeping track of appointments and viewing lab results. Helpful to be able to email my doctor to request medication refills and any other questions or concerns. Overall, very easy to use the app. I like the fact that I can call the help desk if I have any questions about the app. They actually answer the phone and are available to help if you're having problems with the app.",
"I like the app for keeping in touch with my doctor. But Under the to do tab, I wanted to use that feature to help track health issues such as pain. I also wanted to set medication reminders. I was able to set reminders but would have liked to put it under the medication tab in the to do list. There was no mechanism to do so. I was unable to track health issues. I feel like this area needs work on the app.",
"Wow. I really have to compliment the EPIC Corporation for this app! Smooth, intuitive, informative, and friendly UI. Has the many functionalities I need to review my health history with the clinic. What really impressed was the display of lab values which visually shows the normal range for each test. Keep up the good work App Team!",
As someone with severe social anxiety this helps me a ton everything with it has went smooth as butter and I've only ever even had to use the phone to call my Dr 1x when I was learning to use the app,
I'm so glad this app was made. I can check my appointments and see my tests results. I have no complaints at all. Thank you again.,
"Frequent user for family & appts. *Prior to this I would have always given this App 4 star. Not so much anymore. last 4 months anytime I try to send a message/request appointments from the doctors in app, the message disappears. They're not getting to the doctor's offices system & it's not showing in app. once you send it it disappears never to be seen again and nobody knows anything about it. Extremely frustrating. * A few other minor glitches but overall I like working with the app.",
It keeps me on track with things and allows me to connect my providers without calling the office. Its like a direct line to your doctor,
"Multiple crashes! I can check messages, but if I try to check my billing, eCheck in, almost everything else, the app crashes and closes. Luckily, I can sign into MyChart online. Of course, I thought the point of an app is that you don't have to go to the website. Please patch or update the app. It is currently not functioning on my Galaxy s10e.",
"It was my best app until 6/27 when I was forced to reset/change my password 😑. Why? But outside of that, I like MyChart 👍🏼.",
"Love this app, so easy to contact my providers.",
"It is very helpful, easy to use, very intuitive",
"Love it when it works! Half the time I can't get into the individual sections. It keeps saying something about server error try again later. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.",
"I'm a completely new user so these are just first impressions. App seems impressively well-designed & I look forward to its overall utility but holy hell, devs... if I'm picking a state/COUNTY then do *not* force me to scroll through 100+ [non-US] options!😵 Some sort of search bar or alphabetical shortcut should be incorporated, albeit idk how that would be achieved as is when they're drop-down menus; best to let them extract from zip or be basic text like city is imo. Also: DARK MODE please😓",
"The Android version of this app is horrible. I realize epic is a giant company, but instead of asking hospitals what should be in the app, have your pm staff spend a few days in the hospital trying to keep track of their care using the app. They will come out with a whole new attitude about how the app should look and feel. I also know that you want to have 1 interface that works for everyone, the result is a disaster. Everyone is saddled with an interface for for a 100 year old senial person.",
It's a one stop shop. Make appointments. Reorder prescriptions. And message the Doctor anytime and have a response within a reasonable time.,
Very informative about appointment scheduling and cancelation.,
Love this App. I can view my Healthcare with just a click.,
I love seeing my results of testing and remindings for appointments!,
Best health service portal and derivery I have ever come across.,
Great customer service. Have great doctors. But your hospital doesn't take Aetna Better health care plans any more so I had to leave,
I really like the my chart it's so convenient and you get your results before you see your doctor and don't have to be worried or in suspense wondering what is wrong with you,
Great place to keep track of everything medical.,
very simple to navigate and easy to use,
"This has been such help for me because I am always on the go. If any of my son's teachers need a result, I am able to show them, and I save Gas ! Thank You Alta-Med !",
"I love how easy it is to organize my family health records and bills. I like how I can jump to another hospital's Mychart, it is very convenient.",
"Easy to understand UI, great for scheduling, Test results, visit notes, visit summary, sending messages and plenty more.",
Mychart provides my medical information no matter where I happen to be. I can just bring up my medical information to any provider. Even if I don't remember the name of the medication that I'm on I can just bring up the app and there it is. It is wonderful,
Love EVERYTHING about it. Specially how it REMINDS YOU of upcoming appointments. And it gives you test results. Absolutely necessary 💯💯💯💯%%% HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,
Keeps freezing when pulling up messages. Haven't been able to send or read any for a while .,
Everything is so simple 😌 2 used n understand iam just learning how 2 use computers mychart great app,
Unable to change answers if you make a mistake. This caused a great deal of confusion and extra paperwork in an already confusing system,
Been using this app for several years to communicate and keep up with my medical stuff. It's easy to use and updates immediately . I highly recommend this application.,
Really helpful and informative very convenient.,
Quick and easy way to contact the office,
"I have been using MyChart for awhile now and it sure makes it easy for me to see all my doctors, appointments and labs needed! Thank you MyChart",
All the information was present for me to view. All the future and past visits were there for me to check anytime I wanted or needed to review my appointments.,
Have MyChart has been a great feature! Being able to message your doctor or look at recent visits or being updated on needed results has been excellent!,
For a person who is impatient this app helps get me my results quicker refills and scheduling piece of cake,
Most of the time works well and provides better doctor patients communication.,
Very user friendly and easy to maneuver.,
"It would be a 5, if I could get some help figuring out why I have been having difficulty reading letters and summaries!",
"I see that others are getting a blank screen after they log-in. I can't even get that far. The app gives me an error when I TRY to log in, so I cannot log-in at all. In a reply it sounded like it was an issue the developers of this app are having with Android. Might wanna prioritize addressing the problem because this is pretty unacceptable.",
"It is a fantabulous app for most of your medical needs, questions, scheduling app'ts and messaging your health care professionals. CCF is always finding ways to improve this app by refining existing formats & adding new features!",
Needs to be updated not showing latest test results.,
"Would be good if it worked. Trying to pay a bill, option doesn't work. Can't find account number info for bill. Put in payment info and app takes me back to first page. Send email for help, they say there are no problems, and send number to pay by phone.??? Why have the app? The ability to schedule appointment works occasionally. Would be great thing to have if it worked like it should. Customer service is no help.",
Easiest way to keep track of appointments and message doctors. Also links to the website so I can also use my computer and it is all the same,
"Awesome, this app helps you make appointments, get medicine refills, read the after appointment notes to keep you informed if you haven't installed it yet do it it's great",
"So convenient! I wish you could access letters and download them from the app, but other than that, I think it's a great app.",
I absolutely love this app! Add had a double transplant of the kidney and pancreas. I have so many doctors appointments that is hard to keep track. MyChart helps me keep track of every appointment. I also get to see my blood work often before the doctor does. The lab results goes into detail for those of us that did not go to college to become a nurse or a doctor. I am not going to lie but I am very dependent upon this app. Lol being a single mom I'm juggling all of our stuff is crazy.,
"Great app for communicating with your care team for planning visits, refilling prescriptions and especially as a repository for your health care history. Why a 4-star review: Since covid I have been getting vaccinations at my local CVS. The CVS vaccinations are not available to my health care provider even though I have both organizations in Mychart. So my healthcare provider keeps recommending vaccines such as for shingles or pneumonia for me even though I have gotten them from CVS.",
"Sometimes, this is a little difficult to work with. May be my misunderstanding of the electronic system. It does, however, give me an avenue to speak with my provider so I can get answers immediately at times. I get the opportunity to place refill of medication order when needed. Gives my provider an opportunity to speak to me and answer questions as well as ask them.",
Easy to view upcoming apps. And pre-register,
"Great, I love seeing all the red flags the doctors don't question! My chart works better than the doctors that put the information into it!",
I love this app it is very convenient to use and contact my PCP via messages and Labs for blood work and easy way to get your test results back also.,
"Since update can no longer view clinical notes and when I try to view images I now get an error message when I click on the link (takes me to a nilread site that doesnt work). Used to be awesome now its basically useless. No one can tell me who to contact or how to fix or what happened and Im extremely frustrated because having the ability to view notes and images was the only way I knew what was actually going on because most of the staff here are new, young, undertrained and clueless.",
Excellent app up to date app.real time services of appts.,
Wonderful and easy to use. Helps me remember things. It's great for making my appointments. I'm very happy that all my doctors belong to The Everett Clinic. I've been with them since moving here to Washington.,
"Well designed, ease of use... Love it.",
It isnt the best when medical staff fail to use the features provided in the app. If you sell an app. the medical team should be required to follow up with patients.,
I like the app. When I lose my papers this app helps with appointments,
"The message center, you should be able to send to any doctor you have, but you can't. Then you only have a few days to Rey or is grayed out. You send a message and no reply.",
Really easy to use and read,
Great app very useful n helps me with all my medical needs.,
Great for contacting medical without a lot of phone tag!!,
Great app if your service provider is useing it they choose wisely. It keeps you updated on your appointments and you can see your blood work test asap and much more. Overall it a great app. It great to have your medical information at your own fingertips. Great way to communicate with your medical staff. If you have a question you can message it to the doctor. My doctor responds fast which is cool. You can also set up appointments without the annoyance of having to call some automated service.,
Great app. Love referring to my results so I can discuss issues or questions with my doctor. The updates have been excellent.,
Great. Makes it so easy to get a hold of my Dr's and their teams.,
Very informative as well as helpful.,
"This is, by far, one of my favorite apps! Getting relevant information and the available opportunity to communicate with questions regarding my health is top notch!",
I truly had the best care in ICU! Everyone who came in from nurses to those doing testing was wonderful.,
I really like that you're not left wondering about your tests...and that you can access so much...,
Itseems thatheres noway to view past msgs/letters (fersumreasin they're 2diff formats but basikly conveying the same communications??) once they're read theyseemto disahpear & cai8nt be retrieved/reviewd later ifone whantsto be reminded of sumthg thatwuz containd inthem????,
"They would like you to go paperless on bills, but after 3 months app still not fixed so you can pay it. Did put out a message about 2 1/2 months after that they know it is not working, but still have not sent a paper bill during the down time. Good at tracking appointments, was easy for seeing test results, just would like them to fix the bugs.",
so easy to keep up with appts records and labs,
This app is good except where you're notified that you need to schedule an upcoming appointment - it doesn't tell you for what! It needs to tell you what it's in reference to.,
Pretty solid all around. And definately works amazingly well... provided the care you're receiving utilizes it. Hit a Home Run with the 'Proxy access' so I can help manage my partners complex medical care. Enabling it was fast and secure. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the ability enter records of my own from non-Epic medical office visits. Bonus points if you can enable any kind of basic document reading / rendering. The UI could stand to be a bit more modern too.,
Very informative & easy to use. I highly recommend it.,
Very easy to use and really convenient.,
Love love love this app! It makes it so easy in every aspect to know and get my medical history. The only small issue is that when you receive new notifications they seem to change location within the app. For example I received a new message from my Dr attached to a pathology report and after reading it it was moved from the front screen to appointme to and test results. Just a little confusing but all in all great app!,
"this app is pure Spyware...it actually tracks patients' movement everywhere. It has ability to automatically check you in when you walk into Dr office/clinic/group. The only way that happens is using tracking. Perhaps it's the phone pinging the location which is, again, Spyware tracking. What other uses will this ability be used for? This was bound to be used despite denial at release... bullcrap.",
"There are several convenient features to this app, however the annoyances overshadow those conveniences. I am continually asked to review my personal information. I do the review, nothing has changed, but the app keeps asking. Very annoying. Also I have successfully linked my My Chart account with CVSHealth, but every couple of months it unlinks and I have to re-link again.",
"It's a good app when it functions right, but I've been locked out of my account because of a bad password no less than 3 times now and I've had to change it (even though I was 100% positive I was entering the correct one) every time, and my account was not compromised. Further, I've had past issues that inexplicably KEPT me locked out of MyChart for upwards of 2 weeks at a time for reasons unknown, and said reasons were never made privy to me. I was simply ""able to login again"" one random day.",
"This app is riddled with bugs. I can no longer sign in with biometrics, it always gives a password error. I am also no longer able to modify a payment plan or pay for services through the app. I once found the app somewhat useful but it is buggy and broken now. I'm not confident that such a bug-ridden app should be trusted with personal health information.",
"This app has been invaluable to me. Recent health issues have resulted in many many hospital & office visits in the past year. MyChart has made every aspect of my associations with Providence accessible to me around the clock. Appointments entered directly into my calendar at the push of a button, test results, medical history, medications, and visit notes available for review, plus the ability to message my provider - MyChart provides all of this in a user-friendly, well designed format. Kudos!",
"This app has been great in handling all my family medical appointments and billing. Wish dentist, pathologist and smaller medical providers would use this.",
Easy app to look up your medical history records orders that is secure⚕️,
"Am happy I'm able to see all my test results, after summary notes etc on this app. Only bad thing is the Dr's that don't use it",
Have had great experience with the MyChart it great to have communication with my doctor and staff,
"I love the convenience of this App to manage my healthcare. The only complaint I have is; I'm not sure which it is, When my computer updates, or they do updates to the app my UN and PW isn't recognized. Not sure which it is. I do put a slip in with IT. My computer updated 2 days ago. But I could get on the app yesterday. Last night I could no longer access my information. I find it frustrating because it always seems to occur when there are results and/or a message from my PCP.",
The staff here is awesome!! Dr. Keller is my favorite. He always pays attention to you when your explaining what is wrong with you and ask all the right questions. The staff is great with keeping you informed about what's going on. The ladies in the Catscan room were very helpful with explaining the process and letting me know what to expect during my procedure. I will always come to this hospital for my medical care. Keep up the good work 👏,
My star rating reflects the fact that the MyChart app doesn't save FORMS that are completed during e-check-in. It takes about 30 mins to complete the check-in with forms. When I arrive at my appt. I'm checked in manually (another 10 min) The paper version of the form that I completed on line is then handed to me for completion. I've advised the staff of this issue several times and nothing has changed. I decided to enter a review after the same thing occurred for an upcoming appointment.,
"The app itself is ok I suppose. What I oppose to is when your appt. that you've been looking forward to gets canceled at the last minuet for no real obvious reason. I waited a good while for the appt. that's of extreme importance to me. Trying to get hold of an actual human being over the phone is almost unheard of these days. No one wants to interact with a man made machine. Pick up the phone ladies, there are actual people who really NEED the service.",
"Overall, a medium ranking...seems more convenient, but until every care provider adopts it, I find it dysfunctional. I have missed appts because My Chart only has partial info, and oftentimes, unhelpful because of lack of input. WHy can't my counseling appts be included? I have some unknown amt of loss of cognitive function...I don't need an array of specialized apps to do this, My Chart was built for this, I believe. Very dissappointed in it's overall performance. I just missed an appt, and thi",
"I'm very disappointed with how things have went with the app lately. There was recently a breach, preventing me from logging in. I had to start a completely new account, put in the verification code emailed to me only to have the app tell me it couldn't verify my information and a code would be sent by mail. This is ridiculous...",
"I like being able to see my health care plan along with medical record notes from each appointments. It is really convenient for making appointments or changing them as well. Very easy to manage and refill my prescriptions, sending and receiving messages back with easy access to my health care provider and team without having to call them. I can access my test results with detailed information. I also can pay my medical bills through this app with the option of making automatic monthly payment",
"Very good ... I Appreciate my info being organized and all in one place . The doctors have my info and now so do I and can refer back to it any time. My only complaint is the test results. I can't effectively read them nor do I understand the symbols along the margin of some of the results - especially the ! - in a circle that leads you to believe it needs immediate attention ,causing upset. There should be a page or call center for a quick explanation of how to interpret the symbols etc.on app.",
"This app is great, simple to navigate and receive my results fast. I receive notifications by email and text, which is great. I can access most of records. Only problem... wish you can see all past testing (not just the past year) to make comparisons to most current/recent test records.",
"Love this app. Appts, lab and test results, doctors visit comments which is nice as sometimes I forget some of what was discussed in the appointment.",
I love this app!!! I am in control of my medical appointments records and I can also review and message my doctor it's GREAT!!!!,
Works well to make appointments and get test results back really fast. Haven't had any issues.,
"Worst app on my phone. Difficult to use & navigate. I work in tech & have owned cell phone and internet companies. I do internet cabling and tech for international airports. I use apps, phones etc all day. This is the worst app I've been forced to use. Maybe the developers are looking to give a child-like experience? Idk, but the bubbles and transitions suck. This is medical. We need straightforward & concise. This app is anything but!!! Clean it up. Make it simple.",
The app provides useful and timely information to my health condition,
Very easy to use and informative,
This app is very convenient. It allows me to look at my doctor's notes and any other Dr office can see it too.,
"Great app that allows easy access to my past medical information, future appointments, and communication with my medical team.",
Having too much trouble con nnecting to umc for e-check in,
"This app makes it easy it easy to see up coming appts, refill rxs, schedul appts and check your test results.... When it's working. I've been having a lot of trouble with accessing my medication and checking my messages on the app for a few weeks now. Prior to this trouble the app was working perfectly and took a lot of the anxiety out of dealing with all of my drs, scheduling appts and refilling my rxs. I'm not sure what's changed... Maybe the latest update? Idk",
Very helpful tool to look at and manage my Healthcare,
It's a wonderful app You can do everything on you can cancel appointments on there you can do E-Check ins they let you know when your appointments are it's just a great app to have on your phone and you get your test results on here too which is really nice,
"It's nice to have access to your children's records all in one place, no papers to clutter at home. I really enjoy MyChart for my girls!",
"Why can't the items that need attention show up on the main screen so that if you have say two messages a number 2 would show on the main screen on the message icon, etc. I had two letters that I was not aware of them until just recently. For prescriptions and appointments my chart works great but it could stand some major changes to be easier to use.",
"Since the latest update receiving multiple ""server error"" messages. Have made several attempts to send refill requests to my doctor's office. All unsuccessful even though I receive a confirmation page. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Can not currently trust this app for anything. Update: April. No improvement, app or website. App uninstall. Back to the 90's and the telephone. Also, brand new phone in recent days. Android 11. Not the issue, or shouldn't be.",
"They bill you, but never say what the bill us for. they say you owe money, but never give a visit summary or treatment code for the bill. My bill came in nearly 6 months after my last visit with no explanation as to why I was getting billed. Also, paperless billing was turned on for my account. I never turned it on. I liked it better when they gave bill summaries, but this seems to have went away when U of M took over.",
My Chart is a great communication tool and is accessible for all my needs. Very consistent.,
"My chart keeps me up to date with all of my appointments and test results, scheduling and canceling if need be!! It's ALL here!!",
"Love everything about the app but the last few days we have been unable to log into both my and my husband's MyChart. Keep getting an error message that says ""we couldn't log you in right now, please try again later"". Our login name and password are correct on both accounts but for some reason the app is NOT working and it is VERY frustrating as we need to see the cancer marker test results!!! We have already sent an email to Epic MyChart Support regarding this issue.",
"It's great to be able to track my health, appointments, and medications.",
Information is there for you quickly. Scheduling is nice and effortless. Nice job!!!,
"I love being able to refill meds, ask my doctors questions and schedule my own basic appointments. As a disabled mother-of-three, MyChart helps me keep everybody's medical issues and medicinal needs at the tip of my fingers. I love how quick I can reach out to our doctors and get a response back. I absolutely hate sitting on the phone, most people have problems understanding me, my mouth spasms a lot and sometimes it's a lot easier for both me and the doctor / nurse with less confusion.",
The app is awesome in general with a lot of information and ability to communicate. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the checkin process. It is excruciatingly long and tedious answering/reviewing all the same info every time. Then walking inside and still needing to read and sign papers with the same info just verified in the app. My insurance and ID are also stored in the app but they still want to see the cards and make copies.,
I like being able to read my chart better than speaking to someone on the phone and I can go back and read past appointments.,
I love this app. Tou can see and do anything you need or want to do here!!! I love having access to my test results and being able to see the notes that the Soctors have written concerning your case.,
"It was an ok health app before, but now even trying to do something as simple as scheduling an appointment with my primary care physician is rediculously overcomplicated. Now, in order to schedule an appointment, I have to go to schedule, find the right location out of all hospitals in the system, pick a category, and then sort through all available appointments with all the professionals that work at that location. And my doctor usually STILL isn't in that list. Review edited due to response.",
"The app is good for looking at test results with the updated way it uses graphics. The app works ok for scripts that are good for an extended time. I do not find the app to align easily with scripts that change. My pharmacy goes out of it's way to help manage costs. It may be my phone, my lack of skill, and changes in gov rules but the app reduces my confidence in communicating with my physician's office. The office is well run. Like here, #of characters is limited. Attachments sometimes work",
Just wonderful ..very quick to update and plus all my information is right here at my fingertips..100%,
This is a good app to have because it lets you see test results and upcoming appointments,
It makes things convenient and easier.,
This is a very useful and well put together app. It is very easy to use. Makes the doctors visit so much easier. 👍👍👍,
"This is one of, if not the best app for medical appointments, test results, and all other aspects of managing my health!!!",
"I am happy with Mychart. Harrison Co. Hospital is affiliated with Norton's but test results, etc. are not showing up on Norton's MyChart page.",
"It has some useful features that aren't available when I access my chart directly thru UCLA online. But it doesn't give me the option of deleting or marking as completed old appointment reminders. Also, redundant lab results aren't available for viewing. But it's useful in that I can do video appointments with my doctor.",
"Love it the best way set appointment, talk to doctors, and not have to spend time talking to automated systems 😁 10/10",
"App is very annoying while trying to sign in. Asks for a PIN. Then asks for verification code sent via email. Doesn't come. You resend code, no code. You do it again. Three emails come with the same verification code. Code doesn't work. When you get to use the app, it's only good for checking on appointments. If you want to MAKE an appointment, they tell you to call. Then why is it an option? They made an app they don't care about apparently. UPDATE: Same thing happened today. Didn't receive a code for 15 minutes, then multiple codes came via email. None worked and now I'm locked out of my account. Worthless. Update: They can't unlock me. Ask your health care provider. They won't help anymore. Beyond worthless.",
"New version looks no better & still missing Dark mode. Many functions fail to load the information requested, instead returning a vague error that it failed. When they do work the app is very slow. Way too many functions still only supported via web browser making the app semi-useless. Don't release it until you've got it all working.",
"To many hoops to access it , should be able to delete after reading something and not have it pop back up",
Mix things a lot easier to get a hold of your doctor and get messages across and interact without making a million phone calls definitely useful for me,
Awesome app. I know test results and appointments before they do most the time. Very useful and efficient.,
Very easy to keep up with appointments,
"It's fine, but a lot of the features don't work. For example, I can enter all of my payment information to pay a bill, but there's no button or way to submit the payment. There's just a ""Back"" and ""Cancel"" button. Very irritating. Not to mention the other features that take you to the website, just to turn around and say that the feature isn't available right now, and to logout and try again. It's honestly just a half-assed app that's been poorly put together.",
Terrible unable to log in and no response,
Extremely glitchy. Signed up and access the application successfully once. Since then it has not worked. Nor does it interface with the applications of other medical networks like it is supposed to. Other networks show that it cannot connect to the server for this app. Really irritating since I need to verify information for an upcoming Hospital procedure.,
"Fairly happy with it; some rough edges: 1. No message drafts and can't see what I'm replying to. 15 min writing reply, pop out to re-read the message or test result, poof! Gone. 2. Getting a reminder for the flu vaccine from one provider after I got the shot at at another. Edit: 3. Stuck in ""500 - Internal Server Error"" on trying to fill out a pre-visit questionnaire. Seems to have cleared itself. 4. The ""logout"" button looks like a ""send message"" button, and dumps the message you were writing.",
"This app is very helpful, especially during hospital stays.",
For several weeks I have been informed that my account is disabled. I have tried resetting my password but without success. I have not changed my user name and password because it was automatically saved on my PC and I am sure it is correct. It has been the same since I joined MyChart. I would greatly appreciate feedback from whoever is responsible for sorting out these glitches. I'm awaiting news of the results of various scans and blood tests as well as news of my next appointment.,
It's a lot easier to get in touch with the my doctor and make appointments,
It is a lot easier to request refills on your medication. You also get a quick response if you have questions for your physician or about your medication. You can also see when your next appointment is and what your test results are.,
"Fair app. It would be much better and much more useful if we could select our insurance companies from a drop-down box. For example, I have two insurance companies and every time I use one, when I go somewhere else that doesn't accept it but they accept the other, it defaults to the last one selected and there is no way to change it. Therefore, this app has become useless because I can no longer check in or pay because it is defaulted to the wrong insurance company. Please fix this ASAP!",
Really enjoy this app even a trip to er shows everything they didn't tell me,
I personally very much so like this app for the fact that it's a for sure way that you can for sure know that your doctors team is getting your messages compared to actually having to call the office or clinic and someone else takes your messages and info but you never hear back from the doctor and they say that they didn't get the message that the person must've got busy and forgot to give it to the team . Although I don't like the part about how the labs or diagnosis are put in here but there',
like the app but has a big problem once something is entered to it you can't get it changed have made numerous calls and inquiries all to no help.,
"Unfortunately, I'm dealing with several health issues that require me to see several physicians. Using MyChart allows me to easily add appointments to my Google calendar. It also gives easy access to records, test results, and a easy way to communicate with my providers. MyChart is probably the most used app on my phone, I would be lost without this truly useful app. Bill Nolan",
"It is very convenient for me to be able to message questions to my Dr rather call and wait for a call back, I believe it saves time for the practitioner also",
"I love this app, all your information from multiple medical facilities in one place. I will say it is 100% the best of all apps.",
"I find this app very useful for checking appointment dates, lab scheduling and results, and for messagjng my physicians with brief questions that do not require a visit.",
"The my chart app is so convenient and easy to use and understand. I can Make my appointments in the app, email the Dr. Get my test results. I can update it anytime I have to. I'm having surgery this month and I already have everything scheduled in my chart. The directions and all. This app is the best thing to have. It also saves me time on everything. I love it",
They are always very kind and always have my medications. They also helped me with my vacation medications. I recommend them to anyone!!,
"Top app for organizing life. No matter if you are healthy and rarely see a physician or if you are getting daily treatments. This will help you stay organized and less stressed. Create appointments, go to video visits and refill meds all from here. My favorite part is it will send appointments over to Google calendar. I just wish it would sync all appointments, instead of me telling it to do each one. Maybe update that....",
I love my chart. Very easy to navigate.,
"Easy, comprehensive & detailed.",
"This is such a great app. It's easy to navigate and track everything! Even my entire family, which is very helpful. I can go back years and clearly see the doctors I saw, what tests I took and the results. I can locate tests results hours after getting my blood drawn. Haven't used a better system really!",
I do not prefer the new dashboard/homepage setup. My brain doesn't want to recognize all the circles and weird design format. I don't want pretty and artistic from my medical provider. I want easy access and lists I can choose dropdowns to get what I need fast. Still grateful for the access and the idea but not a fan of the updated version. Meh.,
The care I received was excellent! Outstanding physician and Dr Cardoza-Kellog was thorough and very professional!,
"This app would be great if only messages were actually accessible consistently. I'm notified of new messages but every time I log in to the app it's always a toss up whether or not the messages center is even visible from the menu. The inconsistency is the strangest part of this bug, and it seemed to have only started when my provider released their own app that supposedly links to my MyChart info, so this may be an issue caused by my provider and not the app itself.",
"Very, very simple to use. All of my Dr's name and info is readily accesible with pictures of each individual. The appointments part is equally helpful. The time, date, location and with cleveland clinic at least the desk location. Making appointments and prescription drug reordering couldn't get much easier. Also, not only upcoming appointments but it's very easy to look at past ones also. This is a very handy and as mentioned easy, convienent, and available anytime that I want to obtain info.",
MyChart is a Great App. to communicate with your medical professionals.,
Modern app for the modern day patient. Just the fact that it's so easy to pull up on my phone and check/send messages to any of my health care providers. Or check where and when that schedule was supposed to be. I get notifications whenever a test result is submitted so I can literally pull up the app anytime. I love it.,
I would like to be able to update my own information such as testing completed instead of receiving numerous texts and emails as reminders,
"I like the app, but I find difficulty with it. There a 4 on my app, I don't know why, and my ent cannot see my results",
"I guess things were going great for a while, so I guess they decided they didnt need to keep the developer on payroll. App takes forever to login, that is when it feels like it, then it either cant connect to the server or loads so slow it times out the connection. Not to mention there's the cancerous method of resetting your password that should be revamped up from the mid 90's method.",
"I absolutely love this app. It's so easy to use and keep up with my all my doctors appointments, my medications, and being able to send messages.",
SIMPLE - EASY - SECURE I saw one guy say he had to completely close the app and restart because he couldn't back out of anything so was forced to restart to go back. Well that really made me hesitant about downloading the app but figured I could always delete. Come to find out that's not the case. Not sure if he has a really old phone or isn't use to using the back button but you can totally go back to previous page without closing the app and starting over. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
"Every time there is a new message or a new lab result, all the lab results are listed as new. Online on my PC, every message which links to a lab result is marked in bold as unread. I open them and read them, then with the next email notification, all the previously read messages are in bold and unread, even though I already looked at them. On the app there is no differentiation between read and unread lab results. The message icon shows a number and I have to open every msg to erase the numbe",
"I can't think of anything that could be more complex than trying to manage patient records, appointments and interactions with my doctor and his staff, since these activities can include documenting so many different bodily processes, maladies, treatment options, tests, etc., etc. The creators of this app have somehow eliminated the complexity of all this and made an intuitive, easy to use, yet detailed and comprehensive tool! That is a stunning achievement! Well done, developers!",
"I love that you can get any information like test results, etc, a lot faster than waiting for the doctor's office to get a hold of you.",
"The app changed and now I am unable to see my upcoming appointments a month ahead. I had to call the doctor's office for dates and times. I can only see 2 weeks ahead which is very unhelpful. I used this app to keep track of all the families appointments, but now I am going to have to go back to inputting the manually into my google calendar app. Also I wish there was an option to export appointments into your preferred calendar app. It would make keeping track of all appointments easier.",
It works for the most part except when using a VPN then it kicks me off at every button press.,
"Excellent service , so simple to use",
There only one thing rong has far as I am concerned with this app you can't stop unwanted items from sowing up like the one tell you you need some shot (shots) I don't get vaccinated for the Corona19 booster's aka(CCP virus) Flu ect.......... other than that I really like this app,
I absolutely love this app! I have a lot of medical issues and this allows me to keep all of my information in one place. Being able to communicate with my doctor's without having to leave messages at the front desk is a godsend! I can pull up anything I need at anytime I want and can add my appointments to my calendar with one click. The convenience is amazing!,
"Love being able to access my medical info so quickly. I also love the after visit summaries, sometimes you can't quite remember what the doctor said or remember the medical term as it was explained. So it's nice to be able to reference that when we need to and the appointments being on my chart. You can also personalize how you want reminders either by text or email. It is the perfect back-up and support system to our busy lives. 5 stars from me!",
"""Your contact information and notification preferences need review..."" This refuses to go away. I've hit update then closed it again multiple times. There is no button to confirm my info, just a close button and a few edit buttons. ------- items that cannot be launched within the app should at least have a description of what they are, rather than simply directing the user to an external browser, for example sharing->Lucy, growth charts, advance directive.",
This app sucks! Worst app ever. Be warned that if you as a parent have an account then there is no way to get access to your kids account. They say its easy it is not!,
It's great having access to your medical records and all of your doctors and prescriptions via this app. I highly recommend.,
Awesome app minus android swip left to right to get back neck page only iPhone has the back space 🔑 Epic please fix the no black space on test results 😀 and couple of other pages.,
Best thing is I get a response from my Dr.'s office so much faster than calling! But quick access to a list of my meds and test results is super nice as well.,
Very helpful sometimes even better than calling to get meds refilled,
My mother is 80 With dementia and I am 48 AND HER SOLE CARE TAKER Can't recommend THIS APP strong enough My chart Has put her care right in the palm of my hand Literally Test results medicine upcoming visits All of it is SUPER EASY TO FIND AND REMEMBER solely due to this app I'D BE LOST WITHOUT IT It's a blessing DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE,
This app is extremely helpful in keeping all your medical info in one location. Easy to navigate.,
"Don't know if it's the app or the technologically incompetent staff at my hospital, but if you're going to implement an option to pay your bill through this app, make it work. Edit: Got a response from the app developer, which is rare and much appreciated. However, if the hospital determines that it doesn't want to allow payment options through your app, then disappear the pay button and any other payment related tabs, etc. Too easy.",
Amazing! Easy to keep up with appointments test results visits what I'm due and more! So easy for me to deal with!,
Looking at test results is horrible. Last telehealth visit was unsuccessful. Never had these issues before. There needs to be an update to correct these issues. The latest issue was log in not accepting my password when it was correct. Had to use PC to fix it. App not working well on my tablet anymore. I mainly use this to speak to my specialist via telehealth. Keeps me from driving all the was to KU.,
"What would really impove your app would be to have an option to see your historical data. Say I want to see my hemoglobin levels from the past year to view trends. I have to go into each and every lab labeled ""Chemistry"" (and most of them are labeled that generically) to find my numbers. Mayo Clinics app provides a clickable link to see a chart of your trends. So much easier and user friendly.",
Cannot see son's invoices. He is 13. I've been calling back and forth with healthcare provider and it seems to be a programming issue with mychart. Keeps asking me to verify phone,
"Love this app. Easy to use and maneuver so you can see all appointments, results and even schedule new apps.",
It's perfect because I can see all my appointments all my test results and even messages from the doctor it's just what we need to keep up with everything.,
"My Dr. Kenny Hawk is the best NP there. Taylor Shahan is a wonderful nursing asset. Both so kind, caring and polite. However, GMG has changed and not for the better since Ruby took over. It's no longer the small home town feel and most are vwey rude. Your just a number to Ruby.",
"Love this app and all of it's features. It's great to keep organized, the appointment reminders are a huge help as well! I can't emphasize enough what a great help it's been having all my doctors appointments, updated list of medications and dosing instructions, blood work, test results(ie. MRI, CT scans, echocardiograms, X-rays etc), as well as any doctors notes, you can read all notes the doctor or nurse may have made in regards to your visit/after visit summery.",
"The app does not provide you with any type of search capability, nor does it allow you to go back to a main menu or to the main screen you're stuck on whatever screen you end up on which is extremely frustrating. This really should be fixed because I at this point am about to delete it from my phone",
"My Chart is Amazing! Highly Recommended This! Makes everything easy to organize and follow up on. I love being able to communicate with my health team at the touch of a button! Scheduling appointments online is so helpful and staying in step with lab results is comforting. Super helpful app, I recommend everyone to use it.",
Extremely useful in documenting and keeping up with my medical care. It is also invaluable in keeping in contact with my providers. Very convenient and looking up results of tests that have been run. These results remain available to consider for review whenever necessary.,
"Downloaded app today. Tried to look at my information. Lots of Tiff files. They disappeared when I went to save them. Multiple times. Did some research. Turns out Tiff files are big picture files used by book publishers. Probably too big for my Android phone's memory. What use is an app that I can't use to look up my information? Disappointed, I uninstalled the app. Will try to use the internet browser to access my information instead of the app.",
My chart is great. It has all my appt doctors and results. You don't have to wait for a phone call from them. You just check your chart. You can leave them messages also. I gave a 4 stars. Nothing is perfect One flaw... when the doctor is messaging you with results of findings blood work etc. They need to explain it In English so we can understand it. I love having my chart..,
"I love being able to see test results as they are posted. Also, the ability to see all my appointments helps me to be to all of my appointments on time. There are other parts of my chart that are very helpful, especially being able to cancel appointments or leave the dr. a message.",
"I love it. I live about 45 minutes away from both Tennessee & Kentucky. So to be able to do most of what I need to, even visits, is a god send. UVA did a Deep Brain Stimulation surgery on me for a neurological disorder I have, so traveling there every 6 months was taxing & I'd always looks worse than I would have otherwise. I could find another doctor, but a good one is hard to find. So when I find a good one, I hold onto them as long as I can. Lol. I've never had any problems with the app.",
Best medical patient portal ! User friendly easy to navigate. Easy to understand.,
"This has been a wonderful app for keeping all my medical records, Dr's, appointments, referrals, and more within just a few clicks away for me to quickly access. I really do use it constantly. It notifies schedules, re-schedules, and cancels appointments in real time, too. 5/5 stars!",
"App generally works well, allows you to access your medical info, and even message your providers. My only complaint is that the bill paying feature never seems to work. I always have to call the clinic's billing dept and pay over the phone.",
"It's incredibly difficult to adhere to, and at times very repetitive and excruciatingly harassing. It's a good idea in theory, but in reality very impractical, especially since it is now a requirement to either use the app or just don't go to the doctor, that's your two options. It would be helpful if you could be allowed to type in more than 500 words on the review, but. Apparently they don't want to know 🙂 how about that.",
"Y'all need to update and fix the delay and delivery issues. I just now got messages. Also, log in issues with second sign in security feature has a major lagging problem. Updates are a constant and need to be resolved immediately, or it rendered your app useless.",
"So easy to use once it is set up. It's a bit difficult to actually get it set up if you have more than one person on the account. But once you have them on there, everything's under one app and it's easy to switch from person to person or just message directly to your provider.",
"This app seems to be filled with bugs and errors. It seems more likely than not that it will fail when I try to use it. At the moment, I received an email telling me that the provider has sent a message in the app. But when I try to check messages, it says there is an error and try again later. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a choice of apps.",
"This app is easy to use. I love sending and receiving messages from my doctors. If I have a question, I can send it at any hour. When they get to the office, it will be waiti g on them. I don't have to worry about missing a phone call. Also, I can view my test results or look up notes from a previous visit. I have never seen an ad in the app.",
Love MyChart! Having access to my medical test results in a quick turnaround time is very useful. Having accèss to the calendar of upcoming medical appointments helps alot as well. The app is intuitive and easy to use. Overall love it.,
"This is a unicorn; competence boardering on mythical. The app works. It gives me access to important information virtually at the same speed it is processed at the hospital. Easy and effective interface, no excessive security, timely with push notifications... honestly it is remarkable. My only comment is the initial screen of selecting health networks was confusing. Frankly I'm shocked this quality of tool is being used in the Ontario Health Care system! :-)",
it works pretty good for test results and some appointment reminders. but I can't seem to get any of the other features to on the app to work. and I can't get the app to sync even with itself,
"Haven't had any issues with the app, it is quite comprehensive in detail as well as user friendliness. Presumably, any issues run into are related to the age of my device, and available connection.",
"The system is very restrictive, making it difficult to move between pages. You can't message a Physician on MC unless you have already been seen by them. That makes setting appointments difficult. The system must not interact with the epic patient system, as you must complete copious redundant questionnaires everytime you set a new appointment.",
"I Like being able to see my test results in real time, even before seeing my doctor. It helps me with learning what they mean by researching on the internet. Doctors don't always have time to go over all my test results. I've learned a lot by researching what certain tests mean. Moreover, it allows me to understand & engage with my doctor in a more proactive, productive, efficient way. It helps me take more control over my total well-being.",
"I was depending on this app to help me keep up with appointments and communication with my medical team. However, the app now will not let me access my information without setting up 2-step verification, which is a terrible idea and NOT secure for someone who is affected by mental illness, economic hardship and tech access instability. I don't have enough characters to explain all the ways I've already been locked out of 2-step verification on other apps unable to access a code every login...",
"This app is so wonderful & helpful in soooo many ways! I love being able to look at the test results as soon as they're in & the Dr's notes make the patient/ doctor relationship a little more personal and easier to understand. The learning library is awesome as it gives you links to definitions and explanations to some of those ""Big Dr. Words"" that only they could pronounce/ comprehend! E-checkin is probably the 2nd best thing I love abt this app! No lines, No hassle! I'd give 6 stars if I could",
"It definitely comes in handy, it would just be nice if every provider used the same app, because I am missing huge gaps with my Neurology, and I don't know how to go about accessing all that information since it's across three states. But it's very nice to connect with your physician and get answers generally the same day you submit them.",
"Excellent for those who frequent OSF Hospitals and have Doctors within OSF. You can do all sorts of things now in the app that used to be a pain to do otherwise. You can message your doctor, request refills, and see all sorts of valuable information. The only thing I wish is that you could take screenshots in the app because that would super handy, but I understand it's a security issue. 5/5 Edit: Actually it turns out you can enable screenshots in the settings",
"Simple and easy to understand. Access all of your needed resources in one place, and you can communicate with your doctor(s) through messaging, or are able to schedule an/your appointments. I highly recommend using this app for your medical needs :)",
"Extremely dependable,I really like how quickly the nurses get back to you with your answers! I'm able to print my doctor excuses and whatever else I have on there. There are so many options on there. I would recommend this in a heartbeat!!! It is very useful if your if your taking care of your family and having permission to go on their my chart to see their medications to determine what to give them. Thanks for making things alot easier and more understandable.",
"This app is very, helpful and resourceful, easy to manage and use. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be able to use this app; and learning the ins and outs of it. Thank you sincerely, Jose Brown",
"Very easy to use, an excellent tool to keep your Heath in check. Ideal quick access.",
Hard to read results every time.,
"The unified experience is awesome! I can now link my portal accounts from multiple hospitals across the country, and see my past appointment and test histories all in one place. Now all it needs is graphing for labs, and a gernic ""health journal"" option for things like migraine and sleep tracking. (Custom flowsheets just don't cut it)",
My Chart works great... Especially when I'm up to speed on using it. It keeps getting better!,
Edited to add: At no point in my review did I say I got a new phone or redownload the app. Nothing has changed on my end. Developer response unhelpful and assumes user error. I have set biometric login back up but that was not the point. -- Went to log in and biometric login no longer available. Why just remove the login I've been using for so long with no warning? Needed information quickly but have to reset everything. Very frustrating.,
I like being able to ask a question and get an answer back without phone calls. Takes a lot less time to receive a response back. I give this app 5 stars,
Easy to use and convenient..,
Outstanding app for all communications.,
"It has NEVER been easier to request refills, see lab results, see or schedule upcoming appointments, message the doctor and actually get a reply within a day (guess that's doctor depending tho.) Interface is easy to use and intuitive; it makes me extremely happy that my main doctor/hospital offer this service. My psychiatrist uses a different app and while it works okay, nothing like MyChart!",
Great Application. You can see all your appointments and test results here. Also their all easy to understand.,
"Not the best, server error is all I get. Not able to read letters sent or even leave a message for my health care provider.",
Great way to view all your medical in one place from site to site! Love it! Easy to use! Perfect for my medical needs!,
Scheduling for med refills is easy; but i can't seem to be able to schedule a routine office visit in person or online.,
It really helps to be able to send your doctors team a message and you can get a lot of answers from a well kept chart. I have logged into a different chart system at another doctors office and struggled to send a message or use the program. I had to call and wait a long time to get a simple answer. This chart system is much easier in functionality.,
Most times doesn't work. Always error message.... it is convenient and good idea but poor execution,
"The app worked for me 2 weeks ago, now I receive a message that a newer version is available, but there is not. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall app, but it made no difference. Cannot access at all. Last update shows as Dec 13, 2016. Also shows as incompatible with my older Samsung tablet when previously it was.",
"How does one switch between provider networks? I have providers in two different systems that both use your backend. The websites allowed me to link the accounts, but the app can't seem to find the other account, and won't access the other system to log in after logging out of the app. Yet, both send me to the exact same Google Play entry. I'm not going to clear data every time I need to check things on both systems. You know my data, show it to me!",
"I have several Doctors and a few different apps for these doctorsn,. My Chart is by far the most informative and easy-to use",
"I feel like there are so many potentially good features and options in the app, but it seems as though most of them don't work! It's great that you can show me all the types of medical appointments I am overdue for, but no way to make said appointments. Seems like a waste. Tons of options, few that are helpful.",
"Love using this app, I communicate with my Dr's and see all my appointments",
"MyChart is super convenient, and you know results before your Dr even gets the chance to call and talk over them. I enjoy this app alot.",
You need to stop changing the app. It is very hard on people who have visual problem is when you no longer marked the area where there is new information. It's hard to find the newest things added to a chart.,
"Simple to use if one takes their time. Easy installation off app helps when going for doctors visits and get medication filled. Keeping track of my health and understanding what is going on with my health is great when using this app. Every doctor I visit, clinic, or hospital has my medical information that I can provide just by logging in and sharing.",
Love this app. Easy to use and communicate with doctor.,
Great reminder and good for receiving info about your health,
MyChart is awesome. It keeps me informed of my appts and gives me results of tests etc. Thank you so much for my access to this app. I check it often. Janice Taft,
"While this app has worked well in the past, now that I have providers at both UW and GHC, many times the app does not sync with the GHC. I count on this information to be available so I can keep in touch with my providers, appointments and meds. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that it often times does not sync up. This happens with the MyChart website as well. I've been told by Devs that GHC has a separate app. No, they do not. It's all in MyChart. Please fix these reoccurring issues.",
Excellent! It makes it very easy to stay up to date with appointments and see test results.,
"Really a zero star for zero Function - won't install. I've checked every setting, security feature, playstore settings, etc. Called for a new patient appointment at 11 a.m. roughly, now nearly 9 pm. app is still NOT installed. Just spins and ""waiting for download"". Completely useless to me. Advise to simply use website. Not as convenient but it is clearly functional and accessible. Wifi makes no difference and a setting adjustment on the device; they've all been applied in attempts. Note 9.",
Always useful. Wouldn't be without it. Very easy to use.,
Wish for a little better explanation on the things but quite happy with the application,
"Sorry, I thought this was a great idea initially. But I've now spent a month trying to get my doctor to respond. I need diabetic supplies and I get zero response here. If I ignore the app and call to the office, they were able to say 'oh I see you put in a message 7 days ago' what good is that to me. (edit) bump up a bit, not sure of the exact break in communication, but wish I had a 'read' option like texts. so I could say if app is failing, or just being ignored on the other end.",
Trouble everytime I switch organizations. Epic says contact hospital and vice versa.,
I think it is great to find all my chart records. I have had no problem finding information I need. For some reason lately it does NOT give notifications anymore when I have a provider message. Maybe an update? I like getting notifications. Hope it gets fixed with next update. Update: thank you for the response. It works great now. Update to 5 stars!,
"I'm trying to sign up, But I can't!!! I'm getting a ""You must answer the CAPCHA"" error message, and I already answer it thousands times!! And there is no support after 4pm to help 🙂",
My chart is awesome. Any of your care team you can get in touch with at any time and all of your appointments are there as well as any information on anything done.,
"This app needs major improvement. They need to fill a few ridiculous gaps that make it occasionally dysfunctional of an app. It can do lots of cool things and make your medical records and whatnot very convenient, but the app just stalls a lot, fails to load things, takes forever to update your test statuses what whatnotconsistently, and overall is just a very rocky experience.",
Some of it works. Sometimes the screen goes blank and you have to back out to get to where you need. Of course we are forced to use it,
Very helpful app and user friendly,
Frankly awful app. Glitches and inconsistent. 1) Have to log in more than once when I should be able to stay in. 2) Switching between organizations requires new log-in for each! Shouldn't I be IN with one log-in? 3) Can't do screenshot or select text to copy. Reason in error code message has to do with privacy. That IS NOT something that is in the HIPAA rules. I should be able to copy using my phone that I'm logged in to for purposes of communicating and keeping my own notes.,
"Constantly get ""unable to connect to server"" error message when trying to complete the ""E/check"" questionaire requested before each drs visit. Very frustrating 1-29-22 still getting ""an error has occurred"" in addition to ""unable to connect to server"" when trying to send a message, schedule an appt or look at test results. The app works sporadically but tech services have no advice other than to login thru my browser instead of the app.",
"I just love this app. It is easy to use and navigate through the site. You can schedule appointments as well as cancel them. You can also use e-check in and answer questionnaire to save time at your appointments. It also keeps all letters of referrals or any letters the doctor has written for you, such as clearance for elective surgeries that a letter is required. You can really do it all on this app, and see all documents in regards to your health-care. I 100% recommend this app.",
I absolutely love this app. It makes communication easy as well as scheduling & canceling my appointments convenient. I have sickle cell disease which is super painful & unpredictable. My hematologist has started using the medication feature. The pharmacy I go to notifies me when my scripts are put in & ready for pick up! I give the app a/an 5!+,
"The new app makes it hard to tell what news & messages are new vs. the read ones. The distinction between email, test results, etc., are bad once you get in the app to check for *only* new mail. You need to make a little envelope to help us focus on the newest mail, etc and an ""x"" or something once read. The bright colors and huge font makes it worse to get to the info we need right away. It really needs some QC & feedback all the time b/c each visit i find more problems",
"This app is very useful. I can see my test results and get reminders of yearly appointments I need to make without having to get on a computer. the best part used to be being able to make appointments from the phone. But lately, every time I try, an error occurs. The big pull seems to be broken.",
My chart is in my opinion next to my banking app one of the greatest app ever created it's one click information about all your latest test results request medication refills send your health team request etc etc .awesome app,
"I love this app, my Dr. gets back to me very quickly. I can order my medicine with ease, I can contact my Dr. with ease, absolutely love it.",
After newest update keeps crashing. S23 Ultra,
"It's super easy to use this app to schedule any appointments for my kids at both their primary doctor and with the texas children's hospital. It also keeps tract of when their appointments are so that I know when they are. Super easy to add a second child. It's also super easy to change your information (phone number, address, ect.)",
"Easy and convenient! I can send pictures of minor rashes and things I have questions about without having to make an appointment or go to urgent care. Having quick access to my kids' records for things like weight, height, and immunizations without having to sit on hold or driving by to pick up a hard copy has been a life saver! Also having all of information in one portal and being able to make appointments for all of us without holding on the phone forever is amazing! Will use this forever!",
"Can't return to previous screen or to main menu. Is this a problem in all android devices or just Pixel? Ok, update to prior comments. There is no navigation button at the bottom of the device on any screen in the app to return to the main men. And the gesture navigation works about 1 out of 5 swipes, only if you touch it close enough to the hidden arrow. So I guess it works, just not really well. I'm extremely grateful my hospital system has something like this nonetheless. 4 stars, not 3",
Nice way to keep track with medical needs!,
Everytime I try to login it gives me a hard time so I don't use it but I keep getting annoying notifications on my email 📨 😞 clutters up my email,
"Amazing, very helpful, and easy to use",
It's very limited in what it can do. I get messages from my doc telling me to log into the website to do to whatever it is they want. Messages has an attachment button but no one sees/receives them. Ifyou want to check lab values or appointments then it's okay. I can make an appointment but still need to talk to the office anyway. May as well call.,
"Very informative, easy to use app.",
Love being able to contact my providers at any time of the day or week and then they get back to me in a timely manner.,
Great app! Easy to use and very convenient,
"This rating is for the Android app, so I'll limit the comments to just the Android specific points. The web portal is well integrated. The Android app is one of a few apps which never concern me about security. I have never seen it do anything I recognized as insecure. It provides me with everything I need, plus a bit more. Even when using only cellular data, the app stays responsive.",
Great app helps track medical appointments and alot more,
"MyChart App works amazing well, especially if you already have some tech savvy to you. I could see were it might be a little difficult for someone who is new to the tech world though, as going from one page to another is not always a smooth process. But on the Pro side I have seen worse & I think MyChart does a really good job at giving you all the info you need, plus all the ability to interface with your medical people. It just takes a little getting use to, then you're off & running with.",
On a phone the print is extremely small. Entering your password is frustrating. I have had to re-enter mine at times 4 or 5 times. I have had to reset it a time or 2. The app is very useful. I wish results could be printed. After visit reports are not on MyChart. Would be nice to have that.,
Extremely easy way to get & share medical info!,
I really like having all of my information in one place. Having the ability to message my provider is so convenient. Most of the features are great but I tried to verify my phone number for a new provider and even though they had the correct number the text didn't come through with the verification number. I tried several times and still didn't work. The only reason I'm a bit concerned is because I have a video appointment on Monday and it's Friday so there's no way to get in touch with them,
"Paste is disabled on password fields, which negates my password manager. This means the app promotes weak passwords that I can easily manually type in.",
Simple and straight forward to use,
So helpful and truly easy to use.,
It's great getting test results so easily.,
"overall pretty good app except for bugs with logging in that never have been resolved. will randomly log u out then tell u your password is wrong even when it is right. then when u make a new one it gives errors like ""must be 8 to 20 characters"" when the one I put in was 10 characters. pretty sure that's in their range",
Excellent ap. Gives patient access to all of their personal medical information quickly and easily.,
"While there are elements of this app that are ok the UI is extremely cumbersome to use if you have many appointments and messages and you waste a lot of time. You should be able to swipe messages left or right to delete and archive. Too many taps to manage messages, appointments and the like. Needs to be simpler.",
"The 2 step verification is Awful. While my husband is in the hospital, I check my chart often. The two step is a real pain.",
I enjoy using it has everything I need to see and use right at my finger tips,
way too much useless repetative verbage. Nag notifications never stop even after clearing message. most messages won't clear. l,
Mychart is usually amazing however Mount Sinai is now pushing their own version which is not compatible with other organizations. There was nothing wrong with mychart that called for a change. And also the layout change now does not have the visits tab on the front page. Future/past visits should not be hidden in the drop down menu. It should be on the opening page or at least allow customization on the main menu.,
"Love the app easy to use, and it is very helpful.",
"Makes me feel like I have my medical care providers available 24 hrs per day. It is very reliable, and allows me to see everything for myself. I am able to see my progress over the time I needed care.",
"Very helpful. Useful for keeping track of appointments and viewing lab results. Helpful to be able to email my doctor to request medication refills and any other questions or concerns. Overall, very easy to use the app. I like the fact that I can call the help desk if I have any questions about the app. They actually answer the phone and are available to help if you're having problems with the app.",
"I like the app for keeping in touch with my doctor. But Under the to do tab, I wanted to use that feature to help track health issues such as pain. I also wanted to set medication reminders. I was able to set reminders but would have liked to put it under the medication tab in the to do list. There was no mechanism to do so. I was unable to track health issues. I feel like this area needs work on the app.",
"Wow. I really have to compliment the EPIC Corporation for this app! Smooth, intuitive, informative, and friendly UI. Has the many functionalities I need to review my health history with the clinic. What really impressed was the display of lab values which visually shows the normal range for each test. Keep up the good work App Team!",
As someone with severe social anxiety this helps me a ton everything with it has went smooth as butter and I've only ever even had to use the phone to call my Dr 1x when I was learning to use the app,
I'm so glad this app was made. I can check my appointments and see my tests results. I have no complaints at all. Thank you again.,
"Frequent user for family & appts. *Prior to this I would have always given this App 4 star. Not so much anymore. last 4 months anytime I try to send a message/request appointments from the doctors in app, the message disappears. They're not getting to the doctor's offices system & it's not showing in app. once you send it it disappears never to be seen again and nobody knows anything about it. Extremely frustrating. * A few other minor glitches but overall I like working with the app.",
It keeps me on track with things and allows me to connect my providers without calling the office. Its like a direct line to your doctor,
"Multiple crashes! I can check messages, but if I try to check my billing, eCheck in, almost everything else, the app crashes and closes. Luckily, I can sign into MyChart online. Of course, I thought the point of an app is that you don't have to go to the website. Please patch or update the app. It is currently not functioning on my Galaxy s10e.",
"It was my best app until 6/27 when I was forced to reset/change my password 😑. Why? But outside of that, I like MyChart 👍🏼.",
"Love this app, so easy to contact my providers.",
"It is very helpful, easy to use, very intuitive",
"Love it when it works! Half the time I can't get into the individual sections. It keeps saying something about server error try again later. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.",
"I'm a completely new user so these are just first impressions. App seems impressively well-designed & I look forward to its overall utility but holy hell, devs... if I'm picking a state/COUNTY then do *not* force me to scroll through 100+ [non-US] options!😵 Some sort of search bar or alphabetical shortcut should be incorporated, albeit idk how that would be achieved as is when they're drop-down menus; best to let them extract from zip or be basic text like city is imo. Also: DARK MODE please😓",
"The Android version of this app is horrible. I realize epic is a giant company, but instead of asking hospitals what should be in the app, have your pm staff spend a few days in the hospital trying to keep track of their care using the app. They will come out with a whole new attitude about how the app should look and feel. I also know that you want to have 1 interface that works for everyone, the result is a disaster. Everyone is saddled with an interface for for a 100 year old senial person.",
It's a one stop shop. Make appointments. Reorder prescriptions. And message the Doctor anytime and have a response within a reasonable time.,
Very informative about appointment scheduling and cancelation.,
Love this App. I can view my Healthcare with just a click.,
I love seeing my results of testing and remindings for appointments!,
Best health service portal and derivery I have ever come across.,
Great customer service. Have great doctors. But your hospital doesn't take Aetna Better health care plans any more so I had to leave,
I really like the my chart it's so convenient and you get your results before you see your doctor and don't have to be worried or in suspense wondering what is wrong with you,
Great place to keep track of everything medical.,
very simple to navigate and easy to use,
"This has been such help for me because I am always on the go. If any of my son's teachers need a result, I am able to show them, and I save Gas ! Thank You Alta-Med !",
"I love how easy it is to organize my family health records and bills. I like how I can jump to another hospital's Mychart, it is very convenient.",
"Easy to understand UI, great for scheduling, Test results, visit notes, visit summary, sending messages and plenty more.",
Mychart provides my medical information no matter where I happen to be. I can just bring up my medical information to any provider. Even if I don't remember the name of the medication that I'm on I can just bring up the app and there it is. It is wonderful,
Love EVERYTHING about it. Specially how it REMINDS YOU of upcoming appointments. And it gives you test results. Absolutely necessary 💯💯💯💯%%% HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,
Keeps freezing when pulling up messages. Haven't been able to send or read any for a while .,
Everything is so simple 😌 2 used n understand iam just learning how 2 use computers mychart great app,
Unable to change answers if you make a mistake. This caused a great deal of confusion and extra paperwork in an already confusing system,
Been using this app for several years to communicate and keep up with my medical stuff. It's easy to use and updates immediately . I highly recommend this application.,
Really helpful and informative very convenient.,
Quick and easy way to contact the office,
"I have been using MyChart for awhile now and it sure makes it easy for me to see all my doctors, appointments and labs needed! Thank you MyChart",
All the information was present for me to view. All the future and past visits were there for me to check anytime I wanted or needed to review my appointments.,
Have MyChart has been a great feature! Being able to message your doctor or look at recent visits or being updated on needed results has been excellent!,
For a person who is impatient this app helps get me my results quicker refills and scheduling piece of cake,
Most of the time works well and provides better doctor patients communication.,
Very user friendly and easy to maneuver.,
"It would be a 5, if I could get some help figuring out why I have been having difficulty reading letters and summaries!",
"I see that others are getting a blank screen after they log-in. I can't even get that far. The app gives me an error when I TRY to log in, so I cannot log-in at all. In a reply it sounded like it was an issue the developers of this app are having with Android. Might wanna prioritize addressing the problem because this is pretty unacceptable.",
"It is a fantabulous app for most of your medical needs, questions, scheduling app'ts and messaging your health care professionals. CCF is always finding ways to improve this app by refining existing formats & adding new features!",
Needs to be updated not showing latest test results.,
"Would be good if it worked. Trying to pay a bill, option doesn't work. Can't find account number info for bill. Put in payment info and app takes me back to first page. Send email for help, they say there are no problems, and send number to pay by phone.??? Why have the app? The ability to schedule appointment works occasionally. Would be great thing to have if it worked like it should. Customer service is no help.",
Easiest way to keep track of appointments and message doctors. Also links to the website so I can also use my computer and it is all the same,
"Awesome, this app helps you make appointments, get medicine refills, read the after appointment notes to keep you informed if you haven't installed it yet do it it's great",
"So convenient! I wish you could access letters and download them from the app, but other than that, I think it's a great app.",
I absolutely love this app! Add had a double transplant of the kidney and pancreas. I have so many doctors appointments that is hard to keep track. MyChart helps me keep track of every appointment. I also get to see my blood work often before the doctor does. The lab results goes into detail for those of us that did not go to college to become a nurse or a doctor. I am not going to lie but I am very dependent upon this app. Lol being a single mom I'm juggling all of our stuff is crazy.,
"Great app for communicating with your care team for planning visits, refilling prescriptions and especially as a repository for your health care history. Why a 4-star review: Since covid I have been getting vaccinations at my local CVS. The CVS vaccinations are not available to my health care provider even though I have both organizations in Mychart. So my healthcare provider keeps recommending vaccines such as for shingles or pneumonia for me even though I have gotten them from CVS.",
"Sometimes, this is a little difficult to work with. May be my misunderstanding of the electronic system. It does, however, give me an avenue to speak with my provider so I can get answers immediately at times. I get the opportunity to place refill of medication order when needed. Gives my provider an opportunity to speak to me and answer questions as well as ask them.",
Easy to view upcoming apps. And pre-register,
"Great, I love seeing all the red flags the doctors don't question! My chart works better than the doctors that put the information into it!",
I love this app it is very convenient to use and contact my PCP via messages and Labs for blood work and easy way to get your test results back also.,
"Since update can no longer view clinical notes and when I try to view images I now get an error message when I click on the link (takes me to a nilread site that doesnt work). Used to be awesome now its basically useless. No one can tell me who to contact or how to fix or what happened and Im extremely frustrated because having the ability to view notes and images was the only way I knew what was actually going on because most of the staff here are new, young, undertrained and clueless.",
Excellent app up to date app.real time services of appts.,
Wonderful and easy to use. Helps me remember things. It's great for making my appointments. I'm very happy that all my doctors belong to The Everett Clinic. I've been with them since moving here to Washington.,
"Well designed, ease of use... Love it.",
It isnt the best when medical staff fail to use the features provided in the app. If you sell an app. the medical team should be required to follow up with patients.,
I like the app. When I lose my papers this app helps with appointments,
"The message center, you should be able to send to any doctor you have, but you can't. Then you only have a few days to Rey or is grayed out. You send a message and no reply.",
Really easy to use and read,
Great app very useful n helps me with all my medical needs.,
Great for contacting medical without a lot of phone tag!!,
Great app if your service provider is useing it they choose wisely. It keeps you updated on your appointments and you can see your blood work test asap and much more. Overall it a great app. It great to have your medical information at your own fingertips. Great way to communicate with your medical staff. If you have a question you can message it to the doctor. My doctor responds fast which is cool. You can also set up appointments without the annoyance of having to call some automated service.,
Great app. Love referring to my results so I can discuss issues or questions with my doctor. The updates have been excellent.,
Great. Makes it so easy to get a hold of my Dr's and their teams.,
Very informative as well as helpful.,
"This is, by far, one of my favorite apps! Getting relevant information and the available opportunity to communicate with questions regarding my health is top notch!",
I truly had the best care in ICU! Everyone who came in from nurses to those doing testing was wonderful.,
I really like that you're not left wondering about your tests...and that you can access so much...,
Itseems thatheres noway to view past msgs/letters (fersumreasin they're 2diff formats but basikly conveying the same communications??) once they're read theyseemto disahpear & cai8nt be retrieved/reviewd later ifone whantsto be reminded of sumthg thatwuz containd inthem????,
"They would like you to go paperless on bills, but after 3 months app still not fixed so you can pay it. Did put out a message about 2 1/2 months after that they know it is not working, but still have not sent a paper bill during the down time. Good at tracking appointments, was easy for seeing test results, just would like them to fix the bugs.",
so easy to keep up with appts records and labs,
This app is good except where you're notified that you need to schedule an upcoming appointment - it doesn't tell you for what! It needs to tell you what it's in reference to.,
Pretty solid all around. And definately works amazingly well... provided the care you're receiving utilizes it. Hit a Home Run with the 'Proxy access' so I can help manage my partners complex medical care. Enabling it was fast and secure. The only thing I would like to see in the future is the ability enter records of my own from non-Epic medical office visits. Bonus points if you can enable any kind of basic document reading / rendering. The UI could stand to be a bit more modern too.,
Very informative & easy to use. I highly recommend it.,
Very easy to use and really convenient.,
Love love love this app! It makes it so easy in every aspect to know and get my medical history. The only small issue is that when you receive new notifications they seem to change location within the app. For example I received a new message from my Dr attached to a pathology report and after reading it it was moved from the front screen to appointme to and test results. Just a little confusing but all in all great app!,
"this app is pure Spyware...it actually tracks patients' movement everywhere. It has ability to automatically check you in when you walk into Dr office/clinic/group. The only way that happens is using tracking. Perhaps it's the phone pinging the location which is, again, Spyware tracking. What other uses will this ability be used for? This was bound to be used despite denial at release... bullcrap.",
"There are several convenient features to this app, however the annoyances overshadow those conveniences. I am continually asked to review my personal information. I do the review, nothing has changed, but the app keeps asking. Very annoying. Also I have successfully linked my My Chart account with CVSHealth, but every couple of months it unlinks and I have to re-link again.",
"It's a good app when it functions right, but I've been locked out of my account because of a bad password no less than 3 times now and I've had to change it (even though I was 100% positive I was entering the correct one) every time, and my account was not compromised. Further, I've had past issues that inexplicably KEPT me locked out of MyChart for upwards of 2 weeks at a time for reasons unknown, and said reasons were never made privy to me. I was simply ""able to login again"" one random day.",
"This app is riddled with bugs. I can no longer sign in with biometrics, it always gives a password error. I am also no longer able to modify a payment plan or pay for services through the app. I once found the app somewhat useful but it is buggy and broken now. I'm not confident that such a bug-ridden app should be trusted with personal health information.",
"This app has been invaluable to me. Recent health issues have resulted in many many hospital & office visits in the past year. MyChart has made every aspect of my associations with Providence accessible to me around the clock. Appointments entered directly into my calendar at the push of a button, test results, medical history, medications, and visit notes available for review, plus the ability to message my provider - MyChart provides all of this in a user-friendly, well designed format. Kudos!",
"This app has been great in handling all my family medical appointments and billing. Wish dentist, pathologist and smaller medical providers would use this.",
Easy app to look up your medical history records orders that is secure⚕️,
"Am happy I'm able to see all my test results, after summary notes etc on this app. Only bad thing is the Dr's that don't use it",
Have had great experience with the MyChart it great to have communication with my doctor and staff,
"I love the convenience of this App to manage my healthcare. The only complaint I have is; I'm not sure which it is, When my computer updates, or they do updates to the app my UN and PW isn't recognized. Not sure which it is. I do put a slip in with IT. My computer updated 2 days ago. But I could get on the app yesterday. Last night I could no longer access my information. I find it frustrating because it always seems to occur when there are results and/or a message from my PCP.",
The staff here is awesome!! Dr. Keller is my favorite. He always pays attention to you when your explaining what is wrong with you and ask all the right questions. The staff is great with keeping you informed about what's going on. The ladies in the Catscan room were very helpful with explaining the process and letting me know what to expect during my procedure. I will always come to this hospital for my medical care. Keep up the good work 👏,
My star rating reflects the fact that the MyChart app doesn't save FORMS that are completed during e-check-in. It takes about 30 mins to complete the check-in with forms. When I arrive at my appt. I'm checked in manually (another 10 min) The paper version of the form that I completed on line is then handed to me for completion. I've advised the staff of this issue several times and nothing has changed. I decided to enter a review after the same thing occurred for an upcoming appointment.,
"The app itself is ok I suppose. What I oppose to is when your appt. that you've been looking forward to gets canceled at the last minuet for no real obvious reason. I waited a good while for the appt. that's of extreme importance to me. Trying to get hold of an actual human being over the phone is almost unheard of these days. No one wants to interact with a man made machine. Pick up the phone ladies, there are actual people who really NEED the service.",
"Overall, a medium ranking...seems more convenient, but until every care provider adopts it, I find it dysfunctional. I have missed appts because My Chart only has partial info, and oftentimes, unhelpful because of lack of input. WHy can't my counseling appts be included? I have some unknown amt of loss of cognitive function...I don't need an array of specialized apps to do this, My Chart was built for this, I believe. Very dissappointed in it's overall performance. I just missed an appt, and thi",
"I'm very disappointed with how things have went with the app lately. There was recently a breach, preventing me from logging in. I had to start a completely new account, put in the verification code emailed to me only to have the app tell me it couldn't verify my information and a code would be sent by mail. This is ridiculous...",
"I like being able to see my health care plan along with medical record notes from each appointments. It is really convenient for making appointments or changing them as well. Very easy to manage and refill my prescriptions, sending and receiving messages back with easy access to my health care provider and team without having to call them. I can access my test results with detailed information. I also can pay my medical bills through this app with the option of making automatic monthly payment",
"Very good ... I Appreciate my info being organized and all in one place . The doctors have my info and now so do I and can refer back to it any time. My only complaint is the test results. I can't effectively read them nor do I understand the symbols along the margin of some of the results - especially the ! - in a circle that leads you to believe it needs immediate attention ,causing upset. There should be a page or call center for a quick explanation of how to interpret the symbols etc.on app.",
"This app is great, simple to navigate and receive my results fast. I receive notifications by email and text, which is great. I can access most of records. Only problem... wish you can see all past testing (not just the past year) to make comparisons to most current/recent test records.",
"Love this app. Appts, lab and test results, doctors visit comments which is nice as sometimes I forget some of what was discussed in the appointment.",
I love this app!!! I am in control of my medical appointments records and I can also review and message my doctor it's GREAT!!!!,
Works well to make appointments and get test results back really fast. Haven't had any issues.,
"Worst app on my phone. Difficult to use & navigate. I work in tech & have owned cell phone and internet companies. I do internet cabling and tech for international airports. I use apps, phones etc all day. This is the worst app I've been forced to use. Maybe the developers are looking to give a child-like experience? Idk, but the bubbles and transitions suck. This is medical. We need straightforward & concise. This app is anything but!!! Clean it up. Make it simple.",
The app provides useful and timely information to my health condition,
Very easy to use and informative,
This app is very convenient. It allows me to look at my doctor's notes and any other Dr office can see it too.,
"Great app that allows easy access to my past medical information, future appointments, and communication with my medical team.",
Having too much trouble con nnecting to umc for e-check in,
"This app makes it easy it easy to see up coming appts, refill rxs, schedul appts and check your test results.... When it's working. I've been having a lot of trouble with accessing my medication and checking my messages on the app for a few weeks now. Prior to this trouble the app was working perfectly and took a lot of the anxiety out of dealing with all of my drs, scheduling appts and refilling my rxs. I'm not sure what's changed... Maybe the latest update? Idk",
Very helpful tool to look at and manage my Healthcare,
It's a wonderful app You can do everything on you can cancel appointments on there you can do E-Check ins they let you know when your appointments are it's just a great app to have on your phone and you get your test results on here too which is really nice,
"It's nice to have access to your children's records all in one place, no papers to clutter at home. I really enjoy MyChart for my girls!",
"Why can't the items that need attention show up on the main screen so that if you have say two messages a number 2 would show on the main screen on the message icon, etc. I had two letters that I was not aware of them until just recently. For prescriptions and appointments my chart works great but it could stand some major changes to be easier to use.",
"Since the latest update receiving multiple ""server error"" messages. Have made several attempts to send refill requests to my doctor's office. All unsuccessful even though I receive a confirmation page. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Can not currently trust this app for anything. Update: April. No improvement, app or website. App uninstall. Back to the 90's and the telephone. Also, brand new phone in recent days. Android 11. Not the issue, or shouldn't be.",
"They bill you, but never say what the bill us for. they say you owe money, but never give a visit summary or treatment code for the bill. My bill came in nearly 6 months after my last visit with no explanation as to why I was getting billed. Also, paperless billing was turned on for my account. I never turned it on. I liked it better when they gave bill summaries, but this seems to have went away when U of M took over.",
My Chart is a great communication tool and is accessible for all my needs. Very consistent.,
"My chart keeps me up to date with all of my appointments and test results, scheduling and canceling if need be!! It's ALL here!!",
"Love everything about the app but the last few days we have been unable to log into both my and my husband's MyChart. Keep getting an error message that says ""we couldn't log you in right now, please try again later"". Our login name and password are correct on both accounts but for some reason the app is NOT working and it is VERY frustrating as we need to see the cancer marker test results!!! We have already sent an email to Epic MyChart Support regarding this issue.",
"It's great to be able to track my health, appointments, and medications.",
Information is there for you quickly. Scheduling is nice and effortless. Nice job!!!,
"I love being able to refill meds, ask my doctors questions and schedule my own basic appointments. As a disabled mother-of-three, MyChart helps me keep everybody's medical issues and medicinal needs at the tip of my fingers. I love how quick I can reach out to our doctors and get a response back. I absolutely hate sitting on the phone, most people have problems understanding me, my mouth spasms a lot and sometimes it's a lot easier for both me and the doctor / nurse with less confusion.",
The app is awesome in general with a lot of information and ability to communicate. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the checkin process. It is excruciatingly long and tedious answering/reviewing all the same info every time. Then walking inside and still needing to read and sign papers with the same info just verified in the app. My insurance and ID are also stored in the app but they still want to see the cards and make copies.,
I like being able to read my chart better than speaking to someone on the phone and I can go back and read past appointments.,
I love this app. Tou can see and do anything you need or want to do here!!! I love having access to my test results and being able to see the notes that the Soctors have written concerning your case.,
"It was an ok health app before, but now even trying to do something as simple as scheduling an appointment with my primary care physician is rediculously overcomplicated. Now, in order to schedule an appointment, I have to go to schedule, find the right location out of all hospitals in the system, pick a category, and then sort through all available appointments with all the professionals that work at that location. And my doctor usually STILL isn't in that list. Review edited due to response.",
"The app is good for looking at test results with the updated way it uses graphics. The app works ok for scripts that are good for an extended time. I do not find the app to align easily with scripts that change. My pharmacy goes out of it's way to help manage costs. It may be my phone, my lack of skill, and changes in gov rules but the app reduces my confidence in communicating with my physician's office. The office is well run. Like here, #of characters is limited. Attachments sometimes work",
Just wonderful ..very quick to update and plus all my information is right here at my fingertips..100%,
This is a good app to have because it lets you see test results and upcoming appointments,
It makes things convenient and easier.,
This is a very useful and well put together app. It is very easy to use. Makes the doctors visit so much easier. 👍👍👍,
"This is one of, if not the best app for medical appointments, test results, and all other aspects of managing my health!!!",
"I am happy with Mychart. Harrison Co. Hospital is affiliated with Norton's but test results, etc. are not showing up on Norton's MyChart page.",
"It has some useful features that aren't available when I access my chart directly thru UCLA online. But it doesn't give me the option of deleting or marking as completed old appointment reminders. Also, redundant lab results aren't available for viewing. But it's useful in that I can do video appointments with my doctor.",
"Love it the best way set appointment, talk to doctors, and not have to spend time talking to automated systems 😁 10/10",
"App is very annoying while trying to sign in. Asks for a PIN. Then asks for verification code sent via email. Doesn't come. You resend code, no code. You do it again. Three emails come with the same verification code. Code doesn't work. When you get to use the app, it's only good for checking on appointments. If you want to MAKE an appointment, they tell you to call. Then why is it an option? They made an app they don't care about apparently. UPDATE: Same thing happened today. Didn't receive a code for 15 minutes, then multiple codes came via email. None worked and now I'm locked out of my account. Worthless. Update: They can't unlock me. Ask your health care provider. They won't help anymore. Beyond worthless.",
"New version looks no better & still missing Dark mode. Many functions fail to load the information requested, instead returning a vague error that it failed. When they do work the app is very slow. Way too many functions still only supported via web browser making the app semi-useless. Don't release it until you've got it all working.",
"To many hoops to access it , should be able to delete after reading something and not have it pop back up",
Mix things a lot easier to get a hold of your doctor and get messages across and interact without making a million phone calls definitely useful for me,
Awesome app. I know test results and appointments before they do most the time. Very useful and efficient.,
Very easy to keep up with appointments,
"It's fine, but a lot of the features don't work. For example, I can enter all of my payment information to pay a bill, but there's no button or way to submit the payment. There's just a ""Back"" and ""Cancel"" button. Very irritating. Not to mention the other features that take you to the website, just to turn around and say that the feature isn't available right now, and to logout and try again. It's honestly just a half-assed app that's been poorly put together.",
Terrible unable to log in and no response,
Extremely glitchy. Signed up and access the application successfully once. Since then it has not worked. Nor does it interface with the applications of other medical networks like it is supposed to. Other networks show that it cannot connect to the server for this app. Really irritating since I need to verify information for an upcoming Hospital procedure.,
"Fairly happy with it; some rough edges: 1. No message drafts and can't see what I'm replying to. 15 min writing reply, pop out to re-read the message or test result, poof! Gone. 2. Getting a reminder for the flu vaccine from one provider after I got the shot at at another. Edit: 3. Stuck in ""500 - Internal Server Error"" on trying to fill out a pre-visit questionnaire. Seems to have cleared itself. 4. The ""logout"" button looks like a ""send message"" button, and dumps the message you were writing.",
"This app is very helpful, especially during hospital stays.",
For several weeks I have been informed that my account is disabled. I have tried resetting my password but without success. I have not changed my user name and password because it was automatically saved on my PC and I am sure it is correct. It has been the same since I joined MyChart. I would greatly appreciate feedback from whoever is responsible for sorting out these glitches. I'm awaiting news of the results of various scans and blood tests as well as news of my next appointment.,
It's a lot easier to get in touch with the my doctor and make appointments,
It is a lot easier to request refills on your medication. You also get a quick response if you have questions for your physician or about your medication. You can also see when your next appointment is and what your test results are.,
"Fair app. It would be much better and much more useful if we could select our insurance companies from a drop-down box. For example, I have two insurance companies and every time I use one, when I go somewhere else that doesn't accept it but they accept the other, it defaults to the last one selected and there is no way to change it. Therefore, this app has become useless because I can no longer check in or pay because it is defaulted to the wrong insurance company. Please fix this ASAP!",
Really enjoy this app even a trip to er shows everything they didn't tell me,
I personally very much so like this app for the fact that it's a for sure way that you can for sure know that your doctors team is getting your messages compared to actually having to call the office or clinic and someone else takes your messages and info but you never hear back from the doctor and they say that they didn't get the message that the person must've got busy and forgot to give it to the team . Although I don't like the part about how the labs or diagnosis are put in here but there',
like the app but has a big problem once something is entered to it you can't get it changed have made numerous calls and inquiries all to no help.,
"Unfortunately, I'm dealing with several health issues that require me to see several physicians. Using MyChart allows me to easily add appointments to my Google calendar. It also gives easy access to records, test results, and a easy way to communicate with my providers. MyChart is probably the most used app on my phone, I would be lost without this truly useful app. Bill Nolan",
"It is very convenient for me to be able to message questions to my Dr rather call and wait for a call back, I believe it saves time for the practitioner also",
"I love this app, all your information from multiple medical facilities in one place. I will say it is 100% the best of all apps.",
"I find this app very useful for checking appointment dates, lab scheduling and results, and for messagjng my physicians with brief questions that do not require a visit.",
"The my chart app is so convenient and easy to use and understand. I can Make my appointments in the app, email the Dr. Get my test results. I can update it anytime I have to. I'm having surgery this month and I already have everything scheduled in my chart. The directions and all. This app is the best thing to have. It also saves me time on everything. I love it",
They are always very kind and always have my medications. They also helped me with my vacation medications. I recommend them to anyone!!,
"Top app for organizing life. No matter if you are healthy and rarely see a physician or if you are getting daily treatments. This will help you stay organized and less stressed. Create appointments, go to video visits and refill meds all from here. My favorite part is it will send appointments over to Google calendar. I just wish it would sync all appointments, instead of me telling it to do each one. Maybe update that....",
I love my chart. Very easy to navigate.,
"Easy, comprehensive & detailed.",
"This is such a great app. It's easy to navigate and track everything! Even my entire family, which is very helpful. I can go back years and clearly see the doctors I saw, what tests I took and the results. I can locate tests results hours after getting my blood drawn. Haven't used a better system really!",
I do not prefer the new dashboard/homepage setup. My brain doesn't want to recognize all the circles and weird design format. I don't want pretty and artistic from my medical provider. I want easy access and lists I can choose dropdowns to get what I need fast. Still grateful for the access and the idea but not a fan of the updated version. Meh.,
The care I received was excellent! Outstanding physician and Dr Cardoza-Kellog was thorough and very professional!,
"This app would be great if only messages were actually accessible consistently. I'm notified of new messages but every time I log in to the app it's always a toss up whether or not the messages center is even visible from the menu. The inconsistency is the strangest part of this bug, and it seemed to have only started when my provider released their own app that supposedly links to my MyChart info, so this may be an issue caused by my provider and not the app itself.",
"Very, very simple to use. All of my Dr's name and info is readily accesible with pictures of each individual. The appointments part is equally helpful. The time, date, location and with cleveland clinic at least the desk location. Making appointments and prescription drug reordering couldn't get much easier. Also, not only upcoming appointments but it's very easy to look at past ones also. This is a very handy and as mentioned easy, convienent, and available anytime that I want to obtain info.",
MyChart is a Great App. to communicate with your medical professionals.,
Modern app for the modern day patient. Just the fact that it's so easy to pull up on my phone and check/send messages to any of my health care providers. Or check where and when that schedule was supposed to be. I get notifications whenever a test result is submitted so I can literally pull up the app anytime. I love it.,
I would like to be able to update my own information such as testing completed instead of receiving numerous texts and emails as reminders,
"I like the app, but I find difficulty with it. There a 4 on my app, I don't know why, and my ent cannot see my results",
"I guess things were going great for a while, so I guess they decided they didnt need to keep the developer on payroll. App takes forever to login, that is when it feels like it, then it either cant connect to the server or loads so slow it times out the connection. Not to mention there's the cancerous method of resetting your password that should be revamped up from the mid 90's method.",
"I absolutely love this app. It's so easy to use and keep up with my all my doctors appointments, my medications, and being able to send messages.",
SIMPLE - EASY - SECURE I saw one guy say he had to completely close the app and restart because he couldn't back out of anything so was forced to restart to go back. Well that really made me hesitant about downloading the app but figured I could always delete. Come to find out that's not the case. Not sure if he has a really old phone or isn't use to using the back button but you can totally go back to previous page without closing the app and starting over. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,
"Every time there is a new message or a new lab result, all the lab results are listed as new. Online on my PC, every message which links to a lab result is marked in bold as unread. I open them and read them, then with the next email notification, all the previously read messages are in bold and unread, even though I already looked at them. On the app there is no differentiation between read and unread lab results. The message icon shows a number and I have to open every msg to erase the numbe",
"I can't think of anything that could be more complex than trying to manage patient records, appointments and interactions with my doctor and his staff, since these activities can include documenting so many different bodily processes, maladies, treatment options, tests, etc., etc. The creators of this app have somehow eliminated the complexity of all this and made an intuitive, easy to use, yet detailed and comprehensive tool! That is a stunning achievement! Well done, developers!",
"I love that you can get any information like test results, etc, a lot faster than waiting for the doctor's office to get a hold of you.",
"The app changed and now I am unable to see my upcoming appointments a month ahead. I had to call the doctor's office for dates and times. I can only see 2 weeks ahead which is very unhelpful. I used this app to keep track of all the families appointments, but now I am going to have to go back to inputting the manually into my google calendar app. Also I wish there was an option to export appointments into your preferred calendar app. It would make keeping track of all appointments easier.",
It works for the most part except when using a VPN then it kicks me off at every button press.,
"Excellent service , so simple to use",
There only one thing rong has far as I am concerned with this app you can't stop unwanted items from sowing up like the one tell you you need some shot (shots) I don't get vaccinated for the Corona19 booster's aka(CCP virus) Flu ect.......... other than that I really like this app,
I absolutely love this app! I have a lot of medical issues and this allows me to keep all of my information in one place. Being able to communicate with my doctor's without having to leave messages at the front desk is a godsend! I can pull up anything I need at anytime I want and can add my appointments to my calendar with one click. The convenience is amazing!,
"Love being able to access my medical info so quickly. I also love the after visit summaries, sometimes you can't quite remember what the doctor said or remember the medical term as it was explained. So it's nice to be able to reference that when we need to and the appointments being on my chart. You can also personalize how you want reminders either by text or email. It is the perfect back-up and support system to our busy lives. 5 stars from me!",
"""Your contact information and notification preferences need review..."" This refuses to go away. I've hit update then closed it again multiple times. There is no button to confirm my info, just a close button and a few edit buttons. ------- items that cannot be launched within the app should at least have a description of what they are, rather than simply directing the user to an external browser, for example sharing->Lucy, growth charts, advance directive.",
This app sucks! Worst app ever. Be warned that if you as a parent have an account then there is no way to get access to your kids account. They say its easy it is not!,
It's great having access to your medical records and all of your doctors and prescriptions via this app. I highly recommend.,
Awesome app minus android swip left to right to get back neck page only iPhone has the back space 🔑 Epic please fix the no black space on test results 😀 and couple of other pages.,
Best thing is I get a response from my Dr.'s office so much faster than calling! But quick access to a list of my meds and test results is super nice as well.,
Very helpful sometimes even better than calling to get meds refilled,
My mother is 80 With dementia and I am 48 AND HER SOLE CARE TAKER Can't recommend THIS APP strong enough My chart Has put her care right in the palm of my hand Literally Test results medicine upcoming visits All of it is SUPER EASY TO FIND AND REMEMBER solely due to this app I'D BE LOST WITHOUT IT It's a blessing DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE,
This app is extremely helpful in keeping all your medical info in one location. Easy to navigate.,
"Don't know if it's the app or the technologically incompetent staff at my hospital, but if you're going to implement an option to pay your bill through this app, make it work. Edit: Got a response from the app developer, which is rare and much appreciated. However, if the hospital determines that it doesn't want to allow payment options through your app, then disappear the pay button and any other payment related tabs, etc. Too easy.",
Amazing! Easy to keep up with appointments test results visits what I'm due and more! So easy for me to deal with!,
Looking at test results is horrible. Last telehealth visit was unsuccessful. Never had these issues before. There needs to be an update to correct these issues. The latest issue was log in not accepting my password when it was correct. Had to use PC to fix it. App not working well on my tablet anymore. I mainly use this to speak to my specialist via telehealth. Keeps me from driving all the was to KU.,
"What would really impove your app would be to have an option to see your historical data. Say I want to see my hemoglobin levels from the past year to view trends. I have to go into each and every lab labeled ""Chemistry"" (and most of them are labeled that generically) to find my numbers. Mayo Clinics app provides a clickable link to see a chart of your trends. So much easier and user friendly.",
Cannot see son's invoices. He is 13. I've been calling back and forth with healthcare provider and it seems to be a programming issue with mychart. Keeps asking me to verify phone,
"Love this app. Easy to use and maneuver so you can see all appointments, results and even schedule new apps.",
It's perfect because I can see all my appointments all my test results and even messages from the doctor it's just what we need to keep up with everything.,
"My Dr. Kenny Hawk is the best NP there. Taylor Shahan is a wonderful nursing asset. Both so kind, caring and polite. However, GMG has changed and not for the better since Ruby took over. It's no longer the small home town feel and most are vwey rude. Your just a number to Ruby.",
"Love this app and all of it's features. It's great to keep organized, the appointment reminders are a huge help as well! I can't emphasize enough what a great help it's been having all my doctors appointments, updated list of medications and dosing instructions, blood work, test results(ie. MRI, CT scans, echocardiograms, X-rays etc), as well as any doctors notes, you can read all notes the doctor or nurse may have made in regards to your visit/after visit summery.",
"The app does not provide you with any type of search capability, nor does it allow you to go back to a main menu or to the main screen you're stuck on whatever screen you end up on which is extremely frustrating. This really should be fixed because I at this point am about to delete it from my phone",
"My Chart is Amazing! Highly Recommended This! Makes everything easy to organize and follow up on. I love being able to communicate with my health team at the touch of a button! Scheduling appointments online is so helpful and staying in step with lab results is comforting. Super helpful app, I recommend everyone to use it.",
Extremely useful in documenting and keeping up with my medical care. It is also invaluable in keeping in contact with my providers. Very convenient and looking up results of tests that have been run. These results remain available to consider for review whenever necessary.,
"Downloaded app today. Tried to look at my information. Lots of Tiff files. They disappeared when I went to save them. Multiple times. Did some research. Turns out Tiff files are big picture files used by book publishers. Probably too big for my Android phone's memory. What use is an app that I can't use to look up my information? Disappointed, I uninstalled the app. Will try to use the internet browser to access my information instead of the app.",
My chart is great. It has all my appt doctors and results. You don't have to wait for a phone call from them. You just check your chart. You can leave them messages also. I gave a 4 stars. Nothing is perfect One flaw... when the doctor is messaging you with results of findings blood work etc. They need to explain it In English so we can understand it. I love having my chart..,
"I love being able to see test results as they are posted. Also, the ability to see all my appointments helps me to be to all of my appointments on time. There are other parts of my chart that are very helpful, especially being able to cancel appointments or leave the dr. a message.",
"I love it. I live about 45 minutes away from both Tennessee & Kentucky. So to be able to do most of what I need to, even visits, is a god send. UVA did a Deep Brain Stimulation surgery on me for a neurological disorder I have, so traveling there every 6 months was taxing & I'd always looks worse than I would have otherwise. I could find another doctor, but a good one is hard to find. So when I find a good one, I hold onto them as long as I can. Lol. I've never had any problems with the app.",
Best medical patient portal ! User friendly easy to navigate. Easy to understand.,
"This has been a wonderful app for keeping all my medical records, Dr's, appointments, referrals, and more within just a few clicks away for me to quickly access. I really do use it constantly. It notifies schedules, re-schedules, and cancels appointments in real time, too. 5/5 stars!",
"App generally works well, allows you to access your medical info, and even message your providers. My only complaint is that the bill paying feature never seems to work. I always have to call the clinic's billing dept and pay over the phone.",
"It's incredibly difficult to adhere to, and at times very repetitive and excruciatingly harassing. It's a good idea in theory, but in reality very impractical, especially since it is now a requirement to either use the app or just don't go to the doctor, that's your two options. It would be helpful if you could be allowed to type in more than 500 words on the review, but. Apparently they don't want to know 🙂 how about that.",
"Y'all need to update and fix the delay and delivery issues. I just now got messages. Also, log in issues with second sign in security feature has a major lagging problem. Updates are a constant and need to be resolved immediately, or it rendered your app useless.",
"So easy to use once it is set up. It's a bit difficult to actually get it set up if you have more than one person on the account. But once you have them on there, everything's under one app and it's easy to switch from person to person or just message directly to your provider.",
"This app seems to be filled with bugs and errors. It seems more likely than not that it will fail when I try to use it. At the moment, I received an email telling me that the provider has sent a message in the app. But when I try to check messages, it says there is an error and try again later. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a choice of apps.",
"This app is easy to use. I love sending and receiving messages from my doctors. If I have a question, I can send it at any hour. When they get to the office, it will be waiti g on them. I don't have to worry about missing a phone call. Also, I can view my test results or look up notes from a previous visit. I have never seen an ad in the app.",
Love MyChart! Having access to my medical test results in a quick turnaround time is very useful. Having accèss to the calendar of upcoming medical appointments helps alot as well. The app is intuitive and easy to use. Overall love it.,
"This is a unicorn; competence boardering on mythical. The app works. It gives me access to important information virtually at the same speed it is processed at the hospital. Easy and effective interface, no excessive security, timely with push notifications... honestly it is remarkable. My only comment is the initial screen of selecting health networks was confusing. Frankly I'm shocked this quality of tool is being used in the Ontario Health Care system! :-)",
it works pretty good for test results and some appointment reminders. but I can't seem to get any of the other features to on the app to work. and I can't get the app to sync even with itself,
"Haven't had any issues with the app, it is quite comprehensive in detail as well as user friendliness. Presumably, any issues run into are related to the age of my device, and available connection.",
"The system is very restrictive, making it difficult to move between pages. You can't message a Physician on MC unless you have already been seen by them. That makes setting appointments difficult. The system must not interact with the epic patient system, as you must complete copious redundant questionnaires everytime you set a new appointment.",
"I Like being able to see my test results in real time, even before seeing my doctor. It helps me with learning what they mean by researching on the internet. Doctors don't always have time to go over all my test results. I've learned a lot by researching what certain tests mean. Moreover, it allows me to understand & engage with my doctor in a more proactive, productive, efficient way. It helps me take more control over my total well-being.",
"I was depending on this app to help me keep up with appointments and communication with my medical team. However, the app now will not let me access my information without setting up 2-step verification, which is a terrible idea and NOT secure for someone who is affected by mental illness, economic hardship and tech access instability. I don't have enough characters to explain all the ways I've already been locked out of 2-step verification on other apps unable to access a code every login...",
"This app is so wonderful & helpful in soooo many ways! I love being able to look at the test results as soon as they're in & the Dr's notes make the patient/ doctor relationship a little more personal and easier to understand. The learning library is awesome as it gives you links to definitions and explanations to some of those ""Big Dr. Words"" that only they could pronounce/ comprehend! E-checkin is probably the 2nd best thing I love abt this app! No lines, No hassle! I'd give 6 stars if I could",
"It definitely comes in handy, it would just be nice if every provider used the same app, because I am missing huge gaps with my Neurology, and I don't know how to go about accessing all that information since it's across three states. But it's very nice to connect with your physician and get answers generally the same day you submit them.",
"Excellent for those who frequent OSF Hospitals and have Doctors within OSF. You can do all sorts of things now in the app that used to be a pain to do otherwise. You can message your doctor, request refills, and see all sorts of valuable information. The only thing I wish is that you could take screenshots in the app because that would super handy, but I understand it's a security issue. 5/5 Edit: Actually it turns out you can enable screenshots in the settings",
"Simple and easy to understand. Access all of your needed resources in one place, and you can communicate with your doctor(s) through messaging, or are able to schedule an/your appointments. I highly recommend using this app for your medical needs :)",
"Extremely dependable,I really like how quickly the nurses get back to you with your answers! I'm able to print my doctor excuses and whatever else I have on there. There are so many options on there. I would recommend this in a heartbeat!!! It is very useful if your if your taking care of your family and having permission to go on their my chart to see their medications to determine what to give them. Thanks for making things alot easier and more understandable.",
"This app is very, helpful and resourceful, easy to manage and use. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be able to use this app; and learning the ins and outs of it. Thank you sincerely, Jose Brown",
"Very easy to use, an excellent tool to keep your Heath in check. Ideal quick access.",
Hard to read results every time.,
"The unified experience is awesome! I can now link my portal accounts from multiple hospitals across the country, and see my past appointment and test histories all in one place. Now all it needs is graphing for labs, and a gernic ""health journal"" option for things like migraine and sleep tracking. (Custom flowsheets just don't cut it)",
My Chart works great... Especially when I'm up to speed on using it. It keeps getting better!,
Edited to add: At no point in my review did I say I got a new phone or redownload the app. Nothing has changed on my end. Developer response unhelpful and assumes user error. I have set biometric login back up but that was not the point. -- Went to log in and biometric login no longer available. Why just remove the login I've been using for so long with no warning? Needed information quickly but have to reset everything. Very frustrating.,
I like being able to ask a question and get an answer back without phone calls. Takes a lot less time to receive a response back. I give this app 5 stars,
Easy to use and convenient..,
Outstanding app for all communications.,
"It has NEVER been easier to request refills, see lab results, see or schedule upcoming appointments, message the doctor and actually get a reply within a day (guess that's doctor depending tho.) Interface is easy to use and intuitive; it makes me extremely happy that my main doctor/hospital offer this service. My psychiatrist uses a different app and while it works okay, nothing like MyChart!",
Great Application. You can see all your appointments and test results here. Also their all easy to understand.,
"Not the best, server error is all I get. Not able to read letters sent or even leave a message for my health care provider.",
Great way to view all your medical in one place from site to site! Love it! Easy to use! Perfect for my medical needs!,
Scheduling for med refills is easy; but i can't seem to be able to schedule a routine office visit in person or online.,
It really helps to be able to send your doctors team a message and you can get a lot of answers from a well kept chart. I have logged into a different chart system at another doctors office and struggled to send a message or use the program. I had to call and wait a long time to get a simple answer. This chart system is much easier in functionality.,
Most times doesn't work. Always error message.... it is convenient and good idea but poor execution,
"The app worked for me 2 weeks ago, now I receive a message that a newer version is available, but there is not. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall app, but it made no difference. Cannot access at all. Last update shows as Dec 13, 2016. Also shows as incompatible with my older Samsung tablet when previously it was.",
"How does one switch between provider networks? I have providers in two different systems that both use your backend. The websites allowed me to link the accounts, but the app can't seem to find the other account, and won't access the other system to log in after logging out of the app. Yet, both send me to the exact same Google Play entry. I'm not going to clear data every time I need to check things on both systems. You know my data, show it to me!",
"I have several Doctors and a few different apps for these doctorsn,. My Chart is by far the most informative and easy-to use",
"I feel like there are so many potentially good features and options in the app, but it seems as though most of them don't work! It's great that you can show me all the types of medical appointments I am overdue for, but no way to make said appointments. Seems like a waste. Tons of options, few that are helpful.",
"Love using this app, I communicate with my Dr's and see all my appointments",
"MyChart is super convenient, and you know results before your Dr even gets the chance to call and talk over them. I enjoy this app alot.",
You need to stop changing the app. It is very hard on people who have visual problem is when you no longer marked the area where there is new information. It's hard to find the newest things added to a chart.,
"Simple to use if one takes their time. Easy installation off app helps when going for doctors visits and get medication filled. Keeping track of my health and understanding what is going on with my health is great when using this app. Every doctor I visit, clinic, or hospital has my medical information that I can provide just by logging in and sharing.",
Love this app. Easy to use and communicate with doctor.,
Great reminder and good for receiving info about your health,
MyChart is awesome. It keeps me informed of my appts and gives me results of tests etc. Thank you so much for my access to this app. I check it often. Janice Taft,
"While this app has worked well in the past, now that I have providers at both UW and GHC, many times the app does not sync with the GHC. I count on this information to be available so I can keep in touch with my providers, appointments and meds. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that it often times does not sync up. This happens with the MyChart website as well. I've been told by Devs that GHC has a separate app. No, they do not. It's all in MyChart. Please fix these reoccurring issues.",
Excellent! It makes it very easy to stay up to date with appointments and see test results.,
"Really a zero star for zero Function - won't install. I've checked every setting, security feature, playstore settings, etc. Called for a new patient appointment at 11 a.m. roughly, now nearly 9 pm. app is still NOT installed. Just spins and ""waiting for download"". Completely useless to me. Advise to simply use website. Not as convenient but it is clearly functional and accessible. Wifi makes no difference and a setting adjustment on the device; they've all been applied in attempts. Note 9.",
Always useful. Wouldn't be without it. Very easy to use.,
Wish for a little better explanation on the things but quite happy with the application,
"Sorry, I thought this was a great idea initially. But I've now spent a month trying to get my doctor to respond. I need diabetic supplies and I get zero response here. If I ignore the app and call to the office, they were able to say 'oh I see you put in a message 7 days ago' what good is that to me. (edit) bump up a bit, not sure of the exact break in communication, but wish I had a 'read' option like texts. so I could say if app is failing, or just being ignored on the other end.",
Trouble everytime I switch organizations. Epic says contact hospital and vice versa.,
I think it is great to find all my chart records. I have had no problem finding information I need. For some reason lately it does NOT give notifications anymore when I have a provider message. Maybe an update? I like getting notifications. Hope it gets fixed with next update. Update: thank you for the response. It works great now. Update to 5 stars!,
"I'm trying to sign up, But I can't!!! I'm getting a ""You must answer the CAPCHA"" error message, and I already answer it thousands times!! And there is no support after 4pm to help 🙂",
My chart is awesome. Any of your care team you can get in touch with at any time and all of your appointments are there as well as any information on anything done.,
"This app needs major improvement. They need to fill a few ridiculous gaps that make it occasionally dysfunctional of an app. It can do lots of cool things and make your medical records and whatnot very convenient, but the app just stalls a lot, fails to load things, takes forever to update your test statuses what whatnotconsistently, and overall is just a very rocky experience.",
Some of it works. Sometimes the screen goes blank and you have to back out to get to where you need. Of course we are forced to use it,
Very helpful app and user friendly,
Frankly awful app. Glitches and inconsistent. 1) Have to log in more than once when I should be able to stay in. 2) Switching between organizations requires new log-in for each! Shouldn't I be IN with one log-in? 3) Can't do screenshot or select text to copy. Reason in error code message has to do with privacy. That IS NOT something that is in the HIPAA rules. I should be able to copy using my phone that I'm logged in to for purposes of communicating and keeping my own notes.,
"Constantly get ""unable to connect to server"" error message when trying to complete the ""E/check"" questionaire requested before each drs visit. Very frustrating 1-29-22 still getting ""an error has occurred"" in addition to ""unable to connect to server"" when trying to send a message, schedule an appt or look at test results. The app works sporadically but tech services have no advice other than to login thru my browser instead of the app.",
"I just love this app. It is easy to use and navigate through the site. You can schedule appointments as well as cancel them. You can also use e-check in and answer questionnaire to save time at your appointments. It also keeps all letters of referrals or any letters the doctor has written for you, such as clearance for elective surgeries that a letter is required. You can really do it all on this app, and see all documents in regards to your health-care. I 100% recommend this app.",
I absolutely love this app. It makes communication easy as well as scheduling & canceling my appointments convenient. I have sickle cell disease which is super painful & unpredictable. My hematologist has started using the medication feature. The pharmacy I go to notifies me when my scripts are put in & ready for pick up! I give the app a/an 5!+,
"The new app makes it hard to tell what news & messages are new vs. the read ones. The distinction between email, test results, etc., are bad once you get in the app to check for *only* new mail. You need to make a little envelope to help us focus on the newest mail, etc and an ""x"" or something once read. The bright colors and huge font makes it worse to get to the info we need right away. It really needs some QC & feedback all the time b/c each visit i find more problems",
"This app is very useful. I can see my test results and get reminders of yearly appointments I need to make without having to get on a computer. the best part used to be being able to make appointments from the phone. But lately, every time I try, an error occurs. The big pull seems to be broken.",
My chart is in my opinion next to my banking app one of the greatest app ever created it's one click information about all your latest test results request medication refills send your health team request etc etc .awesome app,
"I love this app, my Dr. gets back to me very quickly. I can order my medicine with ease, I can contact my Dr. with ease, absolutely love it.",
After newest update keeps crashing. S23 Ultra,
"It's super easy to use this app to schedule any appointments for my kids at both their primary doctor and with the texas children's hospital. It also keeps tract of when their appointments are so that I know when they are. Super easy to add a second child. It's also super easy to change your information (phone number, address, ect.)",
"Easy and convenient! I can send pictures of minor rashes and things I have questions about without having to make an appointment or go to urgent care. Having quick access to my kids' records for things like weight, height, and immunizations without having to sit on hold or driving by to pick up a hard copy has been a life saver! Also having all of information in one portal and being able to make appointments for all of us without holding on the phone forever is amazing! Will use this forever!",
"Can't return to previous screen or to main menu. Is this a problem in all android devices or just Pixel? Ok, update to prior comments. There is no navigation button at the bottom of the device on any screen in the app to return to the main men. And the gesture navigation works about 1 out of 5 swipes, only if you touch it close enough to the hidden arrow. So I guess it works, just not really well. I'm extremely grateful my hospital system has something like this nonetheless. 4 stars, not 3",
Nice way to keep track with medical needs!,
Everytime I try to login it gives me a hard time so I don't use it but I keep getting annoying notifications on my email 📨 😞 clutters up my email,
"Amazing, very helpful, and easy to use",
It's very limited in what it can do. I get messages from my doc telling me to log into the website to do to whatever it is they want. Messages has an attachment button but no one sees/receives them. Ifyou want to check lab values or appointments then it's okay. I can make an appointment but still need to talk to the office anyway. May as well call.,
"Very informative, easy to use app.",
Love being able to contact my providers at any time of the day or week and then they get back to me in a timely manner.,
Great app! Easy to use and very convenient,
"This rating is for the Android app, so I'll limit the comments to just the Android specific points. The web portal is well integrated. The Android app is one of a few apps which never concern me about security. I have never seen it do anything I recognized as insecure. It provides me with everything I need, plus a bit more. Even when using only cellular data, the app stays responsive.",
Great app helps track medical appointments and alot more,
"MyChart App works amazing well, especially if you already have some tech savvy to you. I could see were it might be a little difficult for someone who is new to the tech world though, as going from one page to another is not always a smooth process. But on the Pro side I have seen worse & I think MyChart does a really good job at giving you all the info you need, plus all the ability to interface with your medical people. It just takes a little getting use to, then you're off & running with.",
On a phone the print is extremely small. Entering your password is frustrating. I have had to re-enter mine at times 4 or 5 times. I have had to reset it a time or 2. The app is very useful. I wish results could be printed. After visit reports are not on MyChart. Would be nice to have that.,
Extremely easy way to get & share medical info!,
I really like having all of my information in one place. Having the ability to message my provider is so convenient. Most of the features are great but I tried to verify my phone number for a new provider and even though they had the correct number the text didn't come through with the verification number. I tried several times and still didn't work. The only reason I'm a bit concerned is because I have a video appointment on Monday and it's Friday so there's no way to get in touch with them,
"Paste is disabled on password fields, which negates my password manager. This means the app promotes weak passwords that I can easily manually type in.",
