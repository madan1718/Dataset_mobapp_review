Review Text,Category
"Mostly good. The lessons are digestible and mostly straight forward, but the speaker tends to not explain certain things (often simple things I admittedly should know.) Sometimes I get frustrated getting questions wrong and ask for hints only to find that I was marked wrong even though I got the answer right verbatim to the hint. If not for these flaws it would be perfect!",
"I like learning about the different kinds of math and science, and was sad to lack convenient resources after graduating. Khan Academy helps me keep learning. I can brush up on what I already understand, and move into stronger subjects as I build on what I know. I can go back whenever I feel I have the time, and there's no deadlines or expectations I have to meet. It's free education at my own pace! All the people behind this resource are amazing for making it accessible and easy to understand!",
"For people with OCD or for perfectionists, this app is very frustrating. Unit tests should not make your score go down in previous topics. It's bothersome to do the work all over again for a tiny mistake. It would be better if you did corrections to your answer and recieve half credit as you would do in school. Just a tip to be more inclusive to people who struggle with these things 🤗. Otherwise, great app. Learning is fairly easy and there's no homework so it's a win!",
"It's great. I am using it to brush up on Grammer for my field of work but I found much more. Upon exploration, I found useful learning concepts for both my children and myself in mathematics, history, science, arts and humanities. After going through a few videos, I see that they focus on multiple learning styles. Each video has traits of visual, read/wright, and auditory. After the video, they provide quizzes for hands on. It's an amazing resource for anyone wanting to learn.",
"For the platform itself, 11/10. The fact that such an amazing website exists that is completely free with no subscription ever, is absolutely incredible. For the app, I find it somewhat difficult to find and access profile settings but that's probably on me, and I kind of prefer the previous app layout. I love being able to learn subjects I would otherwise never have access to, and I would love to see language courses incorporated eventually! Great job all around. Have been using for years!",
"So far so good. Brushing up and refreshing my memory on topics I studied when I was younger. One thing I like is the game aspect of it. You get rewarded when completing the lessons. One thing I would like for you guys to add is a green check mark on the course icon when a course is 100% complete. On the app, if you look at the course list, there's no indicator on which you completed. Example, I'm going to do all math, from early/kid to high school. I'd like to see the grade levels checked off.",
"I like it, especially if helping me relearn math I forgot. Unfortunately, it's extremely buggy and actually makes me really angry to have to deal with it so often. Sometimes when I leave a math exercise and come back later, none of the exercises load for the longest time. This wasn't a problem when I started using this app back in October, what the hell did you guys do to it? Also, can't use a hint during a quiz or unit test without it crashing. Please fix these issues because it's really difficult and frustrating to deal with.",
"This is a great educational app! I do three of my school subjects on this, and it makes learning easy. They have great informational videos, and quizzes to apply what you've learned. I also think the app layout is great as well. The ability to pin courses is really nice. One thing I wish they would have kept was the jump to the ""up next for you"" lesson/task button that would allow me to get to my course material faster without having to scroll through all of it. Regardless, still a great app!",
"The app is great! I love that it says the letter and the sounds. The way of teaching numbers is fantastic. BUT I really wish you'd fix the app. Every time my son backs out of the app it completely resets the lesson, (he's 2) and it happens often. I absolutely can't stand it. It's very frustrating because it's a different lesson every time it resets.",
"The program is fantastic and the lessons are fun, easy to follow, and very informative. I've learned a lot; however, the app leaves something to be desired. The answer box is too small and impossible to scroll, after a certain length, making checking your answer, and even answering, difficult. Please extend the answer box and make it more intuitive!",
"Great app of course, this is free education so I can't complain about that. The computer version is much better and easier to navigate however. I have a lot of difficulty entering answers into the quiz on the mobile version for Algebra. So I find myself redoing problems to try and get a better score. So if you have access to a computer I think you'd get more out of the course but nonetheless this is a good app overall.",
"Love the website, but the app has bugs. I have no problem with videos loading, but when I try to do a quiz, unit test, or course challenge, I usually get the ""error making task progess"" message about 10-30 times before it finally loads.Yes, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it didn't help. Also, I've noticed that when there's a mistake in a video, a correction will pop up on the website videos, but the correction message doesn't pop up on the app videos.",
"This app was great before the newest update. There were some bugs, like sometimes the equation wouldn't show up. but this was fixed by simply closing the app and reopening it. now, I can barely get through one assignment without taking like 10 minutes! The app is now extremely slow. And I know it's not on my end because I have the Sasmung Galaxy S8, a reasonably powerful phone, and I've barely used half of its storage. Hope this gets fixed.",
"This app has helped me quite a bit. I feel like I can stay on track and have a free tutor outside of my college classes and refresh what I forgot in highschool. The English and grammar lessons are easy to remember and well built, and although the math lectures can be slow, they make it easy to understand the material and focus on harder concepts one at a time. You can work on the go without having to have a computer standing by, or at a PC at home. Perfect for my needs!",
"Tried deleting and reinstalling. I'm on an up to date Samsung Galaxy s8 plus. Tried restarting my phone. Still doesn't work. The website works fine, I know I like that. Update: Contacted the help desk. In less than 24 hours, they looked into it and made an update. It works perfectly now. Prompt attention and correction to the problem.",
"It's really easy to use, the lessons are short and easy to understand, the teacher is good at explaining the concepts. The main problems is that once you've watched a lesson 90% of the time it doesn't check that you finished it, and there's no way to manually check that you finished it, so it can be easy to loose track. The other problem is that the app struggles to even work, it wont work out of wifi, and it sometimes won't run the tests even on wifi. Otherwise it would be 5 stars",
"it's ok, but it lacks a lot of the features of the website such as marking your progress, connect to videos on YouTube, and the discussions. it's just the videos followed by a couple questions without any aid. The main feature it is missing is the discussions where you can interact with other learners, to get additional insight. The discussions need to be included in the app.",
"Very convenient for math (or any subject) on concepts you have trouble with, but I do wish that I could work out problems without having the need to physically write things down (I just solve problems in my head). If you could add a notes tab on quizzes (where you can tap/slide from the side of your screen to bring it over if you want to use it to type notes down, and to tap/slide it back to to the side of the screen to consume less screen space), this app would be even better :D",
"So, as a 13 year old (about to go to highschool) I have used this frequently in my school, as well as my friends and teachers. Teachers love it because we learn, but the students don't really enjoy it (myself included) but, if you do want people to enjoy it more, make learning fun, like prodigy, or other learning games, maybe have a game show, where you need to multiply fast to beat the computer or your friend. Things like that make the app more intuitive and fun, and easy to do for long periods",
"I was so excited to find this app. I've always wanted to learn about a lot of different subjects and now I can/am! Some of the ancient history time line is a little off, it's based around the Christianity/religious timeline. (Which I thought was super lame.) I was super impressed with how much education app has to offer. It's not all just boring, having to read 50 pages in order to finish one section of a section. You go by your own pace of course. Highly recommend.",
"I absolutely love this app! I want to congratulate and thank the Khan Academy team for making such an amazing and free app. There are no ads and a lot of content; videos, articles, and exercises. I took off 1 star because: 1. There aren't many challenging/tricky problems. Mostly, it is just doing simple problems repeatedly. 2. The app goes wide but doesn't cover topics in depth.",
"Khan academy/the people/videos/tests are all incredible. Everyones voices are very pleasant,the videos and explanations are quick(much appreciated),as well as very informative and really drives the point home explaining in it several different ways, so it's easily understood, and memorable. The little test along the way really help make sure you understand too. I was ecstatic when I finally completely understood how to solve an algebraic equation! That's never happened before! So thank you!",
"I really, really appreciate the website version of this, and thought that a mobile version would benefit me more. However, when I try to actually open a lesson, be it document, quiz, or video, the app crashes. I've tried signing out, clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and still nothing has changed. Earlier today I sent my crash report to you. I would appreciate an explanation or a solution as I would like to use the app! Thank you!",
So easy to navigate and the courses offered seem endless! The structure of the courses I've started is very similar to the college courses I've taken and I can do them at my own pace! The political science class I'm taking right now is debatably better than the calsses I took at the University! The instructor does a great job at simplifying and expanding in areas that seem confusing.,
"Khan Academy is one of the best free education resources there is. I use the website with no problem but the app has a couple. It lets me download sections but when i try to open them offline they do not load and it displays an error message. Also, quizzes/tests do not offer the detailed explanations for each answer choice like they do online, and they are incredibly helpful. It's just as easy to go to the website which works great but it would be nice to have available for offline use.",
"It's pretty good but.... I wish their was an option to have it read things out loud to the kids, like a little speaker button so it's optional. It would really help my kiddos and me. So far he can only do math on his own unless I can sit and read it too him, which isn't always an option. Also the patent dashboard needs an easier layout. I would also appreciate the option for a 4 digit pin for my kids to log in. And make the app on chromebooks work better. Other than that we love it!",
"This app pales in comparison to its website. If you're considering downloading, don't. It has no start over button, the scratchpad colors are more limited, it's harder to see what you have completed and what you don't, etc. The content is good and challenging, though. If you like Khan, go to the website. It's so much nicer. And just another thing to add, just because I think i've focused on the negative too much: It is an amazing app besides all these things, and i would definitely recommend it!",
"I just got the app. Spent 2 hours doing a course theory text in geometry. It crashed atleast 5 times but let me resume on a different question around where I was in question order. Then I get to the final question, I get it wrong and it crashes again. This time restarting the entire test as if I'd never taken it. No info on how I did or anything. So frustrating. I would love to give this a great rating and I was really excited. Please look into this.",
"It is really a great platform but it is still by far better to study in a computer browser than in app. There are a lot of functionalities that is missing in the app such as the profile view, easier navigation/searching of courses, etc. Just like what others wanted, it would be better if you could add the discussion feature. It is a really a huge help in learning since the author (or other knowledgeable) people could elaborate more on the topics. Hoping these features would be added someday.",
"This app is phenomenal! They have a wide variety of subjects, teachers who are truly enthusiastic about the subject they teach as well as encouraging, practice quizzes, tests, and a clear outline of what to expect in each course. Some subjects I study to learn; others I study to brush up on and the structure of Khan Academy allows me to do both easily. I have downloaded many educational apps over the years and this is by far the best. I HIGHLY recommend!",
"Frustrating for OCD - Awesome content, but I absolutely hate how the app takes points away from individual sections when mistakes are made in the unit test. Give a student a chance to do another problem on that topic to score a point and move on, instead of taking points away and forcing him/her to repeat all 11+ questions again on things already mastered. It wastes a lot of time otherwise.",
"The app does not work on chromebook most of the time, which is of course a problem. However, I have just logged into my acount online, and I must say, Khan Academy is amazing! It has content on about everything and many practice problems for math. The only negative besides it not working on Chromebooks is that the videos can get a little long and not totally on point in my opion.",
"Love the app, no complaints whatsoever. I do have a suggestion though. The youtube app has a pop out video feature that allows the users to browse other apps or parts of their phone while the video/audio still plays. Would it be possible for the Khan Team to program a feature like this into the app? I think it would greatly enhance the user experience for the app. Thank you for your time!",
"It's a very great app, but the Browser version offers more than it. I have 2 main complaints for this app: - Lacks explanations for each answer choice, something that the browser version already has. - Test Practice is essentially worthless in terms of practicing within the app; but links are offered to their browser version, which seems lazy. (Please add in-app practice for Tests like the SAT, it can't be that hard.) Other than that, it functions well and is a great tool for students.",
"I generally do enjoy the app but over the past two weeks it won't load my assignments. Everytime I click on a course it keeps telling me, ""Unable to load course. Check your connection and tap to try again."" I already refreshed multiple times and cleared the cache. I also checked on my wifi and still nothing. I hope this gets fixed as soon as possible! Thank you for your time and consideration!",
"Due to the prevalent pandemic, I am now relying on this app for most of my classes. The app is good, but my biggest problem is how the assignments are displayed. They are all shown in a list. I have at least one hundred assignments and it is very time consuming trying to find the specific assignment that I want. It would be nice if the assignments were grouped under the specific course they originated from.",
"Absolutely brilliant! I've been struggling in math, and find this app to be extremely helpful; everything is explained in a way that I can actually understand. Only downside: none of the practice tests seem to work, error occurs everytime. I've tried uninstalling/installing. Edit: The issue had been corrected.",
"Great for students, not for teachers -- no way to make or check assignments. Would love to see more of the website functionality so I could assign topics to my classes and check student scores. This would be especially helpful since the web platform is not mobile-friendly (for example, the student names take so much space, I can't see student scores, even in landscape). Neither the app nor website on a phone allow me to check student work--an essential part of my use of Khan Academy as a teacher!",
"Everything is pretty great so far, besides one thing that can be a bit annoying. Because it's made like a game where you can earn points by getting answers correct, it bothers me that I can't get 100/100 points, only up to 80/100, even if I've done the practice multiple times and got all questions correct every time. It's just bothersome that I am unable to achieve all the points even though I've done the work and have been successful.",
"First of all I wanna say thank you so much for this amazing app it really helped me a lot .It used to work smoothly and well but the last two versions did not work properly every time I need to exit and enter the app several times until it works , an error shows up when opening practices (( Error making task progress ... please try again later )) . I deleted the app and redownloaded it but nothing worked out .. I hope you can help me solve this problem. Thanks again 💛",
"I was homeschooled last year and it was very good as a sidealong with my mathcoursework. I also now use it to keep up with math class. Very clear when explaining, i actually like math now, 9/10, and it would be better if i could have adjusted the text sizes in app. I had to adjust my whole device to see the numbers. Which in turn made me adjust everything else on the device.",
"Videos are good and clear to understand. The practice is telling me my answer is wrong even though I'm writing it Exactly as the hint does. I can't progress any further because there's no ""check again"" or skip button. Will edit review when this is fixed. Issue stating answers were wrong was corrected. But now I can't even load any exercises. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, disconnected and reconnected my wifi and cell data. Nothing is working.",
"Amazing, free learning tool. Learn anything from basic adding through calculus, computer coding, politics, government, history, science, and so much more. It's an awesome personal resource and if you use it for your kids it has great tracking features so you know what they are working on, where they are at, how much time they've send on each lesson, and if they are struggling and need help.",
"I saw a lot of reviews saying that text is cut off, and indeed when I first opened the app it was for me as well. To fix this go into your phone's settings and choose customization. You should at least have 2 options depending on your make of phone. I switched mine to the default font 'roboto' and now all the text shows clearly in the app.",
"Misleading screenshots. The screenshots show the courses in the app, while it always opens in a browser app. I was trying to take an intro to JavaScript course, and it opened the browser again, offering a non mobile-friendly experience. I have used khan academy before and was really impressed on the computer. Will definitely rate 5 stars if you can reformat it to where I can either, A) View courses in app (preferable), or B) at least make it to where videos or ""talk throughs"" can fit on a phone.",
"Khan Academy is great for learning. My biggest problem is that it keeps saying, ""You're offline"", even when I am on wifi. Please fix this - I can't move on when one part of the lesson finishes! - Update (10/04/2019): I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, it still says, ""You're offline"". I can't remove other devices from the network (I'm at university using university-provided wifi - go figure) and I tried cleared all background activity. Any other suggestions? I use a Samsung S10.",
"I absolutely recommend this app. I had teachers before that couldn't explain things well and I always stayed up studying with Khan Academy. They're very through with subjects and give the best demonstrations on how to do things. it's awesome for both visual and auditory learners. It also has a lot of languages and a very neat and organized setting. You can just download this app, search up what you need and you're good to go! I have definitely aced a few test thanks to Khan Academy. Bless Y'all.",
"EDIT:Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but the crashing problem persists w/ pop up saying error occurred whnever im stumped n try to use the hints. I'm still using the program but its frustrating not being able to see what im doing wrong the geometry section has lines you must move to points A or B, sometimes to create a shape. incredibly frustrating getting answers wrong based on a slightly misaligned point that overlaps another making it impossible to align it correctly. still love the app!",
"Good App, but needs work. I love Khan Academy when studying (something about Sal's voice is soothing). But the app for Android needs some fixes, I can't do much of anything without getting some error about making task progress. Please fix. Edit: issue died with new app so all works as it should. If they want to add I think some kind of whiteboard feature would be useful (like notability but in app).",
"Update removed scratchpad! We use this regularly in our house, but we are all used to being able to make notes or write out problems in the Khan scratchpad. It was essential. We have had to break out notebooks because the latest update removed the ability to use the scratchpad in a math problem. The button is no longer there. I didn't see removing this feature in the release notes either. Very disappointing.",
"Khan Academy does not work with a Chromebook. If you have to type in numbers of any kind it does not work. If you are able to get the pad in the app to come up it will fill in one blank. If you need to fill in more that one blank the cursor will not move to the next blank. I had great hopes for this app to help me build up my math skills to start college again, but it is more frustrating and does not work. We have had good luck with the Kids version.",
"Hands down a quality educational must have. Clean interface, easy to understand, Truly free to use, and Made for everybody. I Downloaded this app to brush up on my math before I enroll in college and it has been a blessing since I started. Lessons are easy to find and organized as well as there being a number of intro lesson plans to help anyone pick up wherever they left off or for the first time. Best practical app I've downloaded in a long time",
"Absolutely love the app, but one complaint. I am on my phone, and even though I am in landscape, when I am on the app it keeps rotating incessantly. I struggle to even watch the videos without the rotating tarnishing my experience. Please fix this, or tell me how to disable the rotating features. Thanks.",
"The Website itself is great but app is TERRIBLE. The search bar is broken. If you try to search up Discrete Math or terms relating to it, you won't get any results. However if you search for it on the website you will get results. I'm sad this app does a poor job representing the site because if it worked it would be incredibly more convienent. Edit: Forgot to mention this. When you don't get any results, if you tap the screen it takes you to a random video or one you were trying to search for",
"I remember when Khan Academy was just starting up, if only I used it more in the past to increase my knowledge. Besides that, it's amazing to see how much information is available for free, you can complete almost every college level class with the teachings available. They even go above and beyond that while including tips, tricks, shortcuts, and ways to boost your memory of the topic. Im going to finally make Khan Academy a daily habit so I can achieve my goals in life.",
"Wonderful tool to be incorporated into education, providing help to those who need it, while also presenting an opportunity to enrich one's self beyond what is expected. Amazingly free and accessible. I only have one issue regarding the mobile app, where it seems that SAT practice (not just videos) is not available as it is on a computer. If this could be added to the app to aid my preparation for such an important test, I'd appreciate it. Cheers to Khan Academy.",
"A wonderful foundation. But the app have problems: I've downloaded items of bookmarks and still not shown while I'm offline, the app is really slow even if I'm online or offline, sometimes it closes by itself, when i try to scroll on algebra (all sections) it lags and glitches a lot preventing me to enter a specific part of lessons. I've used this app 10 months ago, but i didn't have so much problems like now. I hope you fix these problem ASAP. 5 stars for the academy. 0 stars for the app.",
"A very informational app indeed. I'm a middle schooler, going to junior high school next year and for someone who studies advanced, this helps a ton. It also contains foundation (basics) which I recommend going through first. Moreover, the articles and tests are so helpful in my exam preparations. The only problem is that, it doesn't have a 'start over' button for tests as it does on it's webpage. The webpage is definitely better, but the app doesn't disappoint!",
"Khan Academy is the best app for learning math! It has absolutely no ads, no in app purchases and its very simple to use! It has useful videos, properly explaining new math concepts and quizes to test your knowledge! It also has a bookmark function which let's you save videos and view them offline. I definitely recommend this app over other educational aps due to its simplicity, no use of ads and no in app purchases.",
"I love it. I'd just like to make a suggestion though. If/when you add new courses, you should do something about music (the basics of popular instruments, music theory, that kind of stuff) and maybe some language courses (Spanish, French,Italian, German, Japanese, the ones a lot of people try to learn). Anyway, those are just some suggestions, and I like what you guys do. Keep it up!",
"This app is definitely not for me, I hate listening to audio files, can't we just have it in text, there's no way I'll be able to have a go at this, and the voice goes right through you too, it'd be much better with no voice at all, but a female voice would be much better imo. Also I noticed you have a voting system, who's going to vote for stuff, I'd much prefer leaving feedback, and if you don't change it, we move on, I'd NEVER VOTE for useful stuff.",
"The app has no Dark Mode, everything has an old school eye killing white background like it's 2005. Have to use Firefox instead, which is not ideal on a mobile device. Devs, how difficult is to add 1 button to have a dark mode switch? All apps have it, most apps will auto switch to your device's colour scheme, so if your device is set to dark mode, all apps auto switch their own dark mode on. Fix it. Please.",
This is no doubt the best free learning platform on the internet. But the app still has some improvements to do. There's a huge lag spike after opening the app. This also happens after opening every course I open. Animation doesn't show after opening the app for 5 - 10 seconds. It also take something like 5 - 10 seconds to show animations after opening a course. Sometimes it takes about a 2 second lag while opening a category. The courses take 10 seconds to load even after showing animations.,
"a wonderful app for learning and very easy to use, with different levels and grades to choose from, as well as helpful toturials. only bummer is that it is limited without premium.",
"Great for supplemental homeschool. My one complaint is the app does not seem to include the parent dashboard, which must only be available in the browser. So... the app is useless on the parent/teacher side of things. It seems to be only for the learner.",
It's a really good app. They have so many curriculums and stuff but they need to add elementary school science because they only have junior high and high school science. It also has no ads which is definitely a good thing,
"Khan Academy is really amazing, It diverse subject and esy to learn concept really helping me to get any concept done. The best part was the lowest internet 🤓🤓🤓 consumption, I can do my classes even if the data is lower than 10 MB remaining, Amazing! But I found something missing, and I request the khan Academy team that if they also add English subject, and classes that teaches people speaking English then it will be very helpful for me and many other. ☺️ Your Lovely User 😄 Farhan Anwar",
"best app out there for study material, makes it 10x better that you can use it offline. study material is top notch as well, the app provides what it promises. and the simple interface makes it so less distracting...",
"♥️ I Love KhanAcademy But Need Fixes♥️ Please re arrange regroup Everything.😞 In Class 7 Math India, not all the topics are listed orderly, they can be found only in test mode help button. This is a major flaw as anyone can skip a class & jump directly to the test. I want to champion Calculus from begining there should be a way to achieve it. Please group the maths orderly. Don't know what to learn 1st for the 2nd... please improve it 🙏🙏🙏 i donated Rs.3000/- for this amazing service.",
"I was working with the application just fine, but lately every time I decide to open it, it keeps crashing and shows ""Khan academy failed to start,.."" please fix the problem soon!",
"It is a Excellent app, because it give qualitu content while it is free, it just a few of its kinds. This resource in the correct hand, can be all it take for master almost every topic that khan academy got to offer.",
"I think major improvement you need to make are, writing of exams and award of Certificate of completion to any one who completes any course (High school physics,Ap/College chemistry e.t.c) and also offering courses that you can earn credits and which are transferable directly to any partnered institutions.",
"I am so grateful for the Khan Academy app! It's an amazing tool that offers free education, making learning accessible to everyone. The app has truly made a difference in my learning journey, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking quality education.",
"I am a regular user of the Khan Academy app and I have loved it. I uninstalled it accidentally and when I downloaded it again, it refused to open! It keeps showing the message ""Unfortunately, Khan Academy has stopped."" Repeatedly!! I have kept deleting and downloading to no avail. I have also switched on and off my phone. I left the beta programme wondering if that is what is making the app lag. Nothing works! Please do something about it.",
"Like I have been one week, finding any app that could be free of cost . But today finally. I did it A excellent application free of cost. And the concept can understood cyristal clear. Tution is a waste of time and money .. Thanks for Khan sir team ..",
"Best place to learn new things, including academic things, life skills, extra courses, math, etc. The thing that I love the most about Khan Academy is that it does not include any app purchases. So, there are no ads and no paid courses. Each and every course at Khan Academy is better than any other paid course. Special thanks to Khan Academy.",
"No matter how good my signal is, every course just displays, ""Unable to load course. Check your connection and tap to try again. "". Reinstalling the app didn't work either, and I don't know why this is happening since the app used to work perfectly fine for me.",
Master piece for teachers and students. A noble one which is kept free. The only shortfall is the absence of teacher's option on mobile devices.,
This is such an amazing application for learning a new skill or reviewing materials taught in school like mathematics or statistics. I love this app and I wish it had more programming languages to learn.,
It's just so so amazing. It's more of a class room and lectures. I'm a Ugandan pharmacy student. I rely alot on it for my research and it's being amazing for me. All I can do is to thank the developers,
Good app to brush up on your learning. But keeps crashing this is literally the second day it has stopped working.,
"It is amazingly good quality. Good explanation, no bugs (at least i have not found any) and very good quizzes so you can learn ANYTHING! Well the reason for one star less than five is that the explanation is not fun to listen to, and the screen before a quiz leaves room for empeovement. Anyways those are minor problems and i higly recommend khan academy for learning.",
I just downloaded the app and I pressed the computer programming course and it says it's only available on the web when I clicked the open web it brings me back to the screen telling me it's only available in web.. it literally won't open it.,
"It's a good app but sometimes it doesn't work. When i tap on a subject or on anything in the app,it doesn't respond. It just stays the way it is and it's so fustrating",
This is a stunningly useful app for all my studies that I could easily pull off with optimal usage of time. Otherall this is an amazing app. Keep up the good work !! 😀😁,
I don't know want has happened to this. But this app doesn't open. Everytime I try to open the app it shows 'unfortunately Khan academy has stopped working ' and shuts down.,
Very buggy app. Can't see single course. I thought this will help me study but app is so slow and buggy. I can't press anything.,
This app is filled with bugs so much I have to wait 20 secs to see the loaded application everytime after I touch a icon it just randomly freezes so annoying,
"The best educational app I've ever had, easy to use, great design, dozens of amazingly put courses, it's everything you could possibly dream of if you want to get education on all the scientific topics (and sometimes beyond). Thank you for this!",
"Best app ever. You can learn anything for free, with no ads, every skill, Every topic, classwise and courses too, i have never seen such a useful app with no cost at all, the teaching is great, truly helpful for people in all grades and college year.",
"honestly the least I can say is thank you. I have looked for many apps/websites for learning and all of the good ones had very limited access to non subscribers till I found Khan academy. not only it has excellent lessons, it has a very wide variety of lessons for all ages and it doesn't have annoying ads",
I love Khan Academy!! The only thing between you and learning is your willingness to learn. This app proves it. Hands down by far the best app I've ever used or come across to help you achieve your academic goals!! I guarantee it!!!! If you want to learn something and utilize this app your learning will be increased 100%!! And your knowledge on the subject will improve drastically. Please take my advice don't ever stop learning and with Khan Academy this is achievable one subject at a time!!!!!,
"An amazing app for American users and students. This app is great, it has everything I could ask for. However it is mainly focused around the American education system with no options for GCSE or A-level classes. It is an amazing app with all the learning tools you could ask for but it is just not for me.",
"This app is great, but the downside is the downloads. Only the videos are accessible when you download a topic or course. I suggest to make the others (other than the video like topics in text and activities or practice problems) downloadable or accessable offline.",
"Khan Academy is incredible vaste in terms of content, I'm impressed. And it's all for free, this app deserves the world. Thank you!",
"The application simply doesn't work on A03s core, it's a very good studying resource, but this app is completely useless it doesn't let me do absolutely anything.",
I use it the night I know what subject I'm doing at school so I can understand it better and ask good questions hehe. But it's very good and makes hard subjects that seem impossible to learn really easy. When you look back from completing one you think to yourself huh that wasn't as bad as I thought. Love it. Adding streaks back would be cool but not necessarily needed.,
"This app just keeps amazing me, I can't even think of better education app I have seen my life !!! But if you applied some dark mode it would have been better because the bright white background doesn't go easy for our eyes especially the web version.",
"Thank you khan academy from my inner heart. I was able to complete SAT courses,and was able to learn every concepts in a proper way. Everything is okay but as a deaf,I had difficulty to understand but overall good experience.",
It used to work fine but then everytime i tap on the app and it opens it just freezes and i cant do anything anymore. I deleted it and installed it again but then it kept on crashing and the app would just close every time. Wouldnt recommend,
"I just wish there was a dark/night mode setting for the menu - totally understand why lessons might not be applicable Also would 100% everything I'm looking for if there was a category/catergories for adults who are interested in refreshing their skills, particularly for adults who are trying to go back to school (5+ years or so after high school)",
This is an amazing ap for anypne who believes that school just doesn't end on school grounds .This is better than any other school related app out there.Its also great on any OS and this comes from a Chromebook user The only thing that tips me off is that it doesnt work offline except when you download the videos Keep up the goood work Khan Academy,
"I can't sign in, it always say ""Sorry, we saw an unexpected error! Please try again later"" its always like this, I've been trying to sign in, and whenever I tried to open a course its just stuck in a loading screen, it will never load, Please fix this.",
Thank you very much for making these lessons free for everyone. I'm planning to learn every courses here. I can make a good use of what I've learned here. God bless ✨,
"Firstly I was having Byju's course from 4th to 7th but now from 8th it was very expensive and unaffordable.Then I started seeing videos on youtube Physics Wallah umang,and by the time I found that ther is application of Physical Wallah,I searched and I seen it.It was payed so I was sad and then in suggestions I found 'Khan Academy' and I saw the application and it was absolutely free I was happy and all things in the app is also good. Keep It Up Khan Academy.",
All information given are very clear and understable.. Perfect app to study notes in a quick way.,
"Khan Academy is a wonderful app for learners but only limited to it. Known and used for years but not I'm past that. Now I'm expecting courses for related to IT and technology fields such as digital marketing, copywriting and content writing and designing. I hope Khan academy looks into getting that landscape because there's a life post school life. Thanks.",
"Good app, but I would really appreciate it if the Languange ""Bahasa Indonesia"" Is included, thank you.",
"I really love how khan sir provided education for ""ABSOLUTELY FREE"" and i really preciate it. But there's a issue to it i love all the features i'm just pointing what needs to be fixed. Ok so 1) There should a option for video quality atleast beacause yk i can watch khan academy all day if its data friendly (pleasee :^). 2) Dark mode as some might have mentioned. And yea that's it but quality option is reasonably important because yk a lotta data is used in just a video.",
"Edit: issue is resolved, giving 5 star!! New version is just disgusting,auto rotate feature is very annoying,please fix this, otherwise everything is fine,but this feature, disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you issue is resolved.,issue resolved, thank you",
I really love using this app. It could be great if the app start from where we left and continue to the next lesson automatically rather then go back and choose the next lesson.,
"It's the best learning app I've tried. It provides a variety of checked, reliable learning content. The exercises have tricky questions that are applicable to real life. I really appreciate that it's free and doesn't contain ads. My only request would be to make more articles on the topics in addition to the videos, as a lot of content is not included in the reviews. That'd make taking notes a lot easier. I'd like to thank the whole Khan Academy team for their great work! You've saved my life!",
"Hi I have an issue with opening up a lesson, I could scroll through the lessons but unable to select and open. Please fix this. I'd give it a 5star if it didn't have these problems. Plus is there a way that you could enable users to download your content to enable us to watch it later",
"Tears rolled off my eyes when I saw all the courses arranged properly, along with the respective quizzes to check comprehension and all that for Absolutely Free!! ... Salute to Khan Academy For the Application, please fix the sudden auto-rotation of the lecture video. Even when I'm holding the device in landscape orientation the video lecture starts to rapidly toggle between portrait and landscape mode, which is quite annoying😫",
very helpful and beneficial site for the students who are preparing for the sat,
Khan academy is ok I guess but whenever u get a question wrong it's just wrong u can't try again especially if your on mastery challenges or something it's so annoying because u have to start all over again and if u get the question wrong it doesn't even tell u the answer so u have NO Idea what u got wrong. PLEASE FIX THIS plus khan academy boring but itns still an awesome app! 👌,
"Wow!! What an amazing app , for those who don't know the app offers pro bono courses (i.e., free of cost ) and it's an amazing app I don't know how to thank the creater my gratitude to him/her is ineffable",
"Amazing, but videos need to have a resolution setting to save data (so you could learn all day :) and there needs to be a dark mode and with some ""choose all answers that apply"" questions, if you don't select the correct number of answers (right or wrong) it won't get it wrong and it says to choose the correct number of answers. Otherwise, good :).",
"Functional 100% , i didnt really know how to do maths my level and then i used this app and it feels really easy",
"Best application for studies . I used to watch khan academy videos from YouTube, but suddenly I remembered this application of this team .. thanks khan academy for every course .",
"It's great that they are offering education completely free. I appreciate the absence of ads. The information related to the subjects, I think, is enough, informative, and understandable. I've been taking Economy, Finance, Physics, and History classes and the teachers are great. The absence of dark mode is a huge let down for me as I like watching the videos in portrait orientation. If you could, please add it. Thanks for the amazing work!",
"The app itself is absolutely brilliant and it would've received 5 stars if it weren't for ONE thing... I'm hard of hearing so with the videos, I have to ramp the sound right up AND have the transcript on at the same time, I honestly don't mind that. I DO mind that when every question is answered correctly, my ears are then assaulted with this brash bell noise EVERY single time! Even with the sound low, it's discordant tones makes me uncomfortable and I end up closing the app in frustration. Every. Single. Time. There are no options in settings for sound control and that is why KA has 4 stars (sorry, I really did want to give it 5, it's ridiculously good otherwise!)",
"Best educational app out there and entirely free. With a bunch of explanatory videos, exercices, step by step explanations. Just perfect. The only thing I want to point out is that the videos get stuck sometimes (but that's okay because you can also watch them on Youtube, where they run just fine) and that the answer windows have bugs sometimes, but that's quite rare. It's still a very enjoyable and incredibly helpful app.",
"It's very helpful for filling gaps in my knowledge, and therefore focuses on mastery learning. However, few things can be improved. Firstly, it appears that there was a lag when it was loading learning materials. Furthermore, in some videos, the transcript appears to have stopped working, for it crashed whenever i pressed it. Please continue to fix this problem, and also provide the transcript for the app on platforms such as tablets, because the videos haven't been equipped with such.",
"This is school at your own time schedule, it's an amazing app, like never before... I love this app so much. The teaching is very understandable, straight to the point, no adds to distract and lessons of your choice. It covers all aspects of schooling right from kindergarten to the highest level. Basic explanations to get the concept into your head. I love this app.",
"Love Khan Academy, I've been using it since 2009. Helpful albeit slightly repetitive lessons. I have one big issue with the app: the scratchpad. It's too small to do anything but the simplest questions so you'll need a pen and paper to get much use out of the app. One possible fix would be to make it zoomable so you can fit more of the equation on a phone screen.",
"It is an amazing app for students of any class. Unlike other apps where you have to subscribe for a full course, this app is completely free and has amazing explaination and visuals as well. The language of the teachers is also easily comprehendible and very clear unlike other apps where the teachers are very confused about what to say. You can find a large amount of study material. It is definitely a must have for all the students and whatever you listen you remember it immediately.",
"This app was great yesterday. For the past three months, I dedicated it an hour daily almost every single day. Especially great was the easy navigation (even if the sheer amount of content made it a bit hard sometimes, which is not necessarily a bad thing), and it's greatest feature, IMO, one that allowed the user to scribble on top of any mathematical quiz and problem. Both things are gone w/its latest update. I could get used to the new interface, but I don't see why I should.",
"There should be absolutely no doubt that Khan Academy is one of the most accessible and rich resources for a free education. This app provides fundamental knowledge of Maths and Sciences for everyone in a medium that engages its users. I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to compliment their studies at school or for those of us simply wanting to refresh our memory. That being said, as of when I am posting this I have run into a couple bugs while using this app on the Samsung Note 8; One of which is after completing a practice exercise the text button doesn't respond so I end up having to use the arrow on the top. The second issue I face is when trying to sort boxes in the dot plot graph questions the screen scrolls, preventing me from sorting them. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the development of this app and the growth of Khan Academy itself.",
"The App has the ability to play videos and save much energy from the Mobile Device and helps in learning different subjects and concepts behind them such as Mathematics, Science and has the best capabilities and lecturers that have simplified everything in whatever they teach. The app has the ability to allow you to choose your class so it can give you training depending on which class you have chosen, it has a user-friendly interface as well; I would recommend this app for next usage.",
"Exceptional content, no complaints there. Navigation across lessons within a subject in the app is horrid: from watching a random lesson you can't go back or forward to the adjacent lessons in one step. To open the list of lessons if you were watching sequentially you will have to press back button till you get to to the first one you opened. If you opened a random lesson externally you can't do such a thing at all. A MAJOR annoyance.",
"Just fantastic. Its a lot when youre new. All that knowledge for free... I think. Im skeptical. But its fantastic for people that dropped out of school and are willing to catch up on lost education, university prep and genaral touch ups. I came across an issue on my Chromebook while using the app. Equation images were zoomed in and i didnt see the last part of the equation, and i then got it wrong as a result. Sometimes i get confused where i last left off in a subject or whats next.",
"This app is amazing. The instructor is great and the exercise is good. But one thing that annoys me is the answer box. It's too small and it can't slide nicely. It might be better if the box widen to the phone's full width screen instead of just show around 5 numbers and then slides. Also, I hope there'll be a skill mastery for Linear Algebra",
"Totally helpful. I used it on my pc, but right now, I just installed it on my android phone. I can't tell if it's just my phone's OS lagging with the app, but the feedback is delayed whenever I click on things (settings button, for example). I just wanted to raise my concern just in case the problem was on your side. More power to the team!",
"When I try to use the s pen on my note 8, it keeps drawing on the scratch pad even though the s pen is not on the screen",
Thanks khan academy for such a wonderful app which helps lots and lots of students to make learning interesting and fun ....,
"This app is incredible, and I am forever greatful for having the opportunity to learn for free! Thank you!",
"Great app for learning but should be more like a scientific calculator with equations. Eg. I was doing a two step equation and I got the answer correct and they won't let me use the brackets? So I used • and x instead and still no correct answer, please fix this. And also fix the problem with your videos being irritability hard to pause and come out of. What I'm really trying to say is add more mathematical symbols to your calculator for less confusion and stress, and fix the lag, please!",
"I love that I can learn math anywhere with this app. I do have one specific issue that frustrates me. Could your questions accept all equivalent answers, or specify what form the answer should be in; fraction, decimal, simplified. Am I missing something?",
"Am using infinix smart 5 and it really takes time to load on my device, both offline and online",
"Hi Khan Academy team, I wonder if you can address this issue. The auto rotate (when watching on smartphone) seems to be too sensitive. A little movement of our hands will just turn the screen 90 degrees back and forth and it's frustrating and annoying. I hope you can help fixing this problem. Thanks!",
"There's no doubt this app is the best. I love all the content I can learn for free. The only thing for which I am holding out 1 star is because this app crashes on my Android 12 phone. It's basically unusable. I've tried all troubleshooting methids but couldn't get it to work. The content is 100% amazing. The app is cool, with just finishing touches missing.",
Khan academy is a good app but it would be a five star if there is essay questions and a combination of video lectures and interactive text plus they should make the app more customizable For example adding more interactive features and questions I AM willing to donate to make the app better if it goes in the write direction,
The best app for learning I've ever downloaded. Hands off best teaching method you can find. The videos really capture the actual subject. 10/10,
Best app for learning I have ever seen. In this app you will get all the content and vedios related with your class and subjects.. It's really very much heplful.. Thanks to khan academy for creating such a wonderful app and giving education to todays youth free 🙏☺🙏,
Pls my khan academy app refuses to open. I deleted it and downloaded another one still same problem. But it was working perfectly before. Pls rectify. I have been using this app for 4 yrs now. I dont like all these ohh. I am using Gionee S9,
The app is really good and I suggest to use it if u want free education... but one problem tht I faced recently was tht the app doesn't load something and shows blank white page until and unless I open it like 5 times just fix that rest Is good,
"When my son started the a new school in a new country, his math wasn't good. During the holiday, he finished third grade math on the Khan academy app, which greatly improved his fourth grade math skill. This made my son confident in math. All thanks to Khan academy.",
"A very good app with a very good purpose. If you want more functions you can use the web browser version on your computer instead :) It's free, it's from basic to advanced levels of math, plus the other sciences, economy and more. It keeps track of all your progress for years and across platforms. 10/10 donate money to this good cause if you can spare it ♡",
"Everything works flawlessly except for the videos. When watching a video on my android 5 device, if the screen rotates, the app becomes borderline hung for a good 10 seconds. Video continues playing just fine, but am not able to get the app to do anything. I hope this is something that will get addressed as it is the only thing holding me back from a five star.",
The app is excellent I think it would be nice if you add geography as a course,
"It's the Khan Academy app we all know and love, but a dark theme for the mobile app would be nice ❤️",
The app is the best overall! But our learning process would be more comfortable if this app could give us a dark mode. Because a dark mode is lot more useful when it comes to learning at night. Thank You,
"I prefer the 2017 version, it was more intuitive an the bugs were negligible. Now I download lesson as before, but the videos doesn't load. And also it's by far slower compared to previous versions (when the logo was a leaf). Hope you fix it :) I love Khan Academy. Edit: I recommend returning to the previous version :( there was no fatal bugs, never, I don't know exactly when, but since the app icon changed, bugs appears suddenly",
"Khan Academy is overall a good learning app, but sometimes the quizzes are really hard and they don't explain how to do them in the videos because they use easier examples instead. And sometimes I would get the answer correct, but it still told me I was wrong, even when I use the hints and type in the answer again. But it's still almost as good as being in an actual classroom. 3 stars for me!",
"Khan Academy is the best learning app I have ever come across. Every concept and every topic is explained in a boisterous manner. It's been several months and I am overwhelmed with its manner of imparting education. The only thing that sometimes happens is that while watching videos, the sound of the instructor glitches and the screen blurs, no matter how fast my internet connection is.",
This app help my kids a lot when I download it is so good for my kids,
"I want to show my gratefulness towards the team of Khan Academy for providing high quality of education all the time. However, I have seen some issues on the mobile version of the app. That is, when a new video is pressed, there is some period of time lagging and inability to press the buttons of the player. Hope to see fixes soon! Thanks.",
I really like how the lessons are presented and the overall app. Although just after the update i cant seem to tap any lessons. The 'search' and 'bookmark' pages only show a white screen as well. This makes the app nonfunctional for me. I've tried reinstalling it and clearing its cache but both didn't work. Hope this gets fixedd :] for the mean time I'll be using the website instead,
I realy helpfully app is the study and learning purpes.. And no charge this app... Amazing aap,
"The app is great and I've been using it for a while now but it's missing a Q bank, quiz and/or flashcards. It would be great to test yourself every now and again after completing a few videos. It's an easy way to keep updated with the content and reinforce what you've recently learned or what you've learned earlier in the course. Thanks",
having a high quality and free content it's just amazing,
"Great teaching methods, very helpful.",
"Your content is great, and these videos have really helped me with school, but you seriously nees to work on the app. The app is always loading very slow, and the chapters that I bookmark download even slower. In fact, most of the time I can't download them at all so I just give up. And don't tell me it's because of some problem with my internet connection, because it's not. Even when my internet is at high speed and all other apps are working just fine, the bookmarks just won't download.",
"Great app, but what frustrates me is that sometimes the options for the answers in exercises or tests are not fully displayed. I was taking a Math unit test today and was on the last question. I had gotten everything else correct. The options were in the form of cards, the ones where you have to order from least to greatest. One of the cards was completely empty, and I had no idea what number it was. And so, I got it wrong, leveled down and had to take the test (a long one) again.Very upsetting.",
"I think this is a very good app. When I watch the videos, the tutors help me understand more clearly. However, it is not much of a variety and I have not learnt most of the subjects. But the articles, videos, passages are very informative, especially the History types. Overall, I liked the app and would recommend it.",
"Great app for kids and adults. The points system and graduated learning is genius: Too hard? Just go a grade lower until you've mastered it. Too easy? Just take the unit test to complete it and move on to a higher grade. I wish high school had used this approach...I might not have dropped out when things became too difficult! Thank you for making this free. ****For those of us who find videos boring, slow and hard to pay attention to....stop auto scroll on transcripts so we can read it faster.",
"The lessons are nice. The only problem is with the functionings of the app. It's slow and sometimes freezes when watching the videos. When I updated the app, I couldn't access the videos I had downloaded for offline use. The last update, fortunately almost fixed the problem and I can now access the 3 GB of videos I downloaded months ago. I am not going to update the app again as long as I have offline videos left.",
"I have a year that I use this platform and I say that it is good for those who want to learn If you suffer from: - Limitation of study in time & place & quantity. - Vauge explanations of a lesson, - Not having the ability to repeat what is said, This is the right place. ⚒️🛠️Edit: Needs fixing on the energy points earned (web). When disconnected, during watch (you get internet in end), the energy points don't add up as you keep seeing the video and leaves it as incomplete.",
This is a mind blowing app. It just has everything I need. It has also cleared my doubts. The videos are very good and the bookmark section is the most useful section. Now I can nearly solve each and every question. And one of the best things I realised was that it teaches just like teachers. One more thing I loved was the selection of subjects. It helps me to focus more. One thing which I did not understand was the nandages. Can you plz tell what is it for and for what is it useful.,
It would be even more great if it has more english grammar lessons and practices🙌,
Woah. The app is functional 100%. This probably differs between each courses but the video tutor has a very soothing way of explaining the matter of the subjects. Managed to keep my hyperactive attention span focused on the study subject. Thank you so much! A few suggestions is leaderboard function. This will motivate students to study more and move up the leaderboard. And maybe add badge/awards in the app to remind students of their achievements in the app.,
"I love Khan academy. I have been using it to learn algebra. It has been very useful. The only thing find frustrating is that graphs are very fiddley and hard to enter results o 1n. not getting 100% on a unit test because you could not see you were half a line across from your intended value is sooo Frustrating. But that aside, I am learning a lot and the lessons are excellent.",
Amazing and commendable for u guyz to make such a thing for absolutely free for everyone around the world. Hope u get the recognition u deserve :),
"I just downloaded it, and so far, it seems amazing!!!. I'm still working on it, so I will be back with a more detailed opinion",
"I love this app. I think it's amazing! However, if you are on Chromebook, I recommend just using the browser instead of the app. This is because the app sometimes lags for no reason, and the browser has no lagging. However, if you prefer the app, it's still great! The app itself is amazing! It has TONS of courses for any age! Plus, it's FREE! I highly recommend. I'm in 6th grade, and I'm just trying to get ahead to prepare for other grades! Works amazing!",
I am speaking from Bangladesh. I am interested to learn in Khan Academy. But learning from Khan Academy is a challenge for me. Because I don't understand English. And the video quality of Khan Academy is very high. I cannot learn in Khan Academy due to low network and internet cost in my area. So add subtitles to Khan Academy videos and video quality selection on Khan Academy app.,
"Oh, it's a very good app and guide. Maybe just a small complaint, but the videos take forever to load for me. More personally I'd prefer reading things and sometimes the repition gets boring quick. It goes over the most basic things, which is good for others, I know. Although sometimes I'd rather skip the definitions and get to how it's done already. That's just a personal complaint of course, the app has taught me things I did'nt know about. Especially with math, which I'm terrible at.",
"This app help in learning, it has also great learning features, like quizzes and unit tests, and it also has learning videos and they are very good. The quiz and unit test test your memory and skills like what have you learnt , and it makes you revise your mistakes. This app makes your child 100% perfect in remembering every topic. It also helps you when you are stuck in the middle of an exercise. It gives up to 4 hints or gives a video. This is the perfect learning app .",
Great app different kind of learning there's math for each grade,
This platform is without any doubt one of the best. But still there are some things yet to be improved in this app. Make the seek button 5s instead of 10s or at least implement a way to change the seeking duration in app settings. It gets way too much backwards if I want to re-listen a part. And implement a pause-resume feture in downloading videos... Thanks for this amazing platform... <3,
"Definitely time worthy app, though wish it had dark theme; the light design really hurts for late night studying.",
The best tool available for learners to get back to date on multiple subjects and the mastery skills make it easy to grow. Great videos explaining all courses.,
I can't believe it that such an educative app has been here all the time and I was deceived by others. Khan Academy is the best learning app. ☝️☝️😘👌👍,
"The literal meaning of GREAT. With no ads and fabulous quality of education. That's really awesome. The courses and tests which I take are free and it's really designed to bring good moods for all those want to LEARN. Have you experienced that good mood after learning something wonderful? If yes, this is the app that you can spend most of your time working with!",
"Very good... encourages us to learn on a daily basis Very clear and precise content... short videos... so doesn't get bored Thank you for the app :) I'll give 1 suggestion.. the videos doesn't auto load... as when one gets over, it doesn't automatically load the next one. So when viewing the video on fullscreen, have to exit exit from full screen and click on next video each time. Fixing this would be awesome 😁👌",
Very nice and content is very satisfying Thanks for providing this app,
Hello I was a web user when I logged in my google account In app it just showing blank everything and I couldn't click on settings aswell. pls help me like you did with my math studies. 🙂,
I have only one things to say that you will forget anyother apps after using it. It is soo good and the lecture is well prepared and explained.,
"I'm a student my teacher gives me Khan academy everyday. When you get one wrong there should be a redo button so you don't have to keep doing it over and over again. I rage... Like alot, and I know alot of people do too so y'all need to work on that.",
Amazing application for students they provide all the courses for free ! And there courses and good and easy to understand. Easily 5 stars.,
Best learning App/Website ever!!! I've learned so much about computers and networking and math. I also learned all small subjects or topics in school or just things I didn't learn all here!!,
I am very thankful to this platform for providing us this type of quality education. I am using this application as a supplement that's helping me very well Salute to khan sir for his unconditional support and efforts. Thanks a lot to the khan academy team I will try to do my best after acquiring knowledge from your highly appreciated videos A lot of thanx to khan academy team,
"Khan academy is really amazing, you can learn things easily here. Teachers are fantastic. But as a Indian student I want some subjects to be explained in Hindi language. And for Indian student exams like Neet and Jee are important for them so I request khan academy to add courses for jee and neet preparation.",
I just love this app. And it is my favourite learning app I ever found on Play Store. You can download it without any hesitation. I have been using this since this month. And it is a excellent experience.,
App is working well and the content is good but it lags too much and there are too much bugss please fix it There should be a section where all not completed assignment should be there now we have to do see more many times,
"I never ever give ratings, but i must give a 5 star rating for these developers! In a world where everything requires payment you do not demand money but yet you provide the most valuable product in the market : Knowledge... Props to you",
"I can't seem to log back in, when I last logged in was eleven years ago. Please contact me, as I would like some knowledge before joining the higher-ups in the medical team without breaking my bank.",
"It's time we have a dark mode as well, to make the learning experience more comfortable on eyes.",
"It is far better than byju,toppr,extramarks,as here are the lessons are taught very well and don't even charge you a single paise just an internet connection . No adds . No bothering about courses . A non profit organisation . Love it . Will give it a 10 star . Recommended to everyone . Have been using it for last 6 months. But it has one defect . Very few exercise are there to solve . Please add some more questions in all subjects.",
"There isn't as much on the app as there is online, so that's the only reason I took away a star. Very educational and helpful.",
"The app is so confusing to navigate. Also, it deleted everything I had already did. Not to mention how hard it is to focus on because it's so boring.",
It is very useful .... it will be very worth full till 8th standard and there are number of courses u can learn,
"No doubt it's a good app for learning. But I have one major issue... There are only two video qualities available, one it too good and also big but the other one is too bad and so small. There's actually nothing in the middle! For example I can either download the course I want in 69 mb which has a really bad quality that I'd rather not watch or download it with 2.5 gb which is a really good picture but too big to download ( specially for me that have trouble downloading in app)",
This application stand out in best learning application ever built. Please regularly update the content according to syllabus for Maths India. Many important topics are not added.,
"This app is one of its kind in this whole store. No ads, no subscription. It's amazing. It also have Indian Educational videos. Few Bugs: *While downloading more than one chapter, the whole chapters in the downloading list gets stuck. I will have to restart again and download one chapter at a time. *The loading is a problem in this app. While taking a topic in the chapter, it will load infinitely and I have good network. It happens while watching videos too. *Videos should have quality option.",
"One of the best learning tool for any students out there,Its super effective but of course it isn't perfect,There is a bug where some sentences in the Hint button or on the multiple choices doesn't appear at all,Some of the page will just go blank with no reason, It can be fixed by reloading the app but the progress will be removed leaving me frustrated. Need to be fixed but good app overall",
I am absolutely satisfied with this app. It provides everyone with a free but huge and diversified curriculum. It is one of the all time favorite learning apps for me . There's only one mere fault which disturbs and distracts me . In some lessons the calculations I done are shown wrong. In hints when checked they provide you with a 1 digit shifted answer . I have encountered this fault in many lessons. So dear Khan academy technical team please fix it. Other than that it's perfect. Thanks guys.,
Easy to use and very educational!,
"Great Free app for education. But, Math has good videos, tests, quizzes still science section needs to improve a little bit more",
"Great program but the mobile app glitches so much. It will say error connection and then cut you out of what you were doing and keep saying need to retry to connect. Force close the app continuously until it works. This has happened for months now. We don't need it, and this is free anyways, but it would be nice to get calculator option always too and a more scientific of one. Doing split screen and having to move around other calculators to see is a hassle sometimes. Thanks. <3 GoVegan 💚",
I wasn't able to sign up either on the app or on the web. Pls work on it,
"This app seems fine, except my child has Asperger's and it is not Spectrum friendly.",
it's great it helps me understand subjects that I have a hard time with. Also helped me learn more than my class.,
"The app is great, helpful resources and all free of cost, makes learning more fun and easily accessible. The only flaw would be the fact that my bookmarks are not accessible offline even though I have downloaded them. It would be much better if I were able to study anywhere anytime even when there is connection problems.",
"Great app, really easy to use, well presented, good links to the Khan Academy YouTube videos which are always helpfully and clearly explained...theres just one tiny problem. There seems to be a glitch on the number line questions, where when I select the point on the number line there is no way to select or enter an answer, which means I can't complete the tests containing those questions. Any idea how to fix this? Otherwise great, thank you so much!",
Best online learning platform which is completely free and has a great quality resources. The visuals and the diagrams are so good that it makes the topic crystal clear in one go. Really satisfied with the content in the app. I appreciate the efforts put in by all the faculties and the background team. Thank you very much for creating this fantabulous app.,
"Best free learning app ever. All the basic and high level concepts are explained in very simple manner. All courses from 1 to University level are available all for free!. It offers not only the general courses but also many unique courses such as Art History, Computer and Internet, Economics, and many more.The app is also very smooth to use. I personally didn't faced any bugs in it. Thank you Team Khan Academy for making such a wonderful platform where anyone can learn for free with ease.",
"I am absolutely in love with Khan Academy. I downloaded the kids version for my brother too. It's awesome, worth it! Whoever sees my review, just go for it without wasting a second. There's one thing I'd like the developers to add in the app: Please add the online quiz option in the app, so we can compete with other students as well. This would be so great and so fun and would be a great idea for more interactive learning! Thank you for this great app!",
"I can learn math, sciences, economic, history, etc for free on khanacademy. It was mainly made for learning math. As the time pass, they added science, economic, humanities, computing, etc. I don't recommend you to use this to learn to code or learning programming languages. They lack of those stuffs. But it's still useful for general knowledge. It doesn't have some features that I find in web version like the questions/tips & thanks and changing the video quality.",
"Good Day! I would like to say that this app is great I learned quickly because of how you approach the topic. One thing I wanted to ask is that whenever I open a document after watching your video it's just a blank page? Even though my internet is fast and there's another one, when I'm taking your exercises/quiz it's giving me a pop up error. I can't earn points because of that I would be giving a 5 star if you fix that problem. Overall, great app",
I like it Because it help us to learn math easily,
A must-have app if you are aiming to ace every subject in school. I totally love it<3 wish i downloaded it sooner.,
"This app is amazing. I'm preparing to go back to Uni in the next year or two, I need to complete many things that I missed before, it seems to have everything and very ordered the fact that it has built in Excrices is very important, I have a little Issue with using external mouse and keyboard but I all ready addressed the team and I believe they will fix it in the future.",
This app is one of the best educational medium . The concepts are very illustrative explained which makes us to fall In love with the topic or the subject. I have 0 complains about the app and it helps me clear all doubts and solutions . The videos aren't too long so it's easy to grab . Teaching using analogies is very great and I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to understand subjects and topics conceptually,
Amazing education platform and quality teaching.,
"Whoever designed this app did a pretty terrible job. Even though auto-rotate is turned off, any slight movement of the phone will force the screen to rotate back on forth. Also, I forgot whether this was on the app or website, pausing to work the problems will covered up part of the screen with the title and YouTube logo. If the auto-rotate is ever fixed, I will gladly donate something to the cause. I can't tell if It's poor programming or some sort of messed up less angular rotation.",
"Great app ,all subjects covered and also free .Most beneificial for students of every age group .",
"I love this app sooo much. It has the greatest feature in helping you prepare and equip yourself with anything you want. I can't count how many times it has helped with tests and exams and sometimes when I don't understand my teachers I come here. From the notes, to the videos and the questions set up for you with mastery points. I would greatly recommend this to anyone, you don't have to pay for anything which is quite amazing on its own. Khan academy is the real deal!!!!!!!",
"This app is the best when it comes to education, and it is totally free. Other apps don't even come close, the instruction quality is unmatched. The concepts are explained in simple and crystal-clear manner. It has been so useful for me in understanding lessons, and even the little things/details that were totally skipped over by my high school teachers. Hats off to Khan Academy!",
"As a 15 year old secondary student struggling to do maths prior to using this app; and gaining the biggest boost in proficiency, Khan Academy is the best if not one of when it comes to maths. The videos demonstrating are great and easy to understand for me. Because of this app, I've sharpen skills with maths, even starting to like the subject. However, I do have a problem with some of the UI. When I use the app in the explore section, its hard to see the search, so staff please make a dark theme",
"I recommend this to people who's struggling with math and science. Although some courses are missing. Not sure if it's just me but some courses available in the desktop website (e.g. Computer Animation, Programming etc...) is nowhere to be found in this mobile app. Please add ALL of your available courses in the app and update the app regularly. Also please add practice tests and quizzes in your Science course, make it very similar to your Math course. The math course is perfect so far!",
Tears rolled down from my eyes when i see that all courses are arranged properly. And application is totally free .🥺✨💜,
"I only downloaded this application for maths but I was delighted to see that there were many other mini courses on self improvement as well and managing finances. The courses are well thought out and organized, they are explained in a way that you can easily understand. Thank you for creating all this content and access to it free.",
"I really like this app, I appreciate what you are providing . I am learning math its really easy to understand. I am having issues opening the video to a full screen, the button is hallow and wont repsond when clicking on it , never had that issue before. I tried to update it says pending, so i saw that you recomeded to uninstall and reinstall so I did, now I try to reinstall it and it says pending download. so I'm completely stumped and don't know what to do.",
"I usually use the chrome version, so let's see how is the app. At least the chrome version is excellent",
Great app but wish when you were doing a quiz the back button just minimized the keyboard rather than making you exit the quiz.,
"The best learning app I've ever come across! So easy to use, so many courses completely free and diversity of courses...just wow! Short videos help me to learn online without getting bored, they become more engaging. Amazing test papers which are short as well, hardly 10 questions....and those notes and points you add in the documents are so helpful. The strategy of mocking slightly in documents and videos makes me feel as if the teacher knows me so well and is teaching sitting right next to me.",
Been using this from grade 2 and now I am in 11th and khan academy has never let me down (I'm a topper just because of them tehehe),
I really like the app and it's simple ui to learn The only thing I want is that if they support the comments feature of their website on the app and mastery challenge for all subjects it will be a killer,
"It's amazing. It teaches you just about everything you learn in school and more, I can get ahead in my classes, on top of that it's free and no adds. I love it (especially the computer programming) though I wish it had something for learning languages, it's free so I can't complain. BEST APP EVER!!!",
"One of the most amazing apps to have for Learning! A must for everyone in my opinon, education should be free and thats what they are doing so i give these guys a 10/10",
"Very phenomenal app. A godsend to almost all of us students. Though I have problems with downloaded videos. I download them and then after a while, whenever I try to open Khan Academy it just crashes. Which makes me wipe the data from the app, and start all over again. I hope this gets fixed soon.",
"I'm a grown man with no college experience, who barely passed highschool. This is exactly what I need to help me prepare for an entry exam for a new trade I wish to enter. No distracting ads. No frills, animations, or alternative learning techniques. Perfect! Please don't change.",
I love this app! it really helps me to understand the concept of what I'm learning and has a wide verity of topics. from animation to math there is something interesting for everyone to learn. when you get something wrong you can come back to the question or get help to finish it. all and all its a great app.,
The app was good until the newest update. It resets progress whenever I load a course. But I don't think it is actually resetting the progress because it is still there when I use the browser version. It is a visual glitch. Also some courses do not load (Calculus) and it tells me to check my internet connection but other courses work fine. So yeah. Fixing these bugs would help me a lot. Edit: Reinstalling the app worked! Thanks Dev!! 5/5,
"Easy to use, no ads, actually take the time to go through their courses and you might learn a thing or two.",
OMG I absolutely love this learning app for my youngest son he's preschool age and it is amazing! He can navigate it himself and he's a little bit behind for his age because he was born a twin and very premature so he's catching up he does really well with that as well as knowing what sections there are like videos there's coloring there's math logic sight words spelling I can't think of all the tabs are you can set it up by a name and age too for each child that you have!,
"Khan Academy is just amazing. It is by far the best educational app I've encountered. It's even better than my own school's curriculum! Everyday, I go to school with the environment of ""studying to get good grades"" and ""studying to get a job"" surrounding me every second; and it makes me sad just to think about how much kids are brainwashed into thinking this way. But this app is my getaway; a place where I can actually feel like I'm STUDYING - not memorizing words. For that, thank you so much.",
"I love this app. I'm learning AP Statistics and the videos are so clear and easy to follow, and the exercises are superb for solidifying the new information. I look forward to learning more subjects on this platform in the future! Best of all, this level of quality is for no cost-- unheard of.",
"Everything on the app is so insanely well-made! From the appropriate keyboards for each problem to the explanations of the solutions, Khan Academy misses nothing. I just had to write this because I was stuck at a Trigonometric problem and I had a specific doubt within the solution and what do you know! The explanation had explanations for each step. Not only is this a free learning app, but it also goes above and beyond to make it user-friendly.",
"I'm amazed that this is free, this app teaches Math really well, you can even use it to grasp the basics of your upcoming grade. For example if you are in Grade 7 you can go do some prep for Grade 8 so when you actually do Grade 8 it'll probably be a lot easier for you haha. This app also teaches other kinds of topics like prep for several exams, prep for college, history, I think a little bit about computers and programming too? There wasn't ads too O.O overall, pretty good app ♡",
This app is very Good for me....No tutorial class needed....khan Academy made my dream successful and my progress better than last year 😄.....,
"First of all, I'm not knocking Khan Academy's content. It's the app I dislike. It doesn't keep its state (like the YouTube app) and it feels clunky. The keyboard is painful to use and it's evident that it's just a website. It's also hard to search for lessons. You can't go to an exercise that's part of a lesson to go that lesson. Instead you have to find a video and then go to the lesson you were looking for. Khan Academy is still much easier to use in a browser on a larger screen.",
"Had given more 🌟 s if possible. Its the best app. Its clears all my doubts with easy to understand language. Covers very wide range of topics in all subjects. Articles, videos and exercises, all are just flawlessly awesome. I would suggest every student to give this a try. Its helping me alot during my career building years. Thanks for such a beautiful representation of knowlegde.",
"just installed the app. Had clicked on practice, and a pop-up ""Error making task progress. We encountered an error while attempting to make progress in this task; please try again later"" appeared. I waited, and tried again. Repeated the wait and try approach, a few more times. Received the same pop-up each time. Can't give more stars until I know what the app does, other than a pop-up error. (Not going to try uninstalling and reinstalling) If the app works later, more stars. If same issue...",
"I am a home school parent who LOVES the courses offered at Khan Academy and I can easily incorporate it into my curriculum on Google Classroom. My only issue is that when I try to use my tablet, the app seems to have me as a student , and I am not able to pull up the courses to check work turned in or assign new work. If i cold find a way to do that, this would be a perfect experience.",
Excellent easy to follow and understand. I've been out of school for 30 years and needed to relearn/refresh my memory to help my middle school son and this worked wonders. I was an expert in literally 20 minutes after 5 videos. Took a 4 question quiz after and got a perfect score.,
"You guys are absolutely amazing. Wouldn't be able to fit how much praise i have for you in 500 characters. But i can fit a little suggestion😅, it would be great if there was an option to change video quality or if you could make it so that the sound quality wasn't affected when the video quality drops due to bad internet connection on the users part.",
"Awesome app, but it crashes as soon as I download and open it. I tried many times but the home page just crashes. All other pages like search, are fine, just the home page crashes and because of that, I can't use the app. I hope you fix this issue. I tried all those tricks but still not working. I even sent a complaint. I have submitted a request at Khan academy help center",
"Awesome app. I am so thankful that it's all free content. I first downloaded this to refresh on math before my placement test for going back to college (I hadn't done a math problem in almost 6 years, so I started from Kindergarten and worked my way up to algebra within a month and a half) and I ended up being placed into college level algebra. I felt so relieved and at ease during the test. I now use it for fun, brushing up on many more subjects. Love the app, thank you so much!",
"Looks like I found a bug in the application. In front page, when I select ""see all"" of ""Math"" , a list of all available maths courses comes on screen. Then I select ""Algebra (All content)"" it open another page contains another list. Everything is fine till here. But when I scroll down this last list till the very end, the page start showing unusual behavior like e.g. scrolling up. It looks like a loop activate at the very end. Hope this help. Other than this issue, user experience is awesome and I started using it in my free time.",
"The material being offered here is indispensable top rated A+. Although, I liked the older look (minus a star) it looked prettier(This design looks to me like 1990's that I've seen Minimalistic. The list design is awful in my view and gets worse as it gets populated with more content endless scrolling. Welcome 1990's!). Thanks",
"Hello, i would rate it 5 stars but there's been an issue with the app for the past few days. Everytime I open the app, it gives me a white blank screen and when I try to tap on the subject i'm learning on, it doesn't open. I did uninstall and reinstall the app a couple times but it still doesn't want to work.",
"In my life, I could never have such High quality and in-depth education but in this app I'm getting this education for free! Thank you Sal and Khan academy team.",
"This is from far the best app to study advanced topics. I am 15 years old and I have some difficulties to understand the class lessons, but your app help me to understand topics that I will learn only when I will be in College. Thanks to offer this lessons for free. - From a French student who have bad grades.",
"One simple feature would make it 5 stars. Allow me to put videos on an sd card. I can't believe that this isn't a feature already; that's a standard thing. Almost all of my apps already support that. I was astounded when I found out that this app doesn't support putting downloads onto mounted sd cards. This will stay 1 star until this is added, because otherwise I'll just watch on my computer and save battery power and data.",
This app is very good but it needs some improvement. Some of them are to have better voice quality because in some videos audio gets weird so it is hard to understand and it also does not show subscript and transcript also . please fix it.you should also add a section for doubts. Also you should add the missing chapters.,
"Would really like to give it more stars but it won't even open on my android phone. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it's still crashing before it even opens. I hope you guys can roll out some bug fixes on the next update, but I'm not even able to use it so I'm uninstalling it for now. I'm still able to use khan academy through the browser on my computer. But it would be nice to have it available on my phone. Update: still doesn't work. :(",
"Very very good app. I understand all the concepts through this app. The topic projectile motion which was supposed to be the hardest topic became my strongest. The concepts are explained clearly. But there is only one flaw, sometimes I am not able to load my courses but after one hour I am able to do so. I would like the khan academy team to please fix this bug. Thank you for making education such a great experience for me",
It can be a super good app for teaching your kids but for lower grades their is no sicence for kids under middle school and their is no reading.,
"I had this app eons ago and it worked. I just downloaded today it none of the courses are loading to due being ""unable to connect"", despite the fact that I'm in the very room where the Internet source is AND I've turned mobile data. Both cylinders running, the courses don't even try to load. I'll stick with the desktop version until this is fixed.",
"it's very educatioal and the instructors are incredible at teaching, however, specific questions with the interactive boxes which open up options dont work. for example, most comparison maths questions have this box, where when you click it, its supposed to open into a list of available choices like < >. these don't work. and algebraic questions where you have to express variables dont work either because we are forced to use the khanacademy input keyboard, and can't type letters.",
"I think this app is very nice! Just a great addition if you would motivate students on a daily basis to do well in their performance of learning. Let's say they mess up countless of times and want to give up maybe even studying. Motivating the student would be cool and wonderful especially for growth, progress, and development! Maybe the avatar of the student's profile is awful to tell the student to do their best and never give up because if they fail, what are they gonna lose?? Just a gr8 idea",
"3 stars for its content. I love the way the lessons were presented. I recently graduated college and almost forgot all my HS lessons but the presentation of the topics were so good not only because it was easy to understand and I was refreshed by the subject matter but I also learned new things that I didn't before. The only problem was that even though I downloaded the content, I can't load it until I have wifi. That's a problem cause I don't use wifi while studying since its distracting.",
"This is an awesome app! There are two reasons due to which it did not get the fifth star, first is that there should be option to download only a particular video rather a whole topic, or at least its particular sub-topic; and, I needed to select the Chemistry 12 (India) and Physics 12 (India) as the courses which are not there but instead there is Physics & Chemistry library respectively, which has more than what I need so it takes time to refine my stuff.",
Please arrange the videos in order when we filters the videos like for example equations and inequalities all the videos are jumbled up and I won't know where to start so I don't have to mindlessly scroll to find the right order of the videos. Amazing app though,
"Absolutely perfect, 30 year old student taking calc 2, calc based physics one and engineering statics this upcoming semester. Never fully grasped trigonometry in its entirety, but the course content in this app helped fill in the gaps. The layout is perfect, the videos are very intuitive and everything is very easy to follow. Love that you can speed up playback. 2x speed cuts down total time and makes studying/practicing during during lunch break at work very doable. Double plus good.",
"What an amazing app! The lessons are discussed very well and not rushed, showing examples and explaining the concepts behind it. There are even exercises and test afterwards to show what you need to improve upon. It really helps me to prepare for the CETs as I am saving for my college so I can't spend money in review centers but this app provides what I need for free! So thank you Khan Academy for this wonderful thing you created and please continue to help a lot of students like myself.",
I love Khan Academy. I just wish the app was just like the online version but it's not. This is setup like a collection of videos not full courses like the online version is set up. If I'm wrong I totally missed something. Even still it's not clear on how to find a course. I'm disappointed.,
Started learning mathematics and biology from scratch and I feel like an expert already. I especially like that the videos are short and engaging. So many courses offered free of charge. Pretty sure you can find a subject that will interest you. Including programming and coding if you are into that. The leveling up in points makes this learning seem like a game. I wonder if I could get to a million points by the end of 2021. Stay tuned. Please download and learn stuff. You will be glad you did.,
"Make it dyslexia friendly. There needs to be an option to try again and still get 100%. I already have to read questions 5 times just to get it wrong anyway. I get the cosepts just fine, but I can not fix dyslexia, give an option to redo questions to get 100% without repeating the whole thing. I did the same reading practice 6 times in a row and can not get 100% and it's always by 1 question. That means I answered 18 question correctly, I only need 4 to master it so give me 100%.",
"Its free, a lot of videos, can be used when offline, etc. This is absolutely amazing app but we can't save it to SD Card. The problem is, my storage are minimum while my SD Card have a lot of free space. If you add a feature to make us able to save it on SD Card. That would be great :)",
"the content that I am seeing is good, but placing the dots on the points is tedious and could use some work, can't see the dot or the point under a finger to line them up except by guesswork, and on problems where multiple dots need to hit the same point, if I missed, I would have to move the whole line and start over until I got them both in the right spot. some sort of arrow controls, or something might make the geometry sections more user friendly. for this alone, i will only give three star",
I really like this app. The videos are really informative and it's really fun to learn. But I would really appreciate if you had a desktop app too. Because when I want to see it in the browser it always says that there is a threat and none of the videos play. I have tried it in a lot of browsers but the same problem persists. So pls consider this request as I like to learn in a PC rather than in a phone.,
It is the best app. I had many problems with my studies and during lockdown i couldn't join any tuition and my school teachers do not teach well as i m in government school. I m not saying that teachers in government schools are bad but in my school actually they are. It is the truth. They couldn't even able to solve my doubts. I looked for many apps and i also tried utube classes but this app was only able to help me. It is a great app. Thanks for providing best videos for free. Thank u ❤.,
"I liked it. It really prepared me for grades ahead of me. I passed each grades levels when I used this. The videos are really educated, like professional people. But, I have ONE problem. I was watching a video for math, btw, great studies, but, I started off, and I ended learning about a sculpture of an eye, Wich I didn't have to learn unless I signed up for the class in school, but, I thought I was learning everything, but truly, I was learning nothing I had to. Overall great app🤯🤯🤯",
"The Best! Hands down, easily the best app you can possibly find here. 100% good quailty user experience. This is app is in right , the standard any app developer should use as a model. NO AD'S, works 100% of the time. Easy navigation, smooth user interface. excellent content, no subscriptions, just an email to login. Thank you! its apps like these that not only inspire me to become a financial donater, but an ambassador for it.",
"Awesome app! One thing that could be improved: back button on an exercise screen should close the keyboard first and only then (maybe after a confirmation popup) get back to the unit screen. It's the standard behavior of Android apps, and the current behavior of the app is a bit frustrating.",
This app should give an option of recap for high & higher secondary school student so that they could learn in a faster way As I am using this app whenever I got confused I have to start the topic from the begining to understand it if their a option of recap it could be pretty efficient.,
"Great app, with great material. One thing I would like to see added though are documents covering every subject, instead of requiring the user to watch videos. On some subjects, there are review texts, which is great, but it would be better if those kinds of materials were available for all content.",
"The app is great for learning, but after the up date I have been experiencing some problems. When ever i try to open a video from the exercises it always says ""please try again later"" all the other videos work fine except the ones in the exercises, but luckly I can look them hp on YouTube. And on one of the exercises I am doing with Distributive Properties I can't use the parenthesis for my answers. I hope these problems get fixed.",
"Khan Academy is undoubtedly one of the best learning apps, I daresay it is the best of all. The instructors have a high knowledge of the subject they teach, and they impart the knowledge in an easy and understandable way. The badges they give you on completing any challenge makes studying more fun and you actually look forward to it. Great experience!👍",
"I feel frustrated by the app as it crashes as soon as it starts instead of just running smoothly which has wasted a lot of my time, moreover, I have reinstalled the app a couple of times but the problem still persists to exist and as a prospective user this is quite an awful experience for me. It would be kind enough if you just fix it so that others like me wouldn't have to face the same problem.",
"The website is great, but this app is useless. Not a single exercise loads, they all show a ""Error making task progress"" message. And YES, I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it like you recommend to all the people complaining below. Has that actually fixed it for anyone? Is there a single phone that this app actually works properly on? I guess the only option is to use the site (which is slower), or maybe there's an older version of the app that actually works properly?",
"It is a nice and clean app for learning. I can watch videos or download and watch them later. There are courses on different interests. I can add courses of my interest to my library and organize them. Everything is free, there are no Ads, app interface is so smooth.",
There are two problems in the app. 1. If you scroll down to the bottom of any course a sort of glitch happens Which scroll you back up. It is kind of an inconvenience for someone trying to get a brief on what's in the topic. 2. If you speed up your video you might not be able to see last few seconds of the video which is frustrating as we not only cannot see the video but also our progress is mismatched I hope the issues can be solved cause this is actually a great app for learning.,
"Khan academy has helped me a lot with my study, the courses are great and the instructors (especially Sal) explain the concepts in a concise and easy to understand way. I used to hate maths a lot, but after finishing the AP Calculus course in Khan Academy, i can't get through a day without solving a calculus problem. Sal just knows very well how to deliver concepts that can be understood easily. One thing i don't like from the recent update is the auto rotation feature, pls get rid of it.",
"It's very nice, however it would be even better if we could translate the subtitles inside the app, since when can do so, or at least select another subtitle language throughout YouTube. Also another suggestion would be letting users watch materials from any language, not just the one they've selected.",
"Very excellent app. I'm sorry for giving a one star rating! But I'm unable to edit my courses. It says ""we were unable to load the latest content"" even though my internet connection is good. I request you to kindly fix this issue. After that, I'd love to give a 5 star rating to your amazing work ♥️. EDIT: Yeah... problem fixed 😀. Even five stars is not enough for this wonderful app. I'm really astonished by their quick response. Definitely try it or else you will be missing something amazing ♥️",
"Broken interaction with drawing tools such as angle construction. Repeatedly fails correct user input. I have a screenshot of an example if the dev cares. Something as rudimentary as drawing a 70° angle should not frustrate a learner to the point of walking away, but being told you're wrong when you're not is gas-lighting and will have that effect.",
This is absolutely awesome and it's all free too,
"Waaaaay, waaaay better than the app I tried to use years ago, which may as well have been a different site with how rudimentary it was. However, this app still really needs some more love, it's kinda a mess to navigate and just doesn't have the same charm as browser site, and that feels like an important thing when appealing largely to a younger audience, esp kids. Tl;dr more or less perfectly functional, looks clean, but clunky UI. Really, just should be brought in line with site",
"Preparatory Students of SAT can take tests online and offline both. Basic learning of maths video are present in this app. In Videos tutor's voice sometimes getting not hearable and in some video's voice is boring. many learning videos of IIT-JEE is not authentic. Overall running performance is good, sometimes it get stuck-upped while taking test (appearing of next question time is too high sometimes and in some cases next question and it's of not display. It requires some improvement in above described area.",
"This app taught me a lots of things and it will more in the future. In my most needed times it has shown me that everything is learnable. You guys keep on improving as I watch your growth. But before that you need to add a lot more sub topics. I appreciate very much that you dedicated a seperate branch for India, but India as a whole doesn't follow a single educational system. So please keep on going. Though I hope the auto rotate can be resolved as well the need of dark mode.",
"Its a good app, just no Discrete Math. Developers any thoughts why its not there or maybe its named differently?",
"Absolutely stunning experience with pen on Note smartphone. Opened in split screen with notepad and calculator floating in the window. Reason why not full 5 stars - there is no percentage on quizes. I always have to go on the web, check where to go next (where I don't have 100%) and then return to app.",
"the app crashes when i try to open the semiconductors's glossary which as of now i can't find directly in the app but as i had watched those earlier, i still have an option to go back to them through the recent activity section but as soon as i click the the app crashes no matter that the content is available and the one video is still playing but what use it is of if i can't watch the desired video. please see to it asap. p. s: - both the physics(class XI india) and class 12 india are nowhere",
Add rotation lock in video player. It is very annoying....... {Please🙏 add dark theme..} Best quality education. One cannot get this good education even by paying anywhere in the world. Both basic and complicated concepts defined very clearly.,
Absolutly fantastic! I was think about getting a private tutor before i found this app and it has everything i need and i enjoy the way it teaches the concepts and clearly explains them. I had a hard time lerning in highschool and have since wanted to continue my mathematical education. Thanks Kahn Academy! you have changed my life for the better!,
"I have been using khan academy since 2020 and today I am 11th. I highly request khan team to revisit the lectures to add more new concepts, topics and harder questions. To learn NCERT, Khan Academy is superb but for exam preparation it falls down. The question that came in 10th boards 2022 was nothing told by khan academy. So, It's a request. 😔",
"In math kindergarten teens unit quiz second exercise is incorrect. Is 15 cats ,not the 17 But sometimes you can scroll horizontal, but not in this case:)",
"This version is not responsive to touch at all, it takes a lot of time to react to my touch input which should be instant otherwise. Please improve the touch responsiveness, the last best version was 5.2.5, after that the app has become buggy. Also please disable the auto rotate to landscape or portrait feature, it's just not perfect and works even when my device's auto rotate is turned off. It's annoying & randomly changes orientation often, distracting me from concentrating. kindly fix these.",
"I rarely write reviews, if ever, and I had high expectations for this app. Don't get me wrong, Khan academy is a very informational website, good for learning. The app however is very buggy and glitchy, deletes my progress every few minutes and makes me restart, saying ""Error Making Task Progress"". Nothing wrong with my internet connection, just the app. If the app is fixed, I will change my review. Until then, save yourselves the headache and frustration and just use the website. Disappointed.",
"Everything's great about this app: simple explanations of complicated topics, related problems to fix learned material in your head, interface, availability of wide range of subjects, test preps and much more. And all of that for FREE! I started learning maths from scratch at 10th grade with this awesome app and now I'm finishing trigonometry and about to start statistics and probability. This app is the epitome of ""everybody can learn literally whatever he/she wants and be very good at it.""",
"This has been so great for studying for exams for college, but I am sad they are removing those resources this year, and it is unclear if those videos will remain on their YouTube channel, and same for the partner content. Also if I were to change anything else I wish we had badges for completing partner content or specific courses in general.",
App will not load. Now the website doesn't work.,
"I have used Khan Academy a lot from their website and loved it and now tried the app. When doing math exercises in the review section, the app's own keyboard for the exercise is partly covered by the zoom in/out button so I can't use the lower right corner of the keyboard at all. I can't complete the practice exercises at all.",
"This app is one of the best learning guides for students of all ages; from primary pupils to adults it's a really useful website, that's not only great at teaching but absolutely free. I really enjoy studying on this app, because it encourages me to have a go at experiencing hard subjects.",
This aap is amazing.First it's free and also apart from school subjects it offers other lessons like computer programming.I really love it.,
"The app is good, Helpful even it consist grades 1-Highschool lessons, dont know of College tho...But it might contain some.... First, I was in the topic of ""Shapes"" in Arithmetic, it was good and all but starting from ""right angles in shapes (informal Definition)"" the pictures wont appear... Even the choices doesnt have pictures, it just leaves a blank big space...(╥_╥) pls fix...I LOVE THE APP( TДT)",
This app is so good bro it has everything you need for school!!!,
"Fantastic! It's a very great learning experience for people. It's easy to operate as well. Please add some customization to the app though, such as dark mode or custom coloring.",
"The quizzes are horrendously done. They will mark a correct answer as wrong. My answer is checked via an online graphing calculator, calculus equations solvers, and/or other such computer programs. These agree with and confirm my answer, yet somehow Kahns answer is completely different. Further, there is no way to report an error in a question/solution/video. Not to mention the frustration of the way the unit tests and quizzes work, which other reviews have covered.",
"This is the best studying app that I have ever used. It's got interesting videos on literally all my portions and I can cover up on everything even if I have missed one or two of my school classes. The tutor is great. He keeps the lesson going interesting. Most of the other videos in other apps gets boring after a while. But here, I love the tutor and it wants me to keep up with my lessons. Great app. The BEST APP",
"This app is phenomenal in teaching! I recommend it. The only suggestion I have is to add a button which resets the Quiz/Activity attempts and answers so when I make a silly mistake, I can retake the activity from start to finish avoinding the same mistake. Otherwise, it's a great app!",
Its a good app but way too many bugs but overall it's good 💯,
"I want to give it 5 stars for the content, idea and mission... however i can not find on the app autoplay option for videos, even worse there is no one click to go to the next video in landscape mode (like there is on youtube), which wastes a lot of energy and time, especielly while exercising (e.g. stationary bike). I will revise my review if there is an autoplay option. I am using android on samsung note phone.",
The thing adout this app that i dont like is because you can not have full use of app .It takes tooo much time loading even when the wifi is at full capacity 😬😡😡😡,
"It's good for helping with my maths alevel course however, it would be a lot better if there was an option for the British curriculum as it can get confusing, especially since this is based on the American curriculum so the content of the courses differ and their names differ as well.",
"It is an awesome app for me at India. Left with a lot of choices, I chose Khan Academy because it interprets every concept in a detailed and fun perspective. Gaining points along with exiting and cool badges motivates us to excel more in academics. I thank the entire team of Khan Academy for such a great initiative of rendering high-class for free to everyone.🤩🤩💖🙏🏻",
for the love of God please remove auto screen rotation or at least give us an option to disable it. the app was working just fine without it. I don't see why it had to be added in. I enter full-screen in horizontal and at the slightest rotation it goes back to vertical. I cannot watch any videos on the app in full-screen anymore.,
"I'm currently stuck at pre-algebra(arithmetic- dustributive property) and I can't get through it because the app doesn't allow parentheses and I can't even copy or paste to add them. I""ll have to stop my math lessons for a long time because of this detour which causes me to have to travel long distances just to answer 7 questions.",
"This is the best study app I've ever used. You can learn anything here for free! Yep, there are no subscriptions needed to unlock certain lessons which is really really good! However, if it's possible, I want the Khan Academy team to add Indonesia language version because I can't really understand maths in any other language beside my native language :D",
It was working fine at first but when they added new content in the computer science part. I suddenly lost some of my progress. The articles I already read are no longer marked as read and the videos I already watched are no longer marked as watched. Edit: I reported the bug to your website. I hope it will get resolved soon.,
I like the app very much. But playing the quiz part in mobile is seriously a pain in the arse. Dragging and placing things alter every other thing and also gets stuck often and it frustrates me everytime. And even if I manage to arrange everything right it shows Wrong. I stopped playing the quiz totally. Please change the quiz interface in mobile.,
"When I complete a video, it marks it as completed, but when I press the back button to go to the next video it shows that I didn't watch the video I just watched. I reset the app and it still said I hadn't watched the video. So, I rewatched it. It did the exact same thing. I uninstalled the app and it still shows I didn't watch it. And whenever I try to watch a video in the Pixar in a Box course, it crashes. It will get a few seconds in the video, but then crash soon after. Please fix these bugs",
The app is great but it actually doesn't update the information and content on various subjects and all new videos are only available on YouTube which is quite unessential also I would like dark mode and better performance because it crashes a lot even website has same errors everything else is great. Please also make the browser needing courses inside the app like programming.,
"It is very good app . It captures all of the doubts about the text with very nice explanation , example,and many more. But 🙂🙄🙄🙄🙄😒 it will be better if you would add individual topics for biology for different classes just like physics and chemistry.",
"Best place to learn. Could be better if it had restart button for tests, at least for adult learners (sometimes you can accidentally hit wrong button when answer, and you'll have to answer all test until it let's you restart, it can be very frustrating, it WAS very frustrating, no matter PC or mobile version )",
"I am 59 years old and do not have to worry about exams. But this app is refreshing my learned memory from the past. The app contains broad range of topics presented succinctly, both in audio form and transcribed form. For students the app will clarify and educate you in different subjects Important to you. Incidentally I didn't encounter one AD thus far.",
"Amazing! I totally like this app. The way they teach is awesome. Everything is taught in an easy-to-learn manner. The tests are also good, and help improving the concept. I would recommend everyone, who needs to learn anything, to use Khan Academy. Keep doing the same Khan Academy team. ALL THE BEST.",
"I have this app for more than two months. It is a little confusing with the layouts. I'm adapting to the look and took a few tries to understand how to use it. There are more classes than the last time I've used it. So far, it does have a positive impact on my life. I'm learning what no one taught me. The app froze a couple of times. This is what I recommend for others to try. The downside is the app freezing through the entire day. Even I restarted my phone.",
"I watch khanAcademy videos on youtube, but here in this app, lectures are very organized and in order. Thanks for this great app khanAcademy. I wish it was the same on youtube! Thanks for getting back to me. My suggestion is doing what you've done in this app, on youtube. Putting videos in chronological order in playlists, and also mentioning prerequisite playlists for each playlist to avoid confusion. It makes sense because students need to study basics 1st and then go for the advanced lessons.",
"I was able to relearn everything that the schools failed to teach me, Khan academy helped me learn and understand subjects that I was struggling with in school. Honestly, I could homeschool myself with the app, its far better, cheaper, exciting, interesting, easier, and more useful than school. With my free time, I teach myself advance math with khan academy. Its great.",
"So I love Khan academy, and it's a great learning platform, but it's so annoying when I try to answer something then get and answer wrong, but it's at the beginning so I have to finish it instead of restarting and trying again. So I think because of that, there should be a restart button for any of the problems you have to do. Other than that I think this is great.",
This app is a good project and the lectures/videos are short and understanding . The questions are asked after every 2 or 3rd video . It helps in keeping up with concepts . I myself recommend it . It helped me a day before my exam a lot . I revised all of my chapters . Thanks to its builder and designers...,
"I think this is an amazing concept and I would love to indulge, but I haven't been able to access any courses/tests. It fails to load with an ""Error making task progress"" prompt. *Edit* I followed the instructions in your response and it works now! Thank you!",
"The content itself is 10/10, no complaints there. Khan academy is an excellent learning resource. The app however is merely servicable. Its slow to respond and becomes nigh unsusable (at least for me) with no access to a dark mode option, that I can find. Looking forward to future improvements.",
"This has got to be my favorite learning app. If it werent for them, my last 2 years of school would have been for nothing because I would have failed. (7th & 8th grade.) Especially math. If you are a student and looking for help on subject, download this. Use it alot. It will help. And lastly, I want to thank the devs for making this app. There would have been no way to pass Algebra 1 without it.",
"It is an amazing experience to learn through Khan Acsdemy. The best thing I like about it is that, Khan Academy teaches through these interactive videos which explains 'Why' questions which I think is very important for kids to answer them. Moreover, we can learn anything from anywhere at anytime at our own pace which is the most beautiful thing about online learning. Khan Academy is the best!!",
"Amazing app! However, hints are broken! During unit tests, when I get to the 2nd part of a hint, I get ""A problem has occurred while attempting to perform this task."" - Even worse, when I go back to the unit test, it resumes where it was, but with a different question",
"When we see any app which is free, we worry about adds and security problems. But KHAN ACADEMY is not one of those apps . 1. Variety of cources are available 2. Clean and neet interface 3. Videos can be downloaded for offline too ***The problem comes when we start downloading videos, no option to store in external memory, the app stucks while changing the tabs from HOME TO SEARCH TO BOOKMARKS. ***In horizontal mode we lack of fracture to continue the next video.",
Khan Academy is a wonderful tool for learning math (other subjects as well) no matter the student's level! The app is easy to navigate and the lessons are comprehensive. I have learned a great deal from Khan Academy and highly recommend it to learners of all skill levels!,
"I chose to study high school biology. More content that I need for English GCSE, I would say it also covers a lot of A-level. Topics are as easy to follow as any course books - but it fits into your pocket and it's free! I also appreciate any learning app that has no adds to distract me.",
"Probably the best app a student could get. Better than those from Byju's. I did prepared for jee mains from this for free, for just one month and was comfortably over the passing line (though did not get enough as to reach a good college, but preparing for just a month it was satisfactory). Really helpful.",
"First off I'd like to point out the fact that Khan does his best to personally adress any issues users have with the app. I'v followed him some time and believe Khan Academy is committed to learning. As for the app, it's simple and not bloated with advertising. It's not going to be what you get in a college course, but it's fantastic for reviewing subjects you have already taken, and just as good to get an introduction to a class your about to take.",
This is the best app for studying maths and physics in my view. The app won't have much animations but the diagrams drawn by them could match. One of the best feature in this app is we can download videos. I'm pretty sure that this app will increase your understanding levels and grip over the subjects.,
"Cannot exit from the app :p Secondly I couldn't find anything about computer languages yet. However it is my first few minutes with this app, may be I could find some later. Edited on 22-Sep-2018: Previously 3 stars and now 4 stars because you people replied to my review at least! However I still can't find ""Exit"" as suggested by you like going to Profile and then tapping Gear icon.",
I give this app only three stars because when I opened a quiz it would say error and I could not take any quizzes or tests. But I can watch videos though. You can't really know what you are learning is in the grade that you are looking for and there is no regular history on this app. Please have more selections for younger children.,
"love everything about this app, except that for some reason all the videos are barely watchable, because each video is...jumbled around like a half finished puzzle. the audio is still there but I cant see whats going on. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling but no luck. would easily give 5 stars if the videos work",
I really like the Khan Academy. It has exercises and videos to help you out with your subjects and is completely free. I like how if you need help with solving a question you can watch a video to help you with it. However some of the ways the guy in the video solves the math problems are quite different from what I am tought so it takes some time to understand what he is doing. Great job guys!,
"I am unable to make any progress on anything. Every time I get started on something, it gives me an error about not being able to save progress, and then everything stops loading. I have tried installing the app, checking my internet connection, clearing the cache, and googling it. Nothing has helped. I want to enjoy this app, but it just doesn't want to work.",
"Amazing free app, to teach children basics in an amazing structure. They get 4-11 questions per section, with a quiz to review and a unit test to ensure understanding. When a question is missed you have a chance to boost the category back up, if a few are missed they drop you down enough points to ensure you redo the area that is giving the student trouble. And it's all set up with percentage and points systems. They send regular emails letting parents know your child's progress, the best tool.",
"Sal Khan is a really great teacher and I find khan academy really helpful. I love the excersizes and articles and the whole idea of mastery learning. However lately I havent been able to load any excersizes at all which is a huge bummer! My internet is fine so I assume its a problem with the network or the app. Would love for it to be fixed! Edit: I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few times now. Still can't do practice, and now its claiming I'm offline which I'm not.",
"Such a helpfull app/website. It's free to use but I recommend at least a small monthly donation if you can afford it to support the good work being done. Nothing Short of a one stop maths shop that's available to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world. I'll admit I lost faith in our future as a species over the last few decades but recent changes in education, renewables and space exploration have given me hope. we're nowhere near there yet but it's looking better.",
"This is a great app and it has been very helpful for me. Particularly, it helped me gain interest in science subjects which i had lost interest in. The only problem i have encountered in the app so far is that after the videos, for some topics like Genetics, there are notes i cannot access. Because of this i cannot get a full learning experience. Also, i would like to suggest that you add a user guide to the app because i still don't know how to enter a class. Thanks for making such a great app!",
It clearly was made with the interest of the child at heart. I highly recommend it and I've tried many learning apps for my toddler over the course of this pandemic. This one is not only ad free but has no distractions while the child is engaged in fun learning activities which are diverse and entertaining aswell! Thank you Khan Academy!,
"Studied, took classes, read books Many of the answers I got on the quizzes were incorrect, when I know I got correct. Either their wording requires a masters in the english language or they're wrong. I even asked my professors and they were confused. And when I back out of a quiz I want to be able to restart, not just continue where I left off",
"It's a great app for students like me but sometimes it is annoying. While i'm taking my practice or test in the app, it always says that they had a problem showing it so ya i have to restart it all over again because i will clear my recent apps so that i can get it to work again. And all of the articles i can't even open, it's frankly annoying. Please fix it, that results always makes me not concentrate in the exercise slash test in the app.",
I have never had a problem in the six years I've used this platform. Khan Academy is unparalleled in its delivery of education as it allows you to go back to the foundations of subjects you've done in High School to fill in the gaps of knowledge you might have needed in order to progress into more complex topics. It's also great for the autodidact. This is my favourite app in the Google Play Store. Any other developers seeking to create a similar atmosphere might want to take some notes.,
Great content but I hate that when I click back to hide the keyboard the exercise gets closed and I lose what I already answered (Back button hides keyboard before actually going back in any other normal apps). And I don't get why tables get zoomed when I click on input cell (this way I have to click twice on the cell in order to edit it and scroll table after) - my screen is big enough for me to see what I type. Also I couldn't find a way to share this bug without writing it here.,
It's too much educational activities and study material for any information regarding this app and helpful for everyone not only students.,
"English is a language, not a measure of intelligence.... but still, could you have a spelling or vocabulary class? Also, I've noticed a lack of accessibility. There's no text to audio options. Lastly, anyway you could be compatible with Google Chrome... or whatever the kids are using? I donate when I can, which ,truthfully, is not that often. But I do have 1,886,112 energy points. This is my favorite video game only equal to doordash... so I hope that gives some weight to my user input",
Until the most recent update everything was working well. But now whenever I view any course I can watch the videos but when I got to take a subject or unit test the page comes up blank except for the green lightbulb icon. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail.,
"I have relearned my maths from kindergarten in case there is somethingihave missed. So far, I'm up to algebra 2 and I understand and appreciate mathematics in a way I never set did during high school. I hope they add multivariate analysis of variance (and possibly SPSS to the statistics course though). Edit: I also agree that there are issues with the app in regards to the user interface when doing quizes, but those issues are minor issues in the grand scheme.",
"The app is very good, I love everything on Khan Academy. I learn everything I have not learned before as I come from a poor school. My grades have been improving. I have many more to learn but my bookmarks are unorganized therefore I demand for an update to fix bookmark. The update I highly wish for is to make the courses categorized by level and grade to make it more easy to find my bookmarked course. Much appreciated. -Ricardo.",
"Honestly, this app is golden. Compared to IXL, this is FAR more entertaining and fun than it. I love sloppiness of the videos. They feel very relaxed and at home feeling, so kudos, Khan academy. But today I was doing a course, was about to complete a unit, then a majority of my progress from that unit was gone! I have to restart it all over again. I'm genuinely disappointed that glitches like this can happen and suggest this problem be addressed ASAP⚠️.Great app, but it got me. For now, 4 stars.",
"It helped me with my studies and precalculus. The speakers are clear, reliable and confident in their words. It's a good learning app for students and adults alike.",
"As a highschool student, i find this app fun and quick. It makes confusing, long, and difficult lessons easy and fast. The only problem that I have with this app is that it doesn't cover everything. Sometimes, if you search for a specific lesson, there will be video that will pop up, but none of them will contain the information that you are looking for. But either than that, it's a great app and it helps me with my math lesson.",
"This app was not for me, thats all i can say, it says 'you can learn anything' well you can't, its mainly about history, maths and science. This was 100% not what i was looking for, if you want to learn about a small range of topics this could be for you, but it just didn't do it for me, all the video's when really YouTube has many more learning resources",
"Please add a dark theme. Light themes are very difficult to use with my form of severe visual impairment. Enabling dark and light theme options, along with font size options would make this app more accessible. Classroom environments pose almost impossible challenges to the visually impaired; online learning resources such as the Kahn Academy offer crucial solutions. Please make your app more accessible.",
"FYI - i also have an iPad so I tried it there as well and it's the same notes. 1 - a critical bug - when I'm viewing something offline and finishes some lessons, when I'm going back online it does NOT mark it as done. Since there is no way to mark a specific video as done, my only option is to set it to x2 speed and let the video run again in order for it to be marked as done. I have more but I reached the limit so feel free to share your email and I'll send the extra notes.",
"Educational app with most of the topic videos. Every student should atleast view the app once and view some topics. It is possible to select the class and the course for studying. Many problem sets alongwith study material and tests are available. Unlike other educational apps, this app is free. What you need is just to create an account. The videos are short and upto the mark. Numerous languages and programing lessons can be learned. It is also available for kids. There are not any adds(best)📚",
"This app is so great and promoting such a great ideology, education should be free and accessible to everyone. I'm exploring so many new things and the lessons are well organized. If possible I would love chromecast feature on the app and also dark mode. But it's not a compulsion. I love it anyway. It's a boon for the entire human race that we are blessed with people who work for such initiatives. Thank you Khan academy.",
"reducing audio quality in low internet speed was a terrible idea. One can deal with low quality video but low quality of audio is intolerable, given that I cannot adjust the video quality. please consider fixing this problem in your next update. The app is great, I love it!",
"It's such a good way of additional teaching, but I feel like those students who knows only Russian are loosing so much by not having the ability to use it. It really deserves 10 stars from 5. But from perspective of Russian speakers it's just a lost opportunity. I mean you even have Belarusian localisation why not to add the main language for so many. I hope some day you will fix it. Best wishes",
"Not very well structured unless you are involved in a standardized class. If you are looking to study a particular thing, you will not be able to find it unless you know what class or grade it is categorized in. For example, I was looking to brush up on my set theory terminology, but there's no way to know where it is in the courses.",
If your child needs help in any subject in school if he's having he or she is having difficulty with anything sound and calm has the ability to change their outlook on learning this is the only app I have ever seen that was able to change my kids Outlook on life basically. If used properly this app will change your family's future. please believe me,
"I'm a regular user and love this app but over the last day or so it wouldn't let me open the app and kept crashing. Now that I can open the app it keeps telling me to sign in or telling me I ""dont have any recent lessons"" which is making me nervous thinking it might have lost my progress. When I click on the lessons (exp. History) it says ""lesson can't be loaded, check network"" I'm on 4g and my signal is fine so I'm thinking it's a bug. I'd love for this to be fixed, It's my main schooling!",
"When the instructors (inevitably) make mistakes, the website version shows the corrections. I hope that soon becomes available in the app as well. Khan Academy is great, the rating is just for the app because it lacks a very important feature.",
"I love learning with Khan Academy. However, this app is not very effective when I'm watching the lecture videos. The app closes on its own. I'm not sure if that's my phone's problem but overall, I love the app, it's easy to use and courses are easily accessible",
This is the most amazing app. but the content feels a little old and you should make different videos for different classes. Some of the videos doesn't seem perfect for the topic. Like they are meant for college courses but you added them in school's.,
"Increeible, very well explained and thorough. Love this, it's a great way to learn something new or complement your studying (I did the statistics course parallel to the one I'm taking at uni and it was a great help!). Also I did it in english, but the translations I saw were very very good (for portuguese and spanish)",
"I love using Khan Academy with my 5th grade students. I downloaded the app so I could quickly and remotely modify assignments and see student progress. Is it possible to switch to the classroom management aspect of my account rather than my personal coursework? If not, this would be an appreciated feature. Keep up the great work!",
"it's very very good that you are helping kids with free courses. i am a 8th class student and i was looking for such an app. your app works good but there can be some changes you can make. first of all the planning and the infrastructure of the app doesn't seems so good which students don't interact to. you can try to make your app more interactive and add other courses for smaller classes best of luck for the future. you are doing an great help. regards, an thirsty student of INDIA",
"I have been using Khan Academy for a while now, and boy, there is plenty of help. I homeschool my daughter, and with the help of Khan Academy, her English is improving, and she understands maths better. Although we still have a long way to go, I feel confident that we, as homeschoolers, will get where we are supposed to be. Thanks to everyone at Khan Academy for helping the children become more informative and bright.",
"Excellent application, I'm learning mathematics on this app just out of interest, and it's got really good content. I really feel that I have learnt so much in Khan Academy, that I can never pay that debt. Sal has inspired me so much. But I do wonder where the scratch pad is, it used to be there with the problems . . . Nice if you could fix that",
"This app is amazing in so many ways. Not only is it free, it also covers a wide array of topics that encourages you to feel as if you're in an interactive classroom set-up that allows you to learn anywhere. Khan Academy has helped me with my studies so much, and it's truly inspiring to be able to have this lovely tool aid in my learning.",
"The system is horrendous. After you've reached 'proficient' on all topics you have to take the unit test to level up. But the unit test is usually 20 questions long and if you're not doing well in one topic and you keep missing 1 question you have to take the 40 minute test all over again. Also, if you get one wrong towards the beginning there is not option to restart, you just have to do the whole thing knowing there is no point. (Also i am required to get all the mastery points for school)",
"It's a really well executed idea and it's really helpful in all my subjects. However, the app feels a bit limited in terms of what it has to offer, much unlike the website. It would be perfect if the app could also have all the features the website does. Nevertheless, it's wonderful!",
"What the hell it's not opening the app and taking me back to the home page even after several attempt I am not able to open the app Edit: I have tried all the steps which you have written before only. There are 3 icons below of home, search and bookmark when it was on home it says unfortunately Khan academy has stopped and when I tapped the search button and searched videos I was able to access everything but the problem is takes me back to homepage when it is at home bar. Regards",
"Thank you for all the effort behind this free app well done! My 2,5 year old loves it, shes figuring out all the options very well plus she gets to interact with SuperSimple videos which were her favourite when she was +- 1. Drawing is her utmost favorite, and we found there was a little issue for us to resize the objects, when one got too small it was trouble, especially for me to put both fingers on it to make it bigger, also those buttons on reading to turn the page cold be slightly bigger.Tnx",
An interactive app that is very useful for studying and learning. Has a variety of videos and challenges. Questions can be asked online and will be answered immediately.. Motivates you by presenting you with badges. I totally recommend it as a student.,
"My device is Oneplus 3t. Offline functionality doesn't work. I like the content otherwise but this is a major issue. Despite having downloaded bookmarks I get the following error message: 'Unable to load video. Check your connection and tap to try again'. I have tried signing out and back in, uninstalling the app, deleting cache ans data. Deleting downloads and redownloading them. Nothing fixes this.",
"Yes, the app is very good, interesting and useful, I like it. BUT since I am russian, I have some difficulties with language, because I do not know English as advanced. So, I (and more of russians) would like russian localisation (subtitles would be a great solution) to appear, it might be great. That's all. Love you, guys. You are doing a great thing))",
"This is the best app for students. Great explanation and also totally 100% free. I like this. I recommend for students if you are stuck on English or maths, this app is totally perfect. The other thing I like this is also available for laptop users. The website seems fine, there's no problem at all. I give this 5 stars! Thank you Khan Academy.",
"more often than not when I open a task, I get an error message. says error making task process. occasionally when I finish a task it will load forever and if I back out it won't save what I did. I love the website, but the app is getting 3 stars until it works better.",
"Love the lessons, but the app isn't the greatest. Free lesson videos and exercises - amazing! But that annoying little ""Correct!"" noise is impossible to turn off, which sucks. I turn the volume up for the videos, then immediately down so i don't have to be subjected to that obnoxious ""Brrring!"" every 20 seconds. Make that mutable, developers!",
"I really love Khan Academy. I have an account online and thats where I usually use it, but I decided to try the app. Whenever I open a video on KA, it plays for a few seconds, then it either goes back to my home screen or my phone turns off. Yesterday it was working fine but now it's not. Which was disappointing because it looked really promising. Hope you guys can fix it because Khan Academy is the best!",
"Personally i think that Khan academy is the best!! Because its very simple to use, has alot of subject, great explanation and best of all its free!! But in my opinion it needs a couple of new features that will make Khan academy better and easier to use, some features that have been suggested by alot of other people too but for now i suggest.. Dark mode! The UI is so bright especially at night when I'm trying to study. My eyes are burning!! 😵😅",
"I love what Sal Khan is doing in the field of education. Providing simple and easy understanding of every basic topic. The amount of work they are putting into the platform is amazing. Physics used to be my least favourite subject until I found how beautiful it is on its complexity from this platform. Even when the Youtube channel works fine, the app has a compiled library of everything I need in one place with no distractions- the only thing I would expect to see is differerent resolutions.",
"I want to suggest for the reading course separating the 2 part questions. I have dyslexia and the 2 part questions are hard to read, all the questions are harder to read than the stories or articles and I can only ever seem to get one part right when doing 2 part questions. I can summarise the passages and answer questions verbally without an issue. If the each part gave a full point I wouldn't feel like I completely failed every time I do a test. Also all answers should be in complete sentences",
Doesn't work. Won't let me create an account contrive to say error despite trying on both phone app and web based sign in.,
"It is really useful for students. They explain concepts in a way that whosoever will be watching that particular concept is bound to be understood. Some people may say that the tests that they provide are too small, but honestly in my opinion, the questions are really accurate and they tend to test your knowledge on the concept. It is a must - have for all students.",
"I have been using khan academy for years now, there are some great lessons that makes learning easy. Yet there are a lot of lessons that make me angry and upset. I watch the videos and do as told yet when I got to the question its doing it in a different way with no real explanation. Khan Academy has its ups and down but be aware of the fact that many students and parents are upset and stressed do to the app.",
"Truly love this app! I have to rely soley on it for school since I'm homeschooled. Never had a problem with it, until the recent update of new courses. I am unable to take any unit test or course challenge (only tried on math so far). The bottom left dot markers for questions move around and it won't let me check my answer once I've entered one in. I tried uninstalling the app, and it helped, but only for 1 question then went back.",
"Your work is truly amazing for providing quality content free of charge (not even ads). ⚠⚠⚠⚠It would be a lot better if you add a video quality option, cuz here in india, majority of students watch on cell network. High quality video when not necessary leads to less streaming limit. We often have fast data speeds and the video quality jumps sky high even when not needed consuming the daily data limit. If this is fixed, watch hours will improve drastically (ensuring with my experience). Thank you☺",
"The platform is very user friendly. There are lessons for parents as well as the students. The lessons are well structured with a very systematic progression of skills. The teachers provide a clear breakdown of skills. You can try a problem several times giving you confidence to continue. There are lessons on a number of different subjects.Around the time of the ‘pandemic crisis’, I have been homeschooling my myself. Khan Academy is my favorite and most used online learning tool presently.",
"i have been using this app to relearn prealgebra and algebra and have found it to be extremely helpful. i have run into a couple issues. When you're struggling and don't get the answers to a quiz or test right on the first try you get the message ""you don't level up."" I am a grown ass adult i find this message to be painful. The second issue I ran into was being tested on things that have not yet been taught. This is a very useful app but is not yet ideal for helping kids.",
"Good for learning however the videos are super long and confusing, such as they hold so much information some people just can't store it in their brains. and it would be nice if the mobile version had noise... it feels creepy compared to the computer version.",
"This app helped me a lot. I used to use and always score high marks but then I stopped using it and went back to looking for YouTube videos and sites and my grades went back down. It's because the app is simple, and even the work it's self is simple. I started using it again and my marks were back to peak. It's so easy to find exactly what I want help in. Thanks for the app😃.",
"I think this is a really GOOD teaching site , there are a lot of gliches but it still works for me . However please do add more lessons to different subjects rather than focusing only on math ... Phy is also a really important subject but there are only 3 or 4 lessons available, so please do add more lessons .. But overall this is a really good app.",
"I love the app its interface is a little confusing, but that's alright. It can be improved by adding an option for the filter to have like exercises, or videos . Also the ""surprise me"" button should have like a feature that let's u pick what subject you want. Also add multiple options or ways of solutions in the explanation for a problem like how photomath does.",
"Khan academy in itself is awesome, superb. For me who gets bored and sometime frustrated by boring classes of school it's a lifesaver. But this app has some major flaws it loads quite slowly and sometimes it doesn't open at all. Also offline saved videos don't get loaded. I hope it will be fixed soon.",
Never felt Maths so interesting until I used Khan academy. Best learning and Sal Sr. Voice is so soothing that you don't feel to stop learning. Love this app ❤️. Great platform to learn basics of everything and master concepts of every lesson. But only needs one improvement that if I make a wrong answer in the test I have to do the test again to bring a full scoring it would be better instead if the wrong answer is again substituted with another question rather than doing it all again. Love 👼♥️,
"I dont like to complain when something useful is offered for free, but it would be nice that after answering answers correctly to level up on a section to be in position to take a test for mastery, that the app wouldn't crash at the exact moment i finish and get an error message saying that my progress was not saved. I don't like to waste time re-doing the same damn questions. other than that definitely a top notch 5 star ***** app",
"As good as it can get for $0. Helped me a lot for my SAT, my AP physics and math classes, and even my economics class. Videos are concise and easy to understand. Practice problems are on the easy side but they build up your basics and allow you to move on to more challenging problems in other resources.",
"Greatest contents but the app crashes. I suspect that If the tab was opened, and try to open another. The last one remains in the background that's why It's consuming a lot of RAM. The lagging only happens when I tried to open multiple sections or threads. Also, there's the delay when the internet is opened and nothing when I'm offline.",
"I am currently in a college math course and was starting to struggle. After going through all the learning resources they have available, I turned to this app to also help me study while in situations where I could only use my phone. I was surprised to find that the content on here is better than what my school has us using. The videos alone are much more informative and easier to understand. I now use this as my primary learning resource to study.",
"Hey, thanks for free learning, i wanna help, there's some errors in the app, for example when I try to scroll throw topics it may lag, which will prevent you from access a certain topic, this happens especially in Algebra all content, and when i try to download materials, sometimes download won't complete no matter how much i try, and even sometimes download may stop suddenly, i appreciate if you fix this 😊",
"I had to uninstall this app because it allows me to ONLY take 9 courses. I'm taking 12 courses at my university and some have practicals. If I can't do all of them, I'm better of doing none. I've switched over to a more effective app. When this is fixed, I'm all ears.",
This is the best app I have ever seen. It teaches all the basic topics clearly so that there is no difficulty in understanding advanced topics. Plus it includes wide range of subjects from computer science to economics. I would specially recommend this app to high school students who think they are lagging behind in studies,
"This is a mobile data killer. It's quite sad that I have to keep downloading video over and over again because whenever the screen backlight goes off I'll have to restart download afresh. It's painful, discouraging, annoying and heartbreaking, especially for someone like me who has to spend through his nose to buy data in a 3rd world country. I am seriously disappointed!",
"I love Khan Academy. You have so many options and can choose any subject of you choice to learn, and unlike other apps and platforms like this...Khan Academy does not bug us by calling and asking..or rather forcing us to buy or pay for something we can't afford (premium membership and other packages). This is the best part of Khan Academy...they let you learn for free... which beneficial for students who can't afford any extra coaching or guidance. Keep it up Khan Academy 🎉🎉⚡⚡",
"Love the app. The content and UI is really great. Some more features could be added though, like manually selecting video quality while streaming and downloading because sometimes the quality is so low, I cannot understand the audio and video. Also, dark mode for nighttime would really help.",
"Here there is no option to control the video quality,here its always playing at high quality we are not wel versed to watch all the videos in high quality so please make a option to control the video quality as 144p,240p,360p,720p like this ,it will be very useful and helpful for many of us who did not have enough money to play all the videos in high quality.. that's the one fault i find in this app and all other things are simple superb.. pls rectify this issue as soon as possible..",
Khan Academy is an absolutely invaluable resource to me and many others and this app allows me to take my learning on the go. It's not has fully featured as the full website but it doesn't need to be and is extremely high quality. The only extra thing I would want that isn't available on the app is the missions from the website. Fantastic app to go with the fantastic service.,
Its an amazing app. But I would like to bring it to notice to the developers about the two main problems in the app. The first one is about the downloads. When downloading large topics(say of 150-200mb size) it stops at 70-80%. When started again it won't download which is very annoying and the problem even persists in latest versions. The second thing is: Plz give space for rough work as given in PC or browser versions. I request the developers to resolve these problem As Soon As Possible...,
"This has been the best app I have had for study. It has a wide range of standard , comprehensive quizzes and test that are a thorough evaluation of their well-organized content, conveniently arranged in an easily accessible manner. I highly recommend it for all students -since they also have a kids version of the app.",
"This is the best learning app I've ever found, and as of now, the only one I trust. All the videos and articles are incredibly thorough and you can learn almost anything-- and all for free. I'm so glad I found this app, I'm literally learning so much everyday, and the best is that your learning experience is all tailored and you go at whatever pace suits you best. It also gives badges and energy points as rewards for learning, which I think is a great way of keeping us motivated. 10/10i love 💜",
"I really like the Khan academy website, but the mobile app does have a few flaws. First of all, the home page only displays your last videos, not your favorite courses or progress. Secondly, my profile's energy points are not updated regularly, and my progress is not shown in the user page.",
"Everything you could need regarding Maths,Science and more.This was really helpful source to look to when i needed a hand with my work.This app us amazing as it not only help you learn but the design & structure is clear and easy to understand.However, I wish you could do something with the points you earn like maybe you could buy things to decorate your avatar maybe or quizzes when you can compete with others. Overall great,useful and quick app.Would recomend.",
"Excellent platform for a student. I was struggling with one lesson that i couldn't even understand myself or by any tutorial but when I watched Khan Academy's videos on that lesson in my native language, I found the lesson easier moreover I aced that chapter in 1 day. Most helpful was the way of teaching and quiz test (given after every lecture) to evaluate ourselves on the particular topic. Most recommend! *Suggestion:-Please try adding some more subjects to the course.* Thanks! Regards 🌷 ☺ ✨",
This is the worst app I have ever used. I have to force quit and clear cache every time i want to open it otherwise it does not load. Clickable links rarely work. It does not record progress properly. I can't do some of the math exercises because the drag and drop functions don't work. The design is appalling.,
"This app is very functional as a learning app and it really helps, but some of the questions it is not possible to answer them, because it is not part of the keyboard to answer them, example: if 6xy +h78. The keyboard will not show"" h ""so u cant answer the question also please add a skip button to be able to skip a question like this, this is why I rate this app a 3 star",
"This is very similar to the browser version, and it works offline, so it is good... in most cases. I can't learn programming in the app, and I hope this will be fixed, as sometimes my browsers are blocked by my parents. Exploring badges also won't work offline. Other than that, it's the same as the normal one :)",
It's getting buggier with every update. Requires a complete overhaul. Especially the video player. It cannot be that hard to design a bug free player. Edit: Tried reinstalling multiple times--didn't work. I've tried the app on other android devices but the results were no different from that of my phone. It's a broken app.,
I really like the fact that my son can learn on the level that he is at without constantly moving up levels until he is capable of having a full understanding of his current level. Public schooling was very confusing for him because they kept passing him on to higher levels before he could get a grasp on any of the levels resulting in continuous failing report cards and progress reports of bad behavior.,
This app may be good but it's not like that what I want. I want to take solution of my text book problems like let me take a pic of my textbook numerical problems and sending that and immediately taking a detailed explanation of that solution. It should be free and if there is video lectures that will be great. Is like this type of any app for bcom final year then please inform me,
"I know I shouldn't complain since it's free, but I've been having a few probs. I open the articles (e.g. article on Kirchhoff's law) and before I even get the chance to read it, the who app closes. And, after watching a few videos & replaying them, my score (points) is still the same as when I first installed the app.",
I've been searching for years for a good Math book. I tried academically approved math books but found them confusing. They're written with the expectations like you already know the math. They're written for the teacher not the learning student. Being an adult I recall giving up on math in 10th grade and just tried enough to pass. This place is speeding me up to college level math. I'll soon be able to take the required math classes for my program without challenge.,
"The app is not awesome but the community behind it is. It is just a simple app but the content on it is great. I now see education in a different perspective and in a good way. All because of khan academy. The teachers teach nicely and thoroughly. The revision test are all great. The point system is so well implemented, I have 0.9 million points approx. I am addicted to learning now. Spending most of my time giving test and watching lessons. It also ticks the lessons you have seen. Thanks a lot.",
"It is the only thing I have to use for Algebra and Science. I stay on this site because they are the only ones with so many free resources to learn this stuff. It's good, however the unit tests are incredibly frustrating. I pound my desk in rage as I'm half asleep failing the test, with it requiring me to do it over again.",
"Seriously this is a marvellous app, now with the COVID-19 I strongly recommend it, it will keep you up with the school work and I'm sure you will learn a lot! If you are younger or have little kids there is also another app made for pre-school and primary kids. Enjoy Khan Academy and don't waste your time with other apps. PD: if you want to learn a language Duolingo is a great app as well!",
"Its a good learning app when it is actually working, however there are a lot of times Ill type in an answer and the 'check' button will not highlight to where I can move on to the next question. The app has also had issues where I cannot sign in or even get into any of the lessons.",
"I really like Khan Academy, it's a LOT better than what our school is providing! I'm so mad at our school, they send out optional work that can't even be turned back in or checked! Khan Academy gives good educational grade work...it's checked for correctness, and most of all it's free! With that in mind, it's the one educational program of a very high caliber that is affordable for me! Thank you Khan Academy, for helping me educate my granddaughter during this time of historical global crisis!",
Tests randomly stop recognizing that you've entered an answer. Leaving the Check button disabled and unable to continue. Closing and reopening the app doesn't help. Reinstalling didn't help. Fortunately the web developers got it right. Used firefox and was able to continue answering questions without issue on the website.,
"Great at showing the language in a natural way, it's really refreshing to see and you can tell they put a lot of hard work in it making the video flow nicely even when you get it wrong it keeps the flow going instead of halting it in it's tracks. This app is definitely deserving of 5 stars",
I like the app for educational purposes. Unfortunately the app isn kinda lagging (not really that much) but i think you need to optimize really well especially for who uses a device (like a tablet or a phone). I'm not forcing to do this if you can't then that's fine but i do need a reply if you can necessary.,
"I believe that this app is very helpful for learners of any level. There isn't just math, which most likely many know it for, but the other three core subjects as well. You can learn from AP Calculus to plain old Multiplication. I have found many helpful experiences from this app and I hope you will as well.",
"I wish I had access to Khan Academy when I was in High school. I really struggled, especially with math. My math teacher wasn't a bad person, but she chose to become a math teacher because 'she liked math and wanted to do it every day'. She genuinely couldn't relate or help when students didn't grasp the concepts. Now I am getting ready to go to College to become a teacher myself, and I'm finally getting Algebra explained to me in a way I can grasp and actually enjoy! I'm confident now. Thanks!",
"This is the BEST app that I ever downloaded. It's simple to use, no annoying ads and it's absolutely FREE! I'm not really good at mathematics and Khan Academy is really helping me learn and I enjoy it. Tho, I would like the Bookmarks to have folders or something like that but overall, great app. Thank you so much for making this kind of free learning app. God bless you and your team!",
"The UI is fine the course is quite diverse and free which is amazing the only complain I have is how this app so slow and laggy, actually this is the only app that I observe will occasionally delay or ignore touch input completely. This app seemed like isn't fully optimized which I kind of disappointed as this make me hesitant to share this incredible app to my relatives that struggle on school.",
"The exercise questions don't load for me. They always crash. Furthermore, the app could use some quality of life improvements, particularly with navigation and the way the content is organised.",
"The app is great ,very wide info but i have a problem accessing the video lessons,,everytime it stops working when i try to load the videos . I tried ur troubleshooting stuff of uninstalling and reinstalling the app but its only a waste of time It crashes MORE and MORE.Its supposed to be a learning app for everyone ,even if the android version is not updated...wth!!!",
"Hi, I am learning math and many more subjects through this aap since a lot of months. I just deleted this aap because it is showing that there is a error loading the topic please try later. so I have tried it about 10 time but this is not working. can you please fix this problem. but it was the best learning Aap before this message. I will be waiting for your reply for this problem. Thanks.",
"Awesome app! The lessons are brilliant, complete with excellent visual aids and quizzes to enhance the learning experience. No ads, no in app purchases. The people that put this together have gone above and beyond. Love it!",
"One of the best learning sites around! Tremendous value is an understatement. I've grown so much as a student from this online academy and I feel very grateful for having experienced its magnificence. Sal's ingenuity along with his concise and may I say measured aggressiveness on teaching the subjects parallels that of a brilliant automaton, perfectly calibrated to captivate his students into a perpetual state of deep learning.",
"Great, the best thing which makes it best is that everything is provided fre of cost and there are so many incredible courses offered. But there's still a problem, after the update, in the quiz where we used to get a whiteboard to solve our questions without the notebook, is not there any more.",
"i Learn constantly for fun and now i have this app that can teach me calculus and refresh any skills i may have lost over time, Weird how things click now more then when I actually was in school. maybe because i can move at my own pace and not be rushed by inconvenient deadlines. Thank You Khan Academy! I suggest Offering certificates at the end of courses so i can hang my achievements!!",
I love all these topics I can learn. But I have trouble logging in I went to log into it today and it took me like a hour to get in and when I did get in none of the buttons worked so I had to retry for around 30 minutes then I finally got it to work. There's also Unit Tests I hate it how when I get one answer wrong and it brings me down from 80 to 50 or sometimes back to 0.But there's a lot of good stuff on this app recommend it for learning but it may or may not crash a bit here and there.,
The issue that I highlighted in my previous review has been fixed since a few updates ago and now the app is working great! Thanks a lot! I would be glad if we could get a feature to control the video quality instead ofbth default auto.,
It's been a great experience with Khan Academy. It needless to say how this platform is helping a vast majority of students. The application is nice enough. But it would be more convenient if DARK MODE is available. I hope you'll take my suggestion into your consideration and implement this feature in no time. Thanks.,
"I've had to delete it because i'm too stupid. It's having an impact on my mental health trying and failing constantly. I have also noticed now that when you try and submit a test it loads forever. If you back out to start again, you lose mastery points. Please fix this.",
"I love how Sal teaches and Khan Academy is building my base from the start again stronger. But I thought should let the devs know that after the latest update, the app crashes whenever I open any video. I have tried reinstalling Khan Academy phone app multiple times. Hope it gets fixed soon! Thanks Sal for building this amazing platform. Love you.",
"This is just AMAZING! 5 stars without a doubt! This is amazing In every way i totally recommend it!!! It helps me A LOT with my home schooling & is one of my favorite resources to use! It makes school fun & easy to understand! It's Very easy to use & so helpful! The app works so well, all the resources & tests are super helpful, i love it! I think it's so good for home schoolers like me & those who just need to reinforce & better understand different subjects! Amazing job, thank you!",
This is the most amazing learning app I've ever used. This app truly is for everyone. I'm a college student seeking to review high school subjects. Its completely free. You can learn any subject. I'm studying math and science. I suck at Math and this app helps me become a better math student. I can trust this app because its credible. I'm gonna donate to them even though it is free because i want everyone across the world to be able to have access to Khan Academy. They suggest add languages.,
"I am so very amazed with Khan Academy!!! I am a 39 year old returning college student, and with the help of Khan Academy, I was able to pass my entrance exam, with flying colors!! The lessons are detailed, easy to understand and fun!! By far, Sal is my favorite teacher on Khan Academy!! He helped me relearn the basics of chemistry and biology!! Thank you Kham Academy, you have a student in me for life!!!",
"Surprisingly clunky for an award winning app. I tried a statistics course and I knew the first answer but couldn't draw it, my markings were moving around in relation to the graph and lines would suddenly appear. Nice theory but some work needed on implementation.",
"Man does this app annoy me. Not only is it a pain to search stuff and find what you want, but it's a pain to download the lessons( it only downloads the videos. Not the articles to go with it. Smh man couldn't you make this actually useful) and it takes a heck of a lot of time to download the videos, which if I search on YouTube for the same exact videos and download them, it's a matter of seconds. I don't know why this app is so clunky and awkward to use. But please fix it.",
Im not sure about the app just yet but what this company does is amazing. Im 29 never got the chance to finish college and am lacking now that im going back. This company is a life saver with all of the tutorials guides and practice im catching back up and learning new things. I do feel a bit embarassed but I mention you to everyone I know. Thank you so much for the wonderful work you all do.,
"I use this app mainly for math subjects but all of the other courses are great! The way the subjects are taught in the videos make it fun & easy to understand, this app is the reason I love math. The feature that I would recommend adding though is a dark theme, having pure white hurts my sensitive eyes. Thank you~",
"I am having this problem that whenever I search something on Google and there's a khan academy video or an article that redirects to this app, it won't open. The other problem is that the search feature doesn't work well. I have to search videos on YouTube to watch. Kindly fix it.",
"For educational purposes, this app is 5 stars. I take off 3 stars because after years of being around, they don't have an undo button in their notes screen, and when they ask you to input an equation as an answer, they give you the tiniest box to enter it. That means you have to tediously scroll back and forth to check your answer before hitting submit. If they had any sort of quality assurance team, these issues would have been addressed years ago.",
This is a great app. I had rated it 5 before but after the update it was crashing all the time I tried to open it. I have reinstalled it to fix the issue and it is solved but all my progress has disappeared 😔 *Edit As I have mentioned I have already reinstalled it and it solved the issue. However it has caused all of my progress to disappear.,
a very good app and useful for education but the disadvantage is that it doesn't have the videos. separated into topics and it is difficult to search it another disadvantage is thhereis no separate videos for each. class which makes it difficult for kids to understand,
I really like this app because i can understand the basic concepts of every chapter which i really find difficult to understand. The only reason i gave it 4 star is because i am from India and i want articles after the videos rather than only quizzes. Please add article after the videos( especially in science so that i can write it cause it is difficult to make notes while watching videos),
"Thank You. On second thought, one way to improve the app is to bring it up to date with the web version. I find subtitles highly useful, but the app seems to lack them (the transcript divides my attention, so I don't use it often)",
"I do homeschooling, it's good for the most part but because I use a phone some of the assignments are formatted incorrectly. I have to spend a extra 2 hours on my high-school statistics class so I can read the numbers that are superimposed on each other. Can we get better formating for phones or a landscape mode so the stuff spreads out? It works fine on a laptop or anything else except phones which is the only thing I use for school.",
"I like the app and everything BUT please can you teach more in the technology field. It would be five stars but there just isn't enough Cant we have better coding courses like, Python, c++, Java, ect and maybe stuff in the career option and more courses and maybe even a advance, intermediate, and beginner level",
Answers labeled incorrect when the entered answer is the exact answer the app states it is. I thought I just couldn't remember any math instead of just having gaps. The videos are helpful when the problem structure in the video matches the one presented for solving.,
Very much helpful. Khan Academy has helped me improve my basics in Maths and Physics. The concepts are explained in a very simple way so that it gives better understanding regarding the topics. Thankyou Sal and the whole team.,
"Network is inexcusably delicate. One small hiccup with poor reception, and videos stop altogether. After cross comparing with other video streaming apps, then returning to KA, this seemed to be a problem specific to KA. I can't use an app if it doesn't function.",
My twins are 2 years old and they love it! 100% free and there are no ads! All their favourite Simple Songs are interactive and talk about it all the time! They've been using the app for almost a week and I already see the increased interest to learn to read and count.,
The least I can say that this app is unique and fascinating. They ask unique questions which are not just from any other book or commonly used reference books. Concepts are strengthened. There are many courses we can choose from. Definitely one of the best. Keep it up!👍👍,
"Definitely the best learning platform! Accurate and synced with the website, aesthetic, easy to navigate... Only two bugs / improvement ideas: bookmarks won't download if over 10 MB (Error Downloading Bookmark). Besides this, could you please add a dark mode ? I study the most at night and I care about my eyes ⊙｜⊙ (Actually only rating this app 4 stars for you to see my two cents of advice; I will change to 5 stars soon enough ;）)",
"Truly exceptional. Brilliantly done educational app thats completely free. Its good for studying, learning, and teaching. It's also good as it approaches math from multiple angles so its easier to understand the why, not just the answer.",
"I was hoping to do high school biology to get into the basics. But because of the update, it turned into confusing stuff. It only has 1 video per topic and a bunch of tests. It is like school all over again. I missed the old version of this",
"My kids love this app so much. Is very educative and very well made. No publicity and very clean. Also the fact of reading books, coloring pages, and doing activities plus watching videos and playing song etc. So much fun! For a free app. We love it.",
"I appreciate Khan Academy and all that Sal and the team do for us with learning. Sadly, this app is not intuitive. As someone who prides myself on being both a teacher and a student in Khan Academy, I am finding that being able to use the app on the teacher side does not work. I will continue to use Khan academy for my students, my children and myself and will hope that the app will get better for the teaching side.",
"Best app for study. Better than byjus, unacademy, vedantu and any other apps. The teachers are so great. This app is great for learning because in this app we dont have to see the teacher. We can focus really on what they are saying. And the teachers have a great arrangement of chapter material which make the hardest chapters seem easy.",
"Not able to load tutorials, Although I love Khan academy and it's teachings (would rate 5 stars) , I will rate it as 1 star atleast for now coz the courses are not getting loaded and gets freezed up into a white screen after opening the app, I've tried all the basic trouble shooting stuff but still unsuccessful, kindly please look into it and fix in the next update",
"Love this app! It has helped me so much, I had to change my classes around and had to make my math class for next year, so I went to Khan Academy, and it has helped me not lose the knowledge of the math I learned last year, now I'll be able to do perfectly fine when I go to next years course of math.",
"At my point of view, it is a great application and I like it. Unfortunately, the articles can only be accessed online, and it cant be downloaded unlike those educative videos. I want not to enjoy videos offline, but as well as the articles.",
"I used to love this app and the content, but the recent update make it difficult to navigate. I loved being able to see all subject and classes. Also, the content that was removed was very useful to me and it's just sad... I had never find an app as useful and well done, so I must admit I am a bit angry.",
"App won't let me log in. It goes through the prompts, but still asks me to sign in after entering my info. I tried logging in via Google, Facebook, and I created an email account to no avail. I uninstalled the app and re-downloaded it and it's still not working. None of the lessons are loading either.",
I love the way you can choose your profile and background by earning points which makes me want to learn many subjects. It's very organized and has a variety of subjects to explore. Many of my friends use this app too and I think Khan Academy is great for people in school,
This is the best app ever.. it really helped me a lot. Being an international student there was a huge challenge for me to completely understand mathematics as it is taught differently from india.. It really helped me. Anyone who seriously wants to concentrate on their study should have this app.,
I absolutely love the Khan Academy! The app is very user friendly and it was convenient to switch from the desktop website to the app when I wanted to pick up where I left off in a course. I am currently using the Khan Academy's math and physics courses!,
This is the best app to study at home without any money . The videos are short & intresting due to which you don't get too bored unlike some free youtube classes like unacademy jee/neet/cbse which are too time consuming and become boring . The only problem is that it does not have a separate section for chemistry india like physics & maths but it's the best for those who can't afford to join expensive classes .,
Thank you Khan Academy for bringing online learning to the masses! I could not enter the numbers in the box or see some of the questions because I could not scroll down while my display setting was set to Very Large while using a Chromebook. I just shrunk the screen size and it was working fine :),
You deserve a 5star ★★★★★ and deserve lot of educational awards. this app has no ads which no interupt and its very very good that you make it really for free. i learning a lot in this app. thank you so much. 💕 i'm working a lot on math science and grammar and this is really very helpful. 🤗 i rarely rating application. but this app deserve more cause there are also no pop-ups begging for rate us. and the teacher voice is easy to understand what theyre explaining. easy to follow and i like quiz,
"This app desperately needs an option to reset a test, if you get one question wrong then you have to retake the whole thing over multiple times again knowing you aren't getting 100 anyways. Let someone restart the test, and take off points from lessons for the question they got wrong. Aside from this the app is great for learning math and stuff.",
"honestly best app ever!!! I used this to take a course on math and programming, and trust me, this is the best! the teaching is amazing and eaay to understand, and its all free!!! and honestly its way better than the courses where you have to pay for them, totally recommend!!!",
"This is free?! whoa this is a fantastic learning tool for free. I'm trying to dive into machine learning and need some math refresh courses, and this app is great for it! the videos are very clear and dont drag on. the interface is easy too.",
"I love, Love, LOVE this app. I wanted to spend some time on an app that was not just scrolling though social fluff or popping coloured dots, but wanted bite-sized engagement. I wanted to refresh & advance school mathematics skills & knowledge. This offers well illustrated, well-explained, clear-to-follow, short tutorials, demonstrations, examples, practice exercises, review exercises, summaries, and self-assessments. Excellent! I highly recommend this, & I applaud its founder, creators, funders!",
"Great app, Sal Khan is an awesome human for allowing everyone free, universal education. There are a few issues on the Nvidia Shield Tablet such as articles not being viewable in landscape and since the recent update, articles crashing upon being opened, but these issues are probably localised to my archaic device. Thanks for the amazing app!",
It's what I'll describe as the perfect way to teach... The quizzes after each topic and the overall course mastery test it's amazing and it's what I've been looking for in forever thanks to y'all for making this app and making it free you're teaching me more than what I've learned in school and I really appreciate it,
"Highly recommend for those struggling with math, physics, and chemistry. as for other subjects, though.. its better to wait until KA. finishes them (hopefully soon). Most of the time at class I just watch K.A. lessons i downloaded beforehand because the teachers arent very helpful, at least to me. I can learn at my own pace, can learn anywhere, anytime. What could I possibly ask for more?",
"An absolutely incredible app, I just loved it. It really helpes me understand the basics of physics and also provides notes at the end of every series, along with a small test. Very helpful. Thank you khan academy.",
"Being a guy that flunked school from 3rd to 11th grade, I can finally catch up on the things I missed years ago, the UI & UX is great Top tier learning application that ensures you know the topic well before proceeding to the next one. I can't believe it's free! Thank You",
"The content by Sal Khan and the practice exercises have given me a better understanding of math than I received through my entire primary and secondary education. As an adult relearning Algebra through Trigonometry to prepare for a college level math placement exam I am thrilled. The app, however, is sometimes buggy and when you download offline content, for some reason that does not include the exercises (quizzes and mastery challenges). If this is fixed I would give five stars.",
It has got everything as per the syllabus from primary schooling to undergraduate and even more. The app is very smooth and easy to use. All the contents are not just free but add free too. Recommend every learner to kill time in this lockdown.,
"Best app ever!! Kids need help with homework and you aren't sure how to do it, Khan Academy should be your first stop! Great explanations and examples. Amazing teaching tool. I've used it many times and will keep using it (and recommending it).",
"I hate this app, because if you get one answer wrong you will have to repeat the whole thing to get a 100% And you can't see any examples or anything.. and if you press hint it doesn't count even if u didn't see the whole solution... And I keep repeating and repeating.. it's so annoying 😭 But other than that it's pretty good.. it doesn't lagg or anything",
"Thank you Khan Academy for providing this academia app for free to the world. I've really enjoyed the video and textual parts, especially the quizes which helps gauge ones progress. It would be really helpful to add a discussion/comment/question section in the app so users can query and find further clarification on unclear portions of the courses.",
"For me,it's the best knowledge gaining app available on play store.Had a very good experience with it.In love with it's different videos and specially from several institutions such as MIT.I recommend this app for each and everyone who wants to gain more and more knowledge. It's my humble request to you to add some more content on quantum mechanics because you explain it better than any other teacher who has taught me till now. It's my favourite subject so please add more videos on this topic.",
Freaking out !!!!!!! Well the content Khan academy provide is great and I have been using it since 2020 and got to learn a lot in my high school but now after this previous update I think that there is something wrong with the app as whenever I try to open the app it takes so much time and wait there isn't any issue neither with internet connection nor with the device ... please do correct this....,
"This app is amazing for education! I am doing the SAT Test Prep and it has given me a huge insight into what SATs are supposed to be like. The only problem I'm facing with the app is loading time. In addition, I would like recent lessons to be removed from the home page if they are checked as finished.",
"Khan Academy feels like a reiterating of school but worse. The lessons (or classes) don't make much sense and fail to prepare you for the tests to come, only to leave you frustrated with a failing score. I wish the app contained more comprehensive approaches to teaching its enrolled students the concepts of every course it offers, as well as tests/quizzes that better reflected what you actually learn during the lessons.",
"The app is perfect, everything is so helpful and easy to understand and the offline availability is really good for us with seldom internet connectivity, the only problem is that the activities and exercises cannot be used offline, I hope this can change, it would be very appreciated.",
"Amazing app, helped me extremely well with my finals this semester and I'm going to be using it alot more, love the content, although I do feel the android experience could be better, when I'm watching videos ect if it could almost put you into a ui similar to that of a podcast, crossed with YouTube, when your watching a video",
"I love this app very much. When I don't understand anything, I will just search for Khan academy. They explain a lot to you just to make you understand that particular subject and provoide all sorts of exercises and unit tests which I think is a very good experience,especially for high school students.",
"I am having issues with the last update of this app, I'm having issues opening your website, opening the app itself, your lessons and sometimes videos, the history and progress won't show me what I've done, it's lagging and slow and all started this morning after the update 2 days ago and I'm finally having problems. Pls fix this, thx, and yes I still love ya'll lol.",
"It's simply, awesome no doubt. It's a great, great step towards free education but.... Soon I will inshaAllah. You rock Sal, Salman Khan. Indeed a role model. Only problem I have, I don't find a sequence in my study, and in all stuff. As stuff is also too much so please categorise as levels ie study material from 'beginner to difficult' level. Though, it's there but in India sometimes it becomes a mess. Really difficult to find the previous things if coming back after some days. Thanks much",
"The recent UI update on march 28, 2019 has made using the app considerably more difficult. A lot of the time when you tap something you either get no response or a response after 10 seconds. Assignments take ages to load and many times I have found myself tapping things multiple times because of no response.",
"There must be a option to choose the quality of video, just like in the website. I think by defult it is 720p quality on the app. Although this deserves 5stars(for its contents), it must be optimised for older android device, and must function buttery smooth even if in weak cellular connection.",
"Practically free! I struggled a lot after 5th grade, for many reasons. This app has been helping me re-learn things I I thought I'd never get the chance to learn again. With all that is happening in the world learning is a new hobbie for me. Anything "" I don't know"" I look up or I learn on here. Best educational app EVER!",
"Brilliant app.. helps clear all your doubts and and the best part is they start from scratch. This is useful for me irrespective of whatever board I want to target. Moreover apart from the content, it's the thought that also counts. Keep up the great work guys :-)",
Absolutely has saved my college career and has had immeasurable benefit in my personal life. Fantastic app with excellent content. I love that I can skip the videos for tasks i know but can watch and rewatch them for concepts I'm struggling with.,
I find the current available content of this app and its website extremely invaluable in my search for learning supports for both myself and my children. I am having some technical difficulty using certain aspects (ie moving points) due to the incompatibility with my tablet. It would be useful if I were able to remain logged in simultaneously with my kids' profiles with the option to switch between them.,
"its great for a study app and i like the increasing or decreasing video speed function , has a lot of stuff and keeps you actively studying even in free time, have a problem with exercises after each topic on my device the message appears ""error"" each time i run it , i use an LG Gflex first version. please fix.",
"The chapters in the Indian course are same as in the books but the content they teach us is not entirely the one that we should learn , instead it is something else out of the books or syllabus. The notes given matches neither the app's teaching vids nor our books. Pls take a look at this. Class 11th biology ( India ) has this issue. Navigating through the app is so far not so difficult for me because I have found the lessons but before I kept searching for them.",
"It works but compared to the web version is slow and at times completely unresponsive, giving the impression that completed unit tests didn't register and save. Quiting the app and starting back show me that the results were not lost.",
"Considering that it is free, it is amazing! Very helpful for learning a wide variety of subjects. Great supplement to high school classes. Good job fadapting the interface to different devices.",
Best study app. Even on pc it's amazing. Lessons are broken down to be super easy to understand. Tutors are great and excersises too. They keep adding new subjects and features that contribute towards the greatness of the app. The fact that it's also completely free at this quality is incredible 😊,
"Kahn Academy is helping me a lot with my Math. Your videos explains better than my teacher does. Often I use Kahn Academy's videos to learn at home then at school, because of that I sometimes get bored and other people have the same thoughts. A recommendation is to add something for different types of learners so if they don't understand the video they have another tool to be used.",
The app would be great if it didn't constantly crash or glitch. Almost everytime I use it it has errors and can't load my work or everytime I ask for a hint it crashes. It also does not mark my videos complete once I've watched them.,
"hi 🤗! I love khan academy and I liked this app too, but here's a problem : it saves whatever I download in Android folder as if they were cache..I wish I could save them in my external storage and today everything I had downloaded was suddenly lost (I guess after I updated it) ...it's veryyyy annoying and I hope you consider this in next updates",
"I was hoping to learn something since it had such great reviews. Unfortunately it has absolutely nothing on learning writing or documentation or buisness communications or even something as extremely important as a basic life skill, such as interviewing for an actual job. Also, it appears that absolutely everything is solely video based.",
What happed to the computer science courses! My tablet is not loading it alone and when i go to the test quizes some statement pop up and says 'we are unable to load or something failed'. Literally it's better than others because the explanations given are standard and are easily graspable.,
I love this app it is completely helpful for studying and has good notes and videos to aid the learning experience and on top of that an easy to use navigation system therefore you can easily find your way through different topics. I love app😍 thanks for providing such an effective learning resource👌✨,
You are going a great job Sal Khan 👍👍. This is the best learning app so far. Teaching doesn't need a animation or graphics to help students teach. If the teacher is as amazing as you. Every student will understand the concepts in the very first time. The app's UI is absolutely polished no bugs whatsoever in my usage. I'm soon going to donate you for your amazing work. Working as a non profit organization. I request other people who found this app useful to kindly donate to this organisation.❤️,
"It is the best learning app. Simple and minimalistic (sort of). I still can't believe that it is free to use 😅. However, you could put ads (a little amount of ads) so that you don't need to worry about your funding (I really can't donate… I would if I could 😊). And of course, a lot of thanks for your great work 🤓.",
"Hi thanks for responding. I tried the app today and it's working fine, I tried disconnecting the WiFi then reconnecting it and that fixed the problem. Know I get to injoy this app, it a great learning tool and I think anyone who's behind or just trying study extra should get this!",
"I have no words, but this app is life changing. It's the greatest app I've ever seen for learning, and it's a non profit, meaning it's all free. My only request is maybe for a dark mode, as the bright white background hurts my eyes, but the dark themed videos compensate for that! Overall brilliant app, and I want to thank you Sal for creating this incredible resource. Thank you.",
"This application is ausome ! I never imagined that I could go back to the college after ten years ,until I downloaded this application ,it is well organized with every single detail videos nd exercises,the explanations make lessons pretty easy, i wish I knew about it before,big thank for the team who provides this application for free !",
"That is some lazy writing on the developers part if you aren't ""able"" to track more than 9 courses at a time. This means I can't layout my path without going in to edit and moving them around as I go. Stupid, limiting in more ways than one, and not worth my time. Clearly the online desktop version is the only one partially worth my time and effort.",
"This app teaches everything for free!! And Mr Sal teaches concept very good and clear. Many educational apps ask for subscription after that they will provide video lessons. But Khan Academy is free and it goes beyond what you learn in a educational apps (with subscription). The way of teach is very good. And Khan Academy doesn't only focus on problem solving like other apps it teaches subject. I will rate a billion stars, If I could.....",
It is very good but in few of the courses at the middle of the vid the voice starts to glitch and after 1 minute or so it goes away then I have to skip that part and come back to it and still the voice of the narrator starts to glitch again and so I need to turn on caption but the caption take a lot of space and there should be a custom captions like in YouTube but also DO GO FOR THIS STUDY APPLICATION BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IT ALSO HAS AP COURSES WHICH NO OTHER APP HAS TILL DATEthat I know of,
It's a wonderful app ..👍 ... must download .... studying is important but learning is necessary.Just experiencing some problem on iOS app as some videos are not available there and also some video's quality is not good like some crash course videos .. But this problem does not arise when on Khan academy website. .so please just need some solution for this otherwise it's wonderful.,
"was really looking forward to using this and every lesson says check your connection and try again, also wont let me log in through google or fb. 1 star for that, runnin s7 Samsung. And obviously by posting this my connection is clearly fine. edit: its a good app, uninstalled and reinstalled works fine. i wish there were placement tests. 4 stars",
"One of the best learning app ever! Just an advice to the developer.. as an asian people who still learning english, sometimes its kinda hard to understand the word meanings. Thats way I'm suggesting you to add a translator ( google translate maybe(?) ). It can be like the quick translate at the google chrome mobile, translate by selecting the words and then the pop up translate come. the point is, i really need a translator in this app so i dont have to keep changing to another app thanks!",
"Please fix this!!! This was supposed to be a very good app. I downloaded this app because the website was beautiful. But, when I downloaded the app, it took lots of space and it didn't load even when I had internet. When I tried doing the exercises, it had an ""error making task progress"". I just downloaded this app. Please fix this so that this will become a really great app everyone would love. 😁😁😁 Thank you!",
All videos are very useful . Great app and great developers ... I just want more videos on science stream 'cause so many videos are not there . And please add 12th chemistry in the course.. it would be great to have specific tab for 12th chemistry for students like me who are weak in chemistry. Otherwise it's a great app,
Really good app my mom makes me use it for sumercamp and really good. You can also download assignments so you can do them without wifi which is amazing! App is much better IXL as IXL glitches alot and is really bad. This is free and amazing. Also I had to use IXL for school and it is SO SO SO BAD. This is a really good app. Also the people who teach the lessons in the videos like Sal know what they are doing and do A really good teaching! I am also glad that there is NO ADS!,
Many of the features that are on the web app are missing. The most useful of the missing ones is the scratch (note) pad. It's also not intuitive at all to write fraction answers.,
"I literally can't thank this app enough. Honestly, it has every detail of information I would recieve in a class ( most of the time better and more detailed ) and it even has ap options and video lessons which are subtitled/ timestamped so perfectly in sync that even my hearing impared brother can enjoy and learn with me. I use this app a lot in class and I look forward to using it to study by myself. Thanks.",
"I love the app, but I've encountered a serious bug. When I click on the physics topics of India, the app stops suddenly and when I reopen it, all the Indian topics get vanished. I would appreciate it if you solve the problem. Thank you",
"So far this app is excellent. I am using it as an adult to help me with my maths gcse retake, but have also signed my 8 year old up. The short videos and questions allow for learning in short birsts throughout the day rather than hours long revision. I found the history of alebra videos interesting too.",
"Fantastic app and content. My kids surprise me with things they learned on their own from watching. If I could request one further feature, it would be casting and/or NVidia Shield TV support, so we can watch the videos on the TV more easily.",
"It's a really great app... The teachings are easy to understand and you can rewind the video or play it again if you like... I like their features , you can run exercises and it has a vary of subjects really great 🖤",
"Sorry, I had to rate it very low because every time I open the app it crashes 😭 It doesn't crash the last time I downloaded it. Edited: I've tried the troubleshooting steps many times but still it didn't worked.",
"The app is very helpful expecially the video had clear clear and simple explanations which made it easy to understand the content the only problem I encountered while using the app was with the exercises I could get points cause they kept changing as I about to finish each exercise, but overall it is a great app",
"Such a terrible experience with this app. Fantastic website bogged down by constant crashing and unreliable bookmark adding. If only as much time was spent ensuring the app ran smoothly as was spent making the lessons, then it'll be great.",
"I love the Khan Academy app, and I really like the option to download bookmarks for offline use. However, bookmarked articles for teaching do not appear offline on my phone, though the videos do. I am using the LSAT resources and I really need those articles as well, so a resolution would be helpful.",
"It has no features, one can't even save a page for offline viewing, you can't highlight and copy a text from it to your MsWord, no option to download page, poor search engines. It needs serious upgrades. I nevertheless appreciate the quality of information I get from it. But the app is not worth it.",
"Excellent learning app but please add an option to save downloaded videos to the external sdcard, I'm running low on storage so I'd like to have all the videos on the sdcard. Currently I have to go through the dirty way of manually moving the video files from the Android/data/org.khanacademy.android to my sdcard, this also means I'll have to use another video player outside of the app to play them.",
A very nice app. I recommend all of you to download this application for studies. Very nice videos and practices and tests. Plus they teach the concept in depth. But I am giving it 4 stars because it takes a long time to load the videos and tests. Sometimes the tests don't even open. This is my only problem. Otherwise it is a great app for studies. Go for this app for studies. Thanks Khan academy.😊😊😊,
"It's a great app to use. Amazing tutorials on each subjects, however something is wrong when you download items, The video works perfect but the pages just don't load sadly. Please fix that problem but besides that its awesome.",
This app is amazing! I never have to tell y son I don't know how to help him with homework. I hop on and refresh myself. Anyone can learn new skills in a very short amount of time. I also use it for my college classes. It is amazing how it is geared to all levels of learning. Great job Khan Academy!,
"Very unresponsive app.. I often have a hard time scrolling down because the app doesn't respond, tapping buttons rarely has any effect, etc... It works perfectly on my computer but the app on mobile needs a lot of work.",
"App is great, though guys you got a bug, after searching for ""Arithmetic progression"", click on one of videos below. When in the opened fragment I click on ""Arithmetic progressions"" reference below the video, the app throws exc., mb a NullPointer? I think this section doesn't exist in app version yet, shouldn't he hard to fix.",
Love the app. But there is something wrong with the subtitles in some videos. Like I can't view the script fully in the tab and sometimes the subtitles are in non-English like polish etc. I hope you can look into that.,
"the lessons are of course fantastic, but it would be nice if the search function will search full courses instead of just one videos. also I can't find the statistics (not high school statistics) course for some reason. thanks.",
The program overall is excellent! But everytime I start the app on my android phone it doesn't load; the screen is blank and I have to re install the app again.. It's really inconvenient.. I hope you can help me on this..,
"Khan Academy was a very good and a bad experience at the same time , First of all teachers keep changing , like I chose class 10ths PHy. Bio Chem and maths , but first an Indian voice teacher comes , he teaches very good but then a foreign accent teacher , he can't explain a single lecture , that's why I had to uninstall . The thing I hated the most that energy points are never added to my profile , and when every question is correct , it shows task error. These 3⭐ r just for the lesson i learnt",
"This application is sooo soooo great! Now I can watch Khan Academy without getting distracted by other YT videos!!! The thing is I hope you can add a ""pre-test"" feature per every topic since it is already proven that simple tests prior to studying help :>! No pressure guys; I know this is free and we thank you for that! I really hope you will give a thought upon my suggestion :). I appreciate what you are doing Mr. Sal Khan and your team! With this we can truly learn anything :)",
Absolutely amazed! Excellent UI! Simple to use. I'm well on my way to making up for those good times for bad things in High School! The curriculum is immense and the tutorials are remarkably well structured!,
"The best educational app I have come across. Transformed my grammar. I now have a time line of history to build on. And my mathematics and physics have never been better. I feel like a regenerated person, ready and capable to take on the rest of my existence. Thank you to all at Khan Academy. 🙂",
"Thank you for the awesome lectures. I am so happy that there are subtitles in the app too. Mathematics is peaceful, thank you for your awesome lectures. Sometimes I wish all the time in the world to not only for myself but also for everyone to complete all the lectures and textbooks, and then making experiments while reading new textbooks etc. I am sure we would have more citizen scientists if people had more time. Your mathematics lectures are beautiful and peaceful. Thank you I am so grateful",
"Its a great app, but sometimes I have issues where if I need to scroll down to view a whole problem it won't let me scroll anymore and it's cut off. I'm using an Android. Not sure if this is just an issue on phones only and if it works better on something like iPad",
"Really appreciate the app. It woukd be even better if all lectures had quizzes. They seem to disappear after a few physics lessons after Newton laws. Overall, a very good way to re-learn basics.",
Getting to have 100+ free courses with no in app transitions unlike other apps without time limit is absolutely stunning. I thought itd be having a free trial abt a week or 2 but no its completely free.The only thing needed is a internet connection and ur done. Thank u for such a wonderful app.😍,
"It was great on the web, but I can't click on anything in the app. I downloaded the app for only a few days. The first few days were okay, but as time flew by clicking has become harder. It can scroll up and down, but when I click on any classes I can't go inside. And yes, I cleared my cache and it still doesn't work. Overall it's a good app!",
"Lecturer is irritatingly fast, sloppy, casual, and less than literate in his use of English. He blathers. I could not find a different lecturer. The information isn't inaccurate, as far as I listened, but is very poorly delivered. I'll keep looking for an educational app. I've listened to 25 years of college and university lecture, and this is substandard.",
"Changing my rating from 4 to 1, the new search function is terrible. Before it was quick and efficient to go through the years in a curriculum. Now I have to go here and there,select this and that, it's become tedious. Want to rollback to old update !!!",
Great app! There are a lot of features and it has a good looking GUI to keep the users interested. Would love a dark mode though since sometimes you need to study in night and it would help save battery! (If it is considered please try to add pure black instead of gray),
"I think the apps ok. The download function I think needs to be improved. The fact that you can download the videos is great, but you should be able to download the articles as well. Most of what I use is articles, and it's not helpful that I can't download them.",
"Amazing app that helps you understand subject very easily. Love it! Lessons are taught in a way that makes subject more interesting. I would actually like to see longer and harder tests, but maybe it's their way of teaching.",
"I took a maths course just now from this app, and this app is really helpful!! Such an amazing app. And every single lesson is free here, it covers all the topics of a semester. And it very user friendly, not much complicated but simple. It's too good for the people who want knowledge! it is giving everything for free, now it's upto the user whether he/she wants to learn or not. Thanks alot khan academy❤",
I'm having trouble finding words to describe how thankful I am for this app. When I was in school I loved the concept of math but hated math class. Math class was a horrible endless loop for me. Inevitably the first few weeks of class covered things that I already knew. I'd get bored and stop paying attention. Then while I wasn't paying attention the class would go over material I didn't know yet and I'd be behind. The ability to work at my own pace is amazing. Thank you!,
Prior to the latest update I would have given the app 5 stars but with the latest update I frequently have trouble with reading articles or taking quizzes. The words often just show up as blocks. After awhile sometimes it resolves but more often I find myself hopping onto the website to read the articles or test my understanding. Other than that I love this app.,
"Awesome. My children are in year 5 and and year 8 and I keep encouraging them plus all my nieces and nephews to use it. As a teacher even my year 11 students watch the grammar lessons from the very basic steps. From my point of view of a parent and an educator, this is thr best learning app i have experienced.",
"Before when I downloded this app, it was working properly. All assignments properly opened. But after the recent update, the assignment are not opening. Whenever I open, it shows that ""The content isn't loding right now"". In the PC it opens, but in phone it doesn't opens. I want you to please fill this issue.",
"This app is really amazing. It is very easy to navigate and since my computer broke, I can still learn on my phone! Sal is a really funny, fun, and relatable teacher. The lessons (excpet for rate exercises 2) is really well taught.",
"Is not working, my courses don't appear on the dashboard Edit - the courses have appeared again after signing out and signing in , the app still however has some issues . Not being able to see the comments for a video . Video playing speed goes from 1 to 1.33 to 1.5 to 2 instead of the standard 1.25-1.5-1.75-2.",
"Best education app ever scene, And it is totally free, thank you. But I found some dark theme missing. Also it would be great if we can add friends and great small study groups in which there is leader board and complained examinations.",
"This educational app has got to be one of the best out there. The wide arrangement of different things you can learn on this app is enough to fit anyone's place of interest, explaining each topic in a detailed, engaging video. The developers were also kind enough to stay away from in-app purchases, being a non-profit organization.",
"Love this app, would give it 5 stars. But it does not like Google pixel 6 pro...when I click on text box to fill in answer it will zoom in...if it is a multiple answer question after the meeting initial zoom in it does not allow to zoom out to fill in last answer...it's like it locks in the zoom and does not allow me to zoom back out. On the PC it's perfect!",
"What can I say?? The app is More than I expected, I mean it so cool... It goes round all my departmental courses and even the borrowed ones... I highly recommend it for anyone that ones to learn from scratch... You can even download the tutorials for your offline view 💯💖",
"Excellent performance! Passed all my exams because of this app!! If only there was kids science chapters I would give it a 5. My sister is small and she really has improved in maths and other subjects but there is no science, only maths and grammar, I BEG U PLEASE GIVE SCIENCE TOO! This will be perfect than, thank you! Overall best free app to study! Would strongly recommend this!",
Amazing apart from one test (I would really like feed back) One of the trigonometry tests specifically the solve a side in right angles does the same thing every time I do it the second and are fourth are wrong but the first and third are always correct even though I do the same method everytime I look and and study the hints but it shows my method so I need some help😩,
"I love this on desktop but on mobile it has a massive problem imo. On desktop it seems that all your lessons are in order in relation to each other but on mobile it's not like this, they don't seem to be in any order at all. If this could be fixed it would be very helpful and make the app much more useful",
"I can log in from my laptop, but every time I try to log in from my tablet it says password incorrect. BS! I'm very careful typing it. I changed it. Same result. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same result. Your app is broken! TO YOUR 05/06/2019 REPLY: You didn't read my review, because I was clear I'd already tried that. Also, I was able to install and login from phone, so only tablet is problem. ""This app is compatible with all of your devices."" Really?",
"thank you for a lot of good quality videos. but it's difficult sometimes to watch english videos with english subtitles especially is you wanna revise some maths materials. i'd like to have multiple languages to combine some courses in english and.. hm... russian, for instance and possibility to choose the language of subtitles 🕳️ also i didn't see neither russian not ukrainian in proposed languages... that's sad :(",
"This is the most effective learning app I've found. It's down to Earth, yet progressive in its logic. The animated personalities create a nice bridge between the child's emotional world and the academic discipline they need to build. My kids love it.",
"I really love to learn with this app, I haven't rated 5 stars as i have one problem with the interface, you are unable to see total skills mastered. It would be quite helpful if you add that, as the. It would be easier to check sun badges progress. I am at 300 to 350 skills currently though I am unable to see how close I am to achieving my total of 350 for my next badge. PS. Can you add the progress interface for the chart in which you can see the amount of khan you have done over time. Thanks",
"Everything works great now! Unfortunately, exercises can't be done offline and that's a huge disadvantage. With offline support for exercises, the app would be absolutely perfect!",
"""Yes, I Khan. I Khan do it."" A major in science is like building your working knowledge by adding, connecting and accessing your long term memory vault. In addition to reading the text and taking good lectures notes, Khan Academy videos are an excellent way to review and remember multifaceted concepts.",
"Love this! I use it when i am sick on a school day and i love it cuz it is not stressful. I use it for math and the tests are so short that it makes it a little fun! Also nice bc if you do get stressed, you can take a break and try it again later! Definitely would recommend!!!!",
"It is an excellent platform to learn the required mathematics and to improve the maths skills to everyone . In fact it is specifically designed to teach students , but at the same time it is also useful to the working professionals who wants to improve their knowledge and cognitive skills. Maths and science are only the two subjects that requires lot of thought and sense of humour which acts as an patients to the applicant. These patient can only empowered through continuous practice,it's wonder",
"Great app. Teaches all concepts in detail. Topics are organised and I haven't experienced any bugs till now. A feature to control badges, track progress, change avatars within the app itself, would be really appreciated",
"Hello! Ive tried uninstalling and closing all running apps in the background, nothing worked, i cant touch anything, scrolling works but i cant click any lessons or the settings, and ive seen alot of reviews with the same bug i have. So i think its the application!",
Amazing app! 👏 This app was a great help to me while preparing for college and I still use it. There are a lot of subjects and they're explained in a way that's easy for me to understand. It was always difficult for me to focus in a classroom setting so this method of learning is perfect!,
"I'm a senior who loves to learn. (Keeps the mind active.) Khan Academy's course offerings and interface are both outstanding. I especially like that the review questions after each lesson don't just involve regurgitating info, definitions, and so on, but actually require thinking about and applying the concepts that were covered. And given that I live on a small pension, I'm deeply grateful that courses of this quality are made available at no cost. It's a lifelong student's dream come true.",
"an unbeliveable experience using this app, it has wonderful design, a clean hud and the subjects are so precise and organized, its a lot helpful for those who wouldn't just pay attention to the classes and now want to learn new things to join a course. I hope there's a pc version of the app so i can study way better. Congrats for creating this masterpiece and please do not become a capitalist maniac and put adds between 5 minutes",
"Best video game ever, I tried speedrunning it and failed ""addition and subtraction within 100"" 3 times, it was a suboptimal run. I am playing on the hardest difficulty, if I get one wrong, I have to start all over again! It's a great challenge!",
"This is a really very good app! I mean it provides you education free of cost. On top of that, it has outstanding interactive classes. And when you take a test, it helps you meet new standards of questions. I truly recommend this app to every student out there.",
"""I don't know how to draw""😂 its what the lecturer often says... I like it.....Its quite a great application, because it helps us to understand things from the fundamental and basic concepts..... I have learned a lot from it that I can't express in few words,,, still i will try to say that I have learned ""there is nothing that we can't learn"" thanks.... keep it up🙂👍",
Guys... Thank you so much.... I don't understand how you are able to put in so much effort for doing this free.... There is never a topic in science or maths that I don't understand when I listen to you.... Please add more subjects for board classes and a lit bit sample papers and you are actually the best... Thank you for helping many children across the world... Thank you so much and please keep up the good work.... I give a 5-star rating whole heartedly...,
"I always have high hopes for Khan Academy. On YouTube it's nice to be able to search a video to help my kids with their learning. But the UI is unsatisfactory every time. 5 minutes after I set up a new account for my son, Khan Academy sends the email to finalize the account but won't let me access that website. When I try to simply sign into the account it doesn't recognize the password, try to reset the password, it says the account doesn't exist. Stuff like this happens EVERY TIME. 🤷🏾‍♀️",
"It's very buggy and everytime I want to play a video it theres a 6 second delay between me pressing start and the video actually starting. Plus, when there are consecutive videos I would like to watch they do not automatically go to the next video which is a nuisance since I dont want to scroll all the way to the next video. Hope you guys can fix this issue",
"Love it!!! If the school teachers would teach students like this the world will be much better. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT! And I cannot belive is is for free. Such a good quality of the content, videos, techniques.. very impressed. Thank you for developing this app.",
"I love this app. I wish I had more time to practice my math. *CAN I MAKE ONE SUGGESTION* Please add more content for skilled tradesman. Electrical theory. Mechanics. Hydraulic. Pneumatic. Alot of tradesmen lose their skills and training over the years and could use a fun, easy way to stay sharp.",
"To be honest with you, I am only doing this because, when I am on my computer it works purfectly, but I sometimes have problems solving the questions. And I'm going to be doing geometry this year for 10th grade. Even though I'm nt felling to well, I still want to study. YES, in the summer, =3. But anyways, when I tried to do it on my tablet it keep saying ""error, try again later"" or something like that. Could you please fix it? Please And Thank you!",
"This app is very resourceful for students and helps you out a lot, ignore the kids that say it is boring. One of them even called this a game, this app is for educational purposes, not to make you have fun and be entertained, it is to help you get better at a certain subject or subjects. The kids that call this boring are legit middle schoolers.",
Listen. This is top quality free education. I'll be here to say that others who rated this with 1 star is exceptionally idiotic. Others that has a technical issue has it from their device and solely their device. I've tested it out! If anyone is wondering. It's legit. I haven't encountered a single ad And it is free It is free. What a school teaches you in an hour can be taught here in 10 minutes. It is both an efficient and effective way to study Just tell your level and study away. Thx!,
"Awesome. I'm a fifth grader and because of this app I'm at a 9th grade level and I am now studying calculus. This app is like a tutor on your phone/tablet that you don't pay for. And, on top of that, there is no in-app purchases so you have full access to the app for free. This app also has a great UI categories so you always know where the subject you're studying is. Just amazing. Great to get your grades up and get ahead of the class, along with helping you live life with no calculator.",
"(Edit on very bottom) - Very educational and helpful. I did my schooling Billy Madison style. So I started from kgrade and worked my way up. I gotta say, they're teaching kids stuff now that I wasn't taught when I was in school. And I'm 26. So it's really fun and helpful. - Would your Academy ever think of adding languages to learn? 🤔",
Don't have words to describe this amazing application. It have everything for everyone who wants to learn something for all ages. It doesn't matter for what you are learning either for your school/college or for your interest almost every topic have covered and they also have best way to describe each topics. And what is the cost of this amazing opportunity? 0 Yes zero... Who don't have money to pay for learning..... this place is gift for you. I think everyone should have this application. And I have one request if possible please can you add Chemistry & Computer Science for 11th (India) in it..,
"This is a great learning app but the test and papers for us to remember are to easy you fail the first time there the same questions. So in the end this is just a game of memory ,and not teaching a single thing to anyone who wants to learn more about what is being taught.",
"I actually really enjoy this app. I learn a lot of stuff that i have never learned and there is videos to watch that also helps you for more understanding. Its a simple app to use and when it says ""free"" it means it. You have apps who say that and tell you that you need to buy it after 5 minutes of being on it. But with this, you can learn as much as you want without knowing that your going to be caught in this trap were you have to pay $9.99 to continue. I recommend trying it out! (:",
This app is wonderful. It helped me a lot. It has great content with great explanation. I particularly like the science experiments shown in between the explanations. Thank you for helping me learn concepts easily.😄,
"It's really hard to get in app. It would take 30Minutes long just for app to open. This wasn't the case when I first installed the app. (And I have good Internet connection.) I hope you would better your app, because tests and video lesson are great.",
"I've been using this app for 5 years & I'm in love with it! Completely free and versatile. Thank you Khan Academy for such a wonderful app. However there's one thing that I didn't like... the app removed the badges that we were supposed to get after earning certain points as a goal. Eg- for earning 500,000 points, you would get an earth batch & for 1,000,000 points you would get a sun batch. I was really hoping to earn the sun batch but it got removed. Except that, it's complete perfection.",
Fantastic app. I've been using this to study for the upcoming college entrance exams and so far it has been great. The way the lessons and topics are compiled and are arranged in a systematic order is great for tracking where the topic you're looking for is.,
Amazing app. High quality teaching with superb commentary will blow your mind. It's way better than other apps as the videos are free of cost(Mobile data or WiFi required). But there is no way for us to clear our doubts. I think they should add a doubt clearing page so that we can post our doubts (1 or 2 questions a day). But I appreciate the effort and dedication Sal and his team has put into it.,
"Thank you so much for helping others to study for free. The app has some problems, for example it works after along pause and can't show the downloaded videos very fast. It made it hard for users to use this app despite its amazing advantages for studying for free",
"This is such an amazing app for all enthusiastic students, most of the videos have a very consistent format which is very simple yet so powerful and effective. There is a range of materials and subjects from Math to even Computer Animation out of a collaboration with Pixar, which is one of the many collaborations that Khan Academy has done. Sal Khan is a true life saver. To believe that all of these knowledge that Sal Khan shares for us to grab onto are entirely free, no doubt, best of the best.",
I really enjoy Khan academy and I applaud the concept but one thing in this app drives me crazy. The moment you loose connection you're being kicked out of the task even if the whole unit has been downloaded. What is the point of downloading it in the first place? There has to be a healthy dose of commuters or people who will try to solve tasks without constant access to the Internet.,
"I started homeschooling in 2018 and Khan Academy has been with me ever since. Their lessons, teachers, quizzes and tests are so much fun! Khan Academy has made learning such an enjoyable experience, which was the total opposite for me in school. Thank you Khan Academy for having such a positive impact in my life with my schoolwork! xx",
"As a lifelong learner, I appreciate Khan Academy not only for the high quality of the content and overall experience but also for how the world of online learning has improved thanks to its influence and direct contributions. Best wishes for continued growth and success! I hope to see more advanced and specialized content for adults looking to broaden their horizons. Cheers.",
"I love this app!!!!!! It really wows me!!! I recommemd this app to all students learning from Grade 1 up to College. It really helps me at my MTAP Competition, Scylimpics Competition and even at school works and assignment. And what I realy love in this app is that it really fits at your and my phone storage. You really did a great job!! To all students out there.... What are you waiting for?! Download this app right now!!!!",
This app really helps me. My uncle recommended it to me. I learn multiple times a day now. The teaching is very simple and taught with proper questions and answers. After using this app. i have started learning more and i am very happy. There is no glitches and i even scored a perfect A for the first time in my life. I even got up early to learn. Thank you so muxh for this amazing app.,
I absolutely love Mr Khan. You can sense his passion and excitement about what he is teaching. One can see that his mind is racing to pull many ideas together to convey them to his students. His enthusiasm for engaging and communicating is at the core of everything he teaches. Every school should use his programs. His teaching is so to the point of what he is attempting to convey. He is right on target He makes everything so interesting and interconnects the various disciplines.,
"I would like to thank the creator of this wonderful, extraordinary and educational app. I am impressed and speechless from this app. I am really fortunate to find Khan Acadamy on the web as my experiences from this free app has been amazing. There is a wide variety of subjects which are highly knowledgeable. I am thankful to you for creating Khan Acadamy as I am pretty sure that millions of students like me are using this to get a better understanding of what they are learning.",
"I love Khan Academy's purpose. I think you're going to make a big impact in the current education system. Unfortunately I can't do nothing more than thank you for giving me this knowledge. What I would ask for it's to make the platform more affordable to unreliable internet connections. Make exercises available without continuous connection will enhance a lot the app fluidness. Also an offline temporal data to then submit when online for don't lose progress will help. But well, here's my five!",
"Actually, I really love to learn from this academy. Last time I followed some math lessons and I passed maths with ""A"" pass. So thank you and I am still continuing my studies with khan academy ❤ actually I would like to appreciate all the teachers who make video to teach and their explanations are awesome. I followed macroeconomics and basic statistics course. Thank you for all the teachers in that course. ❤❤",
The best app you can find. The micro economics course was really helpful,
"For a long time I have been going on youtube for better explanation of a few mathematical concepts I had trouble to grasp, and finally I came across of a couple of 'Khan Academy' videos on YouTube. I was very satisfied of how well and easy he [Khan] explains hard concepts. It didn't take for me look his website and apps for more videos lessons. If you have not used Khan Academy, you should use it now.",
"Please decrease the amount of blue light in app because it make my head to ache when I use this app for a little longer time. Also the questions in exercises are too easy, so I request to make them a little bit harder and also use harder examples in videos to explain topics.",
This app is so amazing it got me to fall in love with math. I like all of the subjects now because I understand them a whole lot better. All of the teachers are amazing and they explained something to me in five minutes that I have been trying to understand for years so over all it's an amazing app. The only thing that bothers me has nothing to do with the app when it redirects me to chrome I have a hard time loading it up because I have super slow wifi but it loads fine.,
"Really amazing app, loved it. It definitely motivated me to study since there was a competitive edge which just made it all the more better. Although I would really want to see a dark mode option for it.",
"This app is so very awesome, giving good and true information teaching the world for free. This program is worth donating to to forever have this guys voice laying out so much learning, with some depth to the subjects offered and growing in volume. What an exceptional concept and resource to have available to all and all given with such mastery. Thank you so very much again for this gift unto all, and to all, a good mind. 💯💫",
This app is very good as compared to others there are test after completion of every topic and also revision test but one thing is that the language in which that person speaks in the videos is English but he speaks it likes that it isn't understandable even after turning on the captions. But yes if you downloaded this app for learning computer science it's the best but if for learning your course so you can face the above problem,
"This is honestly the best free remote learning service that I've ever see. I get to go ahead of what my classmates are learning so I can be extra prepared, or if I'm behind I can just search up the topic and it's right there!😊 Please continue to make this available to us all!",
"Best Thing Ever! I've been waiting for something like this for ages! I love to learn and rehone old skills, and this app brings it to your fingertips! Also, the immediate attention to app issues from the support team is phenomenal! Thanks Khan Academy! Keep up the great work!",
"I like most of the things about it, but one specific thing I have been annoyed about is the adjective order in the grammar course. It won't let me put the sentence in the correct order if the sentence is longer than four letters. This means I can't earn any points for the adjective order quiz. Other than that great app.",
"Khan Academy has saved my life. Growing up, I was not an avid reader, did not retain subjects learned during my informative years, and now in my 30's, I regret every bit of my past. Because of this app, I am able to catch up quickly what I lost and refresh my memory about various subjects. This app is a blessing from God himself.",
"amazing ,wonderful ,great ,excellent and joyful experience learning from Khan Academy every student should try it at least once. Guys you are doing a great job. thank you, thanks a lot for clearing all my doubts and helping me to understand the concepts in a better way.🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 rest all apps are just a mere wastage of time they tell you nothing but to buy their subscription .",
Hi my name is Varsha I like this app but the one thing is but whatever we do is for class 6 16 shows the same and another time also shows the same but when we do it again it shows that it is wrong but I think you have to correct this option if you go to classes Algebra and if you do that the unit test 1 is wrong then you put the whole history as long and one more thing is you guys must improve 1 thing is that you without assignments completed you should not show that hundred percent l like 👍😁,
Saved lessons offline still can't be accessed offline Edit: I saved it offline so that I wouldn't need to connect to the internet. I guess disconnecting idle devices on the network is just not going to work. But I'll try the different methods,
An amazing app for learning. I have been using it for biology and it has great video lectures and comprehensive articles on almost any topic. The diagramic representation of topics is helpful in getting hold of difficult topics.,
"This is an amazing app! It teachess you amazing skills and is available for all ages. It doesn'y have any ads, it has fun problems, and useful skills - such as economics. I haven't been interested in math or studying at all until i installed this app! And it also gives you videos and reports showing you new methods of working. This is one of the best educational apps I will ever use! Khan Academy deserves a 5 star rating!",
"Bad, they just make tests and exercises more harder than they actually are. making an exercise or/and a test almost unbeatable. And most of the videos just show the same things over and over again, making you more confused than you actually are. I must use this app in my school, but everytime I must solve a test I just end where I started. It will be better if they use What is used as hints (not the videos) included with videos for people who prefer use them than videos.",
"Almost perfect, I watched your videos and visited the website many times when I free time. The best place to learn new useful skills for everyday life. But the app doesn't include a spanish option.",
I really love Khan academy. But the app stops responding 😑 and it blanks out after working for few days. It has major issues but I love the website. Major fixing is required for this app as it doesn't load. I had to uninstall few times still this goes on. App needs major fixing!! Thank you Sal and team for all this free content.,
Nice interactive experience. Zero ads and there's hardly any technical glitch. It would be better if Sal gives reference of some additional resources or makes such material available on the app. Overall I love it!!,
"I absolutely love the app. When I have trouble with the problems understanding a concept at school, Khan Academy will explain it more better than my school. And I also like how it gives us practice questions so we can understand it better, I am grateful for all of this. Thank you and keep up the great work!!!!",
Its really good. You can pick your courses and it has courses for Indian school system. I liked the energy points and badge earning system was good motivation amd the programming courses were super fun. The best part is that its totally free.,
"First I kindly request to add programming in app too. Please.... App is very useful for many students who wants to learn in simple way and do the hardest of all problems. Questions are the best I would say, as of my point of view. And the main thing is this organization is non profit.",
The app is a solid 4 stars. However it is not a substitute for the website. Features like comments and the SAT practice are missing in the app and can only be accessed through the website. Hope that changes soon!,
"Seems like a nice app so far. Would give it 4 stars but certain courses like Computer Programming or Art History open an outside unrelated app and also my web browser. Either a bad glitch or a ""feature"" that needs heavy explanation.",
"I love khan academy, but I'm not able to watch videos with the latest update. 😣 Just shows a reload icon. I know you guys are debugging the new UI. Thanks for providing such a great resource. Looking forward to the bug fixes.",
"Needs improvement. The quality of videos are not good for even looking at them. The people of things are not visible properly, it appears blurry. But otherwise the exercise is ok!",
Really bad... Contains too many bugs... Impossible to actually follow the courses and evolve... Have restarted a quiz 15 times there is always one question that has a problem and it is always one with an order... You really need to resolve these problems ! Update : Tried troubleshooting problems still persisting. I have a samsung A52 mobile phone that is up to date. You applications has serious flaws and you aren't doing anything about them. Not to mention the functionality of the app. -5 stars,
"Private tutor using Khan lessons to brush up I am an academic tutor to grades 7-12 in rural Alberta, Canada. I may not have a Chemistry student for a couple of years, but I can refresh my own skills and help my students get another look at content by referring them to the Khan Academy videos. Thanks so much! And I am so excited about the longterm vision!",
Excellent video instruction and practice problems. Only critique to date is on some math problems i am unable to answer on my mobile device as sqrt or other keyboard input isn't allowed on the calculator keyboard provided and the second screen doesn't appear to work despite showing two grey dots.,
"This really helps when I fall behind and everything is neatly organized, and easy to understand the content. There are many different subjects all available in different languages too! I really like this app!",
I dont use it very often sjnce the one on the web is much easier & more accessible but its about the same. Its just more clunky & laggy. Other than that a great learning experience is in store if you use this program.,
"Omg I absolutely love this app I definitely learnt a lot over the past year, which was when I started using it first It's the best learning app ever (to me) and i can't get over the fact that it's free Because like omg with the current situation, when it comes to dedicating 4 hours a day to online classes and 2 hours with Khan academy, all I can say is that I mean I learn a lot more through Khan academy Love and support, Amruta",
Can there be a proper app for Samsung Tablets. The old versions were better. When using 3 button navigation there is a white bar below while watching videos. No problems with the resources,
"Very instructive and of course free. But also I want to copy the words in the transcript, because when I see a word which is I dont know, I want to copy and paste it to dictionary. It can be very useful for foreign students who dont know English very well.",
"I love what you have created. Maths although i have gotten all classes with high grades seem way more logical and I was able to structure everything correctly in my head.Only thing I miss are captions to the videos, so I can go trough academy from work at spare time.",
"This apps seems to be in no way connected to the online version. Nothing is synced when logging in using the same account, rendering it useless. The website is wonderful, but the app simply does not function as it should.",
"Perfect learning content for students. Explains the concepts in a great and easy way especially in maths & science. Much better than the paid apps like ""BYJUS"". I Would be forever grateful to the creator of this learning app to help students in their studies.",
"I'm looking for a good schooling app for my son. He's a homeschool student that fits between the grades 2nd and 3rd. I can find math courses for him, but nothing else. Everything else seems to be for higher grades. Is there something I'm overlooking or do I need to find a different school app? It seems like a really great app, but doesn't seem to have much for the lower grades.",
I am thankful to you for providing the invaluable source for free... Free and free. But there is a always a room for improvement. Can you please integrate the copying in Khan Academy App. In app we cannot copy the text which makes difficult for us to write. Thanking in anticipation.,
"EDIT: In response to the developer response below: It was working just fine until the new version. Most new tablet devices capable of running this app are ChromeOS devices and the website is not designed for touch-only interfaces. It's been an integral part of our homeschooling efforts since the schools shut down and I can't side-load the app on my children's FamilyLink google accounts. Now is not the time to be breaking compatibility with students' devices. Please help. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The update (6.10.0) breaks compatibility with some ChromeOS devices. I've been unable to use the app on my son's Acer Chromebook Tab 10, and up until the update that was his primary way of working on his math assignments. We've switch over to the website for now, but it is not nearly as easy to use with a touch interface. Please fix! Other than that, this has been a wonderful app to see grow over the years. I've used Khan Academy with both my children for several years now and they are both excelling in math. Sal Khan is a legend in our house.",
"I love this app. It's helped me a lot with my math too! Ive honestly took notes upon notes upon notes and went over them. I've wrote down things he had said to understand. Right now I just started 6th grade in a brand new school, and last year in 5th I almost failed but I think I also made it hard on my parents. But Khan Academy has helped me a lot and I really appreciate it! ❤️",
"It Would be better if we users are able to download articles to read even when offline so that we don't have to spend too much time watching downloaded videos to learn a concept , if it can be learned easily by reading the article. Thanks. Also , can you create articles for every video topic on this app? Because I think that some of those seemingly tough topics can be grasped just by reading the related article...and if not , then it would be my preference to watch the video..",
It is a really nice app. it makes us understand every thing clearly and properly with drawings vedios. And they also give us exercise after their Explaination. I really like this app. It has help me a lot for exams and texts and for my daily classes. Thanks😊.,
I love this very much😊 but sometimes it gives incorrect answer😡,
"I want to thank Sal Khan and his team from the bottom of my heart 🙏 You made me love the subjects I hated, and despite my having a paid Byju's subscription, I preferred Khan Academy because everything is explained step by step and in detail. Sal has a unique method of teaching which makes everything super easy to learn and crystal clear. Khan Academy was my main source of learning for my class 10 boards. A huge shout out to everyone at Khan Academy, you guys are changing lives! 👏 Thanks a ton!",
"Horrible! It didn't help me with anything, if you want to download it don't theres no point i clicked on 1 of the videos and all it did was right the word ratios on the board! I do not recomend ive used study smarter and personally i thing thats better.",
"Brilliant source of learning. I began using Khan Academy in first grade and fell in love with it then. In middle school I expanded to physics and grammar as well as mathematics. Now as a freshman in high school, I still use it. Sometimes I have questions about Calc work which the teacher didn't go over, and I just head over to Khan Academy and it is answered. Multivariable and Linear Algebra are also offered, along with Diffy Q, which allows expansion past classroom topics if you want to explore",
This app is extremely helpful for someone who is homeschooling and I have no regrets in downloading it. Though i would suggest that the files or notes could have a downloadable feature so it could be printed and used as notes. But overall amazing app.,
"Brilliant app. Don't know what I could do without it. However, whenever I google and click on a Khan Academy link, it redirects me to the app, but it doesn't open. I have to restart the application and then it will. A minor problem.",
"EDIT: I have installed and uninstalled the app more than 10 times. When I downloaded the app, it wouldn't even begin to load. All I see is a white screen then I am redirected to my home screen. Please fix this, as Khan Academy has been really helpful in my studies.",
"I love your app! Although one bug that I found is that whenever I try to download a bookmark, it keeps saying ""Error downloading bookmark"". I hope you can fix this.",
"Came back to Khan Academy after a few months and somewhere along the way an update (v6.10.0) rendered this app nonfunctional. Intermittently practice questions, quizzes and reviews will freeze when checking the answer. Exiting the quiz, program, or app and restarting does not solve the problem as you'll end up stuck at a blank screen upon returning to said question. Until they fix this issue, there's really reason to use this app.",
"It is a very useful and helpful for students.It is totally free of cost (100%). Thank you the app maker who make this app.You are best teacher in the world who make it's student best, better without any taking charges, money, etc. (guru dakshina). Thank for the maker and teacher who help us to study.",
The Content is great and the lessons easy to follow but the app is always slow to load booknarks even when they are downloaded and offline. There also isn't an option in the settings menu to download higher quality boomarks,
"Very good application despite some bugs and delays for updates. I would like to suggest that videos are recorded on a white background, as the current black background is very bad to view.",
The app is great but I don't know why I love the website more then the app. The website design is great as well as it keeps a track of my work . It also reminds me my schedule. I'm using the website only from 1 month but the results are incredibly. It is a very useful app for people who are preparing for SAT.,
Very good app for e-learning. Contents are in English which is very helpful and visual effects are very good. And subtitles in the videos helps a lot. You should give it a try...,
"the update is AMAZING, one of my previous problems with this app is that the UI was kinda cluttered and that it took up just a bit too much space, but you guys fixed that and it's AMAZING now! this app is great and helps me so much with my education, and I give kudos to all the people behind this.",
"It's the best. I'm using it fot maths, I already finished school but there were lots of stuff that I had never really understood and Khan goes to the root of everything so you get it. Plus the platform allows you to pick whichever lesson yoy want without an order. So thankful to the people who make this possible and for free",
"Amazing app👏👏👏. High quality educational videos as per the syllabus, no hidden charges and 100% free. Never thought that we could get so good content at NO COST. Question practice after every video to help revise the concept. Awesome app. Definitely recommended. 💯",
"I've just started with it, mostly as a refresher for maths. I'm liking it so far, but I wish I could turn the sound off on tests! It's very intrusive if you want to practice with others around.",
"Just Wow! I Can say in one word. I'm learning Computer programming and enjoying the course.When I Started learning in khan Academy ,it may be Some difficult,but if you are looking for a best programming online source,just go for it.But Only at one point,when I want to write Code,it is redirecting to the browser.Hope,they may fix this bug in the update.",
"Can't learn absolutely everything of course, but overall Khan Academy is a really good website/app to learn off of. You can ask questions and get answers form the community, you can earn energy points and get stuff with them, badges, and more! All in one free app.",
"This app is definately one of the best educational apps ever existed! But in recent updates lots of its contents have disappeared!! For example, there used to be lessons about medicine and the partner content used to have a part about philosophy... I had planned in advance to cover those lessons this month but unfortunately they are no longer available!! :/",
It is pure ass. I put correct answers even backed up by the Web and it gives me it wrong. Also you can't stop and restart the lesson once you get something wrong forcing you to go through the wrong lesson. One of the worst learning apps. I do not recommend.,
"This is a good app for learners and teachers all over the world. I sit back and learn more as a teacher. Presently, I have issue with the videos attached to each lecture because it wouldn't play. I would like the developer to look into it.",
"The most awesome educational app I've ever found ! Lots of awesome content in many different fields, so much to learn :D I'm going to enjoy every minute spent using this app, and will share it with my friends. Oh, and not to forget the most generous thing about it is that IT'S FREE AND HAS NO ADs !!!",
"I recently downloaded the app again after about more than a year, and I have to say I do like it better than before, but I'm confused as to why the drawing feature was taken away for Math practice. Having that feature available for mobile devices was a lot better than having it on the website in my opinion, so is it possible for it to be brought back?",
"Great app. He teaches in such a beautiful, clear and detailed way, it has been really helpful. Good work 👍 Khan Academy! You are doing really good work, being a non profit organization which provides such good videos and an absolutely free website and excellent app which has a very good quality. Salute to the hero, Sal.",
There's no words to describe how helpful Khan Academy has been for me! It has helped in almost all my exams making me understand the concepts better than anybody else! One of the best learning resources! Please keep doing what you do. Thank You! ❤️,
"Absolutely recommend for anyone who wants to learn and practice school subjects. Colorful illustrations, detailed lectures and casual-but-not-boring contents, these are the good points according to my experience.",
"Tried to do the first practice lesson,writing numbers in standard form, basic stuff. Got to question 2 of 7 and it will not allow me to to check my answer, I am literally stuck. I even tried using a hint, which counted against me, to see if it would let me check my answer then. Still nothing. Then I find out there is literally no one I can report this bug to so they can fix it and I can resume brushing up on my math. I'll just use youtube and online worksheets instead of wasting my time.",
Never-ever thought that there would be an app like this! It is the best instead of being one of the best learning app. Edit : After using this application I came to find that it lacks a number of content. So you're gonna miss some of the contents here. So you've to manage that from somewhere else. Overall it's good.,
"I think this is better than whole educational systems of some countries, really helpful and enjoying, made me understand better than my teachers at school, and really helps you in everything you can imagine, future job, personal finance, awesome collaborations with museums and other programmes.",
"It's really helpful and gives just as good of an education that people who pay tutors and tuition for. All of the content is free on the website and on their YouTube channel. If you don't understand something, the community gives (most of the time) really good answers to your questions.",
This app is best for me in comparison to any other app everything is systematically organized from introduction to conclusion. A detailed study of every topic is provided in the form of videos and written content. And the good deed is that everything is accessible for free but I would suggest to increase the amount of written content,
"This is a great learning app. Too bad after the update it keeps crashing as soon as I open. I hope this gets fix. But other then that, when the app did work, it was a very useful tool to help study and learn.",
"The best online resoures for learning basic concepts in physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. You can also get help for exams like SAT. It has nice excises after every lecture.In short its a great aap for learning.",
Its alright but it should have been a problem solving kinda educational app coz videos ain't that great... I don't know about others but to be honest I fell asleep while watching only two videos... (PS:I easily fall asleep watching videos,
"I have used many educational apps but i found this too be worthy that i have been searching for. It focusses how to drive student to a specific topic through natural occuring phenomenon experienced by them. The colours, the format design and my favorite,after each topic questions format. So what else u want dive into khan academy and have fun while learning.",
"Thanks a lot!!! This app helped me at my studies and because of Khan academy, math became one of my most favorite subject. I just have a request regarding on future updates, can you guys add more subjects related to humanities and add categories at the different fields of studies, for example you should put biology,geology,chemistry and other related subjects at natural science and put economics,history and other related subjects within it at social science, this will make your app much more awesome,either way thanks again :)",
"This the real academy! I actually started using it since 8th Standard and trust me, I can never find an equivalent for this. There are so many virtual academies, but I only endorse on Khan Academy. I live in Kashmir, India, I'm a 10th standard student and I love to study Physics, Chemistry and I.T. I missed some lessons at school for Electricity and Magnetic Effects of Electric Current which made it difficult for me to understand the chapters. Khan Academy helped me to understand them clearly!!",
"This app is awesome, but still have some bugs. Frequently the unit test don't load, and some figure don't move in any tasks. I can't achieve some task because figures don't work.",
"Awesome and the best free learning program but it needs a dark mode! edit: the app keeps on rotating, even if i have auto rotate off, it still rotates for no reason at all, please fix this.",
There is no way one can give feedback/review of videos for improvements. Because there are many topics which are very poorly explained and need a lot of improvements for learners to understand properly. The teachers are not explaining in a proper way which in turn causes students to lose interest. Feedback option on every video is necessary.,
November 2018 update made the app far more glitchy than it was. The drop down hints crash the app and occasionally it is impossible to answer a question. Edit: made contact with the development team. Will update my review if issue is fixed,
"I did really enjoy the app but why in a few months ago, I couldn't access any Digital SAT lessons on the app but only on browser?",
"New UI update makes it feel like it's for kids, when they have an app that is specifically for kids. Old one was much more appropriate for middle school- high school kids (like myself) who are trying to use it to study.",
"Dear Khan academy, Thank you so much for your application! Your application is priceless as it has helped refresh my memory on so many courses that I took in college! I love the scratch pad on the side where I can do the coursework and show my own work. I thank you guys and Ladies so much for your application I'm telling you it is just priceless!",
"Will there ever be an app for teacher's dashboard? 🤔 Now, that will be AWESOME! Anyway, when my children use the app, it does NOT reflect their progress for homeschool. They must use the website for it to reflect. I gave you 5 stars because I love what you're doing! The app needs to show progress and not freeze.",
"Issue regarding currencies. In some math tests, it involves America currencies that either show the wrong side of the coin so their value cannot be depicted and the images are of low resolution. As someone who is not American, these simple questions are rendered impossible to answer. The world is not American, contrary to what America believes. Docked 2 stars for overlooking something so obviously problematic. Everything else regarding the app is brilliant.",
No Japanese Support in App Despite there being plenty of content available on the desktop site the app does not have the option to access that content. This was really disappointing as I was very much enjoying the activities and wanted to take it on the go. Guess I'll have to stick with the mobile browser for now.,
It's a fantastic app for learning . Concepts have been explained very excellently . Everything is excellent 👍 But in some vedios there is some glitch Which need some improvement I hope that it will be removed . Thanku,
"I have explored your free educational app.I appreciate the features like multi language option,quiz,practice worksheet & unit test .One can self evaluate the learning outcomes by attempting the evaluation tools of the app .The vdeos are very good.In this way your mission to ""give knowledge to anyone and anywhere""is fulfilled.This app is useful for students from lower to upper grades.I suggest it would be helpful if you add thought provoking questions & notes & include graduate and post graduate",
"Would 100% recommend this app to kids being homeschooled, I'm just now getting into homeschooling and im gonna be going back soon, but this app is definitely helping me out because of my anxiety and ADHD it's good to be alone and actually being able to concentrate and learn with my work, I'm a quick learner so this app is teaching me a lot! This is awesome! The website version is amazing to, I'm able to work with it on a bigger screen on my laptop.",
Always my way to go app. I love it. It always makes my concept clear and give me more knowledge about a topic <33,
It's blowing my mind that this app is free and it's by a non profit but the quality is ridiculously good. I don't think people realize how many bad kid games our out there; even ones that drive kids to click ads. This is so well done and I'm so thankful for the time that was put into this app. Thanks for all you do!,
"One of the best, I can trust. Never ever I've seen the app like this😀. It provides a digital learning medium. Add more subjects to it, to learn new skills & gain more info.",
Just stunning. Everything is absolutely free and even according to the Indian foundation classes and also available in Hindi even the founder Salman sir is an American-bengali. Just love this app. Thanks sir for this.,
"This is a beautiful and amazing app and website. I am 21 years old and starting my journey towards getting my HI-SET education. These videos, explanations, lesson plans, and quizzes help me SO MUCH. I don't know who invented or came up with this idea, but your an absolute legend. My dream of going to collage doesn't look out of sight anymore.",
"Yes, it's truly an amazing app. It's a user friendly app. The content is amazing so far. There is a clearance in the teacher's language. I am giving 4 stars to this app because of a reason that is I request to the makers to think something about business studies and accountancy for class 11 and 12. Otherwise it's best educational app and it's a 5 star app.",
"Good content. But after logging out for a week, I couldn't find my account at all. Then, after making another account on the desktop website, I downloaded the app again. But when I press ""Sign In"", it goes to settings. What is this? How can I sign in?????? I uninstalled and reinstalled the app 3 times but the same happens everytime. Please help.",
Amazing! the best app ever The information is accessible and easy to understand. if you don't understand something it provides a video and testing. it gives feedback and solutions. Thank you Khan Academy. learning on here is so simple. i love this App!,
"Absolutely Perfect for home-school. Khan is an amazing, gifted teacher. Everything works smoothly. You'll want to donate to this project, simply because this team is passionate about bringing high quality, free education to kids. They deliver efficient and effective content/structure. It's exactly what you have been looking for (quality/simplicity/integrity) as the public system implodes under it's own insanity. I've looked at many options. This is the future of education right here. 10/10!",
This is app is great and I really appreciate the creators for this I'd like to suggest few things only because i really like this app: 1) dark mode because white is bright for the eyes 2)in tablets full screen functionality dosent work oroperly 3)a 5 sec forward or reverse option Thank you and God bless! 4) pls see thiss the auto rotate dosent work properly and i hope i could turn it off 😞,
Most people would say: THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE MATH APP!!!!! Even Google says like 70% of the answers are wrong. Don't play this it's just another stressful math game that makes 0 sense. Ignore those people. I even get stressed about it but all you need is practice! Overall I love the graphics and the app. I wouldn't recommend this though if you get stressed easily or you might say hateful comments like most people say. You just need some practice! IGNORE HATEFUL COMMENTS!!!!!,
"This app is great. It does have less content than something like coursera but, for the basics, it's amazing. The teacher who does the math and physics courses is incredible.",
"Hello, I rate this application a 5 star because it is free and really helpful for those who don't have enough money to go to school. And please add some features to create a folder to organize our downloaded videos in the bookmark section. Thank you for your non-profit application; I really appreciate and love it.",
"Best educational app ever. If you're from any part of the world, this app will break down the complexity of core subject and teach them in a more detailed and simple way! My only contribution to this app is, you should app more topics in Art and Humanity category, if you can do this, I will invite all my friends in school to check out this app.",
"such a poorly optimized app. you will be typing on a page by page keyboard that dosent have options for functions such as secant, atleast when i was doing derivative practice. then you see that greater than, less than has more priority taking up a good chunk of the 2nd page and realize youre better off actually playing for a service that wont make you want to eat your own hair (or probably just use the desktop version sadly)",
"I've been trying for so many years to obtain my high school diploma, and I finally achieved it thanks to Khan Academy. Very useful lessons, the videos are well explained. The teachings on here are amazing. Thank you Khan Academy for being right at my fingertips, when I needed you the most.",
"Though the content seems fine, figuring out where to begin was hard as there is no placement test, so you just have to muddle through the grade levels and hope you find where your kid is supposed to be. Also, doesn't have much of a ""fun"" element, despite being geared towards kids.",
"Thank you for this type of great app. It provides so many useful videos. And the way of teaching is literally superb. I will suggest this app to everyone , specially who want to clear their concepts. Keep adding more and more amazing content. And 1 day this will become world's no. 1 study app.",
Horrible can't even change your character or do the mastery test like on the computer. I wanted to do just drawing an animation because I mastered almost all my courses and it gets boring but this app doesn't even have a drawing and animation😡😠,
"Exceptional app, definitely! But please, let's make it as great as the actual online website! Especially where navagition to and accessing all your courses and lessons that you are involved with is concerned.. Otherwise, thumbs up! ;)",
Great app.. Very useful for learning.. The only problem is the downloading of video aspect.. The button doesn't respond early and it keeps saying download failed. If download was able to be tracked it'll make it easier. But thanks for the good work.,
Great content but for some reason a pain to navigate unless just going online. I have to do khan academy because I recently applied for benefits and have to do 20 hours a month. I feel like I've been doing this almost every day and it's not properly logging my time. I'm not sure if it's only timing the videos and short exams and not the time on it because there's some courses that you have to read so is that time not being counted? I'm on all time with little progress on time?,
"It's missing some courses and features, but I really just want a sketchpad like the website has. I'm getting sick of having to pull out my S Pen and using Screen Capture just to write on-screen notes that don't even stay.",
"This app is perfect for me. It has unlimited practice, no limitations. All videos in this app are completely free. No ads or interruptions. It really helped me to gain me good marks in my exams. I am really thankful to the Team Khan Academy for developing this app.",
"I am often times unable to download lessons for future offline references/usage. I really hope this can be taken care of. Apart from this, the app/website is a really great one. It has helped a lot. Keep up the good work. God bless!",
"I enjoyed this app. I really appreciate it because they are providing premium education at no cost in this commercial world where all other companies (like Byju's, Extra marks,etc) provide limited education and loot very much. I have tried almost every app on playstrore, but I found Khan Academy, The best learning App with non-commercial content.",
"Excellent app to learn any different sciences such as math, physics, chemistry, mechanic and computer sciences, it's teach with excellent way with video lessons and exam for every single lesson, i liked it and i recommend it.",
"Though, the app is easy to use and intuitive, providing access to an incredible repository of knowledge, the search feature is broken. It works flawlessly on the website but on the application it doesn't provide expected results.",
"the app keeps on closing... it would be better if u include more realistic animated videos... reading is something that we even do in our textbook... one more thing, i cant find neet in the tests given in the app",
"This is an amazing app with a truly beautiful goal "" a free world-class education for anyone anywhere"". The people at Khan Academy are amazing for making this app and helping people learn. I'm currently pre-med and I found this amazing app and all I want to do is learn as much as I can from this app. When I have the opportunity in the future I will definitely give back like they have done for me.",
"I truly love Khan Academy. I was homeschooled and got very far behind in math. Most my basics math skills were taught to me through Khan Academy by myself. I jumped into 12th grade doing college algebra with a 5th grader's knowledge. There was a lot to catch up on, but Sal Khan explains things in a way that really breaks down the topic and makes it easy to understand. I am forever grateful!",
"Love khan academy. Allows me to learn so much at my own pace. But I just cannot use the app with my potato phone. Internet access isnt so consistent where I am so I need to download the courses, problem is that because my phone is a potato the storage is small. Whyyy can't I save courses to the SD card. This needs to be addressed!",
"This app is amazing. The teachers' explanations are on point, and they don't talk in a boring way which actually makes learning fun. Was having a lot of problems with school but this app has definitely helped me.",
"Great resources and engaging training. Stop scrolling through feeds and start learning! Assessments and badge system help to keep you motivated. It's all free, but we'll worth a donation to keep platforms like this available for those who might not have the resources to pay for training. Highly recommend!",
Love the app but lately I haven't been able to get certain quiz and test questions to load. I'll use my mobile data and now I've tried a few different wireless connections as well. Again I love the app but these problems make using it incredibly.... Frustrating.,
I have been using this throughout my school life to help me revise and clarify my doubts. Its amazing and I got my brothers to use it as well. The videos are very helpful and the practice questions are challenging too!,
"2020 - update - this app is fantastic to touch up on your education and learning. I've been out of HS since 2005, and some advanced subjects in mathematics is beyond me. I forgot most of it, so this definitely helps to relearn or polish up on them.",
this app is good but im taking away a star bc theres no option for dark mode and getting my eyes burned doesnt help with my lack of motivation,
"Good content, but there should be homework assignments facilities also.",
"I can learn so much. It has a variety of subjects and is free. If you need an easy to understand study app, this is for you. Also it has SAT preparation classes. Perfect for highschoolers.",
"I am a regular user of Khan academy app. Best place to learn new things ,it help me improve more on my math life.",
"Really noble aim of the app, nice implementation. Thank you for your work.",
This app doesn't load... I tried resetting my device and nothing Fix the issue please,
Its reaaaaly helpful i struggle with my grammar and this app just teaches me better than my professor,
It's very good for learning and practicing things. very useful,
"Great program for learning math and other skills and they even test you in app on your knowledge and give you experience points for completing tasks although I wish they had a few more questions for every new thing they cover then what is provided, it's still the best app for learning math that I have found",
"Assignments don't load, crashes upon opening some tasks too. This plays an important part of my maths course and now I'll be criticized for not using this. When the app is at fault. Uninstalled then reinstalled and the error persists.",
"Team, Khan Academy. The app crashes whenever I open a video & not able to use app. If I open the video again, it again crashes and throws me out of the app to my homescreen. Kindly solve this issue. Thanks.",
Useful app but not very user friendly. After a video ends you can't directly go to the next one. Downloading the videos stops if the file size is too big or I download multiple ones at once.,
"This has been great up until the last update which is funny because the notes say that there were fixes for bugs and performance issues, yet, I've had constant lagging and crashing that never happened before.",
"I thought it was going to be in app not bounce me to web browser where I can't watch the videos because they get cut off on the side of the screen. Also how's that work with answering questions? Or working on programming with the type window and display window? Edit: The developer clearly doesn't understand. I was expecting a closed environment on mobile, not a shunt to web.",
"This app is very good for learning. But there may be something wrong please make changes for the wrong happening. When I am trying to get a quiz or tests given by our school, at that time this application is showing that """"""""error making progress"""""""""" I don't understood what they wanted to say. 😕😑",
"There are only a few courses listed in the edit courses menu and it's not possible to join any courses that aren't on that list. Even if you try to search for the course you're looking for you can't view the full thing, it only shows you individual lessons. If you manage to pull up the course on your browser it's not possible to bookmark it either. Also, if the course you're working on isn't in the edit courses list the app forces you to add a course to your list that you're not even working on.",
"It's very gud content for studying . I really enjoyed it , it has been desigend in such a good way I really appreciate the team. The study gets more enjoyfull wid some quizzes there are quizzes after each topic , just i'll say that it's very beneficial for all. Must download .🙂 HAPPY LEARNING :)🌈",
All over this app is fine. But it has so many bug to fix. I had 65 assignments but this show me only 30. So I have completed only 30 assignments and other 35 remained due.😶 And then I'm punished by our teacher. Please fix these bugs as soon as possible.,
"Too good app!! Thank you creators and everyone. I'm using it to learn computers!! It's the best thing i could ever ask for. Btw I'm not knowing if it's including psychology too of the same level, is it possible to include a good full course of graduation level psychology too? Thanksss",
"I just hopped into my first topic, introduction to economics, the guy giving the introduction took way too long to get to the point. He sounds like he likes to hear himself talk. His voice is really annoying. I just want you to know my soul is aching.",
"1. First of all the greatness of this app is it's completely free. 2. Secondly concepts of each and every topic are very deep and quite challenging, which is very useful to higher level education. 3. Great management of app. 4. Thank you.",
Horrible performance issues. It takes good minute or so to load in the content. And when it does load and appear on the screen touching them does not do anything. Absolutely unusable,
This is the best learning app out there. The projection of the concepts is super clear. Teachers of khan academy are really best at what they do. I got my basic concepts cleared and very well understood. The highlighting part is that this app is absolutely free. Thankyou khan academy. Thankyou all the teacher's of khan academy especially the science teachers. I m enormously grateful to you people. Good luck!,
Super simple. This app is amazing. I can easily clear any topical doubts that I have because of this app. It's all totally free. The videos are super on the point. Just absolutely amazing!,
"I was homeschooled and I failed to educate myself and no matter what my parent's did they couldn't get me to do my school work. This app in one year has help me go from a 1st grade math level to 5th grade, it has essential history, Science,Grammer and everything else that is needed to educate and it's completely free. This app saved my life. If you feel stupid download this app! And remember being smart doesn't mean you're educated it's about what you do in life and the choices you make.",
"One of the best app to learn Physics, Chemistry and science subjects but if you want to learn computer programming or other computer subjects then I do not recommend this app. Since they do not have much computer related stuff on their platform.",
"Why is this app not working whenever I sign in??? I tried to click every courses I see yet nothing happened, tried to click the search bar but nothing happened, and whenever I close and reopen the app it shows a white screen for like 20-40 seconds before I see the courses :( pls fix these bugs I really need khan academy right now 😔",
"At first the app kept closing but after troubleshooting the app was great! Its easy to navigate, fun to learn, and the class are taught by professional teachers. I personally love this app",
"The Android app is alright, but after having used the desktop version for months, this feels like a step down. Perhaps you guys can work on the user interface a bit to make it seem more friendly rather than just minimalistic.",
"Khan academy is a beautifully constructed education app that is accessible for all ages. There is an astounding amount of educational content and resources that are constantly being updated and expounded. The curated content will intrigue the lifelong learner as well as little ones who are learning a skill, subject, or concept for the first time. Khan academy does not disappoint. Parents, if your kids are struggling at school this is a great at home resource. A+ recommendation",
"The app itself has lots of bugs and is very slow. The platforms is great though, absolutely amazing. 5/5. Just not the app. If you could just make it run faster I'd be very happy.",
"Khan academy is amazing. Videos help, explanations help, literally everything about it is good. I've used ixl for a while, and its point system is absolute garbage. Khan is easy to use and is free! You can learn so many things besides for math, including Javascript and other things. All of this free of charge. 5/5 would reccomend.",
"I am learning everything that I struggled to learn as an adolescent and it's all at my own pace with no one giving me an A or F that will determine my future. It's a beautiful, seamless, personalized application. Progress is made clear and teaches based on mastery not grades. For the best experience you should use their website on a computer.",
"This app is super helpful with most subjects, especially on biology which I struggle on, but this app definatly helps me comprehend what I'm doing, the videos and articles are super helpful, and the tests are great too, I like this app alot and I'm so glad I downloaded it:)",
Fantastic App and thank you for the videos but people in most countries peoole do not have the money or bandwidth to watch the videos on high quality. Please introduce a quality setting in the app untill then i will have to use Youtube to watch your videos since it has a quality setting.,
"The app is really good, it have videos explaining the problems, so you can understand the questions. The unique problem I had was about the hints! When you're doing some question, it give you some hints to you resolve the problem, but the method its bad to me because it test every option (Tested only in math area)! An example: ""x+0=3; a)0 b)1 c)2 d)3. "". If you use the hint, it go to say something like ""x+0=0, so the answer is not A"", and not explain how to do the exercises without options.",
"Hey devs, i'm encountering a problem. When i was doing the unit test i accidentally press the recent button and when i came back its loading and when it does get to the test but theres a prompt saying ""we have a problem blah blah"" and when i press the okay button it exits the unit test and this loops keeps going on so i can't take the test. Pls fix this dev i'll rate it 5 star if that helps",
"I appreciate Khan Academy providing free educational content. There is a variety of courses to choose from with video lessons, exercises and some even have quizzes or tests. It's my favorite app to go to for free learning.",
"It's remarkable application for learning math, physics and other sciences. Another huge advantage is that you can learn English while watching the videos as I do. Also it's completely free! It deserves 10 out of 5",
"Repeated ""There was an issue signing in"" error",
"This app is THE BEST for studying, learning ahead, etc.! When I had to use Edgenuity at school, linear equations and imaginary numbers never made sense. Since using Khan Academy, these subjects have finally clicked inside my brain. Having this app makes it even easier to learn. I will use Khan Academy for the rest of my educational career!",
Amazing like brilliant app I left school because of corona virus in 2020 and then my brother suggest me to study from Khan academy and bro like I am studying since 2020 and this website/app never disappoint me and also I don't need to go to school again now I am full time schooling from Khan academy good job Salman sir keep it up 👍❤️,
"as we know we all want our child's learning very well.i will suggest all,if u want ur child's secure future u should give online classes from khan academy.ur child's studies can be better.this academy teaches very well.ur childs will learn from best academy they will be successful in life.khan academy's teachers are the best.khan academy is the best.",
"Wonderful App and initiative by the Khan Academy team! I have been using this app and the website since I was in highschool. 7 years down the road, I'm contemplating pursuing another degree, and naturally, this is the first place I turn to for a refresher. Thank you for all your hard work!",
"Hi, I'm Muhaimin from MJSC TDI. This app is really helpful for students like me. It is easy to use and I could study more using this app. In addition, during online classes, I often missed the lesson, thus I could revise back easily using this app. I highly recommemd this app to both students and teachers to ease our learning process.",
"Very nice and great app, hats off to developers and community who are providing quality free education in this insensitive greedy world today! i greatly recommend this app to others! BUT the only thing i feel not so good is the lack of content specially in COMPUTER FIELD! so i guess its not of much use for a comouter science student like me but i m greatly looking forward to see the new additions so that even undergraduates can also benefit from it!",
the app stops playing video suddenly and doesn't load even after restarting the app. though the internet connection is perfect and the same lecture can be played on youtube just fine. please look into it.,
"The only thing they might be able to improve is telling you what you need to do next. I wasn't sure when I finished the 1st grade math. But it's really super easy. I downloaded it to prepare for my daughter going to school. I'd heard that the schools are teaching math differently and I wanted to be able to help her when she needs it. I don't know what my sister is complaining about, the math makes sense to me.",
I could learn anything at my pace...Love this app. Still there are some bugs.. for example:-Differential equations playlist....I'm unable to download.... It download fully and finally gave an error. Hope so that this bug will be fixed soon,
"I love the app, but after the most recent update the app crashes every time I open it. It opens to a blank screen, aside from the bottom menu bar, and then it closes after about 2 seconds.",
"The videos are great, but sometimes there's a problem in the app, even after I finish watching certain videos such as Missing Angles "" (CA Geometry) "" and ""Simple probability: non blue marble"", it still shows they're incomplete. Please fix this issue.",
"I tried redownloading the app multiple times but the app doesnt work. It opens and shows the main page as usual, but when i click on something, it doesnt work. The web version works fine on my computer though. Idk whats wrong, please help if you read it",
"I've watched many lectures of other apps like Physics Wallah, Byjus etc but nobody explained concepts like the teachers on this app do, all the concepts just go straight into your head. Loved it ☺️. I'm surely gonna donate to this amazing non profit organization in the future, when I get a job.",
Just awsomeeeeeeeeeee!!!! This is the best place to get the concept clear. It gives extra things than ncert so that our concept is clear. I just love this app 😍!! The teachers are sooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood. I can't even express my happiness 🥳. One of the best best best best place to study.,
"I mean seriously they are providing such a good amount of contents for free. This is the best app for education. I recommending to everyone who ever is reading just use this app it's add free and any one who is spending lots of money on their coaching or tuition just save your by using Khan academy and it's very great for them who can't afford tuitions fee, and hat's off to the ones who are teaching.",
"This app is the best thing ever. You can complete problems based on the lesson completed. so, you will be perfect in that respective topic. Video lessons are super easy to understand, You can ask other students in comments section if you have a doubt. Well, i guess that's what a student needs.",
Great expereince so far. One thing that bothers me is that there is no option to have the videos captioned. There is a transcript but that barely helps if it is not in the video. So please add captions support for the app!,
I highly recommend the app. This helped me a lot to complete amazing courses. And also they have really a planned course outline which is efficient for learning. I hope they'll keep this pace forever.,
They don't update content anymore.. but I will give 5 Star for whatever available it is.,
"It deserves a 5 star rating because the app itself is amazing, easy to use, and helpful. Not to mention the quality of the lessons there. Everything about this app and its system satisfies me a lot. I really want to thank the creators and crew of khan acadamy for developing such a convenient and reliable system which turns out to be the best.",
Even tho this is an amazing app to use but i just wish there was more than just the subjects that is already there. I really wish you can apply English And Language Arts for all PreK to 12th grade and college along with the others. I would really appreciate it.,
I love this! This is helpful to me as a student. I can choose and select the course I wanted. I can practice math problems. And the reason why I like this app the most is because of the video lectures. It saved me everytime I am confused or struggling. Thank you so much for this app. Thank you for making it free as well.,
"Great, but even if you get the correct answer for any of the math quizzes if it isn't in the exact form they want it will count it as wrong, even the the quantity is the same. Also, the app doesn't work on my phone after a month.",
It's amazing because the name of Khan sir I know it will be a best application due to khan sir,
"I really thank you my dear respected lovely teachers ! Your explanation is really fantastic, that really created interest on subject ! I hate chemistry and physics especially but after going through your lectures I really enjoyed the subject ! Morover your teaching is not like our teachers teaching bcuz they just come and scribble the formulae by giving notes and run away , but you really taught concepts Cleary and gave very good knowledge on the subject ! I really thank you from bottom of my❤",
"Found this app great, the person who does the videos isn't patronising and explains and teaches in the videos better than I've experienced before certainly better than when I was taught at school. Really impressed!!",
"First, when i installed this app my mom also said this is a good app but when i changed my account my all points got wasted from 4,021 but when when I reinstalled with my old account with which i opened Khan Academy App my all 4,021 points came back and I was happy because were gained after attempting more and more quizzes and after attempting the master test with which we can get 100 points!! Excellent experience from Khan Academy !!! Great job !,keep it up guys!",
Good app but it doesn't really explain it properly my mom is a wayyyy better teacher than you and how do I chat ? U did all the things but nothing . Please respond If your having trouble with maths don't try this only when your better at it 😉 I just can't understand Area and perimeters so please help me more khan ): Not even my parents can understand you Sal ):<,
"This is the best ever educational application I have ever come across. It not helps you with your studies but also it has many other courses like economics, art and humanity, computing etc which are absolutely free. And because of this I am giving this app 5 stars. Thank you sooo much Khan academy for making such an incredible app.😍😍😍",
Can you please invest in the learning of people with hearing impairments and include Subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) to all video content. It's impossible to view and learn from the video and read and follow the lines of transcript at the same time. I feel this limits and impacts on learning styles and capacity of a potential 430 million viewers worldwide (World Heath Organisation) who experience hearing impairments and require subtitles to understand a film. Thankyou,
"it's a wonderful platform comparatively, but I find it lacking in addressing social sciences, specifically psychoanalysis and sociology. A mere search gives individual videos and essays. what I would have preferred was something like courses listed. The knowledge then is mere basic and not much. :(",
"I normally use my computer to use khan academy, but now I decided to download the app on my phone. I'd say its good but there are things on khan academy that only work on the site. I did wish the experience in app was the same as the site but the fact is that it isn't. It's still fine since this service is free after all, so I won't complain. I rather thank all those who make khan academy possible.",
"As a high school math teacher, being able to assign my students practice while I'm on the go makes life super easy! The interface is clean: support hints and video explanations are always a click away!",
I love using this app to learn it's really good in my opinion but it's disappointing to know that I can't access the notes I can watch the videos but not see any of the notes I've tried deleting cache and reinstalling still nothing has changed I'll really appreciate it if the if this problem can be fixed cause I really want to read the notes.,
"The app always shows that I am offline despite being online and the Internet in a Working condition. Even after multiple uninstalls and phone restarts, the app still says, I am Offline. Its very annoying and am Unable to use all the features of learning available in this app.",
This is the best app for students who are financially weak . This app goal is to provide a better education for a better tomorrow . Sal sir and all the team thanks for making such platform. By using it i get to know that this is a educational app not buisness app. The topicwise short videos are awesome . The way you explain things in short and simple way is i have no words to explain but awesome . Keep expanding . I am from india . It helped me a lot .Thanks to the teacher and teamwork .,
"This is a very good educational app that I've been using for a long time however I changed my phone and when I downloaded it once I open the app it instantly crash. It's really frustrating, tbh. Hopefully it will be fix soonest!",
It's quite helpful previously but now.... I can't open it. I tried reinstalling and switching the power off.... But it hangs up everytime . Hopefully you can fix this problem so that I can further use it for edu.,
"Amazing app. Amazing concept. Everything is taught so perfectly and above all of that its free. You taught that's it No, u can view it offline too. Salute to the team for such a great work. You guys don't know how much you hepled me. Keep up the awesome work 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌. Thank you!",
"My experience through the khan academy is awesome.Now I am in 10th standard,I felt much difficulty to understand the concepts in Physics and Maths during the online classes. But khan academy helped me a lot, interesting videos, quizzes .Thank you so much 😘.One last thing I need to say,when I worried about my studies during this pandemic period,I gone to Google search - which is the best platform to learn, then the first thing I saw was khan academy which is a non profitable organisation 👏👏👏.",
"Right now in this pendamic situation I have the best guidance as well , best teachers . In this application I can't say it application , I can say this is a group of teachers how are crisp to the point as well make you clear approximately everything from theory as well as practically . Better then school teachers it also contains 4 questions after every single topic so if you are interested you can also solve them , best application for students to have knowledge over all conclusion is Download",
"I would have rated this 5 star for the work done, all the lessons are exceptionally well explained with tests but Indian school courses do not appear in the application. For this reason I everytime have to access it on the website which makes this app not really useful for me as I am an Indian school student. Also it doesn't have Indian Chemistry course. Please fix the issue and add the course respectively as soon as possible.",
"This a very good app, it works properly and doesn't crash. The best is that there are lot subjects to study and the explanation is quite good and all this is for free. It is much better than other educational apps that charge a lot of money.",
"I really love this app! It's an amazing app. But the main problem is that the Chemistry lectures for class 11th are not available yet. Khan Academy, please do something for this problem. Please add the content soon.",
"I'm just loving it! Edit: After using it for a while it stopped opening I can enter the app but I see only the white background and the 3 menu options at the bottom, but I still like it because I can go to the website and use it.",
"Definitely 5 stars! Download this app. Share to your friends, educator. Also let's donate to this! I have a fast internet now. But they should include option to lower the video quality for slow connection. I live in 3rd world country, and Thank you so much Khan Academy and staffs for making this app/site. You help a lot of people to learn easy and more! More powers to you guys!!!!",
"Hello, Khan! I am blessed to be able to use this app. I don't know why so many people are commenting on it as boring, but I have a little bit of a learning disability like I can't catch on quickly or learn a lot by just reading it one time. But this app helps me. It's like magic. I do recommend this app for special needs or if you homeschool or just wanna catch up faster. Thank you!",
"Khan Academy is one of the best and leading application in terms of education. It provides you a plethora of content to go through and it's absolutely free of cost . I'd surely recommend it to students whether they are in United States , United Kingdom and also Indians might benefit too",
Really helpful app if you are looking to learn or refresh what you have forgotten. The videos are easy to use and understand and small quizzes at the end to test you.,
"The only thing keeping this app from 5 stars for me is the lack of Chromecast support. So if that doesn't matter to you then consider this a 5. Resources a great, study questions are perfect, this is going to be the reason I pass all my classes.",
I like it really helpful. I can easily do it on my phone!🙃 my only problem is the fact they only let you watch a video after you get the problem wrong. Please change this! I want to watch a video then do the problem so I know what to do! Besides that I really recommend getting!!!😄,
"I love this app. However, after a few hours of use it starts loading very slowly, if at all, and the quizes load as error. Every time this happens, I have to redownlaod the app to get it working correctly again.",
"The app is awesome you guys have to try it but the thing is, there is no science for smaller grades like for example grade 5 or 6. And also you (The game developers) should add some fun interesting games for all subjects and grades or else it's an awesome app.",
Really Really great App!! Helped me learn soo much! please add more content on the Computer Science course about coding!! and I would love that actual schools integrate their online classes here because it's so organize and makes learning fun!!,
Fantastic app for beginners.. I appreciate the work of team.. Really it is very useful to me and My suggestion is to make separate class studies of biology and chemistry ...like physics and maths ..soo it makes fully specific to understand...and all the best to KHAN ACADEMY.. and keep it up your journey...,
"This app used to be the best of the best but now (it's been a month) the videos pauses intermittently and the quality dropped. I thought it was my internet connection but no, I tried to clean my memory but still all the same.",
"Good app, but it is better for high school students. As a middle schooler, I can only practice math. It is pretty boring for me, to only practice math. I love math, but I can't just practice math. I NEED other subjects too. I will be really happy if you add other subjects. If there are other subjects, tell me how to practice them.Thank you. ~written by an anonimous 5th grader",
"Great learning materials and most importantly free of cost. It made education easier and available for me. Moreover, learning was never been so fun before! Looking forward to more AP and SAT subjects to be added. Thanks a lot!",
"the first time i installed the app, it wouldn't log me in and even after it did, it wouldn't let me use it i.e it wouldn't load any of the courses even though the data connection was on. so i figured that it must be switched onto wifi connection only, but it wasn't. then i tried reinstalling the app. this time it wouldn't log me in AT ALL. saying that there was an issue in logging in with the google account. i tried all the other options but it still wouldn't give me access.",
An excellent app for students and educators. The app provides access to multliple educational subjects and materials to aid learning. I enjoy the links to youtube video tutorials and lots of practice.,
Best learning app ever and the only educational app I have seen so far which works for better education rather than business. All teachers are very great and I love the fact we can learn almost everything for free.,
"i actually love app but now after the update, I can NEVER load the videos or excercise. it always says ""error making task process (title) we encountered an error while attempting to make progress in this task; please try again later.""",
It works fine until i have late assignments in my current class. I go to the late work tab and it isn't there. It works on the computer but my phone doesnt show it. I need this app to work for school so Im very dissapointed that this very important feature isnt working. Please update this bug.,
"I use this app for my math 1 class. Its very easy to find what you're looking for and my homework is very easy. But that's not the point, the point is is that my teacher can assign us homework and i think thats great that she can do that on this app! Its very helpful with tutorials and tips. I reccomend this app 100%. But i just got an iphone8 so im done with this stupid galaxy......",
Its an amazing educational app. I just want an option in it to download videos on the cloud so that I could learn from the same video without consuming large data. Hope I will see an option to download videos on cloud like edx and Coursera.,
"It's a great educational app, and it has almost everything. But there is a lesson that is missing. Okay so there is the stem-and-leaf plot, but there isn't the back-to-back stem-and-leaf plot lesson. Please add it. Thanks alot btw.",
"I'll have to admit, the teachers are pretty good and explain every concept clearly but I'm giving this four stars since I'm facing technical issues. One of the issues is that I can't post questions in the community and second, I can't post doubts in the videos. If you can fix these issues, I will certainly rate this five stars.",
"Best learning app I have ever seen! Contains so much detailed information about such a wide range of topics! Love it absolutely! There is an additional feature for checking your progress. There are badges to be rewarded for various accomplishments which makes learning so much more enjoyable and encouraging!!!!!💖💖💖 You should definitely go for this app if you want to acquire extra knowledge in a concise manner! Thank you, Khan academy!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏💓💓",
"It's because of this app, I've learned SQL and am learning coding for free without any premium...... Thanks to pamela fox and the ka team for sharing knowledge.... Btw the build is soo good in your site.. however, I can't find the same user interface in the app, it'll be easily accessible if you can work on a similar interface on your app too... Right now I'm not in a position to donate for your services, however I'll surely do when I settle",
This app is ok but there are a few flaws. Now my parents go by minutes to see how much I did but it always says I did less than I really did. But overall I really like this app and think it is nice. Also when reading the reviews be careful and look at the dates because some of them are out dated and old. The app has changed a lot and is ok and helps a handful of students considering it is free. It also helps schools that have been shut down by this virus (COVID-19) and doing its good deed helping humanity at a scary time like this.,
I used this app to help prepare me for the math portion of my GED and it really helped. The lessons were perfect and covered everything from what I needed to things i didn't need but others may find helpful. So I recommend this app to any person of any level of education.,
"Hii I'm charvi, as I said in my previous review that I loved the app, I would also like to say that it provides a good and extra information about science, mathematics, economics etc... I have biology as one of my subject but then when I started watching videos it gave me extra knowledge which also helped me to understand topics much more easily.. This app has made me fall in love with maths which was a bit hard for me.. I suggest everyone to use this app..",
"doesn't let me do practices / activites, glitches on profile tab, and doesn't count the videos as watched most of the time. okay app if on the go without a computer to do Khan academy and just watch their videos.",
"I think this is the only educational app in the entire world which is not making money and selling courses like others do, The teachers are relative and teach in friendly way with very relative way. They seem like they are one of our friends explaining us. Thanks to developers, teachers (Specially David teaching Science class 11 India) and the organization.",
"It's the best app out there. I love it, I love the educators and the quality education that they provide for free. I can't afford going to tuition classes right now, so this helps me a lot. When I have some money in the future, I'm gonna make a donation here. To these lovely people to help and educate more students♥️",
This app is very useful and helpful for me but the problem is I am not getting the assignments.. I have already completed 1 lesson of physics and chemistry. Now I want to practice the question of the lesson. I have downloaded this app on my android. Please help me to get the assignment. Hope I will get the reply soon..,
"Great, great, great!!!!!! The maths teacher for class 10 India is so great!!!!!! He is amazing, made Euclid's Division Algorithm so easy!!!! Must use app if you don't have a maths teacher in this lockdown phase. The maths teacher here will make you pass the exams! Also, not only for maths but for all the science subjects! I am a board student and I suggest it to you!",
"Most amazing app for concept learning ...totally free,,.every part of the app is amazing. No ads . Nothing only crystal clear education and perfect tests series..video lectures are conceptual but lack visual graphics..",
"Awesome app for learning and revision. A minor annoyance in some exercise is that some questions expect answers to be rounded. However, in the event of putting a correct floating point answer upto 6 decimal, some answers are accepted as correct while some are evaluated as incorrect. I would suggest to improve this by always accepting an answer in higher precision even if a rounding is expected. Right now it is a bit annoying to be penalized for higher precision",
This app is very useful. I understood more math and science topics because of this app. It's very useful for someone like me who struggles to understand concepts without repeating the lecture.,
"I discovered the website a few days ago (really like it) and decided to download the app. I can watch videos fine, but everything else gives me an ""error making task progress"" message, so it's not much use.",
app is great .. it could be more interesting if background music will be added like that in byju's. which helps to concentrate even more and makes the topic even more interesting to learn and one will not get bored as well .... by the way really great app... thankyou Hey where are other videos like organic chemistry and all please add them again.. please add class 11 and 12 ( india ) chemistry,
"It's a good app. I love that we can download lessons offline. The layout of everything is very eye pleasing, IMO. The videos are easy to follow, too.",
Greatest app ever made on the face of the earth. Sal is a life saver. i have been learning everything in math that i never learned before and thanks to him i am studying for my math exam in college. he just makes everything so simple to comprehend. i recomend this learning platform to anyone who's willing to get better at math and other stuff. its like i've got a teacher in my laptop. Thanks again.,
"This is the best, free and extraordinary place to learn in this planet. It's better than learning in college. Thanks to the organization for helping us learn more than our teachers could provide. It's the only app that I can recommend. Much thanks. I love Khan Academy and I will always",
"The Khan academy is awesome, I love all the free education they provide, but this app is trash. It does not keep track of what videos yo ui have completed like the website does, so if you are working your way through a section, the res no way to know where you left off.",
The app is the best for anyone ready to learn.,
I love it. Just one request. Please add an option for changing video quality. Videos start to stream automatically on HD. I am a student and can't afford unlimited bandwidth and streaming HD lessons drains the limited internet fast. Please consider this. I guess it will help a lot of people like me.,
"Whether you are a student or not, Kahn Academy is so useful! Kahn Academy helped me get through a year of general chemistry, algebra, trig, and calculus, all for free! Not only can you get great instruction, you can practice to mastery! Thank you Sal, and everyone else that makes Khan Academy possible!",
I was having trouble with maths as the way my teacher thought it in my school wasn't able to stick in my head and the teacher would over complicate equations and when someone didn't understand it fully they wouldn't wait because we had a certain time to complete certain chapters in the book it was rushed and hard to follow. But THIS IS A BLESSING I LEARNED SO MUCH ALGEBRA IN FEW MINUTES JUST FROM THIS . THIS IS GOD SENT I SWEAR YOU CAN SPEND HOURS DOING MATHS ON THIS APP IT GOES SO FAST.....,
I'll be honest.. I'm not the greatest at math especially when I didn't pay luch attention in school growing up( which I regret) but this app is so informative and easy to use and understand I'm learning so much and having fun while using it especially when you nail the tests the satisfaction is amazing. Thank you for this amazing app!!,
"I can't believe this is free. It is very high quality and teaches all sorts of math topics for FREE. This is what education should be; free, universal and accessible. I am aiming to learn all there is about math with this app. Never stop learning. Thank you Khan Academy.",
I've been revising my math however ran into problems with loading exercises up due to the error loading bug that reoccurs every couple of patches. The app is extremely useful however this bug is both annoying and detrimental to people studying math.,
I'll give this app a star for sure. Very easy to use. Amazing and understandable lectures And you can download the courses 🤩🤩. I am using it to brush up my knowledge before going to college and the app just got all I need . To give them a five star is the least i could do 😘,
"Khan Academy makes math and science seem a lot easier to learn. Sal's videos on Khan Academy are colorful, his explanations are very clear and that's what makes me enjoy studying on this app even more. This app deserves more than five stars. I really wish I could say thank you to Sal in person.",
App is just Awesome... The teachers explain everything so nicely and every concept becomes crystal clear... One suggestion I would give- I have sometimes seen different teachers teaching different topics of the same chapter which makes it pretty difficult to understand the concept as the teaching way of different teachers is different... Hence U MUST ENSURE THAT ONLY ONE TEACHER TEACHES A CHAPTER!!!,
"The app itself is great. It has many subjects that go from really early stuff to in depth classes. I only wish language could be set to Dutch, as it is really hard to learn in a other language!",
"This app is nuuuuuumber one. My university life is about to change. My favourite thing about this app is that it free, they dont want you to update to premium member to access some contents. Try it mfethu don't waste your data on Youtube videos that are all over the place. This app deserves 10 golden stars✨.",
"Hey...!! Khan academy, i hope your mission of free education for everyone is going super well, i just have one little complain, i can't watch the next video in the list by just clicking on the link ""next video"" i have to go out of the video and have to click on the next video (can you please fix this), otherwise the application is great...!!!, And thank you to sal khan and all khan academy team which work so hard so we can get top notch quality of education.",
"Please watch this review In one question regarding tangents of polynomials excercise question I need to answer in terms of equation as y= 6x-16 but it is very sad to notice that there is no Y in the keyboard. Please fix the respective keyboard, I am loosing points and wasting my time doing the sum for several times to get the wright result. Thankyou for such a great learning app. I LOVE YOUR DREAM.",
"I love your app! I love Khan Academy buttttt... Your videos can't play on my new phone . Please do something! When I click on it, the phone switches back to the main menu. Help!",
The best app for free education!,
Great App for children and adults.,
White screen whenever I open the app.,
Best app ever the best ever with I have used and I can't tell so much,
Best app so far. luv it. a must have app for students. 🥰,
"Hi KA devs! The KA learning tools are excellent, Im truly thankful for your dedication. But I didnt give 5 stars to the app because I cant log in. I use my account with no problems on my laptop but everytime I try to log in on my tablet it says my password is invalid. It also doesnt let me log in with my email (hotmail) on chrome. Im really sure my password and username are ok. I just want to keep progressing with my courses on the tablet. Im on an updated samsung galaxy tablet, android v. 4.4.2",
This app is the worst it puts equations you would never use in real life,
I don't understand how to join class and what teacher's code are you supposed to write to join class. I don't understand this app at all. Please show me how to operate the app. Pls reply,
All this content for free and no ads? Are you kidding me? These guys explain O Chem better than any of my professors EVER did. I also got an A in Calc 2 because of these guys with going to class less than 50% of the time. (Didn't mesh well with my professor's style). Highly recommend.,
"It is very good. They are teaching free of cost. And their teaching is really good. Concepts can be understood quickly. In total, no regrets from downloading this app.",
Some problems go off the right side of screen. Glitchy and not user friendly. Like PC version better. I'm a special needs student. This app is a paperweight!!,
"Great app for Khan academy, it let's you download the videos for offline use! edit: thank you for your response, I would give you another star if I could <3 right now I realize my review text was harsh, I've put in production Klite and other services, I've looked under the hood and I know it isn't easy to make those features into such small apk. See you soon in those forums, I'm looking forward in contributing with this amazing effort, greetings!",
Really love the app great for practicing for the lsat. The only thing i would like is for articles to not be considered complete( the check mark) until ive finished them. Maybe add a button at the bottom of each article to confirm youve completed it,
"I was surprised how knowledgeable this app was when I saw it for the very first time. I felt dumb for not discovering it earlier. My life would have been much better. Best thing about it is that all the resources are amazing and completely free of cost. I always wanted to study world history as it's one of my hobby. But, my school didn't support that subject. All thanks to this app that now I can read world history and know about it to my heart's content. 100% recommended.",
This app is the most legit platform for free uses and learning and the system is remarkably easy. My uncle is studying for his mcats and he will donate a bunch of money if he passes I kid you not hes a man of his word. I'll do the same. I'm in highschool 10th grade and I'm just trying to have a kickstarter and this app is the most helpful app I've ever had in my life.,
"It's a free college education/tutor. You can get the actual degree later, but the hard part is understanding the material and turning in work on time. Once you master the material here, the degree will just be a formality (and some money) :o)",
"Even though I love this app so much, I would really appreciate it if the courses like SAT, DIGITAL SAT, etc. will be made available in the app. I think that it would be much better than going to the website. Please do consider this :)",
This application is very awesome and useful. The subdivision of topics is so helpful. My school is very competitive and dynamic; for someone as slow paced as me this application is helping me cope better.,
"Seems like they are getting their World History dates for prehistory from a 1980s textbook. They present dates as fact, but they are being challenged by newer findings. There's no reason to assign specific dates to prehistory, they can simply explain the evolution of modern humans and their migrations. Presenting theories as fact retards progress.",
This app helped me in the pendamic so much in maths and i was hopping for science also but some chapters were not loaded in app and after completing 1st term board where i needed the specific lesson most which was not in the app and i lost mine marks in it very badly😭. But now it's my second board and i opened the app and whoa!! The new chapters have come. But they are non of use to me now. But i will suggest my siblings and friend who are yet to give 10th boards to use this app. 😁😁.,
"After the latest app update, I am unable to sign in. I have tried clearing the cache, data and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Still not able to sign in. I use my google account to sign in. Edit - Last checked the issue was still there trying to log in using Google Authentication. What I did was generate a password using the forget password option in settings and now I am using the username and password option to log in to my account.",
"I wish they can make this app part of the curriculum in schools. the explanations are like water, it just sink right in. math has never been this much fun to learn",
"Wow it's incredible app i found. You can study and learn things for free. This is the best app everyone need to have, while school fee and formal education getting so expensive. Try it !!! Good job Dev, hopefully Team could added some like a certification when we finish study just to cheer students as a reward not just energy points. 🙂 IMO",
"I have never seen an app so perfect and also free. I like everything about this app: the easy interface, the brief explanations and the helpful practice tests. I really recommend this app for all.",
I've tried several learning apps. This one is I think the WORLD'S BEST LEARNING APP!!! Download it and try it. You won't regret it. No adds to distract you. No fees to pay. Plenty of optional exercises and many more...,
Something is wrong..... I keep on getting unexpected errors in practice papers and I couldn't even sign up either... I downloaded this app beacuse I found the website excellent..... Please fix it.. I really want to use it but I am not able to.....,
"Amazing amazing just wonderfully amazing!!! If you want to learn even the hardest concepts on the earth, say rocket science, and that too for completely free, within minutes for easy...then Khan academy is like a GOD! You get everything you want. If you think something is hard, well it's not if you have Khan academy with you.. God bwless all those developers and creators and everyone backstage for providing such a huge and free platform!",
"it was previously a great app and I really do love the teaching but the problem is ,it is not running properly in my device.i have tried to reinstall it to fix it,but nothing happens. maybe it's a bug and you need to fix it really soon",
"Awesomeeee!!! I've learnt a lot in just two days! Lots of information! Although, it can be boring at times but it's really great! This is very helpful to those who lack resources and money. All this for free!! Thank you everyone~ I'd love to donate but I'm just a broke kid :((",
Can't describe how awesome this app is. And it's soooo kind of them to keep all the content free. It's veryy useful for people who can't afford to buy subscription packages for studying. And very awesome explanation of each topic.,
I actually loved the app and if you are looking for a free app to study online this is it I mean I the thing that I like most about it is that they don't spam you like vedantu (if you are an Indian you might know) does and concepts are really clear I think there is only one subjects in this app and that's maths but its great and I am I love their teaching methods and wow just wow!!!,
Endless crashes. Fixed for now. Crashes when internet connection is lost even for a fraction of a second. Otherwise great app. Lowering to 4 because the fact that you can't quit out of a quiz is stupid,
"This is a great learning aap ,I liked the quiz which it provide. The questions are very new and enjoyable to solve. The videos are too boring. There can be some interesting videos like other learning saps provide but overall 👍",
"I only hate the fact that the content(images) loading is very slow. If one is revising the concepts, then he/she has to spend a lot of time for loading of the content. Otherwise, it's a good app",
"Excellent app! I would recommend to every possible student! But hear me out, it would be the perfect app if it had dark theme, as it will bad for eyes if we study with a bright screen for long hours :) All the thanks for Sal!",
"After the update app is closing by itself when i try to load home page i.e when home tab at the bottom of the app is selected... Other than this search, bookmark tabs are all working fine... It is a great app kindly resolve the above issue fast.. now i am not able to view the home page to see the contents topic wise.. so iam giving 3 stars once this issue is resolved i will give 5 stars for this app.. very very useful app..",
It's always my favourite❤️ Previously I used to watch videos most of the time directly in YouTube channel. But recently I started using the official app but unfortunately I found that there is no option to change the download location to my External SD Card just like I used to do in YouTube. So it's my humble request to Devs to look in this ASAP and I'm waiting for the next update eagerly. I hope Khan Academy Devs won't disappoint the way they don't disappoint with their contents. 12th/Indian.,
"It was really awesome I tried many apps for studying and to understand but this app really teaches me everything . I love this application, for free they are giving extraordinary things for studying . I suggest you to join this app and get more benifit . once again thank you very much for your wonderful app .no words hatts off every one who works here",
Cant even complete the first test due to a glitch. I have a couple screenshots but what good is that here. I can see the question but nothing else is displayed. Causing your algorithms to make me look dumb. I should be on a High School level math by now not prekindergarten 😂🤔😒.,
"The content is good, but the app has a few issues, like very slow performance specially when opening the app, and the keyboard is a bit buggy.",
"It has been years since I've done anything besides basic math and I needed to take the college placement test, I used this app to study and I passed! I'm so grateful to all the tutors who took their time out to make these easy to understand videos. Thank you so much!",
"Khan Academy is a great app for learners to study. The only problem I'm facing here is that I cannot post my doubts here. Pls add a doubt section where we can post our doubts. The second problem is that pls add some more chapters for each subjects. Otherwise , it's a fantastic app to study.",
This app is incredible! I'm preparing to take the accuplacer test so that I can go back to college and by happenstance I stumbled across this app. I can not say enough good things about the lessons on here. And the best part? It's all free! No ads! Thank you!!,
Great app with much informative videos and notes with suitable examples.The topics are in depth and are easy to understand.Clears nearly every doubt in almost all the topics.The content is excellent. It has easy to understand solutions for many complex topics.One of the best learning apps I've ever used.Great initiative by Mr.Sal Khan and associate teachers.,
I totally recommend this app if you want to learn for FREE. This is the best choice for students who are eager to learn but don't have money to spend on those expensive premium membership and this app has no ads which is great for improving focus.,
"Perfect and easy to understand with specific and to the point contents. Khan academy your the one I wished to be existed, I'm not saying this just because of free offers but mostly due to understandable and fully covred teaching method it has and using very nice and friendly blackboard with excellent explanations of professionals teaching the topics in colored pens. That deserve more than five but as thete is only five to pick I wish you happiness for you by number of stars in the sky.",
"Excellent app, but need technical help and couldn't find where to put it. Also a 1 star will get read, I'll fix it when I can produce mixed fractions. In the mobile app you cannot write mixed fractions correctly and as a result you get failed regardless of the answer. Please address this by adding a space function or a break or something.",
I love that Khan Academy has an app but it is way easier to use online. When I study geometry on it it's harder to be precise on the graphs and you have to be really careful not to click on the wrong cell.,
"pros: 1: you can download bookmarks for whan the internet's down 2: you can easely accses it from your homescreen cons: 1: It took super long to install 2: all it did was took me to KA online (witch doas NOT take up space on your computor) 3 : it was VERY slow conclusion: I do not recomend downloading the app, however I do recomend creating an account online.",
I should have install this app earlier. I love to learn new things about everything. I heard a lot about khan academy but i just thought it would provide paid courses like other apps so didn't installed it ever. Internet is full of fake and mis leading information. Here Khan academy saves you with amazing explanations and awesome video modules. And best part its FREE 😊,
One of the best apps I have ever seen.. I always start my physics chapters from watching khan academy. There is just another feeling with having a screen like a black board and getting taught by a teacher..,
Khan Academy is such a wonderful learning tool. I started off using it homeschooling my kids and now I assign lessons to my husband and I. I find just as much utulity in the app as I do the website. My only issue on the app is navigating between learner and teacher dashboard because I cannot display both. I recommend Khan to all families and those looking to learn something fresh in the 21st century such as computer programming and robotics. I also suggest donating monthly/annually.,
There is a big issue of auto rotate and video player is not in full screen mode because after entering full screen mode still status bar and navigation bars are visible.,
So far it's works really well and the videos and lessons that are available are also really good and it is easy to use not too complicated also so yeah I guess it's a overall good app and a good place to learn .,
"Thank you so much for providing us the free and great course. It makes me cry when I saw all the courses are free. However, the auto rotation is too sensitive But overall is very good",
Very useful app... its completely free.. I recommend it download for everyone .. doesn't matter if your child is on 1st grade or if anyone is a college going buddy .. it still can be helpful for everyone..,
"This app is soo good that i wanted to take time and write the reviws for this app. I'll tell you the reason you ""must"" use this app •The teaching is just awesome. •Unlimited quizzes to revise the topic •Study materials •Board exam preparations And finally it is FREE!! They have done a very good job in providing free education. For me its a thumbs up.",
"I found this really helpful in learning math, including statistics. But why can't I sometimes see statistics and AP statistics on mobile version of Khan academy? It occurs even after I updated it. I'd be grateful if this is fixed. Forgive my broken English!",
"For ya'll English speaking population, this is the best app for learning and being productive. Pls do download and learn, it's awesome. Also donate too, these coaches/professors are doing a whole lot of hardwork, teachin' us. Thank u, Khan Academy.",
I can only speak for the math courses but this is the best educational platform ever. Challenging quizzes and interactive lessons and practice are what make this so good.,
"App nonfunctional on current phone. Sometimes the bottom nav tabs display, more often than not I am left with a completely white screen. Rereview will happen with new phone.",
"I must be honest and I am not exaggerating things, but this app is the top N°1 when it comes to teaching, especially maths. I loved it since the first time I downloaded it and I regret not finding about such a perfect app before. Their lessons are the clearest, you can't be still confused after watching their videos. They teach even better than teachers themselves and it costs you nothing, not even a penny I guess even teachers would use it to teach themselves Thank you developers, we love you🥰",
This really God it provides so many things without any cost better than other paid courses as sal khan said don't compare kids on test course but on their mastery it provides so many content,
"This is a merely app, where we can learn lot of things without any money. This app has been incredibled for us.",
"Utube video too small. Also, make black and white low power use options",
"simply the best ever, no words to describe how great it is, thank you Khan Academy",
Im 14 and i really strugle with math and khan helped me with algebra so much. But how do you get too where they teach you about english. Thank you for your time. :>) =<) :() ;[] =-) :)..,
"Awesome app! The KA mission is amazing and making it fit in your pocket made it even better. The app can be difficult to navigate at times but other than that, perfect.",
I really like and appreciate for this app.It have been of great help with it's study features and more 😀☝️👍,
"Dear Khan Academy, I really want to know that how can I find grade-wise science and English just the way you have put math. As I am unable to find English or science for Grade 2, 3. Please help me.",
It's excellent app. We learn all the subjects from basics. Thk u,
"great resources to help me learn math and biology, thank for the teams",
Watching videos doesn't shown in fullscreen mode anymore.,
No urdu language..also it needs pakistani textbook Course. I.e Kp textbook board books so also pakistani students can learn.,
First of all..i am so glad to know that founder have this type of kind thinking and also want to appreciate the team. I Learned too much by this app...when i was concerned about my knowledge i found this app suggestion through chatgpt. Thank you very much to Founder and team for this kind work .,
"This is an amazing app. There are no free trials and payments and you learn at your own pace. They have nice videos, closed captions on the videos, and even text to read if learning by videos is not your thing.",
It has really helped me in understanding concepts which I didn't understood properly in the class or any topic which I missed and didn't get a chance to catch up again. Being a student this app is really helpful for me.,
"this app is very useful, but one problem I had, was that it simply wouldn't show half the question. Like, they're asking me to simplify this number, but they're not telling me the actual number! So besides for that it's an excellent app.",
I found this app really useful I was learning well but what I found really annoying is that the app kept freezing up even when you try and do unit tests. It really disheartening for me as a learner. Please fix this problem.,
"Possibly the best learning app I've ever seen, if it ain't no.1 it's at least top 5",
"Wow, this app is brilliant! It's really helpful to my self-study. Amazing thing is that all the lessons are freely provided, i didn't have to pay for them. For the founders of Khan, thank you so much. Really, really good to have this app in my Education. If i have a lot of money, i will fund you guys' institution. Really thank to you guys🎉",
"It's a wonderful platform provided to learn. But when it comes to download the bookmarks content it sucks even after consuming lot of internet data , still unable to download displays dismiss or retry . It's irritating",
I like the app until i come in to the sinusoidal functions phase shift quiz... This is the only quiz i become frustated too much jargon and cant explain clearly like where this number come from?? Im giving up in the sinusoidal function its broken.. The x value is number and the given is radians? That leads me frustated.. I think you have to update the explanation of your quiz into clear and very neat way.. But your app is amazing! Thanks to this,
GREAT free app all the education you could want. detailed videos and perfect if you wan tto reviae or learn something new entirely. will get you better grades. only bad is its in Amerocan but doesn't make much difference,
"I absolutely LOVE this app. It lets you watch videos and lets you do practice questions also. But that's my problem. When I try to do the practice problems, it takes forever loading but I am going to see if they are going to actually load.",
It's GREATTT!!!!!!! I really love this! It's wholesome an exquisitive kinda library where you can just avail yourself with any concept your in need of and of course quite easy to use no matter what the condition is!,
"Great app! Though I recommend that there are dark themes added since some students like to study during night (including me), it'd help to protect the eyes from too strong blue light.",
I love this app. I was just re-preparing for my trigonometry test tomorrow and I found this app. It has so many questions that you can solve regarding the specific topic which interests you. This is a really good thing for someone who wants to have a bit more practice with a particular type of the problems and questions. Thank you for that.,
"Really good app. It has been helping me alot with my studies. But there is a text in red saying ""Math Processing Error"" in some of the exercises in the app version . But when I checked in the Web version there is no red text. What should I do?",
"I Wasn't even able to use it. Since I installed the app, I wasn't able to open it even once because it keep crashing. It would even load. I like Khan academy; it's great, but my experience with the app is not good.",
"I love this app and this site. I learned sooooooo much. It's useful. 10/10, will totally use again. Actually, I'm going to download it right now. Edit: the only thing that I might say that's bad is that it's hard going thru the app instead of the website. But that's just me for the most part because I use is on PC more anyway. I can say this, it is user friendly, I'm just not good at using it.",
The app performance feels slow. Whenever you open it again the loading screen doesn't finish and it is not useful anymore unless you delete and install it again or clear data.,
"I'm an adult learner. When I was a kid I wasn't good in math, partly because of the teachers, I didn't realize then how interesting math is. But thanks to this website/app I've learned a lot and I'm very thankful for it. I use it to improve my second language and take math classes at the same time. Best learning app out there!",
"The content is great. It just doesn't go into as much depth as I would like. And there are no practice exercises that I can find. Use your computer instead and go online, that is a much better way to learn from Khan Academy.",
"Great help and content. But there are bugs and it will show a right answer wrong, with the explanation contradicting itself. With a learning 1st and 3rd grader you can see the problem this causes. These need to be addressed.",
Great learning app. Very easy to use. Videos are superb. I love it. The only problem I have is with computer science. They should try adding some important courses,
Unbelievable and incomparable experience with my child and myself (Adult). I am using khan Academy to tutor my child on classroom concepts for middle school. His grades are improving fast. I am taking programming and a few more classes to prepare for a programming cert. Having KA as a resource is far more than I could have imagined. I would like to say thank you all for providing America with a FREE education resource. #TeamworkMakesTheDeamWork #KahnAcademy,
"This app is really great! I use it everyday! But there is one thing you should fix. Like, can you make the drawing feature better, because if make i a mistake in writing something it takes for ever to erase. Thanks alot though! Bye!",
This app was used in my school as holiday homework to do the exercises of the Academy this app is very nice and gives interesting questions that are easy to solve... As well we do the questions as faster all the points are given us... This app is very nice to use... But the name should be (Be Genius) - (The Learning App)..,
"I have seen alot of apps and thus ended up with this one. Trust me, this one is the best as it has no ads plus it's free. Even it wasn't free, i would have surely paid higher bucks on this app as it's worth it! ☺️",
The auto rotate issu is so irritating that I have to uninstall the application.,
"The app is a very good educational tool. It is easy to use and has a variety of topics. Also, videos are understandable to the viewers. Thanks to this app, I've learned lessons I had trouble understanding at school.",
"The website works, but the app connected to it does not. you can't move past the sign in screen even if you have an account. It's endlessly frustrating.",
I really like this app because it helps me whenever I have to study for maths and exams! But one minor problem I have with the app is that I'm not able to draw diagrams over the math figures and my friend has and apple device while I have an android so maybe that's why I'm not able to draw over maths questions so please help!,
"It might just be my issue, but it will not even sign in. Sign in with Google and it loads forever. Try manually and, no matter what, it says invalid password. Great site, but a horrible app. Edit: They did try to help me by sending to their issue site, but nothing helped, sorry.",
"I've just started using the Khan Academy and So Far, So Good. The think I don't like about the application is that it doesn't work offline. That is because we have power cuts in our area and cause of that I do not get to learn and watch Khan Academy. But other than that Khan Academy is my #1 all time favourite learning application 😘",
The app is great but it seems to crash when I open it since I have updated it. Please fix it. I have already uninstall and install it again hoping it would properly function again but none of those methods work.,
"I love Khan Academy. It and its people help everyone who has a will to study but no financial ability pursue their dream with high quality classes. My kids are taking full advantage of many of its programs. Thank you so much. I just wish I could donate more, but I am just doing what I can to help it to continue its great work for students around the world.",
I have been looking for a learning for so long,
This app is very great to use when you need help with subjects that you are not very familiar with. As someone who doesn't really like math this app helped me a lot to learn geometry and pass it. Khan knows everything about everything so he explains everything very thoroughly. Great app to use.,
This is an amazing app. Been using Khan Academy for around 8 or more years now. Lost count. Got the Kids app for my niece as well. I'm hoping more stuff could be added like coding and so on. Thanks for the great service to the public by making your resources free to all.,
"Good app and content, but holy excrement, when in this God's world will Android developers learn to HONOR the overall system font settings?! The fonts are tiny and I can't read anything comfortably! Outside of apps, my fonts look fine. But what good is that ever while developers just ignore it in such a cavalier manner, ESPECIALLY those that involve intensive reading? Many Android apps become useless because of that and this app is one of them.",
"Great app and extremely valuable free resource. Wish there was an easy way to report questions, bugs, or feedback. Dont have a button named 'help and feedback' if you cant give feedback You have an entire page of articles on how to best report a bug and then dont have an option to report a bug.",
"Fantastic application, however, I would like to have a ""Report a problem"" option, because I'm finding issues with some graphics in some math questions, and I can't answer properly when that happens.",
The app is really good but I I have to constantly delete it to use it. Whenever I click anything it doesn't works so I have to delete it and then install it again and this is what happens everytime I try to use this app.,
"God! I literally literally have no words for this application , it's seriously godsent , you can learn everything and anything from this app from calculus to life skills to college life to Quantum mechanics everything is available , exercises , clear explanations , beautiful concepts and ALL FOR FREE! Sal Khan is literally a gem of my era for everyone a Student or even for a human being :) Loads of thanks to you Sal and your team! Keep up the good work!",
"I wish I could browse while still watching the video like on Youtube. Otherwise, Khan academy has been an IMMENSE help on my academic career; when teachers and staff failed me, Khan always worked. Im SO thankful, I need to make a donation soon (but as most students im pretty broke) but everyone at Khan academy DEFINITELY deserves it. So clear. So concise and well organized, their topics follow my curriculum exactly which is a HUGE help, amazing app and company",
"Very, VERY good. Extremely easy to navigate, easy to understand lessons, and good exercises and examples. Would recommend to anyone.",
"I'm an economic student and I'm learning a lot by using this application here, it's really helpful. But it will be good guys if you could introduce some of the course like econometric or mathematical economic. Hope to see some improvement. God to go",
It's good to have an app for android but it's way too far compared to web. It has many bugs which is really annoying for me. Offline experience is also not that good for me.,
"Wow! I just want to say thank you! And very greatful for Khan Academy. I am going back to college after 2 decades to pursue my 2nd career in mechanics, being a bit rusty 😂😂 this program has helped me to learn and understand way way more about math then before. And what was cool...is when I signed in for the first time, Khan Academy asked me a few questions about myself and created a learning path to take based on my experience. I had no idea where to start, and here I am 🤗🤗🤗🤗.",
"SIMPLY IMPRESSIVE! Khan Academy is super awesome, organized, comprehensive, easy to use and understand! And it's absolutely free! Learning across all ages is fun with this App!",
It's such amazing app... It helps me in my class 10 studies and also some other apps... And due to it i have scored top in my school... And now when i'm in 11 I still study from this app.... The great thing about this app is that it is free so that everyone can study... Thank you so much khan academy team for your efforts and hardwork... I really appreciate it... And recommend it...,
"Very great app, helped me get thru pre calculus in less than a week! 10/10 would recommend. Also the videos are very well made with amazing English and good planning and great explanations about the topics/lessons!",
Best app for library collection.. Filled with a lot of videos. Plus they have a very straight and simple way of teaching which directly reaches to students. Love the app. Thanks to their faculties.,
Khan Academy is the best free learning tool that I've been able to find. Education is extremely valuable and important. In this case it's absolutely free and taught by wonderful teachers! I highly suggest utilizing this service if you want to learn and grow. Just go for it! You can be a better more educated you! Knowledge is power!,
The content was good but not good enough. I am from india and I need to prepare for IITJEE entrance exam. The content in it was not sufficient for my preperation. More models and concepts need to be covered. That is why I give 4 stars.,
"Khan academy is a brilliant app can make anyone understand math and physics . I highly recommend this app to anyone who is struggling in math or any other subject such as English , Economics etc I recommend downloading this app and also you DONT NEED TO PAY FOR ANYTHING. KHAN ACADEMY IS THE BEST and I appreciate the entire team for making such a brilliant to help kids understand math and science ❤ 🤍 💙 🧡 🖤 ♥️ ❤ 🤍",
"Problems setting up, problems with child doing problems as directed and then not being allowed to answer question as screen is still grayed out. Not a novice with computers nor using apps. Website as well as app are difficult to use. Uninstalling app",
One of the best to provide education to all for FREE...!! Edit 1: This works amazing... And ensure that you select your appropriate region in the settings. Nice videos....Thank you so much...!!!,
"The best app ever to learn maths because they teach in a way that no one can't understand(unless they are from space or doesn't know English properly).And especially there is no need to purchase anything, everything is completely free and with no add.",
"Love it! Please add technical courses if possible like different kinds of softwares and some of them are C, C++, CAD etc.. The way your videos teach is very nice so, it would be a pleasure learning various stuff from you guys. Thanks.",
The best teaching app but teaching code must be tried to be made available such that child's doubt could be cleared in a better manner. But in overall all videos you have all are enough for concept perfection.,
"I give it a three because it's free and that's really cool to offer information to people for free. However, if you want to take studying these topics seriously, there's not much here. You can get through a whole course in a couple days if you enjoy reading. YouTube has free Yale and Harvard (yes, the ivy leagues) courses on a wider range of topics, infinitely more in depth, and also free, so this app isn't offering anything revolutionary.",
You are amazing a life saver. You change lives to help people who has dreams to become successful. I am not even done high school yet but I am from a young age want to practice for the lsat test to becoming a lawyer and all those classes are 2000$ or more but You guys FREE! Keep up the great work I recommend this to everyone regardless of age. If you have children I recommend the children version but this is spectacular!,
This app is so great. It helped my kids so much. Though if there was a way of avoiding users from skipping the lessons to the exercises. Like maybe locking the exercises u unlock them by taking the lessons,
"Incredible app , anyone can learn or understand anything for free . Looks like SALMAN KHAN , it's creator , didn't had a money minded approach while developing this app . It has a great approach focusing on making things understand to others rather that mugging up . It helped me a lot to improve my performance in my weak areas and get better score in my examinations .",
"This application by Khan Academy is great. You get all you need in the phone. And the content, as usual, is superb. Caveat : You will have to download some videos if you want them offline.",
Would really like to give it more stars. But the the app just crashes even before getting started. I've installed the latest version of the app but it still crashes. Please do look forward to this problem. Thank you,
"I really do recommend this. It has great lessons for all ages, great teachers with good voices. They have no ads what so ever and if I had moeny I would donate to them... Sadly I dont. So I'm paying them in a review. This is really good rhough, no joke.",
"Decent Application, And the videos are short but full of concepts. Very very good !! And it's 100% free. My suggestion would be give a try. Regards.",
"Decent app, but it contains much info that I disagree with. They even try to suggest that the French Revolution might have been a good thing!",
The idea is sound and certainly fills a need in our society. The execution is good as well. I only gave it 4 stars because I believe that more videos with more complex examples are needed for the math.,
"It's really helpful. I need step by step slow instructions and practice questions. My teacher is too fast, she rushes through in c lm ass because she get it, we don't. I just want to pass this math so I can get my GED and get a permanent job.",
I faced glitches a lot.... After completing the course challenge loading does not happen..... 😭 While taking any course challenge we get back if we touched the back button once unknowingly... My suggestion is that change it to twice to go back...,
"Very good app...helps to clear concepts very quickly and easily. Best for board exams.....also,things are made to understand in a simple manner with diagrams...basically in science...",
The courses are really great I loved it but it would be better if mastery would be available for more units of science and it takes a long time for contents to load so I feel it would be better if it loads faster . Thank you.,
"this would be a 5 star except you can't mute the sounds and this is a huge problem when people need a ""mobile"" app to study on the go and don't want loud sounds going off in public. this is a basic feature on almost every app please change.",
This is great. I really needed this. It's just disappointing how I can't access the courses that have history in them. It says that the connection is bad or something but my internet is working just fine.,
"This is a wonderful app and it helped me a lot and the explanation is also excellent ☺️👍. But I request you to add videos of students of 6,7,8,9.... std on Science and english grammar as it is not having it . Otherwise loved this app 🤩.Thank u so much Khan Academy .😃",
This app is amazing. I uses it to finish all of grade 8 math before i go to grade 8. The videos are very descrptive and explain everything. I suggest this app for anyone who wants to do better in school.,
"The lessons/videos are short, simple and practical. There's no unnecessary details like the ones they do in school that end up lasting the entire period.",
"3/5 for effort and content. Delivery on the app can be very glitchy. No where near the same as the desktop experience. That being said, no other program or website comes close to offering near what you will find on Khan.",
I needed a math tutor and didn't have the extra cash to pay for one. I tried Khan Aademy and it was like having my own personal teacher. The equations are demonstrated step by step and if you don't get it the first time you can always go back and have it explained as many times you need it to be.,
"I cannot stop myself from giving 5 stars, this app is the best platform in the world providing ""WORLDCLASS EDUCATION"" literally for free of cost and their are no silly adds in this app, even their no single add in this app. The video lectures of chemistry and biology I personally think are very very good and the teachers are teaching with very unique and fabulous way of teaching.I really want to thanks Salman Khan sir for providing this level of education to us.",
"Don't even bother with the math courses. All throughout the whole app, if you mess up once, they deduct score. Score, to me, displays how well you do. If I am expected to be a perfect math wizard or I'm worthless, then why should I bother? Actual people teach differently, not punish them for every failure. Oh, and if you are even slightly dyslexic? Good luck going through this archaic mess! If you have a perfectionist means of mindset? Here's the bully ready to question your worth in life!",
The videos and the explanations are just wonderful. Many of my concepts have been solved and I am able to learn and know about many topics which were unintuitive to me initially.,
This is an amazing resource. Things are explained so clearly and concisely. What takes my teachers and hour with pages of notes to explain is described effectively in only a few minutes.,
Excellent app. My only suggestions would be to implement a dark mode as well as a streamlined linear way to progress through courses previously completed.,
This is an excellent app to study and learn. I learnt applications and uses of semiconductors from this app which is very great. I really want to appreciate the physics lecturer which explained this topic in an easy way. I really fell in love with this app. Now I feel to learn more and more from this application . Thank you khan academy,
"Can we get around of applause for the best learning app? I mean seriously Khan Academy has helped me go through school. Especially Math. There is so much you can learn and suitable for every grade. We gotta be honest yall, Khan Academy has helped us through some discussion we don't fully understand. Amazing keep up the good work👍👍",
"I was really looking forward to trying this app. But, none of the practices or quizzes load. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but there was no difference. If anything, the app crashed more. 1) My name is not David. 2) I installed the current version 5.2.3 available for download.",
Desktop site is much better than the app. App needs a lot of improvements. Like In sat section there are only 2 videos for each section and there are no ways to practice a specific topic. So i would recommend desktop site rather than app.,
The best of the best. I mean like literally during this pandemic and stuff its really useful. Im a student and I am preparing for my SATs and thisis like my full preparation. Everything taught from the basics and Sal's my favourite as he goes through all the subjects.,
"This is the best. I love Khan Academy. This is free for all over the world. This is also help me to learn, understand, imagenation of problem, etc. I can't explain from my view. But at the end, Thank you , For all members, love you , god bless you",
"IT IS THE BEST LEARNING APP!!! but please, consider: 1. Feature to download videos without bookmarking it and the tests 2. Add more languages. I need Indonesian. Or atau least add more languages subtitle in the videos. 3. Add daily tasks and rewards 4. I hope we can compete with other users",
"🩵🤍🖤 amazing app, I'm just underestimating myself, gotta keep believing in yourself",
THE BEST EDUCATIONAL APP EVER!!! I'm currently studying in foundation and it helps me a lot. Not to mention all the courses are free and it basically have all topics covered. 100% reccomend!!!,
Khan academy is a must have supplement for the busy student. The app makes it easy to view the content on a mobile device. Especially valuable is the ability to download videos for offline use. Love it!,
I would give this app 5 stars because honestly it really deserve it with all this effort and hard work they made but unfortunately there is a huge problem which made me change my opinion about the app when I knew it. The app provides many and different Languages then why not tge Arabic language????? Arabic is my native language and I can't even use the app if it is not available. 2 stars without any doubt,
A very good initiative towards competitive learning. Personally I am so much satisfied with this app as it deals with almost every subject at secondary level with to the point videos helping a lot.. Hats off to Khan Academy 😍😍,
"At first, I tried use the website: wouldn't load anything. Then i installed this app in hopes to get my Calculus done, but this won't load either. It says that I need to check my connection and try again. I have internet access and it still won't let me. I even tried uninstalling the app and restarting my router, but nothing will works. Please fix!",
"This app is very useful and I thanks .I think no of questions should be increas for practice and make sure to confidence each and every topic.And one more important thing i got a problem in algebra because there was no more options to type like the tying box having ""a""option but to type""b"" there was no option for that .I hope you will solve this problem.",
"I honestly don't use this app very much, but I did download the app to gain more knowledge in my learning capabilities. I'm wondering if you guys, the app developers, would be able to allow multiple accounts for this app. I have 2 accounts, one that my Trigonometry teacher gave me, but i can't add my other College Algebra teacher's class to that account. Then, I'm logged on Khan Academy with my Gmail acc for my College Algebra teacher's class. I wish I could check both without logging out.",
"AMAZING!!! It helps alot on homework and tests! Math and more, also it allows you to choose your grade for specific lessons and difficulty. love the app so much also I'm not a bot I can prove it lol",
"I read in India class 11 and you might know about the situation in Indian low budget private and good goverment schools. Education is not delivered properly but now goverment have thought to improve it like other countries, but right now it's not and I am not able to get any extra tution classes So I used this application and youtube for my JEE preparation. I am in class 11 and today I scored 2nd in my class by just reading in Khan Academy. So I thank a lot to the teachers and developers. THANKS",
"The amount of knowledge and the quality of that knowledge is just mind blowing. And the mind blowing just reached peak value when you see that all of it is FREE, NOT EVEN A SINGLE AD. I mean, the amount of change these guys have brought to a sector that mostly focuses on money rather than content makes the founders of these apps, the volunteers and anyone associated with the app which is a nonprofit almost godlike. I give the highest salute and the deepest respects possible to this app.",
Been using it for years. 2014-2015 was a hard year. Nursing degree studies were brutal and understanding everything was rough sometimes. Khan Academy was the truth! The videos provided were so informative and easy to understand. Beyond love this company and the guy who runs it.,
"Excellent app for learning anything, that too for free. Nice work by the team of Khan Academy. App runs smooth and UI is so simple without any complexity. Wish it had the Dark mode.",
Fabulous app ever.... It provide us knowledge for free... I used it to complete my basics of class 11th and I use it continuosly.... Because there many other courses like life skills... And computer programming... In which am interested a lot.. I use it gain more and more knowledge... And a big thank to everyone one of you.... To make this app.. and provide a miracle to us... Thanks a lot again...,
I don't know what I would do without this app. I failed all my math classes throughout school and now I'm adult that is attempting to go back to college and I really need help. So I'm starting from the literal bottom and khan academy is so helpful!! Thank you for letting.e learn for free!!!,
"This app worth 5 stars if the laggy and delaying issues are fixed. I stayed at bookmarks tapping the download button about 10000 times in 10 minutes for nothing (edit: after the update the app although has little bit laggy but is much more better than last, im loving this app <3)",
This app is literally the BEST ever. It deserves a 5 star rating. I really recommend this app because it's really helpful and has videos and exercises. And the best I like about it is that its absolutely FREE!!! And it has no ads. It's optimized for all devices and thank you khan academy!!!,
"It's worse! I can't see the given assignments of my teacher in this app. I almost failed because there is no assignments that i can see, i kept on refreshing the app but nothing happens :( its only good at the computer but not on an android phone really sucks :)",
Amazing app I just wish that it was an offline app where you didn't have to connect to internet or anything I just really would appreciate if you fixed to that and I just think it's an amazing game I haven't learned that much because well I am kind of at the top of my class and also it's summer break LOL but it's an amazing app for learning I really love this app best part I'm in third grade but I need to practice on 4th grade lol,
App doesn't open after installation.,
"🥺 so kind of developers to provide such a great platform (world class education, guidance and a lot more beyond the scope of this review.) for everyone without charging a penny. Hat's off ❤️. Lot's of love. I wish I were too able to contribute in the great cause.",
It is a very good app if you like virtual learning and David is very funny like try to make a joke out of every thing and I love when online learning are done with fun and laughter because it kinda creates a very good environment to study I was having lot's of problem in force and laws of motion but now that chapter is like completely fit inside my brain. Thanks to Khan Academy and there wonderful faculty,
"Learned a lot from this, but is it possible for the videos to have a more percise written counterpart? With each consept or topic can be linked to a specific point of the videos in case the written text is not that much understood. I believe that would be more efficient for me.",
I'm Lipika and I enjoy learning with Khan Academy because it not only makes us understand concepts but also makes it get glued to our brains ..Thank you Sal and team for making this such a wonderful and awesome platform for learning that too for a good social cause..I wish all the best to you and your team.. Love you Khan Academy#learing wid fun!!!,
This is the best app for students for preparing who have hard time making concenteration . For me i can sit and study for 30 min even . but its lectures are usually 10 min. Then 1 more 10 min. Then some questions through which i will understand better . Its just best app . But i think it needs tougher questions .,
"I am very very Happy to use this app.This is app is th best.The videos, the tests, mastery points create the best learning experience. Very easy to use, with no ads shown inside the app.I will use thsi everyday.I will definitely donate Thousands to Khan Academy when I become big and start earning.This app is for students from all the countries. It has the same syllabus.I can't even think another ed-tech app like this, byjus and others will lose to Khan academy. They are expensive, this is Cheap",
"I highly appreciate the Khan Academy team for their unique and interactive way of teaching, and keeping this app completely free without any commercial promotions as seen in the others. Again Thank-you Team Khanacademy for taking such a nice and humane step.",
"I want to find the Russian. My friend speaks Russian and wants to learn. I love this app, highly recommend. Kahn Academy responded and they are adding more languages. When Henrew is added I woupd like to be hired as a translator and an editor. I love this app, Im using it to prepare for medschool.",
"Not nearly as good as the online website. It doesn't save your progress, whatsoever. Not to mention the random crashes I've experienced. Please fix this app",
"All the lessons are good, but my problem is that after a long time i opened the app then i was signed out. That same day we had an internet problem, so when the internet came back, i lost all my progress 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. That is why I gave 3 stars, the lessons are really good for learning, but due to this problem, you lost 2 stars. Please help me get my progress back 😔😔😔🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽",
"For most my life I feared/disliked doing math. One day I got sick of being bad at math, not understanding it, feeling anxious when I do it. By learning math in my free time with khan academy, I have learned I was wrong about my math abilities. I am not ""bad"" at math, I have just never been taught in a way that I could wrap my head around it. Taught in a way that made me fear failure. Khan academy doesn't just teach you math, it teaches you how to love and respect math.",
"It works for me and i like how the tutor gave me several ways to approach the problem given. Its also accessible to everyone in my house, and its free. I'm very grateful to you developer because i can get smarter even if i don't have the money to go to tutoring and such. So thank you very much",
"Iv had a ""learning disability"" since childhood, living past high school was a miracle to say the least. You tend to get the idea in your head that you should just take the easy route because you'v been declared broken by your teachers. I always knew I was diffrent and could do quite literally anything that intrested me but never truly utilized it. 10 years later and a pendemic Iv taught my self to write code and now aiming for a degree in computer science. I Better learn algebra finaly lol",
"Simple interface, clean design, possibility to save lectures on the device and study offline, no ads, videos load quickly with my potato internet, good audio quality - this is a nice app, i like it.",
"I love this app. Really beautiful. I wish you can add something to it. Nowadays there is a great concern and a crisis of climate change, and I think everyone, mostly students, should be taught about it, how it is eating up our planet, and how everyone, as an individual, can give their contribution to have a better and beautiful earth 🌍.",
best app for clearing and understanding concepts. it will be better if you add more practice and problem solving in it .also the biology part has no information or explanation on animal classification which is an important concept,
This is hands down the best educational app. It has literally changed my life and it is because of this app that i have actually started learning things that I only used to dream about and that too for free... Thank you very much for this. I would also recommend the desktop version of this. It is worth experiencing.,
I love this app it's marvellous. its contents are fantastic and easy to understand and consumes less data. moreover it's free of cost. it has made my study very easy.,
it is a very good app it contains almost all the courses of all the countries also contains international level teaching by various examples and also get your concepts clear I would like to say that this app is the best app for learning ever in the sphere,
Great app but I'd love an option to read lessons rather than watch a video. I don't mean captions rather a text book format; if this option exists I definitely haven't found it.,
For an educational tool the point award system is flawed and doesn't make mathematical sense. Get all of the question right get 80 point miss one get 50 never able to get 100 and missing 1 out of 8 isn't 50 if the possible is only 80 it's 70 if it's 100 (seems that isn't technically even possible) then missing 1 question would be 88.5 points. None of this makes any sense.,
"This application is wonderful... and I really mean it man... It provides us with tremendous amount of knowledge and world class education. I mean that if one goes through it's video lectures attentively, then he/she will be surely doing great in their fields... Also it's teachers are really nice and adorable... One must use it man.... Lit🔥",
"The fact that there is a free app for studying litterly any subject during quarantine is amazing! I'm getting so much help with homework, Idk if the creators will see this but if they do ty so much for your hard work and an amazing app!💖",
"I really like this app. Because it has helped me familiarize myself with many specialized terms written in English, which is not my native language. And more than that, the lessons are organized very clearly and the teachers are very easy to understand.",
"Khan Academy has really helped me throughout my education. They have all subjects, that you may need help or tutoring in. They also have videos as well that demonstrate the lessons taught. ... It is very easy to learn these lessons.",
"My experience was fine until I encountered mistakes in answers in rhe topic ""Modelling eith sinusoidal functions:phase shift"". Please verify. I could've posted a screenshot, but there's no option here.",
"I'm really greatful for your free quality service it enable me to be more confident in my learning. I thank all the people behind this wonderfull app. I believe in your vision and I agree on mastery based learning. I've never been so positive on my future before bcs I was not good at my education but now you helped me changed my perception of my limitations. I am more positive in my potential now. Thank you a LOT, really. I'm inspired to do things that has impact on other people's lives too.",
"This app is the ultimate studying app there is . I hav been using it since 8th grade and now I'm in 11th ( I study in CBSE syllabus). I used to find math very hard in 9th and 10th , however using khan academy I have improved a lot . It is easy to understand and provides in-depth studying on the concept ( compared to CBSE texts) P.S. I recommend all CBSE students to use this app",
"Amazing app, can help you review all the concepts learned previously if you've forgotten or learn new things. If you put some dedication you can probably skip school learning.",
"Upon my word, it would be much better if the subjects (especially HISTORY) would be more adjustable to study for the people of the other regions of the world..",
Their sis such a good learning app you should really really get this it's amazing it ... It even has vids if you don't understand . It's meant for college or any other grade . And it has way more subjects you can learn from !!! ( Btw this is a review by a 9 year old if 5hat even matters),
"""Error making task progress."" Everytime I click on practice it spins for awhile and then gives me this error. I love the website so much!! I wish the app worked.",
"Really the best app I ever encountered, I truly thank you all. But, I have a problem regarding the Indian chemistry course in hindi which I am desperately waiting for. I need help in the subject which could be best given by you all.So, please add the course of chemistry in Hindi.",
"This is a good app for students and teachers for explore the contents, teaching approaches and practice series, These contents are present in Kannada language in website but couldn't find it in this app. Please update and upload the contents in Kannada language also. Thank you....",
"Overall a very good initiative to help students in their studies in a pure free way, but you should add Hindi videos too, to make it more helpful for students of different board.",
"This is a brilliant app with tons of knowledge stored on it, however I cannot seem to log in, add bookmarks or do any excersices. For that reason I am only giving it 3 stars, please fix the bugs for android versions 4",
"Yep, thanks sal for providing such free and very good education of international standard. Your ambition really meets my desire . I get perfect learning platform. Other coaching institutes or schools in India takes huge fees and gives what , a well trained student . Actually education system of India can give out only well trained person such a bogus system is this? You and your effort is sure to make me a well educated person. I don't want to learn for marks( i.e not become well trained )",
"Highly recommend this app for kids. Specially now that children are asked to stay at home during this crisis. They will learn a lot with it. My kids and I love this app, be on a mobile or laptop. Kudos to the team of Khan Academy. Great app.",
"I can't explain how good this app is. It literally has what you should learn in school, but free, well organized and you can access it anytime. Yes, it does have some bugs (I've encountered one so far) but the value of this app is incredible. I can't believe this is real. Thank you so much guys for helping me with school! Yes, I've only used it for one day but it's just incredible. I'm from Romania btw. Is there anything like this out there? I don't think so",
Khan Academy is a fantastic place to learn just about anything. My one gripe is that the videos they reccomend don't always aid you in the specific problem you're working on. Maybe they could add more to cover more than one topic on the problem.,
It is very good learning app which is help me during the hard day. One can easily understand and clear their doubt. I just request to add more questions related to Olympiad and other competative exams.,
"In short:Great app. Very usefull, maybe the style isn't for everyone, but I like it very much, definitely recommend at least giving a try-to see if it fits you.",
"I'm an user of Khan Academy and I feel it is the best educator app. Just I want to give one suggestion is that please start to give courses of science for class 8, 7, 6...1. There's no other reason I gave you four stars. Continue to provide high quality education. Thank you.",
it is the best app for learning. You can find all sort of subjects in just one place with best visual quality and excellent learning techniques.,
"The experience is pretty poor, I try to access a page and the app just crashes entirely. When it doesn't crash, the app just freezes and I have to restart :/",
"...(Sighs) Sal and the Khan Academy team, all I want to say is thank you. This app helped me in so many ways; Grammer, Arithmetic, Biology etc. What makes this platform even more sweet is that its free...forever, and I thank you for that.👏",
"I just can't tell, what the apps seems to me, I have got addicted to the way of teaching in the app, learn through videos, and the explainer explains things in such a way that no question and doubts are left but in an extremely unlikely case you may get one or two.",
"Honestly, life saver. I loved the interactive learning it provides. Been using this for 5 months and my understanding of topics is much better than before.",
"Great app for easily learning but there's a bug, after completing an exercise the ""done"" button is not working, im tapping on it but nothing is happening so please fix it soon.",
"I love this way of schooling! I have never understood science, but with Khan Academy, I finally get it and retain the information! there are a few things I don't like, like the lack of middle school sciences, but other than that, it's great",
I request the Khan academy team to bring the chapters of class 9 10 11 and 12 so that I can learn everything. Please being physics chemistry and biology of every class. It's a little request from me to Khan academy. Please bring the subjects in Indian region also.Rather than that everything including the teaching is very nice which is unforgettable. That's why in Google it is the world's number one learning for students.🤗🤗🙂🙂☺️😊,
"Would be great except there's no recourse if you have problems. Nobody to talk to. I lost progress in an account and started another. Now I can't get into the second and when I did it was briefly and appeared to have lost progress again, then was unable to enter the account after that without any reason. I was using this to home school my daughter. Two grades are gone. I tried logging in from my phone and a laptop, Didn't work. Also did send a request for help and did not hear back. Please help",
this aap makes my understanding capability better. their hindi language for standard 10th in physics is good.it make us understand easily. language is very simple.but i want that their should be the hindi language for all the subjects of class 10th like chemistry and some other.but i faces one problem that in the video sometimes sound is not clearing the words. i hope this problem is to be fixed in the next update.,
It's amazing but I am worried about TCAP this app may not be helpful for student please reply to me Khan Academy. You guys have very boring videos that don't help. This app doesn't help with me a fourth grader with TCAP so help me please. I mean it. Reply please Khan Academy. Y all stupid please help me pass TCAP. Please have more fun videos. Also you have a app that is not for free. Can you please explain that. Thank you. By the I a fourth grader thinks you stink.,
"As a student and a teacher, I find this site very useful and helpful in every subject. Between the videos for visuals and practices, I don't feel there is anything better.",
I love using this for school. Ive learned so much in such little time and its so easy to learn. If you're a slow learner you arent rushed and if youre a fast learner you aren't held back! Love it and will use it frequently!,
"I can tell that this app was made by people from top colleges like MIT because it makes me want to kill myself. The UI is atrocious, and there is no way to delete progress so if you mess up or mis-click (often because of UI) then you are stuck with that mistake and it constantly nags and mocks you about it.",
"Please fix the bug. I tap to any quiz, it won't work. The screen stays white. So I updated the app, but it still won't work. Then I reinstalled it and now I can't even sign in to my account.",
"It is an good app. I really love it but I will be glad that if you will provide science and other subject courses till grade 8th and for Indians ncert based chapters, topics and questions. I really hope if you will look into this matter. Anyways good for preparing school exams.",
I hope next update will featuring the dark mode,
"False advertising. Says you can learn EVERYTHING. That's not even a little bit close to true. They only offer basic highschool classes. Which is great for highschool students. But its certainly not ""EVERYTHING"" as khan academy advertises. Deleting this app.",
"It's a very nice app especially for people like me who don't like long,boring lectures but like to get to the point. It enhances your way of studying. I definitely recommend it to everyone 👍",
marathi language is not in the language list,
"Want to learn math? Use this. (Now has many other subjects, too.) Start where you want, jump forward, back. Replay as often as you need. Don't just learn, understand.",
"This app is great for reviewing maths until you try any quizzes involving the evaluation of exponents, it doesn't allow you to answer as there is no option to type anything that remotely resembles a multiplication symbol (x, *, • are all not options.) This wouldn't be so irritating if it weren't for the fact that I got the app solely because the website has the same problem, and the support team seems to not read feedback reports from users as I have received no response back.",
"Well its such a good app. Its a good platform to learn anything. But since last update , after watching 2-3 videos app automatically closes. I reinstalled it then also it reamains the same. Can You Fix This or tell me the reason why its happening? :)",
"I really love this app, all the lessons i get to learn on it. But thr thing is,its just too slow, i mean since i downloaded the app,ive been able to download just one lesson video,and its really annoying. Id really appreciate if that can be worked on.",
"The app is awesome. full of wisdom but there are just videos, I wish there was also an option to read or watch videos . It would have been the best ever... I hope anyone works on it !!!!!",
"I rate this 1000/10. It's the best. It literally has every topic of subjects, so you don't have to go asking Google questions anymore. I recommend this to y'all high school students during this lockdown period. It's like having online classes but even better.",
"Very useful resource. It has helped bring back to memory, subjects that I learnt during my secondary school years which I had forgotten. It is truly a life saver.",
"Have been a part it Khan academy for 6 years and the improvements made to the app and the academy itself is incredibly. Especially now since Covid-19 has been affecting learning for many children and adults, i would without a single doubt recommend this app for all of them.",
"Khan Academy has given the best experience when I was in 10th but for 11th students Khan Academy has only Maths and Physics and also I wanted some basic idea of every chapter in Maths through videos which was not provided. I am facing some bugs in the biology library, when I scroll up to the last in in biology library my screen freezes.",
"This has been the best Apps I ever used to study. It has many subjects to choose from, and it teaches you in a way that you won't have problems understanding. And the best part? It's Free! Like , can you get something like this anywhere? Thanks Mr Khan!",
"I am a 54 year old with a B.S. degree and an online Ph.Dwho heard about Kahn academy on the news when it first began and again through our school when my daughter began SAT prep. I'm taking the grammer course myself both to improve my copywriting for my website and because I *love* learning new things! It just makes me happy, and so dors Kahn academy. it has useful, applicable and is, above all, engaging and entertaining. Special cudos to David and Paige for doing that with English grammar!",
It's laggy i think it's the app or idk can you fix it.. Thanks,
It's a great app where I find everything what I need and best thing about this application is that there are no ads between the lectures and the content they make are pretty innovatively executed.,
"Best👏learning👏app👏ever It teaches you step by step and it has videos to explain. If you are struggling with something, then this app will help a lot. It's all free these days all people care about is money, but Khan academy is free!!! Props to the Person/People who made it. THIS APP WON'T LET YOU DOWN.",
A new perspective of teaching. This new method of teaching will help students get better grades at school but more importantly it will enable them easily apply this knowledge in real life scenario. Mr khan focusses on enabling students to really understand the concepts.,
"Very good initative and content is awesome and clear to understand..........Cool feature is that it is free and a non-profit education app....... I am a student of 10th class now, that's why I can't make any donation........ Sal hats off to you and to your team..... I am very much impressed to see a Website even get its app....... You guys deserve a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(5 star) rating......",
"I rarely do this...writing a review, but I ought to say that this app helps a lot especially when you want to gain more knowledge about things. The videos are good, this app doesn't require payment for its videos, and the videos make it look almost too easy.",
"Incredible place for learning, no shady subscriptions or annoying ads. High quality content, clear explanations. If you wanna learn maths from the ground up like me, this is 100% it.",
"The Best. Go without doubt for maths. Compared to online educational companies in India like vedantu, byju's, Unacdaemy ect. Thease companies take thousands of money from parents promising child's marks, but after paying even God will not able to find them. Total scam! But this app is the best because of user friendly UI, no ads which is the most noticeable, moreover completely free material and tests. You can learn any subject from basics. Thank you khan Academy Team.",
This app and Khan Acadamy has completely changed my life. I can get a complete understanding of a subject. I also don't have to spend 1000 dollars redoing a class when I can take the class for free before I start the class! Did I memtion free?,
God bless the developers who created this app because this app helps a lot of people to learn new things for free,
"Used this program on computer before and assuming it what fine, never accessed it after initial trial, decided to get app. When testing simplifying square roots I can't type exponents or other algebraic symbols to the answer the questions. It shows me what the answer should be when clicking on icon, but no way for me to type it. Example √75= ... No option to type 5^2√3. No exponent or square root symbols/ options, only fractions ot your basic +-×÷π",
"Where did the probability and statistics section go? If I search something like regression videos show up from that section, i can play them. But as soon as i try to click to the subject name to go to the subject page, the app crashes.",
It's the great app I don't wanna lie. It has all the topics that we need which is exactly free and ad free. I haven't seen such a app in a quiet while. It's awesome and can't express and parents don't want to afford the price cause it's free.,
"Pretty alright. In the complex numbers unit you are asked for polar and rectangular forms of complex numbers in exact terms. Most calculators I've used that have the ability to output answers in expressions will still output decimals for radians in many cases and you are not given the option within the app to type with the pi symbol anyway for those same problems. Be right back, I'm going to go tear my hair out",
The app is a good study tool however I am having trouble with the quizzes that require typed in answers. The keyboard is not popping up on my Samsung Chromebook 3 so I am unable to complete the quizzes. By the way the website that they have below to make suggestions to the community throws an error. The URL does not exist.,
"The videos are so hard to understand and they give me headaches.Why, just why, I have a lot of stress, I can barely learn anything with this app without getting headaches. I'm sorry the review is low, but this is what I think about the app. BUT it kinda helped me when I do my work.",
This app is very useful.. First of all it's a no profit gaining foundation and helps students of all the ages that too all around the world. This foundation has literally helped me alot. Teachers are highly experienced and their teaching is at the another level. Thanks khan academy!!,
"I have been following them on youtube, their website and now finally on their app.. I am so grateful for the lessons on all of their platforms. All their platforms including the app works perfectly with no ads and no fee!! I ❤ you Khan Academy. I hope to keep studying with you even in the future....",
Fantastic app for learning maths and science etc. Really helpful. Please I would recommend you to add more subjects and grades. Nonetheless I had a wonderfully experience,
I love this app. It is very approachable no matter what age range you are. I like to use it for reving concepts that I am rusty on or have forgotten. This is definitely a life saver when tutoring is not available.,
The app is good and the concepts are too good. But the only thing I hated in this app is that the audio quality of the videos are not good and understanding. Please make the audio quality better than now.,
"I was never able to understand math so because of that, I've hated math for years. But Sal is such an amazing teacher! He makes it so easy to understand math and has taught me things my math teachers in school never did. I'm happy to say that math is now my favorite subject and I love it now. Thank you Sal and khan academy team! :)",
"App won't load practice questions after many attempts. Also doesn't support chromecast, so it has literally no additional functionality compared to just watching on YouTube.",
"The Apps usability is generally very good, but most of all I am giving Khan Academy 5 stars for their very concept of establishing an online university with a really broad programme and in-depth courses. For free! Unsurpassed!",
"Rgood app for class 1st to 12th also this app provide test preapration of MCAT , LSAT ,SAT, praxis of core reading , praxis core writting, praxis core math . and also you can change the app language to soo many different language and afcoure if you change the language of the app it will change the book according to the country language . this app does'nt contain any ads and charges 🤩. there are some many things which can I think help you a lot soo try it maybe this app is usefull for you 🙂",
This is without doubt in my opinion one of if not the best apps as far as learning. I highly recommend it to students struggling or even anyone that just wants to learn some stuff they may have forgotten. I am more than happy to rate u guys five stars. Awsom experience. Thank you,
It's a great app for learning and the courses are for free. The lecturer explains all concepts in a very descriptive manner and talks about its applications.,
"App and content is wonderful. Due to the huge size of the lectures, can this app be made to be moved to the SD card?? Right now it's internal memory only. The size right now for my material is more than 2GB",
This is the best app to study hardest to hardest concept. I really appreciate from my heart they are providing free and best education to all. I hope one day will come when all students will download this app in india and whole of the world. Really fantastic.,
"It is exceptionally good... Excellent explanation.. and the animation and all the stuffs were excellent, it helped to understand the main concepts easily. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 💫🖤",
"It's pretty cool. It helped me love math even more. My teacher is not helpful, so everyday I come home and work with this app. It's amazing on how a person can leran so much in such a short time with this app. Just a few problems though",
I love learning with khan academy I want them to keep doing more It helps a lot of people world wide I can understand the concepts easily Bug fix : But simple crashes like progress loss makes it difficult for the developers to get a 5 star from users,
Love Khan Academy!! Been a user for well over 7 years. Used it initially for my daughter then I started to find awesome videos to study myself while in Anatomy class..Great free resource to study most subjects or to prepare for entrance exams. Elementary to College Level review is available.,
"I understand that I have to review the app only. So that is failry interactive, very good looks, very simple to use. And if it is about the content, thats laudable, immensely good.",
One of the BEST learning apps! The tutor is brilliant and the quizzes they conduct are very good. The app gives good vibes. I'd give a 10 star rating if it was available.,
Best teaching experience I've ever had. taught better than 95% of my teachers. Easy to understand as it goes over common misconceptions and reasons why you got the wrong answer. Btw NO ads plus totally Free!,
"Khan academy is a really good app for kids to learn more , and be better at math, I have been using Khan academy for a long time. It really helped me get better with math, and learning new things! 10/10 recommend getting this app, just my opinion. 5/5 STARS!!!❤💖💞",
"Very valid and easy to understand presentations in regards to health technology (disorders, pathophysiology, meds, treatment). Also provides very up -to- date information as well as nclex type prep testing.",
"REALLY GREAT APP! really helpful for studying especially as a grade 8 student! highly recommend it. Just a suggestion, maybe add Philippine History to it in the future and Filipino / Tagalog Language since I'm a Filipino and we also learn about our history. thank you to the producers of this app! Keep up the good work!",
The app is great and I recommend it to every individual. The most amazing thing is that the app is absolutely free and easy to assess.it's a non for profit and you learn at you own pace. This is why it has my 5star👍.,
"Very educative, I wasn't lucky to discover my full potential in sciences due to psychological issues and the fact that an average school is all about A's, not how academia helps an individual intellectually. Khan academy helps me rediscover my inner self, one which I failed to notice half a decade ago. Thanks!",
"I just downloaded this a week ago and it really helps me in my study. In fact, in everytime that I'm struggling with some lessons that my teachers have given to me, I just open it and find the specific topic then read it with my own then I'll get it right away.",
"no doubt, it's free to all plus no ads ,All lectures are in accurate form with concepts accordingly level wise ' for every classes .I mostly used khan Academy to study Mathematics my experience was wonderful . Thanku",
"I like this app, I was never good at math but ever since I started using the app I got better, I'm currently using the app to study geometry and algebra to pass the asvab, but I wish I could use the app offline, if the dev's could implement a way to use it offline even if it means a 5-10 dollars to use offline, I would happily pay the monthly fee.",
"When you hear about the word impossible in understanding your courses, just don't bother your self, instantly download this e-learning app and you will experience possibilities. Thank you so much for this wonderful app Khan Academy",
The app is much better than before. But there is some issues that should be solved. Like the videos inside sat section which are in the article section don't start. Please solve the problem as soon as possible.,
"Khan Academy has helped me to review for my college entrance tests and it helped me a lot to recall all the lessons I've learned in the previous years of my education! Thanks a lot, Khan Academy! Continue helping students and aspiring learners. May God bless you!",
"Have been watching Khan academy's educational videos and reading articles. It's so nice to see that it's for free and that too best quality, so hands off to you guys. Keep up the good work and thank you to the whole team of khan academy.",
"Sometimes I have trouble with entering my math answers. With some practice, and using a laptop instead of a cell phone, I've gotten better at entering the answers. Otherwise, I love the app! It is wonderful! Thank you!",
"I love everything about the app. I can't wait to learn personal finance. If I were to add something I would only add the option to learn more languages, basically if you wanna learn Spanish and stiff like that.",
"My son uses this and was frustrsted with a counting excercise because even though he got all the questions right the app said he got 50%. I took the test with him, counting ladybugs and acorns etc and answered everything correctly...and we scored 70% Amazed that this learning app cant seem to count correctly!!",
"I really like Khan Academy, but the app is much harder to work with than the website. I tried to do my daily SAT practice questions but it would not allow me to do that on the app. Instead I would have to go to the website to finish them. I would really like to use the app, please fix this.",
"I'm giving it 4/5 stars not because of the teaching (because that is 5/5) but when I visited their YouTube channel , I noticed some videos were missing in the app which were there in the YT channel. Hope this will change with an update.",
I really got impressed after seeing Physics videos on youtube💯💯💯 and i came straight to download this app. There are many similar topics of Tamilnadu syllabus. Hope Khan academy can create videos for all subjects of tamilnadu syllabus too🙂. This is just an outstanding teaching way and i really loved it. Thankyou for creating such nice teachers and i really wanna clear all my doubts😕 please consider my suggestion of adding videos for all subjects especially for chemistry. Thankyou:),
"For the past 3 days I'm unable to use this app. It gives an error message ""unable to use course. Check your connection and tap to try again."" My connection is perfectly fine with all other apps but this one. Please help",
This is Amazingly Brilliant!!!! I can't believe this app is real!!! Super useful. It's got all my subject areas covered. So many video lessons.All for FREE!!! 😍 Thank you so much Khan Academy!!!😍❤️🤩,
"I think this is a very well made app. The videos are clear as well as the questions. But there are some conceptual errors, so keep in mind that everything is not 100% correct.",
"Khan Academy is very good indeed and I love it. But the app is not good. I should say horrible. It lags for unknown reasons (device is fast enough), does not support all of the feature like community comments, downloads only videos without articles and so on. Please make this app as wonderful as Khan Academy Khan Kids.",
"Really good as a learning resource, only thing it needs is more video speed options. 1.5x is a bit slow and 2x is way too fast, so please add like 1.75x speed then this app is perfect.",
"I want to be a physicist but math is my worst subject. So far I've been learning. How does one set himself a pace for a subject he cant understand and be gungho about. Wish I could be outside of my will and just force feed me...lol. The app itself is great, that's just a personal gripe :)",
"Amazing. Math courses available for all grade levels, even pre-kindergarten. Health and medicine, computer science, physics, and more. There's even test preps! Best part is that everything is absolutely FREE!",
"Only Positive Things I been a daily user of both Khan Website and App versions since September 2020. As student khan academy has helped me to get advanced in my studies in math, science and literature. Because of Khan Academy I love math now and participate in math contest around the world. If your looking for a free but GOOD resources Khan Academy should defenitly be at the top of your list.",
Audio Only option Please. Why? Battery Saver and some concepts needn't necessarily be seen. People can listen while walking and driving to lectures.,
"0/10. Cant even sign in. Keeps giving an 'unexpected error' when i try to sign in. Even the lessons are stuck on a loading screen. I tried updating my software, restarted my phone, and re installed the aop. I would much rather use a website version than this 😡",
"App is great. Loved it. I liked the way the teachers explain it to us by visualising. There are assignments that we can do, and I am in love with the quiz part.",
"This is a good learning app, but the subject you can only use is math, grammar and science! Why is it like that? So annoying",
"I use Kahn Academy as a teacher and wanted to manage my class from my phone. However, it appears the android app doesn't have any teacher features, so I'd have to open everything in my browser, making the app useless for my purposes.",
"This a great app, you can learn alot of concepts in a convenient way without getting charged a cent. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in incresing his/her knowledge. I would also like to thank the Khan academy family for allowing us to have all these information free of charge.",
This is the best learning app i have ever experience . it is a way better than byjus . i really very happy with the service of this app . it is helping me in studies in a very effective manner . This app help us to easily understand the tough concept / problems ..,
Amazing app for an non profit organization and very easy to use. Made mathematics easy for me. Also I would like a dark theme but it isn't available. Please add the dark theme as soon as possible,
"Very useful for studying and also needs tweaking. App sometimes lags or does not move, Download settings needs more choices like Download location (Phone or SD card, video resolution download ( 360, 480, etc.)",
The version is very unstable and unresponsive. Great content though. Edit : Uninstalling and re-installation works. Thanks to developers.,
This app can be helpful if there can be few changes just like when you signing in it continually says error which is very frustrating. It is even so slow,
Wow this is a great app! I am overwhelmed by it! It does have a lot lags but it's just ur network and anyways I love it u should try it to understand everything in studies and when I told it that I wanna become a veterinarian doctor. It recommended me vids that actually helped me!,
"I love Khan Academy, but the app is terrible. I can't log in through the app. I can only log in through the browser as it says there's an error. It's so frustrating.",
"Best app that I've ever used, I should have given you ten stars but five is the least. This app is so amazing, it has made my reading experience easy, although I have difficulty with reading but this app has made me love every bit of education..........Thanks so much khan academy",
"the content in this app is amazing , but the new updated version is very slow . please fix this as soon as possible. i have uninstalled and reinstalled many times but the problem continues.",
This should be praised . Let me tell a message to the developers & especially the great teachers. I just have seen a video but it really forced me to write a beautiful message or from a student to all of you . Thank you so much . You are going to gain so many messages ahead .,
"Everything is great, except I have to watch the course videos twice to ensure that ""completion tick"" shows up on the videos",
"kind of sucks, It only works like a quarter of the time, mostly it doesn't load and there is just a white screen.",
"i do like the app but I hate that there are no video quality settings,the video randomly goes from a low quality to high quality and vice versa which can be really annoying",
"I couldn't have my middle school education, so this app saved me during my GED and SATs. Now I have a huge scholarship at my University and am majoring in Data Science soon. This is truly an amazing app.",
Everything good except that freaking auto-rotate when you're watching it on phone. Give us an option where we can turn off the auto-rotation.,
"Very great !!! Thanks so much !!! Very great , really useful app!!! InshaAllah it shows how useful it was when I InshaAllah crack my digital SAT exam!!!!",
since the new update there is a delay between me clicking on the video and it starting. and now it does not automatically go to the next in a series of videos. it also take a lot time to download besides having a very fast Internet connection 😕 please help.,
Can't be more grateful for Khan Academy! Thanks a lot! Please add an option to disable auto fullscreen on rotation.,
"Every time, I try to download a bookmarked topic, I get ""Error downloading bookmark"". I've tried multiple times with no success. It happens somewhere in the middle of download. I'm using Samsung S7 edge.",
"Khan Academy is literally the best study guide ever! PARCC testing has been around for about 3 years, and I recieve a great grade MashAllah because of Khan Academy, but sometimes it takes a little bit of time loading, and it glitches sometimes, overall... keep up the great work!!",
"Incredible application. Like they say, you can learn about anything. I have incorporated it into my son's public school education and it has done wonders. I am recovering from a brain injury and it has helped me to recover my cognitive abilities. If you are the parent of a school age child, I implore you to incorporate Khan academy into his or her educational career.",
"i want to say thankyou for creating this amazing app. i really learned a lot from this, and its really amazing that it's free and have a tons of lessons and quizzes that challenge me after some vid lesson. so its a big thanks! keep it up khan academy!",
The app uses the internet website when where I want to change or learn a topic . There is no use of downloading a app if it goes to the website it's better to go to websites online and study. It's quite helpful.,
I love this app they teach it where you can actually understand. They break it down for you also the practice quizzes really help. Thank you so much. These guys really made me understand more than my high school teachers.,
"Very Very and very best app for study. I was trying to complete three chapter of math but I was not able to do it, it taked 5 months but I was unable one day my my one of the friends advised me to download this app and after downloading and using this app for a month I cleared all the chapters in only one month this app helped me a lot in not only math it helped in all the subjects this is free no payment required in this app but it is very better than paid app like byju's, vedantu etc.",
This app is really helpful cus it well understood I only gave four stars I am now experiencing it performance,

I recommend this app for all students.But extra key like u,x,z is not coming please make a key with extra buttons. Because I give his app only 4 stars.",
"This app is incredibly helpful. Studying for math tests is easier now. It's simple and easy, and I can review the lessons easily. Great app!",
It's great. You surely get the concept when you use this app. You understand the tutors too which makes it a worth downloading app and one of the best educational app. Every student must give it a try.,
"This IS THE BEST platform for learning. Not only does it have great videos explaining, but it also provides you with tests afterwards! Great resources which you can get to clear your doubts. I would be lying if I say Khan Academy deserves any less than 4 stars 😔",
"Whilst normally an extremely useful app for learning, I am sadly having an issue with trying to take multiple tests in Algebra 1 due to some error that drops me out of said tests - it makes it very annoying and cumbersome to try and test my knowledge.",
"Some of the questions have broken mechanics. Stats and probability, it wants me to drag and drop things into order, but I'm unable to drag anything into the 2nd row, meaning I can't complete the questions that have me do this.",
I like the interface of this app very simple and useful. I like watching more and more educational videos on Khan academy and I love the exercises(practice) made by by khan academy. if you r downloading it for first time then you are really willing to learn something new. have a good day ☺️,
"I love everything your team is doing. Please keep it up. I'd like to develop an open source Android TV client app, so that we can learn maths as family together. Please let me know the API endpoint I can use for this purpose. Thanks.",
"I really loved it and eventually falling in love more 😘. This is truly something, try once and then you'll also feel same. DARK MODE! DARK MODE!

Thanks and Regards",

"the best of all, I have learnt lots of things from it. Actually i have been using it for long but i just thought right now to repay it with a kind review. Sal Khan can be compared as present day's ""feyman"" he never misses a detail. I have encouraged lots of my mates to watch his videos expecially the ones lagging behind. -thanks from nepal.",
"This platform is singlehandedly teaching me everything I should have learned in high school and college, in a way that makes sense and is easier to understand. Thank you very much to the Khan Academy team, for doing all this work without charging a single cent.",

Really amazing app I don't have words to explain my happiness.. 😍😍,
I loved this app because it's free as well as it is in both English and Hindi language which is good for all students and i like the teaching way of all teachers to . Thanks for making such a wonderful app it helped me alot to understand all concepts and i think this app deserves 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Star.,
It's great and the most helpful app ever. Coming from a student it helped me understand organic chemistry in less than a few days and it made me understand it like it was a piece of cake!!!! Highly recommended And bless the guy who created this litttt app,
Why is the app glitching so much when I scroll? I hope its a temporary issue. (edit) I managed to fix it... its a tiny issue on mobile devices. It works like a charm on my laptop. 5 stars!,
"It's awesome app and hepls me to understand my concepts better.Also it has quizzes just after the concepts ,which helps to memorize concepts and cross check our knowledge. All over the app is best.",
"Amazing app and excellent for students studying in international programmes because it contains all their lessons and questions... for me it was very amusing, educative, and excellent...... thanks",
The best learning app. If i have option to 100stars i would give cuz it really good. I m in love with it and with my study material. I will recommend this to everyone!!!!!!😍😍😍😍. Others app: give us 599£ per month then only u can get good features. Khan academy: everything is just free😍😍😍with lots of love. This app don't even tell that (can we get 5stars?) Seriously i love this app. Thanking you Khan academy for this wonder.,
I'm a parent attempting to keep track of my child's progress and assignments. The only thing the app shows me the badges earned and energy points. This information is utterly useless to me. Uninstalling the app.,
"Sal, the app is having a hard time saving video progress. I see some with the check besides them, I view the video, and some checks do not appear. Thank you for the teachings. Terry",
I'm an adult re-learning middle school math just for fun. I wish they had this when I was younger. I love the visual aspects and clarity.,
"This app is of great help but some issues which i am facing is with sound, the sound is very low and it makes it hard to listen, same videos have good range of volume at YouTube but in app its very low",
"I like learning through this app, and I would like it more if the video player doesn't lower the quality of the voice on the video when the quality of the images gets lower, thank you.",
Khan academy has helped my son with his math classes. By practicing and understandable examoles It gave him confidence in his ability. And helped with astronomy and world history. And yes I'm a real person.,
"Great app for learning about almost everything. I use it to learn more advanced mathh than I'm learning in school right now. I just wish that there's a Number Theory or Combinatorics section. I also wish that there are programming courses for programming languages other than JavaScript and SQL, like Python or Java.",
"This app is great, like having a free , online tutor. However whenever I try to log into my account on the app ( which works fine on the website) it says that it was invalid. Please fix",
look I love khan academy. But the downloading is a pain in the butt. I download stuff offline and I KNOW it's offline then when I go to use it it tell me I'm off line and can't learn the subject. I live in the middle of nowhere so signal is bad. I want to get ahead in my schooling to make sure I make the most in life but that's a bit upsetting. please see into this!,
"The worst thing about this app is that if you get one question wrong, you're still forced to finish the test. It's like needing 100% but being forced to finish the test anyway. Then when you hand it in the teacher grades you, then throws it away and hands you another test. But every time he grades it, he lowers your grade. (levelling down). So you can't just fill in wrong answers after you already know you failed. This is why I couldn't give 5 stars.",
I was looking for some teaching for my kid & downloaded this app thinking Khan Sir himself will be teaching but was disappointed as these seems to be computer generated voice. I randomly opened one chapter which started to check my BODMAS knowledge. The 3rd question ans should have been 100 (50+50) but as per app it's zero (-50+50) which is wrong. So they need to check on such mistakes,
"Best educational free app one could ever ask for, I'm not even sugarcoating people, Thanks to Sal khan and his team, I've not just improved in academics but also as a human. Whenever i want to understand the world around me, i turn to khan academy, because it not only has great quality content but even truly educates for the purpose of learning and not getting good grades or something. It's literally a blessing to human race. Can't thank Khan academy enough, my words for you guys are short.",
"Doesn't load. I have deleted and reinstalled the app, and even emailed the company! But no one responded and I still cannot load ANYTHING on the app. it always says there was an error with the file.",
"Khan academy is a wonderful app that is great to learn from. Learning is made easy and there are so many courses however, Khan academy does not have Literature or Geography or Music as their subjects which are some of the subjects I was really looking for.",
"The app is marvellous , according to me it's the best app for students to study without any cost . While studying from this app I have noticed that it utilizes less data ( i.e. if you study 10 hours continuously then it takes less than 1GB ) . This app contains two languages while explaining ( Hindi & English) so it is very good for the Indians who are not good in English ( like me ). May god bless the teachers to live their life more than 100 years so that they can teach the students longtime.",
Maybe it would be a good experience if it would let my daughter even do the lessons. The videos will play and the lessons just give us a cloud with rain saying they couldn't load the exercise. It's only this app we're having trouble with.,
"The app seems great but i m having issues with accessing the home page and the revision question,when i try opening the home page,the app closes while the past questions are not opening,but i can access the videos tho",
This rating is for the app itself. It's stuck on me being the learner even though I have changed the settings on the website to teachers dashboard. Considering that we're planning on using Khan Academy Math for homeschooling purposes I would even have preferred the parent dashboard over the learners dashboard. With this being said I find this app to be difficult to use / navigate. If possible help me resolve this issue and I will change my rating. Thank you in advance.,
"It's fun, I've had the odd glitch or two but the team has been really helpful and have tried their best to fix every issue I have, other then the odd glitch I absolutely love the app.",
"It is quite comprehensive. While, being completely free. This is very helpful especially since many schools are doing virtual learning and it can be hard to learn the information.👍🏾👏🏾🙌🏾",
"This is an amazing free education app, I can do all my work right here and don't really have to worry about a teacher explaining it to me because of the information it has and videos to learn. Great app, y'all did a great job",
"I'm speechless. They are doing a great service to this world! But just one suggestion - Like we can ask our doubts related to the video on website, please add an option in the app for the same too. Thanks!",
I have used this before this is the best education app I know of... there is only one thing I can think of to make it better and that is an all around test maybe with 4 sections in each area of math English science history etc. to see what areas you need to study to see what you need to go over,
"I wanted to download the app because I loved the website version and after reading the reviews, I definitely think this app is perfect for me. However, I never got to experience it as it kept crashing. Could you please solve this issue?",
"An amazing application, I would definitely recommend this. However, I'm still keen to have Arabic courses, it would be very helpful and would open education to a wider range of learners.",
I hate it so frickn much. It is often used as homework. This stupid thing has made me cry one too many times and have one too many mental breakdowns. Just teach your kids instead. Itll save them from depression in the future,
"It's like going to school, but you can get extra help and more one on one feeling. Also, it has more of a sense of accomplishment. I have my daughter on the kids one and I use this one for my personal growth.",
"Thier teaching staff and faculty is best on earth (atleast in context of online education) and I cannot wish for more than this! About app, it's perfect and compliments Khan Academy's teaching quality. The test's are thoughtfully designed and will get the most out of you from what you have learned from thier respective courses. I had a suggestion though, can you please add tests regarding JEE Mains & Advance (Just like your SAT preparation test's)? Would be awesome if you can add that!",
"I ""HATE"" this app becuase its so AMAZING. KHAN ACADEMY can literally turn school into JETSONS type learning and can probably teach EVERYONE to become rocket scientists. There is nothing this app or program can not do. You will not get better teaching ANYWHERE! Amazing amazing learning portal. I promise you, there will be a day when this is in every classroom in the world.",
"Erik! Take an English composition course! Great app. Knowledge doesn't need to be a mega trillion social experiment. You can find a WELL above average college education (ESPECIALLY HERE) if you look for it, often for pennies on the dollar and often avoiding superfluous courses. 👍👍👍",
"What an amazing education aap. Sal sir, you have done a great, brilliant, tremendous, job and many more adjectives can be added in praise of your work. I liked your work so much, even all the people out there, that I cannot express in words. I am from India and I think that your app is the best aap on the playstore.",
Khan Academy has been more helpful than school provided videos and texts and it saves from the monotony of reading textbooks. Anything I've struggled with in school has been made infinitely clearer in a Khan video.,
"I am having a issue related to the app. When I try to open the app , it opens for a moment then it automatically closes. I have tried reinstalling the app but still the same problem. Please fix this problem . Thanks.",
I have used this app for a while now and enjoyed it without problem and now I am unable to load into the app and when I open the app it instantly crashes. I have tried all of the troubleshooting steps and the steps did not fix the app crashing.,
"I love this app! I use it for class advancement, yet all articles are not available offline. I hope that you guys apply the save offline feature on articles like you have in saving videos.",
It's a very good educational app. It is helping me to score far more better in exams than before The videos are interesting and the questions arw are challenging. And i love it very much...,
"Outstanding app! Clean interface, Properly explained courses in both English and Hindi, very easy to navigate around the app and find courses, download is also available, and everything for free without ads!",
Very helpful. Hope they'll bring more effective courses. I found some practice problems having wrong solutions. I hope they'll fix them all.,
Update:The error of not opening the M.C.Q.s / Tests has fixed now. Thanks Khan Academy for giving free education for all with an ad free application and with a clean UI. We will always support you. You are really doing a great job.,
"Thank You so much for all the knowledge, Also please can you add download option and Background play it'll be much better. Edit :- There's a way to download video I didn't know this, You just need to bookmark the video you want to download, Go to bookmarks and you'll see a download option.",
"I reinstated the app and closed all over apps on my phone, but exercises and quizzes still do not work. ""Error making task progress"". My phone is running Android 4.4. Can you fix that issue?",
Video and audio are not in sync. So there is no interest in watching the videos. Correct this bug otherwise the app is good,
Honestly this is the best app I have ever come across. Such an ocean of knowledge here at this very platform. Hats off to all the teachers and the creator for their incredible services.Highly appreciated and extremely thankful for such a generous spread of knowledge and education about a huge number of topics.,
Excellent app.Less visual clutter.Must have for every student.Ad free. But internet connectivity can be optimized and *please add an option to control video quality*,
Khan Academy is a good app to use if your kids are home schooled. All you have to do is go to the playstore on your devise and type in Khan Academy. At first I thought that it was boring and then when I got into the program I realized how much it helps me.,
"I saw good reviews here about the app,but the app won't let me use it,it doesn't respond when I tap on something 😩,I hear that it's a good studying app for students please let me experience it,I have uninstalled and downloaded it thrice Please fix it 🙏 thanks",
"the application works well, my kids are having fun while learning math, and others (5 and 7 yo) the only problem i hvae is the lack of profiles, they want to do the exercises and everything else but they step on each other as they use my account, i dont want to create multiple accounts for my kids, having profiles like the khan kids app would be best",
Great app overall. Just cant seem to figure out the problems on how to move the dot on the number line? It seems like the dot does not want to move. Please help with this issue. I have a screenshot.,
"This is just wonderfull app. I have a lot of use of this app and ther are many courses which are usefull for future. This app is free of costs. The video lectures are undustable. But, there us no chemister and biology for class 9, 11, and 12.",
"This app is much better than IXL! Not only is it easier to work with, it also provides an ABUNDANCE of lessons and skills to do! So your child can not only learn school subjects, but have the freedom to learn new skills and talents!",
It's too good but they don't teach the methods in a good manner,
I just dont know what to say but thanks! This app has given me the knowledge i paid for in my courses for free and much more clearer and entertaining! Thank you guys... It even has tests with a score system( just a few questions)... 😍🤩 Did i say that theres no ads...,
This is horrible they teach you one way they want you to do it but give a test. About a way they haven't explained in my my opinion you should teach the way every way it could be asked . This is why you really shouldn't do online learning. With a teacher you can ask questions and it can be explained if he/she didn't teach you that way but got a test over it.,
"I used Khan Academy before and I just have to say, I'm really disappointed at how buggy it is nowadays. My downloads are paused. I turned off my data for a second and the app crashed.",
I dont do a lot of reviews but I had to for this. You get to choose 9 courses for free and the teachers are so damn good! I'm not sure where class 11 chem is tho..? It's super useful and a life saver,
"This app is one of the best of its kind. The collected knowledge, the explanations, the samples and the videos are great help to anyone who wants to study and improve its skills.",
"Amazing app ! It's just perfect for quick revisions of topics (as all the videos are topic-wise) Just a suggestion that the app experience could be made smoother , great job otherwise :)",
"Okay so the app is amazing!!!! All this education for free. It's a blessing. Although, the only problem is downloading a lesson takes too long. Apart from that it's basically a free home lesson.",
I really loved it. It is believed that paid things are better than things that are free of cost but this app disproves it. There are many concepts explained better than that in paid apps or courses. They explain the real logic not only that which is written in textbooks.,
"I have tried the website vesion. It is good but, the app is even.....BETTER. To all the people that works in Khan Academy ""keep up the spirit and unyielding to teach kids and teens like me.",
Excellent treasure trove of knowledge 🙂,
"When I play with more than 1x speed (1.3x,1.5x,2x), I don't get full energy point although I learn the full concept. Again the app's orientation is only portrait most of the time except the time of playing video.",
"Free world class education what else can I say now? I only have a thing to write the new update doesn't have the encouraging bell sound in the mastery challenges. It would be great if the sound(the ""tring"") sound is on the app.",
"This is the best app ever. I wanted to brush up on high school math I struggled with and found a wealth of information designed for anyone and any topic. I rarely leave the site in need of further instruction or clarification. This app exceeds all expectations, and has almsot everything the website does",
A great app I would rate it 5star but it stopped working I got very angry 😡. and as many time as I redownload it or restart the devise it still doesn't work😔 I keep going in the app and it says 'khan academy keeps stoping' but luckily there is the khan academy Google website so if khan academy isn't working then try the website if you know any solution please help🤔.,
Why don't you add Urdu? And how about teaching O levels and IGCSE. That will be a huge help,
"I always just go to the website never knowing that there was an app version of it...I love khan Academy and all of its members. Really worth spending my time on, you can get free knowledge from there plus it's really fun too. You guys did a great job! Keep it on, thank you so much!",
"Wow I love this app, for someone who add no opportunity for an education this is great I'm starting with the basics but learning feels so good its simple and practical I don't usually leave reviews but felt I had to with this it's so well laid out easy to use and the video lessons are engaging and fun 5* thank you guys!! X",
"I'm relearning algebra as an adult, 15 years after I last touched the stuff, and I'm very impressed by how concise the explanations are. The frequent test exercises allow me to be sure I've got a grasp on something before I move on to the next topic.",
It is a really helpful but I am having trouble with opening it. If I reopen it after a period of time it doesn't responds but it's really good for education....I request you to please work over the problem. A big thanks to khan academy,
"Although I do not live in the US, this app has helped me a lot with my education. I am currently a senior student at a high school in Australia and this app has become a source of information for my studies. I mean, there is almost nothing you cannot find on this app. I have to give it four stars as there is only one problem I have for it: there is no support for language learning.",
I'm having issues on my S10 and don't see away to inform in app. After a solving a few problems it fails to update memory and I'll have to restart the app. This is a new issue for me and i still would recommend the app and or the website.,
this was wow..but the new update made things work slower.consuming soo much time to losd a thing.opens web browsers to select courses etc.prev one is better with an attractive display and easy to find everything.And when searching need to give everything correct.its not fixed even with tye jew update.i loved this but the new update is not tyat good.,
It's the best platform to learn SAT,
"Thankyou for the truly free education, i find myself playing a lot of video games in my spare time but recently i was drawn in to learning about cosmology and astronomy (that are offered in this app) and khan academy actually makes it pretty fun and interesting to learn about it. 👍🏼",
"My teacher uses Khan Academy for math assignments, and gotta say, it's user interface is super simple and easy to navigate to courses and assignments! Love the work!",
"it's a very good application, but you have to reconsider your contents, as if saying that you should develop your content, and keep up with current knowledge, maybe in mathematics like topology and in physics like particle physics and quantum field theory and philosophical analysis and alot and alot of knowledge , you could by then make your reputation as the biggest platform there is for knowledge, but good job at the least of all that you have achieved.",
"Khan Academy is an app that I've used for 3 years and it is the best. I study on khan academy for at least 2 hours, of how good it is. Two things that I like about it are that you can see your progress and take more time studying that topic and then take the test or quiz.",
"Amazing app for learning anything and everything. It was really easy to understand everything. Also, the accessibility of the content for free makes it available to all",
Writing after my 10th boards I was facing a lot of issues with presenting my answers in the exam due to having half knowledge thanks to khan academy my boards went really well. Thank you so much Khan academy,
It's the best app out there for SAT preparation and it's totally free. But please please please introduce dark mode. I use it everyday and when such a great app lacks dark mode it just bothers me cuz I'm so used to dark mode. Please do it ASAP and I'll update my review. I'll really appreciate it and thanks for everything.,
"I am not able to see the home screen of the app. The moment i click on on the home button, it throws me out of the app. I think there is a bug while opening the app.",
"Highly recommend if you like to learn or relearn all thngs of scholastic subjects and if you're low income,it's free!",
I think it's the best app for learning purposes but it has some flaws which i don't like is that it cannot track more than 9 courses and my phone hangs while using it plz take some action about it overall experience is very good,
"Works a lot worse than when opened in a browser. i can almost never find the videos of the topics i am looking for. I always try the browser on my PC and find the realted video there, rendering this app useless.",
This app is so good and very useful app.because the everything in daigram so it's very easy to mameraize. But there's only one problem that's everything in one language english. Add another language like Gujarati so it's better then one. So that why I only gives 3 stare.,
"Absolutely fantastic learning tool, never had any issues with this app, couldn't reccomend enough.",
"Khan Academy is ""^^SO^^"" worth it. It helped me through high school and college to pass my math classes. It has countless videos on math, science, english, social studies, history andjust about any and every other subject.",
"I just want to thank the creators of this program or app.they teach everything in detail, perfectly without any flaws... I'm very grateful and it is free to use ,I recommend everyone who is searching for a learning app... don't search a lot..this is your destination 🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥",

It's the best app to learn I wish there could be dark mode,
"If it's up to hundred Stars i would have, the lesson are so understandable i just don't know how to thank this tutor for this ,.. ♥️♥️♥️♥️",
"This app is sooo good!!! You can pick what grade your in,pick what subjects you wanna focus on,and it gives you educational videos AND lessons where if you dont understand something they give you a video AND they explain it to you step by step!! Its a super good app and im sure you will not regret uploading it!!!",
"Perfection ! Only being a software student makes you realize how nicely things have been put together to make this app and the content inside. Thumbs up to Sal, his whole team and the people behind this app. 5 stars is must cause the purpose behind this app is one of the most satisfying on Mother Earth.",
"Thanks to the entire Khan Academy team! It's equal for everyone. No subscriptions, no annoying ads, no application bugs, beautiful UI.",
Limited to 8 class Why cant it reach grade 10,
Good for students,
This is a really wonderful application. Wonderful and easy to use interface. I really love the pictures and all the functions in the app thank you Khan Academy,
"After new update, auto rotation works terrible it automatically rotate the screen orientation which is very annoying!!",
This is the best educational application I have ever seen.It is the best because of its motto - ' free education to everyone '.The explanations are very professional and the animations are awesome.I bet that on any other place on earth we get such a useful application for free.I really thank the team and Mr Sal for bringing forth the application.Salute to your team.I wish Khan Academy continues for ever with such a great service to the humanity.,
The lessons in Khan Academy are easy to underand.Everytime I search for something else on google I found videos from Khan Academy and it's explanation can make me satisfied.I strongly recommend that it's a very useful application not only for teachers but also for students.,
The pages never load completely and there's always missing information. It makes for a disrupted learning experience.,
It won't let me sign up/create a profile but it doesn't say why. All the error message says is An unexpected error occured. Please try again later...that tells me nothing. I have tried exiting and re-entering the app and re-entering my info but it still says the same thing.,
"App was working great...now nothing loads and it says to try again later. Super upsetting. Cleared cache, uninstalled and re-downloaded 4 times. Same result.",
This app has very poor audio. It is vert annoying to study like this!! Almost half of the explanation audio is cut and almost half of the audio is mute. How can i understand things without explanation???,
This is the best platform that I have ever used. Thanks to all who take part in producing.,
"I am a first year nursing student. And maths isn't my biggest skill. But with this app I am learning, pretty quick also. Describes decimals very detailed. Very good app! I would recommend for every nursing student. ❤️",
"Khan academy is a great platform that help me with a lot of school material.. the mastery learning tool is the latest feature and awesome at tracking one's study, however I often encounter an error code saying error making task progress, please improve this!",
I expected to be sincere and attractive app but the moment when i downloaded and open it i found that the app had pop up automatically cut down and eventually reaches to my lockscreen of my phone. W o r s t.,
Excellent app to learn stuff I needed to refresh from my school time. I am facing one issue I am doing Statistics and Probability course using website on Laptop but when I browse the course using app I cannot search it. Please look into this and resolve,
I can't believe i get the whole high school and college math for free in the palm of my hand,
"It is really useful. My son, a student of class VI finds Maths more interesting. If Khan Academy expands their learning to other subjects at this lower level. it will be hugely beneficial to us. .",
"It is a very good app , it contains all that I need, but when downloading a video from bookmark, it promptly say error downloading video from bookmark. Please figure it out in your next update.",
"I definitely loved this app.This app is acting as a life-changing for me,the only reason why 1 am not giving 5 star is the possibility of improvement in function as it hangs sometimes and addition of more topics like mental abilities separately. Thankyou",
"This is an amazing and i would love it if you could put an in app game where you can execute different practicals in subjects like chemistry, physics and biology thank you",
"Khan Academy is a very good studying app. My experience on it has helped me understand many things. And it is COMPLETELY cost free. For anyone who has difficulty financially and have kids, this is the app for you.",
The app is really good but the only problem is it does not teach you everything for High School Elementary kindergarten first grade and Cetera that would be a very helpful that the application can get us ready for college or for beginners that does not learn any mathematics there's a lot of people that does not know how to do any math for example like me this is my first time learning I used to be in life skills special class for kids they don't teach us math they think it is too advanced for us,
Best free learning platform... I am using it for a long time and it's the best no one can compete with it... Like no one... The quality of education bis just superb... Hope they do well in future also... Love from India ❤️,
The app is amazing there's lots to learn but most of the courses about computer science from the website are missing it would be so awesome if you could add them to the application Thanks,
"This app is great for learning. But I just wanted to note that I miss the comments section which is available on the website but is not available on this app. I was wondering if it could be included, that will really help a lot especially for communicating with other learners.",
"An amazing app, the most useful thing app there is. I was struggling with physics and they explained everything I needed to know simply and with great example graphs",
Most amazing app for primary as well as higher education. The only problem is that if we do not use for example physics(India) then it does not show that option,
It's got no teachers of any subject,

I am using this app to relearn the math I lost in a decade of excessive alcohol consumption and general debauchery and I'm loving it! The instructor is fantastic and occasionally hilarious.,
This app is easy and fun this help me learn more math than in school it was just what I needed my favorite thing is that it has quizzes along the way. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs help.,
I really like this app.It is a very good platform to learn the required concepts and it guides you from basic to advanced parts of all the chapters smoothly.,

"Pushing data up? I have not used this app in over a year. For some reason, the app pushed up 14 MB of data. I haven't been watching the app, so it may have been doing this all along. This is not a small amount of data. Uninstalling.",

I absolutely love this app. It has great courses and awesome teachers. I tried the JavaScript course by Pamela and it was so interesting. Hats off to Khan academy for adding CBSE course as well as it's very helpful. Keep up the good work👍Good luck to u.,
"Used to be great, now any time you click on a lesson but dont complete it you are unable to use the app without first deleting the data. Sufficed to say this is incredibly inconvenient.",
"Right to Education is free without compromising quality, here it is. Anything else we find luring with a fortune, are all commercial version making profit by using the loopholes in a particular education system, especially online digital one's, flooding with advertisements with celebrities from irrelevant field, while Khan Academy is flexible, pampers out the creativity and if one likes donation is fine without compulsion. Great Job since the inception of interactive online learning. Thank You.",
Thank you Sal Khan for making this app free for every learner. The videos really help us to easily understand complex topics. I enjoy studying with this app. Because the explanatory videos are better than any animated videos.,
This app is incredible it explains things better than my teacher and I am very grateful this is free to use because now all good learning apps you have to pay for. I am very satisfied with this app and I hope it continues to be free.Thank you. Side note: I'm definately asking my parents to donate.,
This app is completely helpful and it explains in standards such as taking the SAT is the same way it explains. Another reason about its greatness is that it can help you to start from scratch.,

"I have always wanted to give this app 5 stars when I started vising in 2018... I think it's kind of bugging as at 2020. With full internet connection, the video doesn't load😖😖. Annoying!!!",
"Never seen a better learning and revision app for free. A job well done. For readers, just to let you know the founder of Khan Academy himself has studied from M.I.T and Harvard. His teaching style is awsome. Everything just strikes your head, or atleast my head when he teaches. 5 stars from my side. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",
"Khan Academy is one of the most useful academic tools I have ever used. It's comprehensive, and extremely informative. They keep it consistently updated. You really can't ask for more.",
You guys are complete life saver. I am a good chemistry grad student and got to clear my basics sometimes so I won't feel left out I check the videos as they are more comprehensive to me and I find it very suitable. 10/10 recommend everyone.,
"The courses are very nice, Very well taught 👍.. But I have a problem with the home tab. Whenever I open its home tab, it crashes automatically. When I open the app ,I have to change to search tab or the app crashes in the home tab. If I go back to home tab from the search tab it crashes.... I've not seen the home tab yet.... I tried reinstalling the app but it doesn't work..",
"Khan Academy is helping me so much especially now that I haven't gone to school for a long time, it feels great to catch up and keep learning. You literally saved my education 😂. Thank you so much! Definitely recommended.♥️🧡💛",
"I already have my BSc degree but sometimes i need to refresh my brains for something I'm researching on. This app helps a lot. Even on new things i want to learn and understand, Khan Academy app is proving to be a rich source of knowledge. i love it.",
"There is a bug with the algebra course (or st least, the one I found), you cant scroll downwards because the menu keeps going up on its own, making it immposible to reach the courses at the bottom of the menu.",
"I remember there was a class 12th section for India separately , i had to uninstall this due to some reasons but after reinstalling the app i cant find the section of 12th, which makes it a lot more difficult to search for the lessons i require. Please fix this if it is a glitch.",
Thank you very much to the Khan academy organisation and this app.It helped me alot with my self-studying.I am at year-9 student and it have all the courses I want to learn and pratise.It'd would be great if this app could provide more exercises and more courses though I am satified with the amount it provides now.,
"great educational app which clear your concepts at free of cost.. Since i complete my 12 there are so many uncleard concepts, this app is helping me to improve on those. I recommend this app to every student for their studies.",

Excellent app for studing students and it's free👍 for all and this may encourage many children like me to study. And it is useful to recall all lessons or chapters we learn.,
unlimited learning for free. love how you can accrue points...very intuitive and interactive. Love how the lessons are taught.,
"I like the options and variety of free education. Best app I've found yet, however Khan Academy included more instruction of the arts like threatre, dance, martial arts, etc. It would be even more amazing",
As a student it's annoying that for assignments it doesnt keep track...like when you finish it there should be a check icon next to it telling you it's done...please add that in because I think it would be very helpful,
This app is one of the best warning apps i have seen. They have helped me pass so many tests bc the lessons are short clear and effective the practice tests and quizzes are fun too.,
This would be a great app if every time I exit a video it didn't rotate and lock my screen rotation in place. I cant go full screen again unless I exit out and resign back in. I literally wanna smash my tablet right now!,
"It gives me good experience about online study. But some concepts are being not teached , teacher should have an introductory video of every lesson.",
One word for this app. Just 'Awesome' I rarely rate an app but I had to do it.. The animations the videos the ideas and we can say the app is gold. Content makes the app so pure gold. If you want some concrete knowledge download now.,
The moment where I felt like I would never get better at math and I found this app. it felt like I found an extra teacher who actually understands my problems and knows where I need to work on. Instead of making me relearn what I already know.,

it is a really good app for learning but it has some bugs like if i get an answer wrong on mobile it says a error occured or it will say an error occured before watching a video but it works the next time.please fix mobile khan academy,
The best learning app. It teaches us more than the average text book. I love how it suits all the curriculum even the Indian curriculum. Love it.,
"I am happy to study in Khan Academy.But,there are two problems.First,I tried to login after I signed out.I typed the correct email and password multiple times but, it is showing ""Invalid password"" and ""Network problem"".Second,You should add the in-app facility for the courses only available in the browser.I hope you will fix these problems.After you read this,please reply!",
"Khan Academy is great. Whether you use the App or the Browser on the PC, you can always expect really good and informative videos. Khan Academy was a huge help for me to graduate.",
"Amazing, but it needs some performance upgrades, my Galaxy S7 frequently crashes when i start the app and i need it to do my homework :( ... Still, it's great to learn new things ❤",
"Good app, but the math section quizzes are impossible to use since I can't enter exponents in for answers. The keyboard needs to be updated to either include math symbols or let me use my phone's default keyboard.",
Love the app so far. Missing night mode! Loving the finance videos on the black background. Thank you and kindly consider adding a true (OLED type) night mode.,
"Overall, the app works well, lessons are very specific and easy to understand. But it often crashes and most exercises in a lesson are not much diverse :(",

Just one small request if you guys can put some PHD level mathematics contents that will be great. Once again I'm so thankful for your generosity.",
"This app is great! It helped me prepare for a pre-calculous test that I had to take for college. It taught me alot, considering that i have been out of school for ten years.",
"Love this app! It helps me a lot! But I think that there was something wrong with the last update with this app. Since then I can't acess the exercises or questions, the page is completly blank. What do you think happened?",
So helpful! I was struggling with mathematics and it helped me understand the many things I struggled with. What really helped is the videos and hints. it explains and helps me understand what to do. Thank you khan academy!,
I have seen some electric and electronic coaching and find them readily understandable. The tutors are well experienced and use simple language to teach the subjects.,
Does not have much content for programming learners. Just some HTML and CSS. Also takes me to browser in many of the courses saying that it was not supported in app. Such a Frustrating app.,
"Absolutely brilliant. Good job men. In India there are also many apps, and they are making fool of everyone , taking $200 pm just for nothing. Very good, a child who has interest in study can pass class 10 and 12 easily with this app.",
"Great app. Minor bugs from time to time, but they always get them resolved quickly. Can not ask for more from a totally free (and ad free) service.",
Very good app for learning in shs especially.it has lesson videos and many trial questions to access your understanding for a lesson.The little problem is that you can't download their videos because I have tried so many times.,
Awesome Ed-Tech platform.Free access to full content. Well categorised and arranged videos with awesome quizzes inbetween videos. Has content for topics ranging from science to economics. LOVED IT!!,
"its really good but there should be an option to silence the exercise, its very annoying. Also says in several videos ""could not load this video. Try again""",
"Changed my life! amazing material to study and the videos have helped me tremendously. thank you so much for having material that is easy to catch on to and learn easily. I dropped out of high school and now 30 years later, I am confident that I can make a better future with your studies! 🧡",
"New Review.. The app now works excellently. Thank you all at Khan academy. Hopefully..... I will break this burden of learning. Old Review. App not signing in, not loading courses. Nothing is working. Pla Khan team. I appreciate this app and your efforts. I am from Nigeria and I really need this service. Pls solve this issue",
"The best platform for any student! I downloaded Khan Academy 2 days ago after learning about it from the net and personally, it is the best platform I have ever used. All concepts explaind wonderfully. Cheers to the team!",
I'd strongly recommend this app. It's fabulous. You have a lot of subjects to study and that's all totally free. Also videos are really good and easy to understand. It's just amazing! ☺,
This a very good app and the fact that its free makes it better its the best educational app. The subjects are taught in a very good manner .Plus there are no ads.,
"Great app, but a bit glitchy. I cannot take a course challenge without it freezing up after submitting my answer for the first problem.",
Very Well Done.Everythings seems to be so perfect.This app is literally fantastic.This app helps us to understand all the concepts in a systematic manner along with videos. Better than online teaching......,
Great learning platform that covers almost all fields. Best this I like about the content is that it begins with the history of given topic. Wish this platform to be ever growing.,
It is quite a good app. During the lockdown i had to sudy for my 10th exam as well as go through 11th syllabus so it was very helpful.and the explanation was simple and easy to grasp,
"I like the lessons sir, and the app is easy to use. It's very easy to learn and study since you can choose a course you want.",
Great app! Just as convenient and easy to use and learn as you can think. Learning from this app looks like exploring and is fun. And that's exactly how one should teach. Thank you!,
"During this COVID19; teachers are using this app as a teaching tool. However, my scholar is provided a QR. I think the app should include the scanner so that they can automatically be directed to the material. However, its a good app.",
"This is by far the most wonderful app I have ever used IN MY LIFE. I honestly cabt believe how much value I get from this app for free!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Thank you so much khan academy. this is so helpful for people who are discouraged by overpriced tutors who don't even give this much value 😭 I've developed a completely positive attitude towards learning since I started using this app, and my performace has drastically improved. So I am very grateful from the bottom of my heart!",
Khan academy is great. The app is a little annoying in that you can't display it in the landscape mode. But other than that it's really great.,
Not great as a teacher. I cannot navigate my teacher profile. I have to have courses on my personal to have an account and I cannot access my teacher desk top from app. Forums are unhelpful. Works well for students and is pointless for my usage of the app.,
Amazing. I get all the info I need to freshen up for my first year of college. Trying to get my math skills up to par. Its really helping me find my weaker areas. I can sharpen up my skills for free and learn something new. Highly recommend.,
Very good learning app.Partner contant chapter is amazing for whom who don't like to study. It describes one chapter very nicely. It is amazing 💓💓💓 If one subject is there for answering any question from the respective sirs in next update it will be very good to study,
"It runs smoothly, has an intuitive UI, and allows me to do all the learning I usually do on my computer at home anywhere. I couldn't ask for more.",
The best app on Play store. Various subjects and beautifully designed videos for anyone to understand the concept very quick and easily. Thank You Khan Academy.,
"this is A good app, But can you please add add a Arabic language? I mean Using this app to study for my tests and classes is quite useless because This is a english app And I go to a Arabic speaking school So please?",
"Good idea. Bad execution. Your editor is going crazy sometimes, and I hate the fact that some lessons are videos. Also, starting to code in Python is the worst possible idea",
The app has gone buggy! I can't even open it. I have downloaded the app before and this the first time it's been like this. I tap on the app and it opens a white browser then goes back to my home screen.,
I really like the app. It helps me review and advance read about a certain topic. I just wished there were more choices especially for high school students.,
The videos and pdfs does not even load.. at first time opening the app it did meet my expectations but when I try to play a video it doesnt even load i tried different ones and pdfs but still it failed.. pls fix this..,
Absolutely amazing! I use Khan Academy for teaching my international students to prepare them for the TOEFL exam as well as prepare them for university. Of course I use to learn myself as well :-),
got all the way through the first math course and when I took the course test there were questions that wouldnt allow me to check after I answered. I tried very hard to get some help but apparently you guys dont have any numbers listed emails listed nothing. the severe lack of help for people on here is why i give it 1 star,
The physics and math section is very good- complete with different chapters. However there is no specification over chemistry. Few topics are missing.,
This app is amazing. You can learn just about anything & interact with other people using it and make cool things learning to program. There's a kids version too. Check it out! 😁,
"Absolutely incredible!!!! To date, I've found no better program that's so dedicated to free learning at the highest level.",
Cannot open Grammar in the app. It was working fine but one time I tried opening the grammar section and the app crashed. Now it doesn't even show the grammar section. Not even when I search for it.,
"I absolutely love this app, I'm going through math and chemistry and the teacher is super detailed and I also love their voice. I couldn't recommend this app enough.",
"best app for e-learning,Contents are amazingly Explained so Students Can grasp & Understand easily, Best part is it does'nt charge like other apps Do, Suggestion for khan academy is to add Test like Mcq solving for each chapter topics,Mock tests & Material Preparation for Neet and Aiims, Last but not the least I heartily thank the idea behind providing free e-learning app with Amazing Content for students.",
this App & site is Great but this App doesn't provide the feature of changing space from internal phone storage to external sd card please i humbly request you to add this feature in your next update of this App pleaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.cuz my internal storage is very low i gave this App 5 stars but if it had that feature i would have given it more then 5 stars and despite of that lots of poppulers app as well include this feature for peoples like us in need i will be so Greatfull of you,
Best learning app ever. Be it college or advanced level of study. Way more easier to understand than going to university lectures.,
Amazing app. There are discrete options for each type of studies. It lets you choose subjects of your interest. Great help.,
"i love this app, its easy to use and easy to understand, I've had a 46% improvement in maths,( yay me) but i think this app need to pay more attention to science and computer study like have more exercises and quiz's based on such studies",
"High school teacher used as part of curriculum, best year of math I've taken. Very easy to understand and learn at your own pace. Excellent app for Khan Academy",
"The app and its learning content is awesome, but every time I try to search for Chemistry, the app crashes. Tried troubleshooting, nothing works. WHAT THE HECK?",
Best app with clear learning. Can understand the concepts in depths. Very effective. Can save more time of reading in text. Thank you so much.,
Best app for students looking for a free education. Khan academy had helped me since i discovered it 5 years ago. Their courses on organic chemistry and my sworn enemy: statistics are well explained. I fell in love with this.,
"The best student learning app I have ever seen. It has everything you want to learn for your better understanding. So, I really appreciate this app for learning betterly. Use this and you will Understand, how nice is this...💚 Better than byju's and other apps, if you are looking for a full non-profit learning app👌",
"When I tap on Science section in the main menu, it closes and says khan academy has stopped working. I try this multiple times and I get the same outcomes.",
The UI is very simple and easy to navigate than before and now that it supports Bahasa Indonesia I can recommend this to my families and friends! This excites me to look forward on the next update!,
Wow! This app is lit! There is one problem that I can't minimize the video screen like YouTube! That would be really good if you add that feature!,
"The app was good until it just crashes, i dont know what causes this, but im pretty sure it has something to do with the app itself.. I hope you can fix this ASAP",
"Still the best learning platform , and the best part is it's completely free but I have one issue which remaking some old lectures by Sal, I would love if you could remake them as old is gold stills deserves 5 stars though",
What an amazing application! The amount of information and interactive challenges are brilliant. Thank you for this masterpiece and for allowing people to learn!,
I have problem in watching videos it is just loading and stopping in every seconds it show could not load this video or some other error I think some network issue but my network quality is good it is just stopping and loading for a while please help me in this problem,
Very incredible app for learning and exploring. Such a good interface and experience. And having high quality educational videos.❤️👍,
Khan academy provides a very good atmosphere for students to learn a lot especially during this quarantine.....! It is very useful for people who cannot afford much for their children's education...! I wholeheartedly thank the team for providing this platform for free....!,
"This is a fantastic app to learn anything to children.i was very weak in english. When i installed this app I'm speaking fluently with my friends in english. I'm studied L.K.G to 3rd class in english medium. Due to some family problems I completed 4th,5th,6th,7th,8th in telugu medium. So literally I forgot all my English knowledge in between. After that I realized, now I'm studying 9th standard in english medium school. I think english language is very important to everyone in this generation.",
"Missing option to broadcast video on external screen. Nowadays one wants a ""share to external "" button. This justifies only 3 stars.",
This app is so good but dating in a hard way but in my school the system is very easy so that's why I think the learning system should be changed but other than that the app is really good I recommend it actually I should say that it is learn able so that was all for me but if you are looking for free then don't visit their website because in their website you need to pay but here you don't need to pay,
I think I wouldn't have gone to college if I had known khan academy earlier on. They basically teach virtually every course for free with experienced teachers. It's Nice!!,
"The ONLY thing affecting the upper bound of how effective these classes are is the user's motivation. This is the most well designed approach to classes, ever.",
"it's overall an amazing app, and it's awesome to be able to access so much knowledge for free! however, i do have a slight problem; documents won't load for me and it's making it really hard to learn from my phone.",
"I love the app. It has been very helpful throughout my undergrad college career. The only problem I have is that, all the other test preps are present except the GRE. If this can be added, it would definitely help the rest of us who need to prep for our GRE. Thank you in advance😊",
"Sorry, I love the content but I hate the app navigation. It's so hard to understand, search, and cannot press back to hide the keyboard.",
"Needs work. Formating can be painful, ie. binary all squished and not spaced. Still hits the points though, it is a good refresher.",
Absolutely adore this app. I can't even convey in words how much it has helped me get through crying over math problems on dark nights. It provides so much for free and that's so beautiful. I am so so grateful to the people behind this.,
"The best free educational app in the whole Universe! Genuinely saying it improved my knowledge far better. Only one request to you amazing people, please provide Dark Mode as it will be easy to continue learning.",
everything is best BUT app crashes Everytime i try to open reading section... CANT DO ANY READING.. content is so great but opening browser or laptop for every reading after video doesn't work.. Would give it 5 star after this is FIXED,
"The latest update causes trouble with watching video's. I always get the ""try again"" symbol. the newest version is reacting slower than the older ones",
The app itself is very cool. It just does not have everything. For example: microorganisms( that is what we are studying at school). But I am very happy that I've found this app. So congratulations for the people that created this magnificent app. Just a question: is this app good for studying for test and exams?,
I'm trying to take an allegra 2 course and it won't let me answer the equation in logarithmic form. There aren't the right kinds of characters in the dropbox to answer a question on one of the quizzes,
"I personaly use this app for the succesion of the lessons cuz our education system is bad! Wich helps ne a lot, but alot of times i can't find lessons i'm looking for.",
Now khanacademy is a godsend invention. But the mobile app itself needs work. The activities and tests mostly don't work and some needs a lot of tries to work. It's hard to learn if you can't test yourself,
"I give it a five this app help me in school, before I installed this I use to watch YouTube video to study but when I was watching, I realized that the more educated video's always mark khan academy...and the best and have more reasoning I love this app keep up the good work, and develop this app and make it even more educational and better for all of us.",
"Just love it to bits.... its good learning and it's free ,there are cool quizzes which are definitely fun and it's allll freaking free.... like no money.. all you need is some wifi and its done....",
it is a very good app but.. it is a very good app for sure but the thing is you should also add the syllabus for Indian students pursuing humanities in India. like you only have history mostly related to America. and also you don't have political science syllabus of India. like you provide syllabus of physics and maths for India it should be the same for India.,
"Just can't explain it. I mean, what a wonderful application. You can learn anything about science. Perfect app for a hard core learner and researcher.",
"I wish that all languages are included for big benefit for all users around the world, I appreciate your hard working truly and sharing it for free. but it was my wish to find my language (Arabic) there as option to best understanding for the content. Thank you so much for all your efforts for spreading knowledge.",
I'm 25 years old and all I have to say I'm really sucks in math and this app is superrrrrr helpful for me. step by step I'm using this for taking my asvab test to enlist on the army. So thanks Khan academy for show me things I didn't know. 👍👍😁 the other thing is they have more languages no only English and that's really awesome.,
Free education is always 5 stars. Would only be better if the interactivity and animations in articles and explanations was increased.,
"This app is really nice and is ideally for students. I, as a student practice my skills any time when i am free. This really helped to improve in mathematics. Good app. 😊👍👍 Happy with this app.",
"it's a beautiful app with plenty of content, however can be improved upon. say for example, add icse content, make it available in Asia Pacific region, like China, Philippines, honkong etc.",
AMAZING WEBSITE!! YOU LEARN SO MUCH AND IT IS VERY EASY TO FOLLOW AND UNDERSTAND! I also use it for my kids and they have learn more here then at school. We have been using it for this past year. It helps me to understand what my kids need to know,
"Hello Khan, im from Indonesia. This app is really helpful. With this app, i can understand the lesson easier and better than what my school did. Im so in love with this app, also thank you mr. Sal and teams for helping me to study, you all are a hero. If i could, i would give this app billions stars. Keep going, Khan. Great app",
"Its an amazing app no words about that. But it might be more good and amazing if the discussion were in the topic wise as same as NCERT text books if so students can pick up the doubt of eacn topic and exercise the way as NCERT goes.Any ways it is amazing and I wish to have seperate questions for JEE orNEET preparation classes in this app,how ever its an amazing app",
"I liked it more than any other app and it was the best. But after you have I Guess collaborated with BYJUS (added videos made by one of their teachers), Khan academy has lost it's natural atmosphere and is no different than others.",
"This app is very educational and useful for a student like me. The courses are exciting, the teachers are so dedicated. Learning with this app is very fun. It deserve love from everyone. Awesome app!!!",
Why does the app require access to contacts on the phone when using Google auth? I could not login without allowing the app access to contacts. If i choose Google auth initially I could not change to password-based. password reset link is sent and password reset fails on form submission.,
Good app but It hangs a lot when downloading a bunch videos also on changing region from 1 country to one though after closing and reopening fixes it but please improve downloading setting .,
"I have had khan aca9for a while and it really helps but then I deleted the app and I tried installing it again now, but the problem is I can't get into the app. Once I press on the icon it kicks me out / goes out.",
please add quality settings in each video cause it's changing automatically. It sometimes change to a low equality where in i can no longer read or understand the object in a video (blurred),
This videos are very very very helpful . I am able to gain all the concepts which are thought in this app . I am glad to have such a app which is very useful . I even suggest this app to my friends . Even for them it is helpful . Thank you for providing such a nice and good way of education .,
"My cousin started teaching me coding on this website and I gotta say it's pretty good. I just don't know where to view my projects on the app. There are only 3 tabs at the bottom. There should be a fourth that says profile, and I'm pretty sure I'm logged in.",
"Hello. It's been a great experience so far but, would it be possible to control manually the quality of the video being played? I do not have a strong internet connection most of the time and thus, it takes a lot of time to load a video. Hoping for a response",
The search option should be developed more. The thing we search we donot find it. But after Searching in google. I found it and it took me directly to the app. By why we cannot go searching through the app??,
Been an F and D student since I was 9 years old. Regretted never taking school seriously. This app has helped me go back and learn everything I missed and need refreshing on. Thank you for creating something like this.,
I want to use this app but I CANNOT ADJUST THE CLARITY TO LOWER AT 360P and the vid plays at around 720p and i dont have enough internet data to watch vids at that high quality. Please tell me how to adjust quality in android app version of the website. Im stuck to not using the app till you guys help me out here.,
"A exllent app for learning any subject,any topic, any time, any place and it is absolutely free for all Not to keep any doubt there is no charge for everything Some are poor they can't keep money 💰 for coching for subjects and also for some people coching classes are not available for them it is the best app to study f At this covid-19 situation it is best app to learn any subject related to any profession not only this time any time that to freely Thanks for introducing this app..🙂🙂😘",
It keeps crashing. Please fix this error. I have a stable internet connection but it does not seem to comply with signal stability.,
It's really complete except that it can take more than nine courses and that's really stressful but it's really the best of it's kind so far,
"THE ONLY LEARNING APP WHICH IS EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. I cofess that studying is too boring, but learning is really fun. And that's what khan academy is all about-learning new fatcs. I literally love learning on khan academy it's one of the best learning apps specially for maths. Iv been on khan academy just for 3 months yet I have learnt all of class 11th and 12th cbse maths,this is just becoz khan academy makes every topic extremely simple for one to understand. Really love this app 😍😍.",
"Best app to teach yourself, test your knowledge, and retain what you learned! I'm 29 but I still struggle with math and this app has helped me with basic math to chemistry and now biology. Very thankful for what this app has done for me!",
The best app to understand easy and complex problems. It covers almost everything from science to maths. They are just brilliant,
"Great app! Exactly what I was looking for, much needed refresher of knowledge and great explanation and examples specially for maths, which isn't my strongest subject. Very greatful for the team sharing their knowledge and making this app available",
"If I could rate this zero stars I would. On some of the questions you could get it right, but then it will say it's wrong, then when you look at the explanation it will say the same answer. Worst app/website ever! Would not recommend.",
"The app does not want to open. The screen turns blank (white) and then it exits. I downloaded the app, uninstalled it and downloaded it AGAIN, but there is no change",
"Fantastic App, they teach us how Math is really -really fun and beautiful. Science and others, are easy to understand eventhough we don't have any background on that field Thanks Khan Academy from Indonesia",
"Great. Few bugs, but above all the experience is great. I mean getting to learn all this stuff for free is amazing.",
I am using this app more than 2 years and it really helps me with my lessons! I have finished my high school and even now in university it helps me with my lessons. Thanks to developers! I really appreciate it!,
"Currently the website is not opening on browsers, it's been about 4 days now I keep trying to open it but it kept saying the site is taking too long to open. I have tried it on chrome and opera. Please fix it. I miss the site already",
This app is great! No need to pay for remove disgusting ads (because there's no ads!) or to unlock premium feature. All premium features are free,
"This is one of the best online learning platform. Better than most paid courses you can find online and offline and we're getting it for free. So, thanks to the whole Khan Academy team.",
"In depth videos ❤ but i there is no option for video quality setting, all of us didn't have unlimited data of day, so plz add this feature.",
When I open any course the app doesn't want to open it .the screen turned blank(white) and I am not able to see the content in it.,
Wow offers great learning skills. Best learning app ever. But you guys need to do something about downloading videos. It tells you error when you wanna download a course. Please do something I really need help. Thank you,
"I used to use this app all the time! But recently it's started to get buggy. Now the app doesn't even open anymore, and it just turns my screen white. I'm giving it three stars since the website is amazing :).",
It's an amazing app. It's developed wonderfully and it's content too is wonderful. Just one thing pls do something of the time taken by the app to load. The app takes much time to load. Except this the app is all good.,
"This use to be a great resource years go to brush up on math skills. However, the program has become so glitchy that it is almost impossible to use.",
"Best content. My daughter preferred byju to this app initially. But, after a few sessions with me she lives to study. Kudos to the team.. Parents must sit with the child initially. This helps them to follow the materials better.",
This app sucks. Do not download. All the answers are wrong. NOT EDUCATIONAL. they switch the answers. Not a secure website or app. Doesn't teach you anything. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP. you will be really fustrated with it. It makes me want to die.,
Good content and a no frills interface. I use this app in a addition to home school material for my 7 year old. Could be a bit slicker but for free access and content this is a fantastic tool,
Too many bugs.. I don't get any sound sometimes... I just get the video and the guy would have moved on a lot and I can't learn.. please look into this.,
"Khan Academy brings out my best in various topics in English, Math, and Science. Although we are in a pandemic, learners can continue learning. I now have mastered topics for my Current Grade Level.",
"It's a very good app and very engaging for me, someone who doesn't like studies. It's not just about memorizing whether I highly recommend this app for all who want to study better",
I used khan academy and found it to be a very great app. But I am having some problems on my lenovo TAB 2 A10-70L. Every time I open the app it is crashing I cant use this app on my tab. Please help me fix this.,
"this app is awesome and very helpful. suggestions: can you please make it possible to view offline? just like YouTube,you can download and view later when you don't have an internet connection. that would be very helpful. i want to be able to view the questions and write ups while offline.thank you 💖",
Great App Thanks for helping People. It's good app and free. where others are making money by making education as business. This is good and we support you in all the way. Thanks from all Students,
Well I got only one thing to say it's great app☺️ I'm really happy with this it helps a lot in understanding the concepts . it's helpful especially when we all are quarantined,
When I chose the Calculus 1 course it wasn't showing in the list of courses in the Android App. But the others were being shown in the list.,
"The content till now is good, but while doing the quiz it do not accept correct answers in multiple questions 😡, it shows the answer is incorrect, even if u check the hint the answer matches but still keep on stating incorrect, pls fix this.",
"Khan Academy has really helped out in learning more! And it has also helped me in planning out what to do after High School. Without it, I would still have been in a dilemma. It has also helped me in my academics a lot!",
"Why does it crash when loading before you have a practice quiz? It's irritating, I spend hours going through your videos, I understand very well and eager to test my understanding but it keeps on telling me to 'try again later' so FRUSTRATING 😤",
"The search box needs more customization, so that it can easily relate with what the user is trying to find out, sometimes I can't find videos on khan academy app, so I go to YouTube and there I find the video on khan academy channel.",
i think overall its a good app but entering answers in fractions isnt working. it might work once or twice but then it stop responding.,
Absolutely Amazing app! The tests after the video lectures are so helpful to me. Just keep adding them. It also have board prep lectures and totally free haha!,
"I can't express much on how grateful I am to this app. Complete lessons, completly free. Not even ads. Thank you for all the developers and other people who made this app as it is. Wish I found this sooner.",
Wow Khan academy is my one stop destination for all my classes and doubts Khan academy's videos are simple but fully simplified. I totally recommend this app to anyone and everyone who don't have money By the way I want to request a dark mode feature so that We can study at night and save our battery life,
"Video quality sucks sometimes, even with good internet connection. This app seems to be a wrapper for youtube. That's just my (bad) opinion but I really think that checking Khan Academy on Youtube was way more satisfying.",
Best app 💕 this is the best app for studying and i really love and they explain everything so clearly...💕 And the quiz after every lesson is just helps understand the thing more clearly the videos are just love💕 and also the best part is this app is absolutely FREE and that's amazing thankyou so much khan academy for this amazing app 💕💕✨,
"Very good app. Helped me to clear my concepts and doubts. I hope this app will improve in future with latest innovative contents. This app contains interactive videos and questions,which develops an interest in learning.",
its good but after i edit my course and when i open the app again few of my edited courses were lost so again i edited and thats how i got it back but i do this everytime whenever i login the app so please look after this issue.,
It's a great learning resource rich with information. Only shortcoming is you can't download the content for offline access like edx and cousera.,
I really love KhanAcademy. Its in depths explanations on math topics. But mobile app lacks a lot of feature of a web app. Wish there was a video quality adjustment option.,
"I would be glad if the autoplay feature could be made available for the downloaded videos, it's absence really bugs me in the moment!",
perfect app for learning! they explain nicely and show examples too!! and the best part is that it's free :) surely recommend this!!,
"Khan academy is great, I use it whenever I am confused about a topic, but the videos run in high quality due to which I can't play videos, therefore I request you to please 🥺 give a quality control in you videos.",
"Having no rotating screen option really makes this mobile app experience awful, much less reliable than the web version on PC.",
Sal deserves a medal of honour or a Nobel prize for the work he has put into developing this online academy. Superb teaching base for essential subjects for any age. Everyone should be using this app in their spare time to broaden their knowledge. Thank you.,
first impression of deserving 5 stars still holds up and i highly recommend this amazing app. i cant thank you enough for this EDIT Im still very happy with the app but i continue to get the message that im offline. It also dont register the videos/articles i complete. Reinstall does not help. Will give it the 5stars it deserve when fixed.,
"This is the only best app you need to have to learn science, mathematics and language . No matter how old you are you will definitely find something to learn in this app ... Thank you Khan Academy for this app 🙂 .",
It is very informative. The lessons are very easy to comprehend. There are also transcripts for the videos to understand it better. And it's free! I love it so much.,
Easy to revise since always on the go now. It would be great if some aspects of nanosciences for practical purposes are included,
"Your work is great !! Thank you so much for providing us all such great knowledge ! I just can't imagine what would done if I didn't get this app ! Thank you so much again ! I'm a student now ,but later i'll promise to contribute in free education!!!!❤",
Thanks for Khan Academy for give such a good quality of giving free lesson and course. But sometime force close happen while moving from one to another course. I hope you can fix the issue on the next update. thanks !,
Loved it . First of all the teachers are quite good and the app is just brilliant exercises tests videos are very helpful,
"Best app for learning (emphasis on ""best"")! No ads, no fees, teachers sharing everything they know... it's perfect.",
"its pretty nice being able to have khan academy on my phone, but the search is junk. You can only search for videos, and even then, it only seems to be the regular classes. No doodling in math, no pizzas in a box, etc. Please fix that!!!",
"the only problem i have are the errors.I think the newsest update mad the problem worse. I literally went from being able to do everthing no issues.To now not able to load a single video,quiz,test,or practice.This needs to get fix really quick.Have yall ever thought of adding a asvab section?",
"This app is the best educational app I have ever seen whith it's adaptable pase of learning, congratulations on getting something right,saying your almost there when rong,and point system this app is fun and great for learning.Also unlike the website you can learn offline.",
"Great app, it teaches me a lot. However, the UI seems so light and I cant browse at night because of ""light theme"". I'll give 5 stars if you will put dark mode or dark theme on the app",
"This is a good application for those who need help in studies. However, would like the developers to add the following- 1. We can choose in which quality would we like to download the videos 2. We can download the documents",
"I am able to sign into my account on the computer, but whenever I try to loh in on mobile it says, ""Invalid Password."" I would like Khan Academy to fix this issue right away so instead of waiting to go on the computer I can go on Khan Academy on mobile. I need to keep up with Khan Academy because COVID-19 shut down my school and I need to finish doing my work for 6th grade Math. If you don't fix this bug I would not be able to go on mobile so I woupd have to wait for my turn on the computer.Oof",
"Good app. Only complaint is when I log in, my progress that I made on my laptop doesn't sync with the app, so I have to basically start my LSAT prep from the beginning. Any fixes for this?",
used it for my studies on a windows phone from 2017-2018.it is undoubtedly a toolbox of essential knowledge and even a career saver for me personally. don't know how it is on a android system but I am sure it will be good.,
"This app is the best learning app. I love it. I think sir that you should include the language learning course. As a student I always have problem learning grammar topics related to language subject like hindi, english, marathi.",
"Would love to have access to teacher options on the app. As an educator, being able to assign homework from my phone would be beneficial.",
Please kindly improve your app's clearity it has lots of problem I want to report about subtitles problem and sometimes video was stucked. But i liked the app it has tons of new skills to learn so i loved it,
"Great learning app, good for just brushing up on things to full on courses. Great for both kids and adults.",
"this app is just too good to be underestimated.it gives a straight forward understanding of a subject. it made me love maths again, but i would also enjoy it if it had a geography topic.",
khan academy is fantastic no real complaints. Only giving it 4 stars because the app lacks a few features that the website has and because I'd like to be able to follow my friends for some friendly competition,
I am using Khan academy from 5 years & I still love it. But there is a problem it uses a lot of data & there is no option to decrease quality of the video. So I request Khan Academy team to add this feature.,
Khan Academy helps especially with anything important you missed in class in order to catch up! Khan Academy is also useful in studying advanced math classes in order to get a head start and prepare into higher levels of math. -college student :),
This is the best study app ever. I love how its non-profit. But please can you put another feature in the app where one can be able to download the videos and watch it offline. Best app ever,
"It's a best app for learning and knowing our potential. And the best thing is this that it is free app, so those students who can't afford fees for tution can learn through this app ...... It's the best app I ever tried.... Thank you khan Academy for helping in my exam preparation 😊😊😊",
My experience with this app was astounding. This is a great app if your ever falling behind in studies or need a review of topics great work Khan. Hope to get more amazing results.,
"Khan academy is the best platform for strengthening your concepts thank you khan academy for these wonderful videos ,but in the app I think few videos are missing when compared to the videos uploaded in youtube.",
Terrible app would NOT recommend it makes you completely restart of you get a question wrong and if you get a question wrong you have to completely restart everything quiz and all of your work. You literally have to get everything 100% just to move on,
"Very poor, When I am going in the app again it comes back in my home screen... 😡 Need to improve.. Not happy with it... Thought with everybody's review that it is good but really very bad.. Khan academy please check the problems that increase at all..Not good experience. Need to improve very well. But the YouTube videos are very nice I follow it... But the app is bad.... I thought that YouTube videos are so nicee then the app will be also nice but not at all.. 😡😡 Now I will uninstall it....",
The application provided by genius : what to say about it .The learning and teaching method is marvelous. Each and every thing fitted the learner very well.,
it is the best app i ever used.Best learning app for children of all ages but i have one problum there is not multilanguage. please fix this issue so that everyone should be able to understand at their comfort. overall this app is excellent.,
"The app is pretty good. The only think I don't really like is how it takes you thr website when you click on Programming. I'm assuing this means Programming isn't on the app yet, but its very difficult to type and progress on the website with your phone. Can you please add Progamming in future updates? Other than that the app is great.",
"the best, because it has videos and practice for you - everything is adjusted to your learning - the app is free and offers offline downloading for videos - Sal Khan did everything right with this program.",
It's a really good app to study. It's easy to use and really the assignments are great and video quality is very good.,
Love it. Best educational app . No other app like it and its free too. Clear and indepth videos on almost all the topics you might need.,
"I know this app to be good...the best infact, that I've ever used....but for some reason it doesnt work on this device. Everything loads till i get to the actual work and they tell me there was an error.",
"Good app but I cannot download exercises and topics. Sometimes too, some cases videos fail to play or download for offline use. Please you guys should kindly fix this problem.",
Excillent App help you catch on faster in minutes it gives you exersices to do to see if you nesd help or not its a free app and thats really good. It goes all the way to college it has EVERY thing you need,
"App is perfect except for Bookmarks feature. Downloading lessons cause app to crash, and downloaded content isn't available online. Educational Content:5/5 App UI and UX: 5/5 Bookmarks Downloading Feature: 0/5",
"My course challenge results / summaries are not loading. As a result I cannot get tailored suggestions for tutorials to help with specific weak areas Device Sony Xperia 13312 Android 8.1.0 Khan academy app version 6.10.0 (1382) I have updated the app today,  I then uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it didn't resolve the issue",
"Khan sir, i love you... I just want to say that this app has a fault in downloading bookmarks. When i put it for download its downloading some part and showing download failed when i retry it some time after it pauses and wont download anymore..... Please solve this, i download videos from local railway free internet which is far from my home. Internet is pretty fast but downloading fault is in your app... 😢😢",
Khan is very useless are teacher makes us do it and I do but I am not learning most of the videos are very long and it only talks about one problem. It's like if their being to specific,
"This app makes me legitimately angry. Where was this website when I was in school!? I have learned more math by myself, on my own time, IN ONE DAY, than multiple teachers have completely failed to teach by rote memorization over several years. Suddenly math makes sense and that makes me very angry. Get this app if you want to feel unspeakable rage towards every math teacher you've ever had. Or to learn math in a way that actually works, I dunno I'm still riding the rage atm tbh.",
"So when i first downloaded this app it helped me so much. But i havent used it for a while, now only to see that i have been logged out and all the amazing video and topics are gone!!!!! There is ntn there about anatomy anymore im so hurt. Whatever u did put it back",
"There is no Ads, it's free, simple to Use, amazing interface and the best teachers. This app is my all time favorite and should be App of the year",
It was a very good learning app relative to others but I wish there was a maths and science engineered towards the UK curriculum as it is not exactly the same as the US curriculum.,
Very good app for studies and everything is free. I'm very thankful to Sal and team khan academy for providing good quality free educational videos. It would be helpful if they added language courses as well.,
Very. Helpful App for those studying!! The way of explanation is so good!! And the concepts are explained along with the basics,
I LOVE the offline feature. Unfortunately offline video quality is really really bad. Also image equations in articles don't show up 🧐,
First of all Thank you Khan academy for giving it free . I am using it for almost every purpose . It had helped me a lot during exams and it cleared my doubts. The app is so good for studies and it helps a lot .,
I have logged into the app but I cannot see my dashboard with all my subjects and progress. It is weird. Just shows me the things I care the least about - my energy points and my badges 🙄 Can the development team help?,
Great app I had great experience on it and it is good for sat preparation but I just want more videos of sat mathematics and reading otherwise it absolutely a great app I personally recommend for all the students who preparing for the sat,
My mom Is getting mad at me because I can't get one question right out of 4 questions and it is the Worst app in the world because it doesn't match with my school Were learning about bar graphs and H keep on showing other stuff And the worst thing about it is that sometimes it makes it wrong so in the grammar Chorus In my school There is no such thing as concrete and abstract and that's in grammar so do not install this app this is the worst App in the world😡🤬😠👿😾,
"Overall had a good experience with the algorithm class: it was great, learned quite a bit. Khan Academy is a great app!",
"It's is a very helpful and useful app, although, with the new update, I can't find my learner home to look at my exercise minutes!",
"rating for the app, not the academy coz khan academy will get 10 stars out of 5. needs improvement in performance, speed and stability. needs an environment for coding. needs dark mode also.",
"Best Learning App. You can find everything from your school syllabus to much more extra content. Also Partner Content make it great! Best thing, it's free. But I considered to be a patron! Truly Worthy app.",
Very good.. no complain.. but i would have liked more if more than 9 subjects would have been possible for being selected.. Yet i say this as one of the best education app,
"i would give more starts ,if there was such a option. very helpful app. you can learn almost anything.. I didn't liked math that much during my schooling so i chose life sciences stream . but now i'm preparing for a entrance exam,and there is some basic math in it..thanks to Khan academy..its not a issue for me now...God bless Sal khan.",
"I highly have🔥Great impression on this app. this application is best for Secondary classes. It helped me alot ❤️ Despite of all, it is still helping me and it is my helping hand. Now my Mom doesn't need to take much attention to me😊. Best application Ever!! !!High recommended!!",
Great app! Teaches pretty well! Sometimes in my own opinion they teach better then my own teachers at my school. I just wish they would add languages aswell but other then that pretty good!,
Best ever. Sibtitles. Transcript. Good pronunciation of words by teachers. Easy to use. Enables online viewing. Bookmarking. Tests you. Its the very best education app ive ever used!!!,
"I try to learn Javascript.Guess what,they at first started the lesson with ""ellipse"".. Are you guys kidding me? You should teach chronologically & there is so many wrong chapters. I will never anyone recommend khan academy to learn coding.this is worst coding learning platform.Don't download it..W3school is way better than this.",
"This is just awesome, while people flood the apps with advertisement to earn revenue, this one is with out ads with super quality material. Highly recommended.",
A amazing app awesome app I have seen the videos so amazing I am doing well in exams now . Best app but please fix sound problem there is a problem for sound and all things are awesome. I rated this app 5 so please I request all of the students who are getting less marks please use this app I am telling you amazing . Khan academy I am thankful of you .,
"Amazing. I you want to learn truly then this app is for you! Videos, quizzes, and files! It's so easy to use and it's totally free!",
awesome.! but 2 features i wish it had 1. option to manually choose video quality to limit data usage 2. option for offline downloading of the videos,
"Students are not able to see Individual student report like teachers are able to see the students database like how many skill ups, how many times course challge complted, we (student) only able to see time invested and therd is not feed back option. Please add these things for students.",
"This has been extremely helpful over the years. It's pretty easy to use but, sometimes I have a hard time using the pen function with my tablet pen on my touchscreen.",
Please upload videos of physics and mathematics of class 12 ( India ) in hindi. .You app lectures are very intuitive in nature. I am overblown by the way they teach. I mean to say the way you uploaded videos of physics snd maths in hindi language the sane you can upload for class 12th.,
"I think it is a best learning app and also better than byju's the teachers are highly experienced ,without animation they explain so good I really appreciate it",
Really very much useful to those who just wanna study. And much more than college topics can be learnt without restrictions.,
"I've been using Khan Academy for a long time already, and i still love this app. It really helped me to improve my math skills and review some of my skipped classes, and this is really useful for me. This is the best!",
"This app is the best. But, it seems like Math for Fun and Glory has been removed.. Why? I really loved that, and it imtroduced me to Vi hart and hexaflexagons. I hope you bring it back, but other than that, IT IS AMAZING!",
It is seriously the best app for students to learn anything any day. They have the best teachers available. Everything is made simple and very comprehensible by them.,
"Saved my ass countless times when I wasn't paying attention in class. It's incredible how sal khan is so passionate about educating kids. He makes all these videos and I'm sure it's a strain for him, but he genuinely cares that everyone suceeds. Not too many of these folks out there.",
Thanks guyz.. Hatts off for all your works.. I think from the last update I feel some delay on my khan app It responds slowly even I play the downloaded videos And I request u Plsss give access to the external storage Whenever I download videos it sticks to the internal memory My mobile has only 1.5 gb available space But I have 32 gb SD card 😎😎 And I also have pretty good internet access 1.5 gb per day But the worst thing is I can't use my 32gb SD card and only my internal space😧,
Please explain why you only get 1 chance at a question and if you fail you dont get a second or third chance.Its really stupid because some of the videos don't explain it enough and when you go do the quiz you fail the question once its done no more chances.Make it so we have at least 2 or 3 chances.Edit:I CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT IT SAYS MAKE THE LOWEST TERM I DO AND IT SAYS WRONG AND PUTS SOME RANDOM MIDDLE TERM OR LARGE TERM NUMBER.SO CONFUSED????,
Hi I am an 8 year old kid I use this app and I was on the course challenge of grade 3 and there was a question about bar graphs so I did the question and suddenly it said I was wrong I was really upset so my mom checked the answer I was right and they told me I was wrong so this is why I rate this app a 4 otherwise it has taught me a lot.,
"Judge by yourself! I think Khan Academy is amazing. It provides well structured articles, examples and exercises. The only thing that you must do is be consistent. Thank you Khan Academy!",
"The app itself could use a little work, but the content is exceptional. My son uses it a lot and I really feel like he is learning a ton! Khan Academy is a blessing.",
"We are using this app for teachers in Africa and having parents who have a smart phones use the app at home. If the entire Khan academy is made downloadable for offline use onto a SD card, free world class learning in every child's home. The hunger to learn of poor children is much greater than middle and upper class children whose parents allow them to go online. Age 7-8 optimal age to begin on Khan academy.",
Best free learning app. I have even donated for this for providing free and quality education for years. This app is the best for e-education as it is free and has really good content and teachers.Thank you Khan Academy.,
"In my opinion, this is the best application for learning, with videos that will drive ones passion in the course.",
it is a superb app and it cleared most of my problem related to physics. thanks to the whole team of khan academy. God bless u all. But I want to request u that please think about the sound quality of offline videos,
"THIS IS A GREAT APP!! I've love the way they're teaching. 'pixar in a box' when I saw videos my mind was like....BOOM! I will really suggest this app, those who are curious to learn new thing. :)",
its good of you to provide this sort of quality education for free not only the lectures but also the interactive and makes learning a lot easier,
"You guys have my respect, I used this for basically any academic study I'm in need of. Although the app doesn't require payment, the services offered are so similar to those that require payment. Keep up the Good Work",
"Lovely platform to use the courses. Only issue is that for certain features outside of courses, you're directed to the website",
"Great app,but there are still some bugs found in it Such as the problem of scrolling down the exam pages. And wait a second why don't you guys go ahead making a USMLE-1,2 prep program?? I've long been waiting for that to happen😔",
Excellent app for this period. Have all you need for online learning. The kids are in love with it which because it is friendly and fun to work with.,
"I love this application, it is amazing, but I would like you to introduce more physics, chemistry and biology exercises. Please!!",
"It's a fantastic app to help with your studies. It's got lessons on many subjects, and it's FREE! one of the best apps ever.",
Khan Academy is simply the best. They don't spam your email and gives good quality vedio lectures and that too in an easy to understand and lucid language.,
"I really like the concept of this app. The fact that theres an pandemic rn, but i like this app You learn, get to study, and review. Its like a online Class but its offline and the concept of this app is better I lovr it Keep up the good work",
"Cannot use the number line on my Chromebook keyboard. Everything else works great, but if you can't type in numbers in the boxes, what the point?",
The new app is great but seems like content has been limited. Prior to the update there was the whole body system with physiology and pathophysiology. Will this be added back into the app??,
"This app provides a truly innovative learning style. A real help for those of us that have math trouble, but not for long. Thanks.",
It was a very good app and also very useful.. I use app mainly for studying maths. Bt when I opened the app today it is showing not loading and try again...😓 please fix it as soon as possible 🙏,
Missing programing languages. Only theory. I already know how to program just need other languages. To kahn academy: Thank you for the quick response and acknowledging of me. Many developers just ignore suggestions.,
I am not able to understand that why my videos aren't getting downloaded....otherwise it's a nice app ...having a good content....and it crashes a lot .... try recovering it,
I can't believe that this is free.... Unbelievable courses by experts and super easy to navigate.,
conceptual explanations is what iam impressed by the most. Tutor discouraged root learning and laid imphasis on understanding the working of various problems. Great !,
On preparation for the actual sets of UPCAT and other CETs. I am searching a lot of topics in youtube and the channel Khan Academy keeps popping up especially on Math. You'll help a lot of aspirants that wants to become an academic scholar!,
I really love this app. I started to learn chemistry on this app before I began chemistry at school. It really gave me a headstart and it was so helpful. Now I'm among the best in my country at chemistry Thank you so much😊,
This app is very good and useful for school students as well as competitive students all the videos are 100% free and This app has a very beautiful interface and icons We need to appreciate the developer,
Hii the app 👉📱is awesome but I want you to add( English-Hindi) lecture that means the lecture a teacher should give should use both English-Hindi.it's a request from a student of Khan Academy because i need it very much. Hope you have got my problem.,
"i downloaded this app based on a recommendation but as I'm screening it for my son I'm receiving task errors on everything. Hopefully this issue is resolved soon, this is pretty disappointing.",
"This app is very helpful especially for the students, you can learn anything here, Grammar, Algebra, Arithmetic, Get ready for your next Grade, Reading and many more, this app is online and you watch videos and start answering them. 5 stars!",
Our household loves this app. We home school and use Kahn for different courses. My 7 year old who is in public school also gets on for FUN to practice math! I do wish that my log in for the app gave me the teacher and student dashboards.... Furture adjustments...,
No option to download to sd card. No option to download all courses in one go. No option to participate in more than 3 courses at once. Very limited. NO option to move app to SD Card.,
"Best app😁. Everything is explained starting with basics and then proceeding to advanced level . Test questions are given to check your progress . This app proves ""learning has no limits""",
"hello khan academy. when i download the lecture, some courses are low in file size and some courses are so huge in file size when it contains only few videos even if I set download quality to low. Can you please fix this bug?",
"I was excited when I saw this app, I had been on the desktop version of it and thought it was great. This app not so much. It will take hours just to figure out how it works and I really don't feel like spending my time learning that. BYE!!!",
There is a problem.The app isn't showing all contents that were in SAT Maths section. Only two section;Heart Of Algebra and next one. There aren't all topics available. Please take a look.,
"I love this ap, this is basically what I have been looking for! But I just want to inform you of a glitch. I'm writing the write answers but it's telling me I'm wrong. Place value - tens and ones. I have screenshots.",
This is incredible. Not very high level but the basics are explained concisely and with great examples.,
It is a great app and helps me tremendously with school. The only thing I would add is videos and lessons on the trachtenberg methods.,
"This app is great, in quarantine I was able to learn so much stuff. And it was pretty good too since I could re-watch if i didn't understand. I highly recommend this to everyone.",
"tbh its good for learning but when I was doing one of the units. I was doing this question, 489= 0 hundred+ ? tens+ 9 ones. So i wrote the answer 48, and guess what its answer was wrong. So it took me 30 mins to think wat else can the answer be and it was WRONG. I decided to check the hint and it turns out the answer was 48 but it was 489= 0 hundred+ 48 tens+ ""2"" ones. BRO, its 2 ones why did the question gave me 9 ones 😑. And there was the SAME exact issues with another QUESTION.🤦‍♀️",
It helps a lot I recommend this to anyone who want to learn science because they teach you to understand everything. One of the best online courses ❤️❤️❤️.,
Honestly It is a pretty good app. Right now my board exams are coming and I've been waiting for science chp-4 and chp-5 of class 10 India for like a year to pop out and it didn't work out. So I'm not so happy with the app.,
"Everything is simple and understand, you can even take quizzes and stuff. To top it all of ""it's free""",
"Firstly i am very much happy that this app is free for all to learn from scratch to expert, One of the best learning app , thank you developer for making us to learn in easy way, and this is also useful for revision before exams",
this app is very useful for students as well as teachers. Mr Khan is a good educator . I am giving three stars because there is need of improvement on advanced physics and mathematics.,
"Yo, i love this app, 5 stars. Little problem however, in the algebra 2 playlist under rational functions, it is not allowing me to check answer. Do you have any advice relating to this problem?",
"It helped me alot with math being a remote learner during the pandemic, I highly reccomend this app to help with math and several other subjects.",
I love this app but where's the sound? I'm just wondering where it is. It used to have a little bling blong can you bring back the sounds? I rate 4 and a half stars (if i could to a half XD),
"I love this app. Most of all I like the exam practice and how it is divided into grades so I won't waste my time searching grade ninth book cause I just can get it easily, thankyou so much. Best app! Way to go khan academy!",
"Probably the best app I've ever come across! The team behind it are all heroes, and they should be proud of their efforts. I have tremendous respect for their worthy cause. Thank you for educating this world to become a better place. Kudos to you all behind this app!",
App worked wonderfully. Now the app struggles to load exercises and freezes upon completion of tests. Very unfortunate. Khan academy is a phenomenal resource.,
"I would have given this app 5 stars except that when I'm offline, the home page off the app keeps vibrating so that I can't read what is there clearly. Plz if u fix this u could be the best in the world. Plz ur ardent student is pleading.",
"No option to change the video quality, it would be great if there's a button to do that. Lowering the rating only to grab your attention.",
"I cannot continue the course I am training to on my laptop to the phone. E.g. I am getting the course of Probability and statistics with mastery points etc and I cannot continue on the phone. I cannot even find the course... It should have same structure and ""Continue course "" like coursera udemy etc",
Tons of free and valuable information with clear and applicable analogies and explanations. I would love more physiology and kinesiology based courses!!,
This app is rubbish! It insists that 7.4689 rounded to the nearest tenth is not 7.5 The site should document how the calculator is used since the app does not. Well neither the site or the app provide information. All this and repeated crashes too.,
I love Khan Academy but the app isn't as extensive as the website? I can't view my courses and I just feel like this is a tight space compared to the website which sucks because having it as an app is really helpful,
I am a MBBS student. This earlier version of Khan academy was very useful to many courses. But now I couldn't find as many lessons related to my course. Please fix it.,
"The content is very good and the app is very helpful, But it crashes almost everytime and i have no idea why. I'm using a Galaxy A9, Android v9",
"i have been really stugling in school and i dont really have the resources to get a toutor, i am so unbelivably happy that this app is here! all the other apps you have to pay for, however this one is free and that really helps. i dont think there will ever be a better app",
"No dark mode and the navigation bar theme is overridden (unlike in the screenshots where it's displayed properly...!!!). Utterly inappropriate, this means some goofy dev added extra code to insult their users by overriding their system theme preferences.",
I appreciate your business as it will help many homemakers like me to continue there studies accordingly with the flexible timings as there are lots of chores for them... Quizzes help to sharpen the memory of everyone I will give ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ to the app,
developed a great online educational platform for who cannot afford education from any institute or school. this app has everything what a student want and also the graphics inside of the app is too good & also they provide quality education. Love it ❤️ thanks to Khan academy 🙏🙏,
"Awesome app and great contents. The reason for not giving 5 stars is because it did not had chemistry for class 11(india) for india. But overall i am greatly satisfied of your service, but i hope you would soon add the subject that i mentioned.",
"Some courses are missing from the web, for example Algorithm. But the contents still great as you can expect from Khan Academy.",
Absolutely love the app. Love the learning structure. Since I never took Algebra in school... This is helping me prepare for college and I thank you so much!!!,
I am reviewing for the first time . It's my first day on the app and it works magnificent. It has vast number of subjects to study and is really efficient . I will keep you updated as and when I review again.,
"Thank you very much Khan Academy because content is too good , questions are very interesting and all these are offered for free . I salute your selfless service . Thank you",
It is the bad app...the grades are only upto class 8...it didn't have any useful information...i gave it 2 stars because the content of this app is in english and it is the good app for students of class 1-8 only....for me don't download it,
"Super.. Amazing.. Thanks for producing like this app.... Thank u so much brilliant we can learn all subjects and any science maths, Arts, And others.... Wonderful.... App.... But one thing if there is learning chances in Kannada its wonder i hope you will heed my request to change languages in Kannada and other indian languages... Thank you",
"This app is helpful but what's up with the calculator how you gonna make a app that you watch the lesson plan then when it's time to do the work you only have numbers and a fraction sign when you don't even have a multiplication, Division, Subtraction ect. to put the equation in like.........WHAT!!!!!🖓🤔😒",
"Exceptional, life-changing. So, 10 years ago I downloaded this app. It made me want to quit school, so I did. Now I am a world-class Architect because it taught me Quantum Mechanics. Download it, and you will learn the techniques used by the 10 richest people in the world today.",
"Overall, the app is good and the UI is clean. Try to add Dark Mode feature as it is very helpful for studying at night",
The best learning app for all the student's....the best thing of this app is it has variety of quizes and clears all tje concept in one time....I really love this app,
Maybe I'm unobservant but not being able to turn the sounds in the app off really irritates me and is cutting down my usage.,
It is a very good app if you want to educate yourself. It consists of hundreds of course that too free. I recommend everyone to study from this app. It is the best learning app ever found.,
This is Outstanding platform for students .It teaches things very simple and informative. I have not words to describe how much this app helps me. Thanks Khan Academy 👍👍,
This is an amazing app 👏🏼 👏🏼 the approach to learning is so clear it's almost impossible not to understand.From math to chemistry to biology everything is just amazing let's hope it stays free.,
I am a student of class 11 and I installed this app because I thought it will help me in studying but it doesn't have videos related to Accountancy and Business Studies. I am gonna uninstall. Don't download this app. I suggest you Byjyu's and Topper's learning app.,
Sal has been wonderful! He was my sole professor as I learned both single and multi variable calculus with nothing but textbooks and Khan Academy. I just wish I could ask some questions.,
Amazing app! But users must have a mentor to someone else to help you understand the concepts. Everything else is first class. I am rating it 5 stars because l love it,
"I have used many e-learning apps but this was best among them, and compared to others it runs so smoothly and was a variety of content. Loved it 😊",
"Love the app but the girl's voice is SO annoying... so nasally, ""valley girl""... I can't stand it!! I really wish you would consider a different actor as a voice over .",
"Loads and loads of information and tests, a wide range of topics covered in plenty of deph for beginners to intermediate for all levels. Would highly reccomend for anyone looking to self study any of the topics they cover!",
"The app is helpful but as I open the page icon on the learning journeys, the app closes and shows "" there was some problem with the app"" . Please try to fix this issue",
"This app is easy to use, and it has a lot of great content. I really appreciate being able to learn about new subjects without be bombarded by ads.",
"You can't expect something better than this app . It has a lot of content in maths and science and that too free ! A lot of apps are there which cost money for their courses , but this one is truly amazing.",
Wonderful app and so much help from k-12 and some college courses most definitely be using it for myself and my kids the one that droped out of school can find the help in education he needs to further help him to a GED thanks would like for them to add some vocational trades with certificates of completion of their work and trades 😀,
"This app made learning easy for me. This is very helpful and their study material is fantastic. Their way of teaching is so much good. Thanks, Khan academy.",
"Very good application, I like it and recommend it to other people however I noticed that the algorithms course is not available on the mobile app, please do something about this.",
"I love this app so much, especially the personalized tutoring for standardized testing, my grades have improved even more than I thought possible.",
"Khan Academy has changed my life, I have learned about coding, history, science all from this platform while living in a rural area of Pakistan where there is barely any electricity/4G and development. I'm greatful to the people who continue to operate this platform for humanity's greater good. Guys you don't know how it has changed my life. Keep inspiring, Bless you!",
It's one of the best apps anybody could use for gaining loads of knowledge infact this app helped me a lot in cracking the class 10 boards. I would have given 5 stars if the app had class 11 biology 🙏. BTW : thanks,
"I can't open any articles in the app, when I tap on the article all I see is a blank page and sometimes when I take a unit test at some point of the test I only see a blank page but I can see both the article and the test when I log in from the chrome 😕 please try to solve the problem asap",
Very good app for kids and adults. They break down concepts and make them so easy to understand. I do 20 minutes with my son 4 days a week and he has almost finished grade 3 in Maths although he is only in grade 1. Big shout out to Sal and all the other contributors. Please donate so others can benefit.,
"Zero Stars for application and developers as it crashes all the time when i open it, developers are even not responding to mails, as they are very busy. Beautiful Courses, Worst App...",
I don't know why it doesn't allow me to change unit or to skip lessons? I don't want the video for example because my daughter knows how to multiple but I want the exercises. It is impossible to open them. I do not know why?,
"I would just say that this application is best for me. It has everything in it, all concepts nicely explained. I just love it. I could have given ratings of 10 stars to it because it deserves 10 stars.",
"This is kinda torturing because as soon as you do it for half an hour, it starts to get boring. But it does get fun if you learned it. It is still pretty cool...",
Best education i've ever had plus its fricking free! And also its very cool and i learned math easily unlike my previous school teachers their behaviour is hitler-style which we are just writing and she will go brrrr but this is the best expierence ever i've ever had on education its free and yet its cool learning,
Very nice English accent like the perfect way of teaching and also main thing is that it is freeee!!!😁 Of cost and people can make use of this app andthis was suggested by my math teacher a great gratitude to my teacher,
"Really good information. I have been learning with Khan Academy for a lot of time. Good that they've come up with an app. Thank you so much Sal, David and other mentors on Khan Academy.",
It is the best experience i had the short videos about a particular topic made me save time and i am really glad that they are making this app free i mean there is nothing good beyond that they can do :),
This app is ok 👍 they don't have phonics or english they do have tests and they don't have like science quizzes for like second graders it's just all hard stuff when you try to do science. Because sometimes science isn't hard like you can learn about the clouds and I don't even think they have research on clouds on the app.,
"so far I am loving the app, only question is why no science content?? we are just trying this app out for a few weeks hoping to use this as our base curriculum for homeschholing would live to see more science content for 2nd-6th grade",
"Wow I can't say anything. This is the best app I have ever seen. In mathematics and science lessons I was not good but know, thanks to this app and I improved a lot. I even start being the top student. Thank you very much",
Very good app.I like the way of teaching.Learning with fun.But I was a little upset that I couldn't find the course of python.They gave me Javascript course.But I wanted to learn python programming course.Please give me that.I downloaded that app for that and above all I am a Bangladeshi.You have to do me that favour.,
Sorry! But the chapters are not interesting. Better than this I recommend Byjus. There are interesting chapters based on syllabus and before we start other chapter we get tests. Once we finish our test we can go through other chapter.,
This is best application software for maths I'm in 7 grade and I am in love with maths because the short videos didn't strain my mind that how big concept is this very good outstanding Thanks a bunch Khan academy organization but.. please add landscape mode please please please please!!,
"Great. It offers so many lessons, and is easy to understand. Love everything about this app. Wish they could include IGCSE too.",
"I am so grateful for this app 🙏 covers every subject and i mean EVERYTHING, and the best part is its super easy to understand and follow along ive never had a professor and teacher as good as Sal !",
Great app. I'm planning on attending University but in my mid thirties I've found that I had forgotten a lot of math this app is great for brushing up on a lot of topics.,
"I love it, but.. The first two videos that I downloaded didn't take long (like a few minutes) to download, the others are just taking forever (it has been days, still not done). Sad.",
The best app so far. Every tutorial is just ok but whenever i download contents i've bookmarked i can't read or watch it offline like how i used to. Please do something about this.,
"Easy to understand blackboard videos, and awesome visually really fun and easy to use educational program? Yes please!",
"Great learning experience, indeed, for the basics and fundamentals. Suitable for all.",
"This app is the reason why my grades are over the roof! The Best! The explanation is clear! I Love this app, I totally recommend ths app to other people who are struggling with school! ❤❤❤",
"Great endeavor, but the app is just too buggy. Couldn't take a lesson without force closing the app several times.",
Very nice app that help you to learn at your own pace. Explanation are clear and examples are plenty. Thanks a lot for the great content.,
"Love you SAL, your videos are high quality and aslo consume less data and are literally very very informative.! Love you I just want one thing please provide a separate section for practising whatever we want to by searching it..! Otherwise YOU ARE THE BEST, SAL😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘",
Very good app. Very helpful. Totally free. Its visual classes helped me a lot.,
"though it was a good practice, it was pretty sad that it froze and even when i would keep away for an hour it wouldnt budge. ill try to uninstall and reinstall, but it is kind of annoying",
"I really love this app.This app is a life saver during Quarantine.While the university is closed,I wanted to Self-study the lessons that don't have enough understanding at home.I recommend you to give it a try this app.It includes everything, biology ,chemistry, maths and many others.I gave 5 stars.",
"Just wow for the contents and information, when i was in school and collage if i have a chance to explore to this kind of application i would become the expert in all the subject.",
I tried opening the app a bunch of times and its not opening. I tried to delete some stuff for storage and yet it still does not open for me. Even my phone does not want me to learn ; _ ;,
"Khan academy is well great and the videos are amazing,, the only problem is even though I have a strong internet connection the video always buffers... Guys please take it to the notice,,,,",
"Hello Admin I am very pleased to write a review on this app. They provide such a good education and practice with step by step solution. Many paid apps like byjus, Vedantu, toppr, unacedemy, etc give good education but this free app gives as good as those very expensive paid apps. Please donate to this app if you can.",
"Wonderful app. Education at hand. Thank God for the brilliance, the kindness, the effort and all that was involved in each person who collaborated toward this. The best to you all. Love. Bryan.",
I truly appreciate that you devote your amazing and hard work to helping young and older individuals to enhance their understanding on various subjects. Thank you so much for helping me with the LSAT prep.,
This is awesome app it clears all my doubts and concept and it also takes test so that we may know that we have understood the concept or not.There are energy points and batches which we get according to our marks in the test and make learning more fun.I recommend everyone to download this app,
I never saw such a great educational app before. It's UI design is amazing 😍. It's contents are on next level.,
When trying to do math quizzes it is impossible to input exponents or other mathematical symbols. The experience on mobile browsers is equally infuriating.,
"You are often wrong with answers and confused with explaining reason. This inconsistency isn't education because you discourage desire to study/entertain your material. I've been on the math courses for 3 years, algebra, to complex trigonometry, to multivariable calculus. I learned to get ready to laser you to death more than to do wrong math.",
"Awesome app. Teached me lots and lots of stuff. I recommended it to my friends and teachers too. They are using it. My special, Thanks to Khan Academy Team. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
Amazing app Lots of benifits... I am satisfied with this This would help children who can't take subscription of expensive course I really appreciate teachers who are teaching in this... In an interesting way For me.. It's best⭐,
"I can't log in through the app. You guys have awesome lesson plans, I like you guys a lot and have recommended to others. But for some reason the app doesn't let me log in. 😣",
The app is very helpful to grow learning & better understanding. But please add 8th class science too! There's unavailable.,
"I like the app, but I needed to do missions on it to earn points in my math class.It took about three min to sign in to my account.I still like khan because it can help in many subjects.If you need khan, it best to do it on a laptop instead on mobile.If khan could update the app to its full resourses like on the laptop, I would consider then say to do it on mobile.This app is still a good app to say the least.",
Great app! I wish it had comments section under every lesson. But still wonderful app and courses... I'm extremely glad to be using the future of education in the present.,
"I used this app to study for a math test. Really great app with plenty of videos that not only explain how to solve equations, but the concepts behind it.",
Your app is great but after two days of using it it stopped working none of my courses load anymore because apparently errors occur when trying to load latest content so.. I'm,
Unusable. I forgot my password. Click on forgot password and it keeps redirecting me to the JobThai page. Eventually reset my password from the email sent and takes me to the JobThai page again. Refuses to let me in to the Khan Academy app,
It's just amazing. It helps you learn in such a easy way. And it has so varied subjects. It has helped me learn from economics to a programming g language like STL. Thanks khan academy.,
I really really love this app ....it has all the study materials I need. And every topic explained are very detailed and I could understand them well ... Thank you team !!,
"Its nice but there is one issue thats when I open the app I find my self always logged out and have to re sign in please do help Edit : my issue was helped quickly and now I am satisfied completely, its free no ads its best. Highly recommend 👌.",
Edit: There were a few bugs but they were quickly fixed. Very clear and useful :),
A great app for learning and it's completely free. I appreciate the update which provides subtitles.,
"How this app is free, I don't understand. Thank you so much for all the resources. The lessons are easy to understand. Complex concepts broken down for easy understanding. God bless you for all you do. You deserve a million stars, 5 stars doesn't do justice. Thanks once again",
Khan Academy is an amazing and free to use app that has changed my learning experience in so many ways. I wonder if Khan Academy could give out diplomas/scholarships though.,
All of the videos are great and helpful and the new uptdate is impressive but I can't play the videos that I've downloaded and the app becomes laggy whenever I'm not on wifi,
"This is an incredibly useful app, the courses are clearly explained, easy to use, not to mention the entire thing is free. Great app.",
One of the best educational app and that too free!!! Not like the other Money quenching corporate Ed.app. A small recommendation would be to have a dark mode.,
"Used this in highschool. Have always loved it, Its improving so tht is great. Its a good app and it being free it has quality lessons that you can really learn from! Good job!",
İt's awesome but can you please add a dark mode setting? My eyes are hypersensitive to light and so the white mode makes it harder for me to read as much as i want to.,
"I cannot thank you, Khan Academy, enough because this, and other supplementary resources, are allowing this dirty hippie to bypass the elitist UC higher education system. I will thank you by using this getting from this app what you intended.",
"This is a great app, but because of the new update the app is not working well. There is problem in going through the app and with the bookmarks",
"Myself Mohammed. I'm from Rajasthan,India. It's too awesome, fantastic, mind blowing for us because this is not belong to premium. I use other apps just BYJUS app, Extramarks, Topper app etc,.In those app many charges are applicable But in this no have any charge This app is supperb . This statement I write from use this app okay",
"I love this app and I learn a lot. But I suggest adding a dark mode or dark theme feature. White theme is way too bright for me, and always bothers me while reading.",
It is an interesting and fascinating experience using Khan Academy as my study mate . The app is really doing a great work for the education of kids . Nice initiative for education 👍🏻,
It is very depressing that I have to quit full screen and tap next video When I am in a learning streak it's just mood killer put a next video button on the media player plzz,
I really do wanna use this app.... But I am Not sure if it teaches according to India's CBSE... As it's a crucial time i can't waste my time in covering the topics that aren't even in the syllabus.......please let me know if it does...,
"Why when i search for something on the web i get it, but i search for the same thing on app it shows nothing? It makes the whole app useless... only as a reader for articles found on laptop.",
This app is terrible! In some of the lessons it continusly loads and never stops! Please don't download this. Message to the developer: Even if I update this stupid app it's gonna be terrible.,
I really like Khan academy.i really understand everything.the problem I am facing is the course class 11 chemistry (india) isn't showing as a couse in my courses selector.but when I search it on Google and clicks on the link it shows upon the app.can you please add class 11 chemistry (india) as a course?,
"I just love it, been using khan academy for three years and i cant compare it to any other. Its very easy to use and the videos are well detailed. Thanks so much khan academy.👍",
"The concept and thought alone regardless of content are incredible. It may not allow me the experience I had hoped for once but for someone like myself who's troubles run with every step I make, it's best to learn or at least occupy my time with things I once only talked about. You've made it possible. I hope you enjoyed putting it together for me. Gas money.",
Great app. It is the one spot for studying. It helps to prepare for various competitions too. I love it,
"For a free service to help you prepare for a return to school after years it's great, have not started the NCLEX RN Test prep yet but if as good as the courses I'm sure it will be of help to me.",
"Best app for education, I was searching this type of app and my search ended with this app. And salute to the Khan academy team, for providing it in free of cost, which is unbelievable as nowadays everyone is busy to gain their own profit.",
"If you have another gmail account on the device this app is loaded on, it will not let you log into the student account. You have to completely log off with the non school account. I have this loaded on both my kids android tablets. Is this going to be fixed anytime soon? Talking with the school administrators, it's a known problem.",
"Wonderful app and totally free. İmmerse catalogue of topics, taught by amazing instructors. Anyone out there who uses this app should support them with donations. Thank you for such great app.",
Fantastic content. The only wish that I have is that the videos could be played on the chromecast.,
"If i could have get one more star making it 6-stars rating, i will have done so. Khan accademy is really a best educational app for now. Especially the science and math aspect. Keep it up",
"Although I enjoy the web version of Khan Academy, for some reason I cannot open the app. When I click on the app, it starts the main page and then quits. I would like the support team to tell me possible solution to this.",
"Nice app. Better than everything else A bit of problem in Trig, when u want to press a dot in the test, specifically A, it wont show the options.",
The app serves the purpose. And good learning source as well the teachers. Problem is I don't see the selected courses on app.,
"awesome app completely free, encourages students to get free education all standard courses available.i really cant tell in words just awesome app i will suggest my freinds and relatives also, and teachers explaining outstanding not bored anything i suggest all to download this app or go to its website,keep it up and make more devolpement to reach this app all over india and world 😍😍😁 thanks alot🙏🙏",
Amazing app I use it for my homeschooling. I've always had trouble with math and the app's videos help explain everything perfectly. Highly recommend.,
I am unable to solve anything as I am missing many mathematical symbols from the keypad. The app looks great but isnt functional enough to work on my device.,
The APK is good and the video lecture are awesome but NEET and 12th HSC board point of view there are not many topics in this app. So I please request you to update and those topics which are present in textbooks of HSC and NEET.,
"I usually don't prefer giving reviews to apps.. But honestly, this app is too good.. It's helping me in every possible way.. Thanks a lot for your value addition in our world and making quality education available to all..",
"I like this app but if we could somehow bunch different subject we have interest in together and not have to browse through the gallery again and again, I think it would be much better",
Really helped in the summer so you dont forget all the things you have learned and khan academy puts these thing in the right order to learn so you know which to do first it also has videos so you can visulize the thing you are learning.love to use this app!,
I like this app. But I recommend to provide a separate section for Class 11 and Class 12 Chemistry for better experience as I used to study with this app only.,
"Excellent app! I would give 5 stars just that i wish it was more user friendly, by that i mean like there are available features for me to download the whole subject or at least tick which i want to.. if this is availble i would give 5 stars no doubt! Thanks for making an app! such a convinence",
"Deffinstly worth! For kids and adults. I don't believe my school system worked well for me, so as an adult Im finding tools for learning and this is perfect!",
"Hi khan academy, this apo as being extermely useful to me and since u am home schooled its very really helpful. The majir and only problem is dat i is slow in reacting like when i want to leave a lesson or pause it takes abt a Minute before it responds which is strating to affect my academics because am short tempered and each time it does dat i get so pissed and will find it discouraging to use, the lesson are very nice though but can u pls help fix the problem. Tnxs 😊",
Really good app 👍 in my I was in botten set on all subject now I am on top set .Really helpful app and really appreciate it .In my tests now I get a good score more than 70% most of the time . Recommend this app you should get it and start learning with this app .,
Its a good app but i don't understand some lessons. Teachers don't speak properly and they explain it in a hard way. We need good explanations.,
"I love it! Great explanations, even complex topic are beginner friendly. Love the little exercises.",
"Nothing is loading on the app nor on the computer. Due to the schools being shut down I have to do my finals on this platform and they are due tomorrow and haven't been about to do it because nothing is loading, its been like this for days.",
"great App, I'm from India, but since a few days the khan academy academy India videos are not available, I've tried re-installing but it's still the same, please fix this or tell the reason edit: no help still, please do something before I start hating the app",
"The website is amazing, it's the best place to study for me but the app stopped working entirely. It just loads endlessly, and doesn't let me do anything.",
Khan academy has helped a lot from my academics but I'm having trouble signing into my google account. It won't let me in. Please fix this cause it gets in the way everytime I want to log in with my google account.,
"The home feed doesn't open on my phone, and I dont know why two different app icons appear on my screen after installation? I really need it this time as i want to study Maths!",
It's a very good app.I love the way of teaching.Everything's practical.But I was a little upset because there was no course on python.I have downloaded this app for that reason.They give me Javascript course.Please give me python course.I will be very happy with that.Bangladesh is proud of you.,
It's a very good app. My problem is that I can't see the important cbse board questions anywhere except in the physics section. Please try to resolve this problem.,
"The lack of dark mode makes it extremely difficult to use the app at night, with it's blinding white layout.",
great content but difficult to navigate and often data you need to work from doesn't load so you cant complete the tests.,
I found while surfing and I am really fond of the app. The contributions are so helpful that even a student can easily adopt the subjects of different stream.,
very good and better than most of the other paid educational apps like byjus and toppr. Very In depth and good explaination.. just love it.😍😍😍,
The app is ver good i like it very much It is very helpful for students like me who are struggling with studies Overall it is very helpful app BUT CAN YOU PLEASE ADD URDU LANGUAGE TO THIS APP I WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ME TO LEARN THINGS IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE Please please please.......,
This is the best learning app ever. My child was nervous about CAASPP testing and after she watched khan academy videos and did the exercises she was confident. These videos helped us learn a lot from kindergarten to even 12.,
I really like this app its the best but every time i earn energy points it doesnt display them on my profile and the calculater it seems like it doesn't have other variables like + ÷ etc please fix this app in the next upgrade i just downloaded this app like 3hrs ago and im already seeing disappointments,
It is amazing. It solved all my problems with my courses at school. Is really understandable and sure its free. Thank u guys for every special donation. We Africans also benefit a lot.,
"This is really a fabulous app I definitely dont have words to describe your work Sal. It helped me alot in building my concepts, MCQ's practice and much more. Keep it up and stay blessed.",
"This app doesn't help me at all. None of the videos make sense and I literlly have to look up every single question on google because the videos don't explain anything. Parents please do not download this app for your kids if you are actually wanting them to learn. I am 16 and a ""junior"" supposed to be graduating next year and I just found out that this app doesn't go to anything it doesn't get you a diploma or even help you get to where you need to be in order to get your diploma plz dnt get it",
This app is simply a boon for no. Of learners out there anything will be less to say. One problem I'm facing with my android app on phone is that not able to see the assignments icon. Can you help me with this,
"Dear Khan Academy: Excellent teaching frame. Thank you for standing up with us (parents) in nurturing generations to grow and take on futures. Keep up improving your work. More efforts on developing ELA, please.",
The app doesn't launch on my phone I tried uninstalling reinstalling many time I got so mad I started using the Khan academy through web which is far better than this app. Kindly look into this issue.,
"Tried to use this to get ahead in my classes, but the lessons didn't help at all and the stuff they taught me ended up being completely wrong.",
It would really be nice if I could quit a test and start over without having to waste time going through every. single. problem.,
I have a question how do you change the name of the profile. But the rest are ok. It has different things you can learn but isn't there a Khan Academy for 9 to 12 so I can use it for my child,
"Khan academy is the best educational app on playstore . It's smooth , it gives free access to all learning content , it have better UI than any other educational app .",
"Now it's ok... After I reinstalled the app, it worked fine. Hope you all developers and the team behind the hardwork may bring some more exciting updates in the future. I'll support in every step in the development.👍🏼",
"I'm from Iran, so I just needed some sort of thing to teach the English version of what I have learned in my own country, in order to migrate, and this app came too handy. Thanks, 4everything.",
"I cannot find the class code , If I go to the website I cannot find it and if I try looking for a teachers email to enter the class code or enter any random letters or numbers , it shows class not found. there is no use of keeping the app in my phone , I really hate it.",
"I love this app and I've been using this for almost a year now. However, new update doesn't show ""health and medicine"" course anymore /: please bring it back ):",
Best learning app ever. Hard concepts made easy. But the app is too slow. Please try to fix it.,
"I uninstalled and installed the app multiple time; however, nothing will load. This wasn't a problem until I used it this month. Please fix it.",
"Better than the teachers from my highschool, I'm actually LEARNING from kind teachers that are easy to listen to, that are showing neat shortcuts to problems and seem to love what they're doing. Thank you",
"So I was used to using this app on the internet, I've never downloaded it and it's amazing. But then I wanted to download it and I couldn't open it, It bugs Please find me a solution",
This really helps develope my educationa and know that this will help me get a great career. I hope young minds will really enjoy this mind developing app. keep up the god work Khane Academy. Have fun!,
"Great app, the only issue and the reason why I am giving 4 stars is that none of the quizzes, practices and tests load, instead it says there was an error.",
I hate Khan academy with a passion they do everything half way I would never say anything good about it it is more glitchy than slither.io when it was popular and the server could not keep up I did not use the app but it can't be good when the website is so poorly designed,
Awesome app.. if u are just thinking to download this app... Do not waste a second.. Content presentation is exactly the way you want your teachers to teach you.,
"I learnt so much with this app. It is so much better with the update. But still, a few more tweaks like next video features of youtube is desirable. Thank you Khan Academy.👍💟😁",
"Talking about free education,this app is perfect That's why I'm giving this app a rate of 5star. Good job to all the teams who work so hard on making this app it helps me improve my math skills.",
Wonderful app!!!! I have download about 20 apps in lockdown but all apps have some faults in science. Then I have found it. It's really amazing🤩.,
"I'm loving this app. Nice refresher of grammar. After so many years writing in acronyms, I've lost some ability to write in correct grammar.. this will help!!",
Can you please push an update for a dark mode setting!!! I usually only get time in the night after work to study and the bright screen kills my eyes... Would rate 5 stars after...,
"Wonderful! Spent some time fretting about how I was going to get back into college after several years of not being in school, and this seems like a great way to ease back in. Thanks for all you're doing for those who need it!",
This app is amazing. I've been using it forever since im homeschooled you can even take classes that you just want to learn about like coding. its great.,
Yes it is very good app for free education but when I am watching some particular videos app is stopping by itself and test should be conducted in physics and chemistry also for our JEE MAINS.,
Great app. It clear all my doubt. Teacher explain every topic in detail. The video lectures help me to understand all topic. Practice question after every topic help for better understanding.,
"2 stars for this app not for khan academy. Khan academy has a great platform for online learning, i use it to teach my kids. This app might be good but not of my use. It is not offering your students.",
"Hey this app is amazing , much good content , download are available too, and the exercise and it's note are complete in itself ,just pls can you make option for download in hd quality ?? Pls it will be helpful",
"UPDATE: Thank you for your response, appreciate it! Unfortunately many have done this suggestion and it is heavily fought for still to this day. Again I say - A dark mode would be nice! The app is very bright 🌞 A dark mode would be nice",
"Needless to say that content is awesome. But, it's completely free. That thing made be happy that how can one spend so much money and effort to provide free education to needy people. I appreciate it.",
"No word can describe how grateful I am , it's the best app I ve ever used , it teaches us everything in general with many exercises and tests , I don't know why we go to school when we have khan academy , such a good app !",
Thank You. Sal Khan and All Team Khan Academy And Specially Thank You Mahesh Shenoy Sir for teaching Physics and Biology In Very Interesting Way. This App really gives you the correct reason to learn and study. Must Try For Class 9th And 10th,
"Guys, I rarely rate any app but really khan academy is AWESOME... it explains simply with examples and all the important materials are available and for free, both videos and pdfs are very beneficial. Thank you for this great academy",
"Every feature in the App is impeccable! Well one thing should be added, there should be a search bar in the bookmarks Section.",
This app is good for students whose parents can not afford the quality teaching as another apps. My parents can not afford me such kind of online teaching. Khan academy the online teaching is 100% free. All app shows that they are free but Khan academy has proved that .,
I love this app completely!! What I miss and hate about this app is that it's not like the website with the avatar creating feature to encourage the child to keep learning to make their character awesome. Otherwise I give this 5 stars.,
"An amazing app, but can you please make it so that the comp programming courses is also available within the app rather than redirecting us to the site? The site is quite laggy for me",
"cannot see app buttons when using on a tablet (galaxy tab s6), on a phone i can see settings like downloads etc. please fix as otherwise it's a great app",
I think this app is great for people to understand the concepts step by step. It has very good clear explanation and makes me understand the concept correctly.,
Following Khan since my engineering days. I'm a teacher now and this app has helped me understand concepts deeper and teach better with real life examples.. Thank you all for such an amazing work.,
I am using this app for last 1year still it is free to use no payments for study i really like the way they teach and question are asked it is very helpful for me to improve my skills now i am improved in my maths skillsbecause of this app and i am interested in maths thanks for giving a wonderful app,
worst app. i searched scatter diagram and correlation concept. it did not showed related videos. later i searched 5-6concepts. it didnt showed even one concept related video. why people gave editor choice app i cant understand. so i writing this review before uninstalling. bye bye khan academy.,
As a learning kid... This app is incredibly useful and easy to use . Words can't describe this app. Everything's cool about this app. It's wonderful and amazing . It made me learn new things that I've never thought about .,

Hats off to Khan Academy .Not at all impressed with the Grammar section .Check the Noun module yourself . Did anyone get the Penguine concept . I have a better module that covers the whole of English Grammar just in 15 hours .,
Clear video lectures followed by practice exercises. I always hated math but this actually makes it fun! App is running perfectly 👌,
"It's an excellent learning experience with Khan Academy. But You should add more to the computing like computer programming, which is available in the website but not in the app, kindly update it. THANKS",

This app is really useful and amazing. It made me fall in love with concepts with I used to hate. And the questions made me more prefect in the concepts.,
It's the best educational app I have ever seen. It clear my doubts in concepts as well as it takes my test on based on concept.,
It's missing a lot of content from the web site. Merely tapping on a link can crash it.,

"Very good learning app quality and free I would like to suggest adding a filipino version even though we are more used to reading in English, I think it would reach more filipino children if you add subtitles (or even better dubs)",
"Love the app, the only thing it's missing is a few subjects that I'd love to see on here. You should definitely consider adding Mycology, Pharmacology, and Toxicology to the list of subjects offered.",
"I am in class 11(india), and most of the time the indian playlist is not being shown, neither for physics nor maths. The app is forcing me to go to the website!",
You just do not realize fully how helpful Khan Academy exactly is until you can use its educational script to augment your reading! Sal Khan who spearheaded this non-profit venture is transforming the outlook of staunch educational attainment with his team. Thank you so much Khan Academy!,
This app is a life saver it is so easy to use the content is very healpful and interesting and the best of all its free whitch is very rare for a app of this quality. I couldn't recommend this app enough its just so good.,

App is awesome but it takes almost 1 minute to start. Also add vocabulary courses in English.,

It was a really pleasant experience using it.. I never thought that it would bring a so good quality study material and that too for free..kudos the team behind Khan academy...,
the app is good but the one thing I was searching for was not on there. it's not learn anything. it's learn easy things you should already know or just need to brush up on common sense,
This app is absolutely great!!! I've missed many concepts when I was in school and this app teaches the concept that I've missed. Wonderful app for learning.,
"It keeps crashing please fix it, all i see is a white screen and it keeps going back at my homescreen(sorry at my grammar), i really want to try the app so please please fix it, Thank You😊 Edit: I Don't even have an khan academy account yet",
Whenever I am using this app with my cellular network it doesn't show content of class 11and 12 India but it works perfectly fine with WiFi connection. Please resolve this problem,

Khan Academy has helped me through highschool and now going into college. I will be donating and if you can as well I highly encourage it. This is such a great resource for children and I'm grateful my teacher showed it to me,
love this app. It helps me remember and practice forgotten work and provides helpful tutorials so I can learn more going forward or just decode what the professor said. All for free!,
"Not as good as the desktop version, (mostly because of mobile limitations which explains my 4 star rating) but otherwise great app for someone who's eager to learn. Also no adds at all",
"i dont know why but it is so slow opening this app, it opens but no content can be seen. i hope this gets fixed because I really like your app.",
I love the app but only thing I hate it does not have a ACT practice Test or a AP admission practice test for college and it does not allow you to restart the test when you get it wrong pls add the ACT practice Test and the AP test for college thanks and make a tutor for adults as well because they it is only for 13 years old,
App loads slow. Cannot change video quality. Sudden video and audio quality drop makes it hard to understand classes.,
"Very helpful app, thank you very much! hope you will make more and develop the app learning strategies. I really really love it!",
I had a really great experience. It helps greatly with all of the subjects specially the one I have studied MICROFINANCE.,

"It's just under rated! This app is beating all the other platforms on this criteria, bt it's underrated, and it's all free, I would love to give it 5 starts",
Perfectly good. No ads and it's completely free. The teachings there are exceptional and I love it.,
"The app automatically logs me on as learner, unlike the website. I am the parent and I want to be able to monitor my childs activity remotely and I can't.",

Please fix this!!! :( But other than that, I think this is a great app and I totally recomend it! :) <3",
"If you want to learn. then you came to the right place. Free, precise, and informative. Did I say it was free? Which it is by the way. Been learning math of this website and got an A in math. :)",

I really love the app my daughter is happy to use it she lives animals but there's not many animals categories and she keeps reading the same one over and over again I would love if you could add more animals,
I really appreciate your work. I do t know why you would just do this for free and teach million of kids. It would be more nice to add some more topics in there because you dont have all sort of topics. But still I love it.,
This is the real deal. It really helped me with my subjects and provides examples that are fair enough to challenge my knowledge and understanding. So as a student I recommend this app❤,
It didn't have the lessons I was already taking and the mission I was already on really acceptable to me. I was expecting more convenience from the app.,

"I really love the content but I can't find any setting for changing video quality, I have limited data for a day, so is there any feature to change video quality in app?",
"Was going well for brushing up on math until I got to using order of operations.. instead of adding before subtracting, it wants you to subtract first which is NOT order of operations. So the ""correct"" answers are actually wrong. Now I dont trust this app for any subject.",
This is a great app for adults as well who have been out of high school for a few years and wanting to recap for further studies/prepare for uni.,
"Khan academy is an amazing app for learning, wether that be for the SAT or just Algebra 1, this app has got it all! Mr.Khan also teaches in a nice way and I can learn quickly from him.",

"Good app helped a lot,but the problem was that this app offers hindi videos for class 10 only for physics . I hope that the app will offer Hindi video on rest of subjects also",
Everything is great.. I love everything about the Khan Academy.. But please can we have a dark mode in the next iteration of this wonderful app,
This app is so good! I enjoy myself watching video from Khan Academy because education is made sample and easy. I want to say a big thank you to the Khan Academy family for such a great and unique opportunity given to us students all around the world.,

I just became a fan to khan academy .. I fed up with the remaining apps which asks us to enroll after watching few vedios in it orelse it won't allow us watch it for free.Now I can revise my classes without spending a single penny of mine. Thank you 😊,
The developers and anyone who complied the content within this app have done an incredible service to those who needed a no preasure way to resharpen the skills needed to expand ones educational life. Thank you very much.,

To Mr Sal Khan I love khan academy i have been using it for 5 months now and i love to say my past few months on khan academy were great; ●Nice and Straight to the point videos ●Summarized tests and many more I can't list. In fact I think this app is too good but just one suggestion i will really like mr sal to make a worldwide quiz competition or something related and the end result being either a scholarship or academic funding in one form or the other Thanks. From @michaelogidi13 on khanapp,
I really love this!!! The way the educator explains and illustrates the ideas and concepts is truly awesome. Thanks for making such contents!!!,

An entire school curriculum in one app with very in-depth videos by a natural educator. All for free. Any hate this app gets are from trolls and should be ignored.,
"I would like to have the discussion section in the app itself because there's a lot of times that I don't fully understand a concept, it's most likely asked by another person and answered again by a different person.",
"Oh man ! You people are one of the best who are playing a lead role in my life. You made me open to do many courses ! The best thing is , you hve made this academy completely FREE ! I have been learning so many new things and being a lover of Maths and Science , you help me focus on my dreams . You the best person !",
Have used Khan Academy's website for years and their app is even better. Khan Academy got me through Calc in university and helped me discover my love for math! 100% reccomend for anyone looking to truly understand a topic.,
i just downloaded the game and was happy about it when i saw maths as there was from 5th to 8 th ..... so i learnt some topics in the 7th in maths which was nice . but in science and other subject there were no 5th to 8th std syllabus so i am not happy with this.,
It is a mindblowing app it just have everything I need to practice for my final and all the resources are so usefull and have cleared much of my doubts. It just have everything I need.,

This app. Oh this app. It's saved me time and time again from the incompetence of my professors and continues to do so. Love it to bits.,

There's lots of bugs whenever I try to download from bookmark or set it to auto download. Please fix this issue.,

This is the best education app on the planet. This app helps student learn classes such as Algebra and even prepares students for AP exams and SAT. Oh and the app is free.,
This app is very useful to understand the concepts in a easier way and it is also absolutely free app. So it is very much recommendable.,
It is a very great app and it make learning easier but recently I can't get any course to load and its heartbreaking. Can u please do something about it. Tks,
"I would give it 4 stars because its amazing yet there are some topics which are unavailable, please I'm begging you to update it as we are preparing for competitive exams. Thank you",
"The content is really good and thankyou khan academy for that but i request you to please add up courses particularly for iit/jee and medical aspirants of India, so that everyone can prepare for these examinations without paying hefty fees to the coaching centres here .",
The maths topics are not all covered. I was looking for videos on conic sections . There are only a few videos . In Jee there are a lot of other detailed topics which are not there .,
Awesome lectures... I was so confused with moment of inertia but a single lecture of khan academy on moments cleared my concept.. Explained biology very well....👍👍 Thanku for such a great app...,
I used it for my math grades in school and it moved my grade up more in math. I think this app shopuld get a 4/5 because when I do the work it sometimes dosent show.,
This is a great app there are so many courses on here that you can learn even though I'm 43 years old I still enjoy this app very good job I can't wait to see more updates in the future.,

very useful. But it would be my suggestion to include detailed Engineering courses and lectures.,
"it's a nice app, although you can't learn without good internet connection. Khan, please try to make the videos available for offline downloads",
"It's too good app for learning.it have present more learning material that makes us easy to understand topics,I thought you might be interested please download to make your future secure.",
"This app is a good app.It is good for childrens and kids.This is educational app.In this app we will learn all things like Math,Biology,Grammar and many other things.

"A great app! but I am unable to access the ""articles"" (the docs in the article format) would be even better if that gets fixed",
"I found this app extremely useful, plus the way Sal explains stuff is fabulous. I also like their motto of providing free and quality education to everyone anywhere.👍😃",
I PROMISE THAT IN THE FUTURE I WILL DONATE A FORTUNE TO THIS APP. IT HELPED ME A LOT AND ACTUALLY MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE IT IS SO ORGANIZED. IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE A SIN TO NOT STUDY IF THEY PROVIDE INFOS AND PRACTICE QUESTIONS ALL IN ONE. I'M TAKING UP EXAMS SOON AND THIS APP IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.,
Literally khan saved the future of my educative and productive life and made me learn everything that my school didn't teach that too all for free. But it doesn't contain videos of higher classes in India so I would like to give 4 stars to it,
This is a very amazing app. My all doubts get cleared after seeing the videos and the content is also very useful.In my opinion I would suggest everybody to use this app,
Outstanding. You are doing a great job.Now you are making vedios for India.Thanks a lot. Your outstanding vedios are actually helping thousands of poor people who cannot afford high priced coaching institutes. Sir(salmon Khan) you are teaching very well.You are better than all teachers I know in India.I am taking example of trigonometry. Most teachers teach us degree and radian conversion without even telling what is a radian.But you told the origin of degree system and then the meaning of radian,
"Wonderful app, the only issue is when using an sPen to write, the touch should be disabled to avoid randomly drawing lines.",
Got it for the kids. Going through the math classes myself to teach by example. I'm really surprised about how much I have forgotten!,
"I think Khan Academy is a very useful app, and the most important thing, it's free!!😃 For me,this is the world's no.1 learning aap that's free💞",
"5 out of 5 not just the app but the whole organization, all these quality courses for free is just the best thing for students, thank you very much",
"This is the greatest gift the modern age of technology could give us. Quality education for free, right here on your phone. This is a great way to refresh your memory or keep your mind tuned.",
"The initial and original app was fantastic and set the standard for free exceptional education, which is what we should all demand globally if we're going to survive.",
I really love this app it really does help me when I get stuck on a problem because all I have to do when I get stuck on a problem is get on Khan Academy thank you people who works for the company you people/guys/and girl's are the best of all.,
I like this app. I've been going through the maths. The app forces me to get 100% on the tests before I can get the maximum score which is making me get better.,
"This app is one of the most worst study app . Whenever i try to search something it shows that ""try something else"" am i an idiot that what i want to learn is not coming and instead of that you are telling that try something else, error and all those excuses. Come on if you are giving an assurance to the students then be on your words . I have rated it with a star because my frnd suggested me this app but you guys don't deserve any stars . Uninstalling it right now",
"Khan academy is currently the best app compared to I ready, and even without the comparison it's still the best!! I would definitely donate to this app if my mom let's me! ( I'm in 6th grade lol)",
Thank you all who put their efforts! I have never expected such an application like this. It is completely free. We are able to learn many things and improve ourselves. I am excited to tell my relatives and friends!,
Thanks for your wonderful educational lectures. but still need more math/ science lectures in Hindi with 3d/animated videos. Hope for best of it.,
"Just sometimes it needs to load a bit, but I certainly love it, thanks a lot. Can you add the choice of searching a topic eg atom structure within a subject eg chem though ;)",
"The professionals at Khan helped rapidly & so professionally when we encountered an issue. I feel confident my child is getting a quality education here, and it is definitely worth checking out.",
"Really good app, really helpful If i can give more than 5 stars i would have given It and the fact that every thing is free(unlike other education app) is amazing i wish you guys grow more and become more widely available Ameen",
"Very nice app with all features that you would ask for an educational app . Lot better than Byjus , Toppr ,. Vedantu and all the stuff like that.",
"This app is exceptionally good, but I'm giving it 4 star because it doesn't download the text files that comes along within the topic, it just downloads the video",
I think the app is amazing bcoz of the way they teach and the content you all provide but there should be a 100 or 80 marks mock tech after evey lesson or 25 marks mork test after each topic. This will really help us to have our own's analysis and will let us know where we stand Or there can be a separate section for mock test of all the chapter you teach,
"After updating , videos are not at all opening . It's a nice app . But I am bit unsatisfied with this . Plz fix it . I want to continue soon. Plz take it seriously. Thanks.",
"Please do introduce quality control button as that will increase the engagement time for people who are short on data packs .... Coming to the experience, it has been outstanding .... A big Thanks to Khan Academy",
This app is fantastic it helps even when a child is in year 6 for gcse students this app is fabulous Make more of these educational apps so they can help students achieve and get top grades Thank you!,
This app is very helpful for me. I was once struggling to keep up with my studying in algebra and this app really helps me to improve.,
Only khan Academy gives 100% good quality content with test series and it is totally free. Thank you khan Academy. I am fortunate to be a part of this academy.🙂,
This learning platform is VERY good. I've been using it since January 2020 and I have learned a TON of knowledge. I have found out that there is almost any subject to learn here. I am a big fan of this!🙂,
One of the best app that I highly recommend you to use... Because it is having good content lessons and taught by professional teachers and absolutely for free....,
Really this is the most influential app in my academics. I have got the highest result in university entrance exam in my country Thank you very much. This is the best app I have ever seen,
"I am 12 years old, and this amazing app let me finish quantum physics, topology,calculus and python... I suggest for every one who loves learning to install this great app !!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀",
This app is awesome. But could have been better if it is not used with internet connection as many people can't afford to subscribe regularly for it.,
I was amazed when I started using this iapplication. This app has really help to understand stand difficult topic I couldn't study. Thanks a lot for such a great invention😊,
i am a prek assistant teacher and i have decided to take my certification exam to become a certified teacher. i was afraid to even start studying for it because i have test anxiety and dyscalculus and the test covers up to 6th grade math. I havent taken a math class in like 6 years so i felt i was in some trouble if i didnt get a good study habit. once i found Khan Academy i no longer feel anxiety about the exam and my confidence level is rising!!! i will let you know how it comes out!,
"Just got it an hour ago, downloaded it for schoolwork and assignments, and I can't find them or my teacher anywhere! I have logged in with my school account and every thing adds up. Apart from the app going haywire, any way to fix this KA? If so let me know, thanks.",
Free and great educational tool by a non profit organization! Also works through a browser on your computer incase you want to utilize a larger screen. <3,
"I love how you can take tests because I was struggling, but with this I feel slightly more confident in maths and I know what I need to improve on. The best thing, is that is it freeee.",

On the Khan Academy website below every videos and articles there is a section where learners can ask and answer questions but this feature is not avaliable on the app. Please add this feature 🙏,
"I tried to find Psychology as a separate subject but it was under the Health and Medicine topic, I hope it can be separated like Math and Science.",
I love this app. It has helped me with my GED studies. It has helped my high school aged daughter with her math and my kindergarten aged son with his math! Great App!,
"I'm a teacher and sometimes I don't have time to use my computer. I hope soon the app can assign homework and activities from it, this will be awesome. 👍",
"Very good app for study a subject in details and gave many types of practical problems to solve in a single subject . Hi, I am Abhishek of class 11th and I study a lot of things from this wonderful app",
It's okay but the teachers are not at all clear. They start a topic not from the basics or beginning but from the main or the most difficult part and they drag only unimportant stuff.,
"Dear KHAN ACADEMY Team, I'm a aspirant of JEE mains/JEE advanced. I request you to avail courses of JEE. I also request you to avail the science (Chemistry & Biology) & English Language (literature & grammar) courses for class-9 and other classes. It will be very useful if you add video quality & speed options. Thankyou",
"So great, I donated $ twice already! I wish I had Kahn in the 1980s. This service is much more engaging and fun. Good bless Kahn Academy",
I don't even use the app because I prefer to use the mobile website but you guys are amazing though. I've learned far more from Khanacademy than all my teachers ever taught me.,
"I think khan academy is one of the best learning app i have ever seen. It encourage those students who could not get a proper education by giving them the quality education. khan academy is doing welfare of students by teaching them free of cost. teachers are also good in their fields. well,i like most the ""maths for fun and glory"" section of mathematics.this section expain the purity of maths and its applications. Overall , i like to say it is a very nice app . keep going khan academy.",
It's really helpful it helps my child learn from videos and her dad always says she doesn't need school she needs this and she definitely does go to school buuuut she's home schooled and does this every evening.,
I really want to appreciate this app because this is something doing really grateful and most importantly it's free because many children can't afford those highly paid courses so they can get help from here ..All the best ahead,
"It's awsome @Sal Khan, it really helped me with a test for a magnet school, thanks! But error in the description, I don't think Google has been supported out of earth XD!",
It's like going to school online since you can access this app at anytime and you can take any couse in your own pace. It is a really cool app to have.,
It's is one of the finest app for the learner's.and it has entirely learner's centred content that is really remarkable and engaging.thanks a lot @khan academy and I want to join your for this beautiful journey ahead ...,
"This is the first time, I'm writing a review for an application on play store. Usually I have more and more fascinations for something from an application when I download anything. Today, it's my pleasure to rate this application and team khan academy √1000/√100 as the world's best resource which is available for free to learn something new everyday. I was worried how I'll prepare for My SAT and AP Exams but now after this app, I'm glad to have Khan Academy's presence. Thanks Salman Khan Sir",
it is really helpful for studies... the first app that I would recommend u is khan academy... I really started scoring good in physics... your concepts will get cleared n it helps for maths too...,
Nice app. But it does not you for your class. And all classes' videos are at the same place. No segregation of classes.,
Disappointing.. unless your child is a competent reader at 5/6 its quite pointless doing maths for example..and the calculator is upside down..where are calculators upside down? The dumbing down of our children continues..if this is the best they have to offer I'll stick to homeschooling old skool..no Prussian system indoctrination for mine thanks.,
This app is lovely I am only rating it four stars because it doesn't give science to elementary schools and it doesn't support year 6 sats apart from that the app is easy to use and it's absolutely wonderful,
There is a small bug or error in the test exercises. They are not opening. Please look onto it. The rest is best..,
"An amazing App it allows students to work on classwork at their own pace, it also allows teachers to monitor their work without students feeling self consciousness as to what others think!",
"Idea itself is good, content is good. But this app is God awful just terrible. They put no effort in the design of the app, use the browser version instead",
best app to learn.. totally free and I'm so happy. How easily I can understand concepts of Physics on khan academy. Amazing. You must try it instead of paid apps. Thanks Khan Academy for giving us free education ❤️,
The offline progression must be taken into account to allow its use with an intermittent internet connection. Allow offline testing as well.,
It is a great supplement to my college courses. I wish it had Chromecast support.,
"I can't express in words how much I love this app, and Khan Academy. I wish Khan academy all the best on their way and hope they get full support of everyone.",
Wonderful app and its most helpful 👍 But please add jee preparations as people like me who want to study but can't afford coaching it was really useful I got good mark's in 20th due to your app . If there will option of giving 100 stars I could have given ... May God bless you for this kinda work ❤️❤️❤️ but please add JEE IIT preparations ...,
Some understanding. Some not understanding. The teacher is very fast in speaking. We can't understand without subtitles,
Thank you sal sir for such a gift to us. Your app teach and explains every concept of science so easily. Never found a better app for free than this. Waiting for a neet course.,
Excellent app. Perfect for learning and all this for free!!! But I can't find Political Science (Theory). I want to learn Political Theory from this app. Plzz add it,
Best learning app ever found.👍👍🤟 Please make Khan academy available on Microsoft Store so that I can use the app on my laptop. Which would be more convenient 🙂. As I find the app most fabulous app for learning 😺,
"Really,very good app and the mosr positive about this is that it is totally free.But chemistry section needed to be expanded as there are no classes of chemistry for class 11 and 12.",
This is really a perfect application for everyone and also for those who think that they are lack of knowledge! The best thing is that this application provides free educational service! Thanks to C.E.O Salman khan and team 🙂,
"The app is a very nice app, I am very sure you will also like it just give it a try before you talk,you can learn all the subject you want,if you need a reading or learning app this is it for you",
I would have rated it 5★ but the problem that i have is that many of the topic which i search for ain't there for eg: in organic chemistry.. I respect this app and am inspired by their free flow of information but many topics ain't there..,
"Absolutely fell in love with this app , my heartful thanks to all who make it possible to bring world class lectures at free of cost . Thanks again !",
"I wish I could give this app no stars. Why aren't there any language courses available? I took language courses when I was in secondary school and high school. If this were actually covering general school studies, where are they?",
"This app should work well, I expected it to, but often times it just doesn't load, quite frustrating whem I keep getting in trouble over not doing it.",
"Wish there was an option to add more than one child to the list so both can be learn under one profile.also, would be lovely if you could check off the progress?(just a 🤔)",
Well it helps you learn. And you can also download the Khan academy kids app for kids 2-7. I definitely recommend this app to learners.,
"Now that COVID-19 greatly changed our way of living; it also changed the education system in my country (Philippines). Thanks to this app, it made my lessons easier!",
This is the best app I have ever seen . But whenever I try to download a pdf or want to watch any other video they always show me retry option.,
The app is very good but only has one drawback that's no subjective type questions and by doing 4 or 7 questions u can't understand a fullchapter atleast 20 to 30 questions should be there that s why I am giving it 4 stars and by the way app is very good 👍💯☺️🙏 good work.keep it up,
I hate math and this app. Khan academy should atleast give you a second chance if you get a question wrong like tenmarks. They should also add fun activities like tenmarks. Really I would leave a way better review for tenmarks. This app is horrible and frustrating. This makes me hate math even more. I hope khan academy will read this and make this app better. If not I'm leaving a worse review.,
It's good but when my child gets it wrong he sometimes can't pick the correct answer and so he has to pick the other answer that isn't right to pick the right answer,
"I am going to be starting school in August for my AAS and I am so nervous because math is NOT my strong suit. In my opinion, I suck lol but this app has helped me SO SO much, I am so grateful it's an option. I've been going through everything even if I already know it just because I dropped out of school when I was 14 and haven't been to school since other then getting my GED. This is a life saver!!",
Very informative. Especially Mathematics. I am in class 7 yet I am able to solve many higher grade problems. I can also do precalculus too because of Khan Academy. Thank you so much Sal Khan Sir and his team. You have made Mathematics my life.,
Best learning app I have ever used. Got all the doubts cleared in a single shot. Expecting it to be more more and much better.,
"Khan Academy is simply the best learning platform for students, and it's free. Even better than websites that are paid for. Keep up the good work guys.",
"It's just an amazing app Contains videos to help you out, and it contains relevant information in almost all fields of studies from math to science to helping you with test preps It's jxt amazing",
i just want to say this app has helped me so much. and btw if people dont like the app if its to buggy for them go to your browser and use it that way thats what i did. but khan academy helped me review everything i ever learned in school for math. i passed my tasc test thank you so much. now i can still use it for college to review,
"I love the app! I have been already using it when this pandemic wasn't here, but now I am using it all the time, especially on the weekend. I kind of wish it helped me understand the why of the question but overall, it is a wonderdul app.",
My friend just told me to install it because for her its helpful since we are starting our online classes but the problem in here is that after I installed the app I cant open it. Even if I uninstalled and installed it again. :(,
"great way to learn, especially math. make sure you format your answers, as sometimes you might get a question wrong for simplification/formatting errors",
Best free interactive educational app. Nice interface and easy to use. Even better than some brick and motar schools 😁,
This is something beyond regular syllabus. I find it really interesting the functions the topics the way they etc. But i didn't find some topics but i hope they will you will upload it soon.,
"it is too much good app.i like the apps which have good and genius questions. it is one of them,but there is a problem when i want to sign in then it can not sign in.",
"Sir It is very good app but the lectures of class 10 are in English please provide lectures in hindi. In your app there is only Physic & Maths lectures in hindi of class 10. Please give us hindi lectures of Biology, Chemistry, etc. Thank you",
"This app, it's teachers, it's ease of usage, everything is simply brilliant. I would recommend everyone to try it for once atleast.",
Exceptional app. It simplifies rather abstract concepts for people like me to understand. I'm glad I came across it.,
"Fab app. Enjoyed listening to a podcast interview with Mr Khan a while ago and I applaud his idea, determination and the fact that he enables so many people to learn. Brilliant",
it's very easy to learn subjects via khan academy and this helps alot to gat answere for the questions in a infomative way and also the way they have discribe those lessons are really understandable. weldone khan academy and thank you for giving us a such knowledge. 💯😋,
Good for a fundamental refresh without Ads. Love how the videos are straight to the point!!!,
I might have give 5 stars. I installed the app and when I opened the app it shows a white screen and then closes the app I tried uninstalling and then restarted my phone and installed again but the same thing happened,
I never see any app better than it till now I suggest to all to download Khan Academy and Khan Academy is the biggest platform to provide free online videos I like it I love it.,
Excellent app for students to learn. This app has made a huge difference in my life and I am sure others would benefit a lot from this app. Thank you Khan Academy.,
"Mind blowing app...Other apps like Byju's , toppr and more seems to be just make profits by adds every where even in YouTube.But this app is free for all with outstanding teaching techniques.Thank you to Khan Academy whole team and Salman Khan",
The most useful app ever. Thank you for creating this life changing app. P.S. I really love watching your interviews with the entrepreneurs.,
"It is definitely the best learning app that I have have ever downloaded. It really made my study life easier. I even have more time to study now, thanks to this app. I feel like it's too good to be true. Thank you!",
It is a very good app for many subjects especially for Maths. So if you are weak in Maths or having many doubts about a chapter then it is the best app for you.,
"If you are the one whose always fascinated by knowing more and more things every time in a really really simple way ,this is gonna best app for you .It's all in one app.",
Very promising app so far. I am very satisfied with this app. The most interesting thing is that it provides all the content free of cost. Very useful and amazing app.,
I believe this is the best app for leaners and it's absolutely free and I love it how Khan teaches. I greatful for your work thanks ! Keep it on the work.,
this app is very good for learning. i used it to skip 8th grade math in school. It is definitely the best learning app.,
Sometime's there are glitches and I can not answer the questions. I don't like this app. When it comes up it's is just a bunch of random lines. No matter what I have to get that question wrong. I don't get it.,
I think this app should have Live Classes too......I have searched for live classes in many apps..but in some of the apps it is...but it is only for class 6th to 12th not for class 4th......even in some apps live classes are there but I can't talk personally with the teachers.........so I recommend this app to have live classes for all classes but still this app is superb for knowledge ☆☆☆,
Nothing can beat khan academy. Place where all can learn anything anytime with the best teacher's one of them is Sal. Thanks for this beautiful app.,
"More website content should be made available and to heavens with Dark Mode. Otherwise, do I need to say the awesomeness of Sal and Khan Academy.",
It is more like thyself teaching thyself. And most amazing content without any fee. The only and only plateform to just not hammer but polishing your mind and persona. Academically and socially.,
It's really a nice one. Especially coaching and explaining things to the lowest means of human understanding. I love it,
Such an amazing learning app. Khan academy has so many collections of information of each subject. Absolutely love it. Definitely recommend this app,
It is a very brilliant app. But when i want to give exam it says that there is a problem in the progress of the subject.,
"I downloaded this app to learn physics and calculus. I ended up learning that just because your Grandma tells you that you're the smartest boy in the world that doesn't necessarily make it true. It's fortunate that I'm the handsomest, most special boy in the world.",
"Another app filled with trackers, harvesting information about it's users. Uninstalled.",
This is the best app for learning. In this app you got the option to see the video in hindi Or english. This is very good. Appreciated,
"Very useful app so far. There should be a University content. Especially, Environmental Engineering and Aerospace Engineering etc. Also a space for fields of study.",
"Yep! It's the best, the free. But, please make update sizes the smallest you can because poor people running on 2G won't be able to download updates.",
"no comments, feedback or anything else!!.. if someone is putting this much content for free and easy to access then, just appreciate it.",
"It's really a good app for all students . many poor students haven't no much money to have a better class. Here ,everythings are 100% free. So I give 5 stars.",
I really can't believe it. The content is too rich. 1000000 percent high quality. It is also at free of cost. 😊.LOTS OF THANKS . NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE APP.,
"Superb app. Especially for clearing concepts in maths. The odd sheep of the group, in a sense that khan academy stands out from other educational apps by giving free and quality education. Thank you, khan academy. Edit: hey khan academy, could you also add a chemistry class 12 CBSE playlist.",
"Perfect app for learning since it's free and gives us well explanation but thr thing is that this app needs to add solution to understand how to write chemistry equations, not just balance.",
Through my experience I found the app in my general prospect very inspiring to every body who believe in available education to every individual in this Globe And when i have been filled with Enthusiasm and joy I looked... Unfortunately it doesn't has enough diverse themes in the Arabic and the German languages. Yours faithfully A Student,
"The application doesn't provide any option to control the video quality like if somebody wants to view all the content in 240gp, 360gp, 480gp, that they can do that however the application are not having any option such as like that, so would request to the developer of this application please look into this matter!",
Much better than byjus. Download it without hesitation. And it's fully free. Its main purpose for teaching U. Best app for study .,
"this app has helped me a lot during my exams, its lessons help easily in understanding the concept thoroughly, thanks a lot! 5 stars deserving app!",
Its excellent app! It clears all the doubts to the root level And wonderfully thing is its for free. Not like some aftrr one video will ask for money and keep on calling for registering.,
I like the app but I downloaded Artimetic fractions for my child but when I didn't have data tried checking everything whether it will work but only the videos worked the exercises didn't work and some questions there videos are not working,
Really helping me a lot. After completing Engineering and 3 yrs of working in Computational Industry I was not clear in math.. your videos helped me to understand math in depth.. grateful to this app!,

The mobile app version of khan academy doesn't contain many of my favourite courses. you guys have omitted the animation course so I hope it gets added soon.,
This app is amazing. We can complete any lesson just in few times. We can add our teacher's or tutors which will help us. We can even us it offline.,
"It's fantastic. But they should provide all subject like biology, chemistry In hindi like Physics. So indian student can understand easily.",
"I'm trying to get into the course. Fortunately, it's freezing on my android. I wonder you will understand us because we love and appreciate your app. First time, it's was really good.",

"Probably the best learning app to exist, I'm always half expecting a prompt asking me to pay, because I still can believe it's free😁 P.S: please optimize the next update for phones with waterdrop screens ;)",
I downloaded this app to code without my laptop yet when I go on the coding course it says that the content isn't available in the app and sends me to the website version instead :/,
I love the app. It's a great app for learning. There is no add inside this app. Every events and courses are free,

If Salman Khan upload all of his videos in khan academy app also which he already uploaded recently in hindi voice ( English medium) in khan academy YouTube channel Please make this such a great app khan academy app up to date. Because, everyone isn't perfect in English language. Once again, Thanks alot Salman khan and his team khan academy.",
Great app for homeschooling and reseach You can also download vidios to watch offline You have to be online to work I suggest if your child has focusing isuess and needs apps to be blocked such as social media and chatting Apps To also get Family Link And app that tells you were your child is and what your child is doing You can also have more than 1 child on Khan Academey and Family Link,
Great app for learning. Can be more effective by adding hindi language to it. I like your hindi videos on youtube. Please add the language option to the app.,

Very nice app! But.. everytime I try to attempt a question it closes and shows an error. Please fix this question error. But overall 10/10,
This app really helps me a lot. Greatest app ever made and its the best because it is free and you can choose many courses you like to learn.,
Khan Academy is changing the world for the better. It definitely changed my life. Thank you for providing the world access to such high quality learning materials. Please stay free forever.,
Could you upgrade the app so we can see as both teacher and student if we have a teacher account to help the students we are teaching. Right now I can not see any of my classes I'm teaching or students,

Probably the first time that i decided to write a review without been asked to. THE BEST LEARNING APP. It has changed my life. A must have for all the learners.,

"I really in love with this app so much... Let God's grace for you all that works behind this app, I really wish that this app also could use for windows.... Thank you Khan Academy... BECAUSE this app I could learn easily and good",
Didn't like being told how complicated and hard something is to learn while supposedly being taught about compound interest.. weak!,
Gave it 3 stars because the only way i can learn anything on this app is by watching videos it would be better if there would be actual text about what you are learning,
"as someone who is practicing for IM1 in 7th grade, and have to learn 8th grade independently, Khan Academy is major help and u can learn a lot of different material with pure ease.",
Can't stand the ringing bell and no were to manage it. I find it hard to get around and find where I was. Maybe website is better because I've heard good things about Khan but the app is frustrating me,
"In substitution and elimination reactions the order of the reactions are jumbled, the basics i.e. SN mechanism r given later and free radical reactions are given first so plz fix that i just wasted half of my day in trying to learn something without knowing the basics of what im learning. Thanks",
This game is really good but ... it's kinda easy for me I am grade 5 but it is like I am doing grade 1 because I have been in back home and the school was so strong we would do bigger grades math so now I'm in Canada that's why it is easy,
All was fine until today. If I select English as my language why are all my bokkmarked courses now in languages OTHER than English? Two stars for the few courses I could use.,
"Please add a video quality changing button, twould be pretty beneficial. Thanks for the free content! Keep up the good work!",
This it is free but a very bad app because when I open it and select course it was showing only 9 course but I want to select more course and it is a very slow app also,
I have downloaded this app since the last 10 days and now when i opened the app they are showing some kind of error and i can't even logg back into the account.,
"Sir, i opened this app, its has many languages but i choose hindi. Because i want to read in hindi language. but sir there was a problem when i choose english language , its present all subjectes to choose but when i choose hindi language , its present only math , no other subject.sir i want to read science in hindi language.sir , please tell me how its posible.sir , please solve my problem.sir your app is very good and i believe it so i tell you my problems .",
You can learn anytime anyting. Its free. You can Math and Sience and more! It has videos and practices. Come on and have fun!,
"Great app, besides to be totally free content, you can download the content and learn even being offline! Thank u so much for it!",
I would give 5 stars cause Best app ever. This app helped me learn so much. Now i downloaded the app for my brother and now he is so good at his math. This app has no glitches at all. I would recomend everyone to download this app . It is also. FREE so you dont have to use your money. Thanks Khan Academy.☺☺☺☺,
You can learn anything for free thats amazing but you have to put in the effort to find your topic but thats ok because research is also a part of the study,
It's the best free app never seen all take money 💰 but you don't . I like your way of learning and it will also help those poor people who like study . I will give you donation . Because your app is wonderful ☺️,
"Lame as hell. Either teach how to do everything required in the quizzes, or just scrub the whole app. Waste of time.",
I was happy to there was a khan academy app until I realized that you can't use the Official SAT Practice. Please add this onto the app. Thank you.,
"I cant open it. I thought this could be helpful but ohh i was disappointed 😢 i often watch your videos on you tube and it was helpful thats why i search for an app, but it was no use😭",
Its amazing I've been looking for a website like this for a long time and I've finally found it thanks to arecommendation from my teacher and I like the teaching methods they use,
I am amazed to use this learning app. It is only the best app I ever found in my life. But I am not going tell about this app to my friends because I want to be the topper of my class after studying here😉😉,
12th math ncert solution is that you can use the same code as the first one you have already applied to your new one or the first time in a year or so the other one will need to change your test to work better on this device without using your Windows phone to download and using the software,
Best learning app seen ever i keep wathing videos on this app because this app teaches in a unique way which other apps cant tech like that in their whole life...... Lots of love Khan Academy ........ May you become the most popular app ........2020,
"FRACTION BUTTON on number pad stops working. DATA MISSING ON SOME PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY BAR AND LINE GRAPH, CHARTS, ETC. Overall useful and worthwhile.",
"So nice! Started with supplemental lessons on linear algebra, then quickly overwhelmed myself with other well organized material!👍",
Best app for learning.Better than byjus and vedantu.And the teaching of lectures is like listening offline and the language they use is very helpful English for beginners.I Thank Khan Academy. Thank u so so much Khan Academy,
Its a great educational app but the user interface is absolutely horrible and sometimes the app doesn't respond to my commands.,
"Love, love, love this website! Complicated subjects are explained in an easy to digest visual way. Perfect for those who struggle in school.",
this is good. i give 4 stars because i have a request. please add a subtitle. it's very helpful for me as a person who are not using english as a main language.,

This is literally the best learning app All the videos are short and crisp and helps understanding concepts quickly and easily,
The best learning app ever. All my appreciation for this project workers. Very high quality lessons and engaging teachers.,
Its good but there is timer setting option in parent control. So that we can set 30mins for learning.,
Good concept. Terrible on desktop and not easy to get to on phone. Kahn has a boring voice.,
helps me with math skills and does a whle lot of other stuff likehelp me with other classes like health and i think math and reading plus computer programming so this i a really cool app,
"Its good in a way that you can learn a lot but i rate it 2 because when this app updated, all of my progress has been reset which annoys me the most",

Best educational app got Its advertisement on YouTube and then I used it It is really very helpful ☺️🙂 I got amazed when saw that it provides free content from class 1 to neet level .,
I absolutely love the guy who does the videos. He really breaks down where anyone can learn the lessons.,
"I will really appreciate if you add black theme Where can I type |absolute|? I saw nowhere. And while doing all the exercises on the same page, at the final question, I can't even scroll down to check my answer after typing the answer so I have no choice but to leave.",
The best thing about it is that it's free. Completely. Its content is also easy to understand. The perfect service to learn and practice for free.,
"Highly recommended if you ask me, makes learning fun. If you need to study and get to understand easily, this what you need.",
Everything is good but it would be excellent if there was a save video offline feature.,
You did what you tried to do.. Great app.. I missed my maths lessons in the school as I'm a gymnast so I had to go for my performance.. But now all my course is clear. Thank you Khan Academy.,
"I love it!! could you add a drawing art class, with exams? That would be great if you could practice drawing skills.",

Super awesome app for homeschoolers! It has helped me learn so much because of its comprehensive teaching. Love it!,
"Great app but recently it has been having trouble recording my progress, which can be frustrating at times.",
This app teacher but for me it is very so boring and that is why I hate the app but really good but I hate this app it needs to do really better and the lessons are really easy and also really short periods of time I totally do not recommend that is why I rated it one thank you for sticking around with me to read about khan academy,
"Great App! there's just one problem. sometimes grammar just disappears. not sure what happens there. also, Can you guys make a GED subject?",
"No ads, clear explanation, very organized and free. This is a learner friendly apk that doesn't milk the users. This is pure generosity, thanks Khan Academy",
for the online version it keeps telling me tobrefresh but it never works. i am studying math and khan academy keeps lagging. for the app version it doesnt refresh it works perfectly fine,
the app did not load a single lesson. I wish I could give it a Negative score. especially since Khan in known to be one of the best. very disappointed.,
The only academy that you can learn anything for free and easily. What a amazing app!!!,
This FREE education service is among the best things ever. Has good quality content and delivery. I highly recommend this.,
Okk so uh I'm in 7th grade but I have the knowledge of a second grader. (Yes I am being 100% serious.) Anyways I really like this app (well not really I hate learning) but it's really good for learning I guess 💀,
This app is one of the best apps i ever saw the language is in an understanding way and it has a simple language...my skills are really improved by using the app n the khan academy website too Thank u for creating this app,
This app has very interesting content and lessons. I am hoping that the Khan Academy app will be available on Roku one day.,
Personlly in 5th grade decamales you dont really need to give the imanges of the problem. I understand some kids need it but I think in my opion that its uneccorcary.. Overall its a great app.,
"Dear whoever this may concern, You are probably deciding whether to download khan academy and are quite unsure about everyone's opinions of this GREAT app. I personally have amazing experiences from this app and learn so much from it. So the answer you have been waiting to hear is.. DOWNLOAD THIS APP, it helps you with anything you might require and is great as it even has a slide to show you how to prepare for an interview. GREAT RIGHT?! Yes so download khan academy today. Yours kindly, Annie.",
"The Khan Academy's the best online education resource, period. Just a suggestion, - please try to optimise the resource usage of the app, it almost binges all of my RAM (nearly 2GB) whilst active. I have an ASUS ZenFone Max ZC550KL (Z010D)",
I'd appreciate it if I could see the My courses section just like on desktop so I don't have to look for a specific subject every time.,
"The best app to study or revision, but I can only choose 9 subjects!!!! That's so bad because I want to study 14.",
I am yet to use it more but definitely the app is good for maths science and grammar. I am starting to learn from scratch. RECOMMENDED,
I just love Khan Academy. There are so many free classes available. I love that it makes learning accessible to everyone regardless of financial status.,
I don't have enough data every time to learn that's the one thing I'm worried about the app is just awesome but this is my problem I'm trying to solve it I don't have enough money and I want to learn very much haha it's not easy,
Wow! I changed my social habits from social apps to productive apps ( khan academy is one of them ) and I see the results. Great to kill free time and gain knowledge simultaneously. Good work and please add more content on economics and finance,
"The app is great!!! And so is the content. However, I cannot access the content for Indian schools via the app. Please look into the matter.",
Really useful app but I live in Sri lanka so i have a different syllabus and i dont learn they same thing so it's kind of difficult for me... and also for the languages i learn in tamil but u cant get the Tamil language!!! Which is really sad!! :(,
This app is extremely good It has aided me in improving my comprehension abilities in the field of studies. The best educational app I have ever used.,
This app is the best It really helped me a lot during my home schooling and I like how it allows a teacher or guardian monitor and send work....Data less requires no data,
It is very nice as everyone had told me about this app no money at any step of making an account and no subscription to get some special content liked the app a lot I never write a review generally but this app is truly awesome,
It is a good app but the problem is it has not video explanation and not online classes and not the chapters which I want to study I study with lbf I am in Chameli Devi Public School and I am in class 6th I want video explanations and online live classes and solving doubt thank you! !,
"Learned a lot of math from this app. Always struggled with math and couldn't grasp the concepts but this app changed that. Thank you, seriously",
Well let me tell you something this is the best learning app ever this might be the only app that teaches you everything I searched for many other apps or websites but this was the best one yet thank you khan academy for teaching me,
Best app have ever seen the badges and the concept clearence and the quizzes are just adorable i am love with this app i have using this since 2 months and my grades lifted up so quick it made me to work hard that makes me a non average student,

its a good app for science students for PCB but it doesnt includes the video sessions of Chemistry (India) - Hindi .... i think this must be improved for class 11th and 12th CHEMiSTRY,
"I don't normally write reviews, but the usefulness of this app has forced me to. The app is absolutely amazing. It has been very helpful to me, and it is absolutely free. Kudos to you, Khan Academy!",

"Extremely brilliant app,I practiced questions of chemistry from this app for my exams preparation. It is really awesome app. You can also learn coding and cosmology here.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰",
I downloaded this to dabble in some further education. I'm trying to create a profile by signing in using Google. Why does this app need permission to access my contacts?? There's no reason why a static education app needs to know this.,
Best free education app! So much material and all for free. I was amazed when I wasn't asked for a subscription for once! Thank you!,
I don't normally review apps but this is amazing. It's such a good resource for learning and the fact it's accessable for free means an easy 5 star rating. I will be using this with my kids.,
Very very good app for learn something easily ever I've seen.It's arranged nicely. I'm very fond of this service. A lot of service is included in this app.,
"It is the best way to learn something. Also I like the guru (Sal) very much because he is very expertised in maths, physics and everything",
This app has the best content. I am currently reading chemistry (India). But it provides only 11th class syllabus. Please upload class 12th chemistry also according Indian syllabus..,
"Can you please fix the download problem it says retry every time I want to save something offline it just doesn't work And can you please add sd card storage as well please look into it ,it would be a huge help Thank you",
Never thought such an extraordinary app will be available for free. The best learning app for wide varieties of field.,
It is very helpful but I do wish there was a test in the beginning to see what level of knowledge for the subject you are at personally,
It is really good 😊 superb 👌 app. I love it. It is better than other educational app. Thank you khan academy . Please make 12 syllabus in hindi also. Thanks for make my physics super 👌,

"Marks corrects answers wrong repeatedly √20x⁸ 2x⁴ √5 Is the answer i come up, is also the answer it gives in hints and the answer it gives in multiple calculators but still marks it wrong. Very confusing",
this needs network its better if they update this without network cause almost all students can use this app like me im still elem. at 5th grade now then when our internet slow cause we are many at the house and ofcourse need to study for upcoming school year even though its quarantine cause we need to learn something at the house not just keep playing at house and yeah thats only my opinion hope the creator of this app will see (JUST MY OPINION) and this acc. is my fathers,
I am also a student but ill say that this is a Very nice app for students In my mid terms my marks of English language were almost 80/73 But in my 2nd assessment my marks of this subject were 80/80 At last i ll say that its a very affective app for students,

"Very good app, one of the best educational apps I have ever used. only started to use it because my teachers said it was good and it really helped me in fun ways",
"Khan academy sucks, it lags like no other app I have ever had and it sets you up to fail. It failed me on kindergarden stuff when im in 6th grade! UGH!",

2 minutes silent prayer for those students who don't have this app,
It's the best learning app and the people who made it don't disturb you with ads and by asking for money like beggers. Their purpose is sincerely to teach.,
"Khan Academy had transformed boring theoretical parts into deep, clear conceptual explanations with excellent tutorials. Thank you so much khan academy, you helped me alot in my academic studies. Lots of love from India 🇮🇳.",

This app is great because you can learn on your own even when no one is teaching you and you can answer the difficult parts of math,
Non functional app. Edit button shows an error Adding pre calculus tells that i have network error. Edit : worked by logging in from a new account,
I cannot reduce size of videos they are too large in size and uses up lots of data to even download a short video.,
The best App to keep children busy and at the same time learning as well. My two years old love it. Thank you.,
It's awesome you learn alot of things but the problem after downloading the work it doesn't save it's self u need to have data to read again,

For maths students it's great app. But for computer science fields like coding its not conplete. Also dark theme is missing. Other than that its great app.,
It is a greate app for distance learning education for all over the world.I think it must be include some sort of subjects too.,

Don't just come and start insulting people's work like that! It's not done. You are calling it boring. Excuse me, but don't you go to school? You obviously need it. Think of those who are spending their time and resources to give people like you a good education. You are just taking it for granted. It's obviously not a game. If it's a waste of time, then to you, going to school is also a waste of time. Don't be so immature. How dare you EVEN INSULT the guy, who spent his TIME AND RESOURCES to create such a wonderful opportunity for people like you. Who knows if you even DESERVE it? Khan Academy is a great application, and it's really helpful. It helps me to understand more of what I am learning. Thank you, Mr. Salman Khan.",

Delete your app and website this is a sorry excuse.,
Great app and content.,
Needs more hands on work for younger ages. And it seems like it's just questions. No tutoring,
"I have started preparing fror my physics exams with khan academy (not having physics in school). I have got 98%, therefore I am in top 0,4% in my country in physics (where physics is not a compulsory subject). Although I had to learn more than was on khan academy, khan academy provided me with very solid basis for physics (as well as calculus and mvb calculus btw). Khan Academy did a great job :D",

"Love khan academy. It is one of, if not THE BEST place to get free online education. Highly recommend! If you don't want the app, check out their YouTube channel or website full of educational material",
This is no good app for learning Because there setup is too bad and teaching quality is also bad So I can't support this app for learning Thank you!,
Love this app.. it really is great to be able to learn about all the things that they offer and for it to be free is extra great,
I am really greatful for discovering this app it really helps me understand more our topics and lessons.,
unable to download a bookmarked topic/video.It just stops and does not proceed.Even with a good internet connection.I am not able to watch the bookmarked topic offline.,
Khan academy is the BEST!!!... no doubt. The videos are just perfect and understandable.,
Need dark mode Also need 0.75x speed,
Love this app. Would just love if the icons could change colour once I achieved full points in a course.,
"It is a good app but, I just created an account yesterday with my computer and today its says that there is no account with the following email.",
"Everytime that I go to ""Home"" it crashes. I already tried those steps but it still happens",
"This is the best learning app I have ever used it is easy to sign in, gives test after the class and many more beautiful features 👍👍👍👍👍😊📚",
This app is waste of time everytime my answer is correct it show it wrong and when it shows it's anser that is matching to my answer dont download this app your space and data will be wasted,
"Working,and ready to get going and also exploring...let's learn together as one nation.",
"It's an app for learning, and I can have ""classes"" while in quarantine.",
It's a great app and foundation for education world wide any one can learn from it having fun I like it very much,

Best application for education but i just only want to suggest you to make the videos for class 9 chemistry and biology (india) also...,
I just love this app!! The quality of education they provide that too without any expenses is just magnificent ❤️,
Is missing a automatic dark theme and ability to disable sound effects.,
Excellent source to learn math. 2 weeks and I learned more than 12 years of school teachers.,
Super beautiful app for both students and teachers. Gives u summary notes and Videos for free.,

Not only the best learning app ever made but in my opinion it's the best learning resource ever created.,

"Dude, i learned so fast, plus its free, that's awesome, wjich is why, for all these educational efforts you provided, you should get a 5 star, your better than IXL with education.",
I can't thank Khan Academy enough for their efforts. Adding a dark mode would be pretty cool though.,
It's best app ever. But there's frequently download error concerning files with large size.,
This is of course an amazing app. As the founder Knows the value of education. The apps like byjus and Udemy charge a lot and everybody cannot afford it But Khan academy is a totally free app,
The best learning app right now and it's totally free.This app really helped to clear my concepts and get good grades.Thank you Khan academy!,
Not user friendly. You almost have nothing to access here compared to the pc/browser version,
I've been able to learn more since I started to use this app. I really like the features and the new courses,
it's learning is nice but I keep on getting errors and I even tried installing and uninstalling it but the errors won't go away,
it's excellent app you'll be made great in your field by this academy This learning app is better than most other apps that I've ever seen ''LOVED IT!! '' 😀😊,
This is one of the best learning sites! I enjoy learning and reviewing what I think that I know .....or not😊,
This app is very useful for school students. I have study with entertainment. So this app is very best for you,
"Doesn't work for free best on the app, also I think there was an update and now I can't find lesson involving the motherboard",
Wonderful app.and that too free. I really like this app. I suggest that you add transcripts for offline videos also.,
Great app because teacher are amazing teaching and in it is perfect for them who can afford teacher and want class of free,
The best for knowledge and strong foundation......luv it ....a great job guys it really helps me and a lot of people I'm sure,

"It really follows it's moto, YouCanLearnAnything. This app made my lockdown productive. This is a must-installed app in every students device.",

I love Khan academy but it won't let me sign in so what's the point of the app?,
Maths concepys were never so easy to understand and Khan Academy is best than all the apps in the education sector.,
"Fantastic, their is teaching is great and understandable . Thank you Sal for your wonderful app.",
One of the best videos very very well detailed explanations very good for concept clarity a remarkable work done by sal khan i love it ❤❤,
I was encountering a lot of prblems with my studies. Coming into contact with this app has indeed solved most of my problems,
"It is showing you are offline. Please fix this issue. I tried reinstalling the app, but it didn't work. Please give me a solution.",
Really... amazing app .. but we face trouble in some places...when videos also provide in Hindi/Urdu then we give 10/10,
this is a great app and a true helper as it let's me self study. I use this app 7 hours a day. thanks,
"Even after completing lessons it doesn't show it , so hard to understand which video is completed which is not",
I really enjoy learning with Khan academy but the reason I give 3 stars is because I can't download and store videos.,
Do you have any learning app in Hindi language. So children can understand easily.,
Perfect. I love this app. Thank you for bringing such high quality education in an equitable way.,
Good for all ages and levels the learning experience for everyone no matter where you live.,
Please add note adding feature in lesson video so that learner can save it as a small note on what he learned.,
Your app loads very slow and functions are also very slow.,
Khan academy is an app that gives you follow up but breaks down step by step on how you do the work so you could get better at it,
Its only mathematics they are teaching .fix that and put other subjects,
"Best application ever it increased my brain capacity, visual impressed 😁 and best guider ever",
I used Khan Academy for test prep. I have a math background but it had been 20 years since I had taken an algebra 2 class. I studied up on my trig and alg 2 with Khan Academy and past with flying colours.,
This app helped me get my GED so I'm always going to use this app whenever I go to college because I'll always be bad at math lol,
This is so good app you can improve yourself and you can find what you want to learn there is many interesting topics it's super app,
Good Free App but there should be a way download courses for offline use. Overall good. Thanx Sal sir. Edit: thanx for ur reply,
"Very useful and it really explains everything clearly, also takes short tests after a topic",
"😒 I cannot give you 6 stars what a shame 🥲 Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computer Science etc... this apps it is the best 😁",
It's very educating and free of cost. It's a best platform for up to 12th class students,
The best learning app ever. You can learn everything at your home specially during a lockdown.,
Khan academy is a nice platform for increasing your knowledge but some additional platform should have been created for doubts allowing regular users to help the student out of their doubts ....,
superb and fantastic app for learners or the people or student who want to learn basics and high end principles related to maths and physics,
I can't even access my bloody assignments sent by my teachers! Sometimes the Home Screen is pure white when I log on and off! 😡 (Edit: Thank you for the info!),
This app is good for tests nd practice but teaching manner is not so good the teacher is so fast that I couldn't make it up with him otherwise the app is osum,
Very good app but please add more languages coz its the best app for students please add (persian) language too.,
Awesome!!!! amazing app this is by far the best learning app I've come across Although I don't know how to join a class yet though but I'll still give it 5 stars,
Because of this Academy I have embarked myself on a magnificent journey to get my degree of Mathematics at the University. Thanks to Sal and all of his collaborators!,
It's not actually free education. I saw no option to choose courses. You need pre-approved codes,
Best learning app I ever seen in my life. Best wishes to khan academy. You people are doing great job. Keep serving content to knowledge hunger student. Kudos to khan academy,
Hey sal all the things are good but you must provide all the features to this app which are available on the website like the progress panel and discussion forum,
Excellent app. I use the maths for second class for my kid and it's very helpful.,
sir please improve the interface.Interface is not structured please make it easy and structured like byju.Khan Academy provide very better learning.,

Man this app is nostalgic and I'm only 18 it's got it all if you want to get ahead or learn a language then put some real time and you wint regret it.,
Its very useful app it would be even better if they teach some language classes..,
"I love Khan Academy, but I wish this app could cast videos to Chromecast and other devices.",
app is not quite smooth and hangs a many time Even the app is quite messy and is sometimes confusing and prevents me from using it all the time.,
Very good app for studies. Working for people for free. Hats off! User friendly app,
It's perfect!!!! It is very useful for all the cbse students under this current scenario (covid 19)..,
"best best app.... you can not even imagine that how happy am i after getting this app...... it is free, ad free... thank you very very much for such a very very and very great app.....",
"It keeps saying the answer is wrong, I used all hints which told me the answer, and it still said it was wrong.",
this app is very bad because it is not given proper information of chapters and it is not focus on the language of the text 🤯🤔😨,
"Very educational, although I wish the mobile version had all the website did (especially the SAT practice content)",
"It's usefull and nice app, it could be better if there was program language to learn.thank you.",
this app is a life saver. thanks so much for making it. I can't express enough how much this app is helping me in preparing for my college placement exam. thanks a million!,
"No ads, free knowledge, downloads for offline view and quality of content is very good.",
It's a really really good app but my problem is with video quality i cannot watch videos on low quality.,
I love this app I totally forget something my teachers teach me and I find it useful to make it more clear to me,
I love khan academy but please create option in video player to change the pixel of video quality as in many places internet data are limited and mbps speed is low..,
"Hii, Sometimes the app doesn't open so I have to download it again. So, kindly fix this bug",
This is not a good app for learning because we don't get to lern a particular thing from starting nor proper videos to see.,
Best learning app with no bothering elements such as advertisements. Perfect for highschool studies,
I'm giving a full hearts because I haven't use this app for a long time but I hope my expectations like learning will really make my expectations come into reality I hope so .,
Great app but I wish the quizzes and course reviews were more rigorous and had more problems to solve.,
This app.was good and fun to learn but one time it deleted everything I worked hard for now I have to restart all over again I hate it so much,
The best! I love how it's free and the questions and topics are very good!,
"You guys are doing a great work! Thank you so much for this, as a lot of students who are not financially stable are also able to learn a lot from this.",
I am studying at home 🏡 and I'm having a wonderful experience. I'm 35 years old and it's awesome to remember everything I've learned at school.,
At least when someone fails and when someone takes the exercise again and pass please let the person have a pass it doesn't mean that when someone has failed and then the person retakes the test the person still gets a zero is no use,
I downloaded this for my test preparation and I am making an account but an unexpected error is not letting me what is wrong with it I am tired of trying again and again 😭,
"Always used this since school, anytime I need a refresher on something I always remember this website/app. Love it!!",
"Cannot use it. I signed up and and it just tells me that I'm offline and won't let me do anything. If I were offline, I wouldn't be able to put one star here though. :/",
"Once you've chosen a specific age for the child, there's no menu or option to change the age. 😩",
"This app is good, but in several times maybe should improve app by fixing button that showing progress report without open the other apps.",
0 stars It has be marking alot of my stuff wrong for no reason it doesn't send me any notifications and I didn't get 2 assignments I have 0s in now,
Great app. No one can beat this app. Exceptional. App at its best. Hey Developer - Add dark mode. Dark mode. Dark mode. Please.,

A great when i ever see but this have only problem language issue and there have so many languages like english and hindi please make the language telugu also in videos please 🙏🙏🙏,
helps me understand every concept of maths and science;i would suggest the khan academy group to make vedios downloadable and have more visualisation more than information and verbal speech,
"Why doesn't work other languages, we used to check and do the activities in my cellphone, but now it says it is not available in my language "" spanish"" 🥴😵🥴☹",
just the best platform: nothing much. p.s. Add 'going back to questions' and 'seeing their hints/explanations'. it will be just right,
It's very useful to understand the concepts from the basic...Just loved it,
Absolutely great. Helped me pass a test that I was super worried about with no issues.,
"Everytime I open a video or a lesson, my app stops. I'm using the Samsung Tab E.",

perfect for me . All concepts are their.By watching videos i am confident that i will take good marks,
I love this app .. but if it's had Arabic language it wil be perfect. that's why I give it four stars,
I wish that the app was faster and also the videos are already downloaded with the app i hope to see this in the new update soon,

It helped me change and I became a better student since I lost a year of progress in 2018 but it covered all the content for my final year in school,

"Would b 5 stars if u could report questions after answering; sometimes it's difficult to fully judge if a question is confusing/misleading until u decide on an answer. Take this for example: ""It takes 1/3 can of cocoa mix for Floyd to make a batch of brownies. If Floyd wants to make 4 batches of brownies, how many cans of cocoa mix does he need?"" If you said 2 cans you'd be wrong, even though it didn't ask for ""parts of a can."" Besides that, extra design options would b great 4 customization!",

Excellent App that lives up to its hype,
"Incredible resource but be cautious of biases and indoctrination attempts. Introduction to macroeconomics, for example, marred by suggestion people can magically create moral society through self-interested capitalism without moral decision making. Not at all likely so why suggest such magic? And why America was founded by capitalism lie? We the people say no more kings! Lies of Capitalist Pigs should be separate course. Introduction summary, though sticks to real course material, no propaganda.",

Not optimized for learning. Perhaps leader too full of himself to optimize instead of promoting himself. Pitty for the countless donations.,

You make the atmosphere feel comfortable and engaging. Providing an app is a huge plus and I am sure it has come a long way since I have last used it. Keep this alive!",
Big improvement by adding the ability to do quizzes. Thank you. By the way I am a regular donator to Khan Academy. Not much $ but I love what this organization does for making education accessible to everyone.,

"Hola, soy de Perú. Descubrí esta herramienta de estudio que me ha servido mucho. Lastimosamente me descargue la app y me di cuenta de que esta no está disponible en español:((( la vrdd me apeno mucho porque encerio me gustaba pero me incomodaba tener que entrar a la web y tener una vista más incómoda. Espero que me deen una solución, muchas gracias :3",
"Videos are good but keyboard is not good. Tangents of Polynomials under differentiation. No easy way to type ""y=2x+27"". To enter ""y"" you need to hold tap on X which is not clear.",
I wish I had this app when I was at school. I'm now a 50 year old librarian and learning math I never understood back then and Khan Academy is making it as easy as humanly possible. It's just an incredible learning platform.,
"App maravilhoso, principalmente na parte de matemática, mas tem uma coisa q eu detesto, é quando estou fazendo o teste de unidade há muitos minutos e erro alguma questão, aí me traumatizo, pq sei que terei que passar todo aquele tempo de novo para poder chegar no nível máximo de pontos de domínio. Eu amaria se dessem a chance de fazermos uma outra questão como a recuperação.",
Excelente para o aprendizado!,

"It's great, just like the website. 1 thing it is missing is scratch paper or notes. I have galaxy note 8 and was wanting to be able to do work within the app. Would be awesome if you guys added this, you wouldn't even need a stylus one could use their finger, it should at the very least be an option, thank you. EDIT: Just realized they actually added scratch paper, and it works just as well as it does in the full website browser. The app to me is now relatively perfect, 5 stars.",
"Baar baar break dete rhate hai Confison question, battmiz teachers is app ma teacher apne phone sa apne app ki rating dete rhate Har class ma sirf apne app ki rating ka bara ma bolna parents ko bacchaa ka khilaf badkana bachaa ko galt tarah sa treat karna kisi kaam ka app nhi hai. Naam ka sirf app only apna profit bachaa ka future ko destory karna hi inka task hai online offer dene jisse bachaa apne peak sa distrack hokar inke app ki rating ko Badhai apne feedback apne ap mang lene ki inki adat",

"Thank you Khan Academy, I've gained fair share of knowledge form this platform; Knowledge that I did not receive from our mainstream academic institutions. I definitely recommend this to anyone, literally anyone--I cannot stress that enough. When I graduate and earn my fair share of income, I will most definitely donate to this platform and or invest in educating those who do not have access to it. Ofcourse, I understand this is the platform that aims 2 do that but nonetheless.. I'm out of space",
"Really it is a great app. I started to learn from various other apps like Byju, Unacademy but they all are zero in front of Khan academy. Most importantly as you take education from this app you need no books whole the life. I request Sal Khan sir that they should also launch Khan academy India app with all courses in Hindi. I AM SURE THAT KHAN ACADEMY WILL MAKE FUTURE EINSTEIN, NEWTON. GREAT WORK KHAN ACADEMY. YOU GAVE ME A SURITY THAT I CAN DO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS POSSIBLE. LOVE YOU KHAN ACADEMY.",
"Lessons are nice but the app experience is not smooth on android 5 (it is smooth only on android 10). The navigation is very slow, when I click in one of my courses it takes around 10 seconds to show where I clicked and load the selected course menu. Last, and most importantly, the video player is very slow. Entering/exiting fullscreen freezes the player and app buttons. This is sad because this smartphone runs freefire and other heavy apps smoothly but can't run khan academy in the same way.",
"Just wonderful. Educational and fun! I never covered Calculus in high school, but thanks to you and your app I can do some differential calculus :) still working on it! Where did Vi Hart's videos go - heck, all of Math for Fun and Glory? I can find them on YouTube, but since they're something kids like, you can't add them to playlists anymore, so KA was the easiest way to find them.",
"Edit: Didn't update it for quite a while, but as for the current update I'm happy to see that the app finally works fast and smooth. Especially it's nice to have earch bar doing it's job properly.",
"Sólo he comenzado a usarla y ya me tiene más enganchado que Netflix jajaja, es bueno recordar sobre física, matemáticas, química etc. De las mejores apps que puedo tener en mi phone. Well Done.",
"Unfortunately, the app is inferior to the website. Seriously, you're better off using the website mobile version, it has more content as well. The only reason I can think of using the app over the website is maybe to download videos? It doesn't even have a proper profile page (streak, awards page, progress, etc....).",
"Add the ability to batch download entire lessons. Add a dark mode. Add option to change download location (SD card). Add the daily streak to the mobile app. No, I won't go to your site and suggest it there. That is your job. Raised to 4 stars after they implemented batch downloads. Thank you for your efforts.",
"The app has come a long way in 4 years. It's now possible to do exercises on mobile almost as well as on desktop. It scales well to the screen size, and pinch zoom works too. I miss the scribble pad from desktop though.",
This is great for learning. The lessons are good so are the videos and I also like the happy faces,
"Los videos explicativos en español son muy malos, simplifican los casos, no te explican como resolver los problemas cuando algunos valores pueden ser negativos, decimales, fracciones o radianes, es el caso del curso Trigonometría, en el vídeo de explicación de obtener el periodo de una función por la gráfica, la chica solo explica como obtenerlo si es un número entero el periodo iba del número 2 negativo al número 0, se podría sacar a simple vista, pero en ejercicios lo sacas del decimal.",

"Harika uygulama ve harika içerikler. Sadece sosyal bilimlerin daha gelişkin olmasını dilerdim. İlk yorumumda 5 yıldız vermiştim. Yakın zamanda bir güncelleme ve bazı görsel değişiklikler oldu. O zamandan sonra matematik alanında bazı konu testlerini telefonda yapmama izin vermiyor. ""bir hata oldu"" diyerek testten çıkarıyor. Ayrıca telefonda açılabilen bazı sanat tarihi videoları bilgisayarda açılmıyor. Bu nedenlerle puanı 4 yıldıza düşürüyorum. Hatalar düzeldi. Yeniden 5 yıldıza çıkardım.",

Great app,
I would love a section with all the basics of engineering (the common mathematics etc) and then several sets for different careers etc. Imagine the motivation children could get knowing that they can learn everything necessary to be engineers here! Children could learn these things crazy fast without the hinder of university! It doesn't work and we need more engineers. Khan Academy should continue its great work with more complex topics. I'm willing to donate for it.,
"Free education at its peak and it's not even a pun. Excellent videos, Short and precise in content, ideal for doubt clearation and quick rundown of syllabus. Covers almost enough material to clear most of the examination exams in my country. Thanks Sal for building such an amazing platform!",
"Pretty good, but I get quite a few error messages when my son is doing the tests for a unit. It's a bit frustrating, if he starts the test again, the same problem will be there, generating the same error message, so he isn't able to finish the tests.",
Great app to learn several things! But it could be much better if we could study offline and have the achievements system built-in in the app.,
"It's a very nice app Deserves 5 stars The only problem I have is, when I tap on the download button, the app stops Please fix",
Great app and using this for few months. Right now my problem is that when viewing video the screen pixels changes according to network speed and this is a great problem for varying net speed. Been getting this for few days. Edit : Problem solved,
"Update: No issues to date and a perfect platform for learning. Accessing a video displays a wall of text and the audio players, but no video. I haven't seen many people complaining about this, so maybe it's device specific?",
Its really a superb experience for me. But the only problem is when i try to attempt the test its not at all opening. Its showing that something error occured try again.. please help me to find a solution to this only problem...,
Amazing app. I have learned so many topics off of this app. Love love love it. I would love to contribute in any subject @Sal if you are reading!,
"I study from, unacademy, h.c. verma, ncert, Walter Lewin, bozeman, etc, but khan academy is really doing something different, really outstanding content, lots of love from a physics lover 😘,",
The first app to democratize education! Providing high quality free educational content!,
Its an awesome app plzz add more hindi videos,
It doesn't have a great variety of subjects,
"This is very useful app for students please try it, awesome app",
What the heck happened to the HealthCare/Medicine field? Bring that back and I will happily give 5*,

I can always go to the website from my comp to do practice tests if I have to anyway.,

"It would be a lot better if the videos are made with less duration, going through lots of videos which have long duration makes it very difficult to stay focused.",
Conteúdos ampliados e detalhados e plataforma acessível com exercícios que facilitam muito o aprendizado.,

"It's been 84 DAYS since I first requested for video quality settings on the KA app and have also submitted a request and a ticket in the feature request forum, but still it seems like the developers aren't concerned about adding this CRUCIAL feature. A reply that I received made me trust that it can happen in the future updates but disappointment is all that I'm left with.",
Its the best for education. I hve tried it on pc and phone but i think phone dont has too much features which desktop site has. Please add that and please add languages if you can sal. And after all 'you only need to know one thing that you can learn anything.,
This is the greatest learning app .I miss the old version where i can download all the content instead of downloading one by one.Wish there was an option where you can download all the video in just one click.Example: download everything in alegbra without selecting them 1 by 1.,
"The best way to uphill your hold on subjects, in my opinion Khan academy should at least have ads to their videos on youtube coz ur running on a deficit , so please every child need Khan academy ,so for its existence you people should atleast do that thing",

I tried the updated app and some of the answers are cut off by the edge of the screen.,
"I will appreciate if the developers are adding extend courses, no just basic/introduction.",
Khan Academy taught me so much! The app is well designed and the developers take feedback here into account.,
"Mostly useless, it does not have specific lessons that the desktop version has...",
"Thank you, thank you!! 3 years a user and still loving it. BUT I do wish there was a chat room for users. Other than that it's 100% worthwhile!",
"Awesome app, but most times, after I update, the app crashes.",

"There are plenty of lessons in both humanistic and scientific subjects and each one of them is explained clearly .( I also love the small exercises at the end of each unit ) I would thank you for the subtitles because , as a non native english speaker, they help me a lot : I can increase my vocabulary and listening skills in my second language and also learn something new. p.s. please forgive me If I've made some mistakes",
Free education in a very interesting way the best new feature is that they have added vidio lessons in hindi but only for class 11 physics that's ok becoz sal and ram both explain things v.well. Best education app according to me.wish to have more vidio lectures in hindi.,
"Great resource to learn math. Wish it had a calculator on the quizzes tho like it does on PC. I use my phone as my calculator so switching between apps is do-able, but a bit inconvenient. Still 5 stars.",
I love it! It is so nice to have a wealth of digestible information in my pocket! I watch videos constantly whenever I have a break or when I'm bored. A special thanks to all the professors for the enlightenment and thanks to the platform creator to make such an easy to navigate/informative application to use.,
"Its a very useful app. People say it is boring but yeah, it will always be boring to people who doesnt want to learn in the right way. Just to remind them that we always have to give time and effort to something we want to have. Im very thankful to the creator of this app. I learned many things i never learned in school. Good job guys! (Edited) I wish khan academy would attach the subtitles to the video",
But I have a problem it keeps on crashing whenever I open my list of downloaded video,
This is the world class study platform. truly love the great work of khan Acadmy. God bless you.,
"Estaría genial que añadieran temas como geología, y algunas más para que sea perfecto",

It's free education... 5 stars. Is there any way to get 'math by grade' on this version of the app?,

"Aplikacja w końcu umożliwia dostęp do polskojęzycznych kursów, które są doskonale przygotowane i dotychczas były dostępne wyłącznie w wersji desktopowej (strona średnio współpracowała z przeglądarkami mobilnymi). Materiały z matematyki opracowane przez polskich wykładowców są lepsze niż anglojęzyczne oryginały. Teraz to narzędzie jest absolutnie idealne. Ogromne dzięki!",
👍👍,
❤❤❤,
Appreciate the update but recent courses and lessons have disappeared from the app. Those sections were very useful to quickly access content instead of browsing. Please add them back.,
Made for the students and not for the sake of money. Free education and guidance to those who are unable to get admission in expensive or high level classes due to financial reasons or maybe something else. Also it isn't time consuming as well,
soooooooooo good,

Loving it so far. In depth explanations of how various subjects are done and why. What I would like to see in the near future is more content to study for more career paths. Such as adding additional disciplines to the field of engineering. Update has ruined this app. After coming back to work on it some more I've found that the lessons are slow and sometimes don't work at all. You guys need to fix this. The old version was so much better.,
"Still use web version even on smartphone because the app doesn't show if quiz/unit test is finished/in progress or not even started. Same story with videos, it's cool that fully watched videos are marked with check mark, but what about videos watched in part/not started ? For example i use such information to know where exactly i've finished last practice so i don't need to recheck all watched videos in series to know where to continue. Little details but as for me they're playing a big role.",
Salman Khan you are a phenomenal instructor and I truly appreciate you creating Khan Academy and offering it free of charge. keep up the good work. Your instructional videos have helped my children excel in U.S. Government/Civics and Algebra. Thank you so much!,
Cant find physics topics that were earlier part of the app rest the app is great and a treat for students,
Great app would be nice if you could write on screen like scratch paper.,
This app is very informative and I love learning more about math!!,
Will there be added Chromecast support? i really enjoy this app but good would save me so much hassle to be able to cast to my TV.,
Khan academy is making one of the greatest contribution towards building a better future,
The new app annoyingly lags on Android 4.4,

Love everything about Khan Academy. Except this app. The lack of chromecast support makes it so much harder for me to study! The rest of the app works great as long as you aren't trying to download gigs of bookmarks at a time. I would change my rating to 5 stars if chromecast support was added!,
Now we can do the actual lessons and not just watch videos. Freaking love it!,
Brilliant. I highly encourage everyone to try this app out on your own.,

I love this app so much. My cousin Omar Rizwan told me about this website a long time ago because he had worked there as a summer intern. I had used this to help my daughter to learn her basic math since she was 4 years old and now she is 9 years old and still uses it as support learning for her school homeworks. And I myself uses this app for my nursing review. When my daughter started kindergarten her school never heard of Khan academy until I mentioned it to her teachers on our 1st PTC.,
"I found a bug. whenever i try to download some course, the audio and video quality is crappy. fix this soooon Edit : But can you please make make an option there for the quality that user can download because the audio sometimes get really choppy. please :)",
"Bad quality offline video. I've been using Khan academy android app and it's quite helpful.  But after I needed it offline I downloaded my tutorial(or the thing you call it), the video quality was so so so bad like near 140p, how do I change the quality of the offline videos?  Thanks for any help.  This is an excerpt.",
This app is just perfect. The most interesting part is that you can pause and go back if you didn't understand something. It's just like a teacher in front you. I love it,
Please provide option for saving videos offline coz we face network issues now and then... It would be kind of you,
I'm a first year medical student and almost all my knowledge comes from Khan Academy! Keep doing great stuff Sal!,
My school has taken khan academy and it is awesome all the math sums are all my level too KUDOS TO KHAN ACADEMY and haters gonna hate (duh) IDK why this thing is boring it seems nice to me and again What do u expect PUBG? fortnite? good luck with ur studies then 😑😑😑,
Such tons of great content and that too open-source☺ loving it,
cette application m'a sauvé la vie plusieurs fois! Il est très instructif. Et il est également très facile à utiliser. J’apprécie beaucoup l’effort! :),

"Great app. However, Chromecast and Picture-in-Picture support wild make it even better. Also, an offscreen like an audio app would be beneficial too.",
"The pioneer mind behind this app, i truely appreciate it. They're provid'g high quality education digitally which is totally *free* Choose any subject any topic they will provides best explaination for that",
"I am a relatively newbie to Khan Academy, but I must say, this is one of the best apps for self-studying. However, it will be nicer if you can practice, just like you can on the site.",
This is Sal Khan's gift to humanity! The idea of providing world class education for free to everyone is a great gift to humanity. Keep up the good work! 🙏,
"The king of educational apps, please improve userinterfac, and also there is no option to change course please fix",
Downloading for offline use is efficient. But it downloads files with really poor quality as default; and no option to change it. IDK WHY?,

"Me fascina! Es una app excepcional. Exceptuando el hecho (y por eso no le doy 5 estrellas) de que cuando se descargan temas para verlos sin conexión solo se guardan los videos, pero no los textos, practicas o modelos de exámenes, que me parecen fundamentales. Fuera de eso, una app maravillosa para aprender ciencia❤️",
"As I said in another review this concept is perfect for a lot of people who either want to learn new stuff just because or who seemed to get lost in the system in their formative years, like myself. I've watched this application evolve over the course of several years and I can't say I'm all that disappointed in the direction it's going. I would definitely like to see more practical exercises in the physics modules. Forces and Work can be tricky to get a hold of and some practice would be great. That's about all I have negative to say about the app as of late. Keep up the good work.",
It would be the best app ever if doubt clarification sessions are also added. Liked this app very much. Concepts are very clear and easy to understand.,
"Like it alot but need more updates, i like to know when a section is completed like a percentage the website is very good i hope the app will be the same",
The stars from sky r even less to rate this app. I love Khan Academy. It gives me a lot.,
This app is the best app in the world It strengthened my grip on all of the subjects. A must have.,
Totally enjoying your app. Can you please add Forensic science topics as well,
Sometime the formulas in the articles vanish. Plzzz fix this. Great learning platform,
- A recent issue : The app doesn't allow me to sign in with my google or facebook account. - A good substitute for the official website yet needs improvement: Couldn't find most chapters in computer science NCERT Chapters. ----------------------Thank you-,

"Truly amazing. If you just pay attention enough, you'll indeed get the help you need with this app. They even have exercises you can do for free. Thanks Khan Academy. & Continue to do what yall do. 👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",
Its a nice experience with khan academy app i think this app is one which taught someone easily.. I am from India sometimes i stucked in English language but now there are vedio available in hindi also but only for 11 physics.. I hope 12 physics been come soon.. Specially thanks to Ram who spokes hindi very nice as we talk in daily life... In india....... ☺️☺️☺️☺️ And at last i hope this app for Indian students like a miracle... But for me it is.. Thank you so much,
Only 4 variables max show up in the popup,
Khan academy is doing a great job of offering free and quality education. Loved it!,
The app currently just offers viewing the Khan academy videos would be perfect when you can also do the exercises on the go,
keşke derslere eklenti olsa mesela matematiğe ispatlar eklemek gibi. insan sevince daha cok istiyor.,

"I want to give the app 5 stars because I love the content. However, the web version shows units as being mastered when you do the unit test but this doesn't show anywhere on the app. I therefore don't know what I have completed to move onto the menu unit. If this app had the whole experience of the web version it would be 5 stars. Currently I don't want to use this because it's such a better experience on the web. I also am unsure if the progress I made on unit tests on the phone was treated on the web when I went to it.",
"Honestly, this app is absolutely HORRIBLE if you are wanting to learn anything in the computing section. I went to this site to learn things like SQL, Javascript, and even the hour of code upon recommendation. However, they have the absolutely basics and they are only informative sections. If you are looking for a good app to learn coding, go to the SoloLearn app. They have a truly AMAZING all in one learn to code app. If you are looking for other things Khan Academy offers, then hopefully you can find it in this app but don't hold your breath.",
"This is the best study app I found till now and the catch it's absolutely free...each and every single thing! Khan academy offers courses on math,science and humanities along with explained videos and even MCQ's Those from India will find NCERT based class 11 and class 12 chapters too... I highly recommend this to each and everyone Thank you so much Khan academy!",
"A really awful app just a waste of time. First of all it doesn't provide all the stuff that is required for preparation of concepts. Next it works awfully bad. So much of crashes! Last but not the least the app doesn't provide interactive study material for the students. I get too bored while watching the videos. If you'll fix all of these problems, I would think of giving it 5 stars. This app is not at all better than BYJU'S. The app should provide good practice of concepts. Worst app.",
I love Khan Academy. It has helped me tremendously by facilitating me with a free and easy way to fill my mind with things I love. I have two major complaints. First of all why are the bookmarks not grouped by topic e.g. Circles and congruence not grouped under Geometry? It would make searching for stuff so much cleaner. Finally please implement PiP (Picture in Picture) Or just have sound overlay if I'm not in the app like Spotify. Though Graphical intuition is great. Great Job Sal!,
I am totally amazed. The app is just fantastic for all subjects. Even though I am a science student I tend to peep at other subjects as well. I am student of class 11 doing integrated medical entrance coaching and thus app actually helps me understand the concepts well especially physics and it's freeee!!! Totally loved it. I wish I had found this earlier. Thank you Mr Sal Khan for this beautiful creation!!,
"Ok, so I love the app and Kahn Academy in general, but there is one thing that has always bothered me about it. I can't her to my classes that Kahn Academy is helping me with. So the website can have you pick out the classes you are taking and then give you lessons to help you based on that, but when I go into the app I can't seem to find that. Another thing I noticed is that the app isn't as navigational as the website. Other than that I love the app.",
The app is very good for learning.very easy to use.if you can finish everything concerning one topic in one video including the theory part and the solving part. it will really help many people to understand more.nice app you got here.,
"I love Khan Academy and their content, it's so helpful for me! A slight issue with the app that I have a complaint against is that in articles, (especially in the Multivariable Calculus series, not sure about the others) some of the symbols and equations don't appear. This leaves gaps in the understanding since it requires guesswork to assume what equations or formulae should be there. Please fix this and I'll rate the app 5/5 😍",
Nothing better than learning and having transcribed videos with text showing its time frame. Useful for notes or just to catch up while watching.,
"Anyone who's looking for the fundamentals of almost every academic fields of study should download this app, don't expect anything too significant in more elevated criteria, such as computer science, which isn't the point of the app as much as it is to help more younger, uninformed/misinformed, elementary students that want to learn the BASICS of the courses provided.",
"Awesome, the way it has developed from Beta to current is mind bowing. Khan's academy's organic chemistry teaching is superb. Loved it",
"I loved it so much. Khan academy is doing amazing job by providing free education which is up to the level, it clears my all doubts , it's lectures are under NCERT coverage. Thanks SAL KHAN.😃",
It's great except that when you switch directions while scrolling it won't scroll unless you stop and trying again. Very very annoying,
You guys are really doing a great job 👍👍👍. Your application is really providing very high quality education free of cost. Really loved your work.,
"It used to be really helpful back in 12th grade,but these days,no matter what I type in the search box, it seems to not identify it Even a search as popular as microprocessors is left unidentified Please update and add more videos , because I find your teaching methods really effective :)",
"I am very happy to use this app. It a very nobel thing the KA team is doing putting out such rich and interesting learning content for free. Thanks a lot for that. Although I have came across an issue, I couldn't find ""My Courses"" in the android app or, any way to resume my study from app after web. Can you please that? Or, atleast point out if I am doing anything wrong?",
I got fascinated after a while of 1st lectures It is non-profitable organisation which demands of no money...unlike Byjus which of gives time lock after some lectures... Thank u Mr.Salman khan for unforgettable gift man... Lov u,
Wonderful app! The website and app are both amazing they contain everything you need to refresh your mind or learn new things. All with a fun incentivised way by use of badges. Recommend to all,
I love khan academy and I've been using it for a while. It gives you a base in the subject which your studying and then dives deep in to it. The reason why I'm giving star's is because I think it would be great to have video's on Indian chemistry. This is the only reason. I also need to mention the use of bookmarking video's so that we can later watch them. So far it is a great app and I as a student feel awesome to be using Khan academy.,
I wondered while watching the topics n all the topics which are mentioned are present in my syllabus....As the app is very interesting too n helped me a lot....I love it,
"Khan academy is great for learning but I could download the review articles. When I'm going through the topic I watch the videos but am unable to load the articles offline, which is where I learn most of my info from.",
One of the best educational app . It has both Indian as well as IB ( including AP) course for all grades .,
"Amazing app, and very useful as well as advantageous. Big thanks to Mr. Sal Khan for his dedication in educational world. I hope it could be a game changer in global education. Never imagine a free educational app such as this.",
I think the content is awesome including the way it is taught but inculcation of more visuals and animation would make learning even more fun. All over I like the app.,
Its amazing app i was searching for the same . I can make my study better by the help of khan Academy,
It is nice app but most of time it shows video cant load which is a great problems do something .,
I love it because it is quite informative. The only issue is i do not know how to download or study the contents offline.,
"Because of depression, I found it hard to concentrate on my exams. Now that I had found a way to cure my depression, I had to find a way to revise properly. Khan Academy is so fun and useful, it's helped me loads and I've learnt so much!",
"New update is not good class 11 maths and physics is removed, why? Please bring the old version which is before version 5.1.0 ,I am giving 5 star becose I love this app as it provides best study material but before version 5.1.0",
"One of the best apps out there for students who rely on Internet. Explains in an understanding and interesting way, hope it stays that way",
It would be better if you give class12 physics in Hindi language.Please try it so that more students can be benefited,
Very bad only maths subject for 10th class I want s.st or science,
Just wow... I learned more here than I ever did in all my years of education.,
A brilliant app.. And a very good thing to spread knowledge free of cost ..,
The app is crashing on 5.1 version please update it soon.,
In Quantum Mechanics the lessons are in complete quantum state is missing quantum entanglement is missing quantum system is missing and etc please can you please include all the lessons that are missing I don't know them I have only searched pls,
"I really like Khan Academy, but I'm having problems with my tablet version. For some reason some courses, like the Grammar one, aren't available on the tablet app and it doesn't have my bookmarks too.",
This is best app but i need improvement like adding j&k maths student plzzx sir,
"You are just fantastic! Not good work, GREAT WORK!",
This is the best educational app for me...I loved this app's videos and practice questions and is great.. Wish there could be biology too.All other apps in compare to this are ****,
It's help me learn what I needed to get my GED,
You can study the best in this platform than that of byjus. He is the one who can change the whole world,
Thanks for providing best quality lectures. It's better than Byju's,
Best learning app on the planet i found. Very good work. Thanku very much.,
It will help you with everything even collage courses that's how amazing it is.,
"while the app is good, it does not seem to categorize categorize math content by grade",
Best app for education!! But some topics for Indian 12th students are missing!! Hope you can add them too!!,
Nice app for learning😀and please install some interesting projects also,
explanations are very clear and precise and the format of the questions are good too,
This is the best education app and it is any day given better than byju's,
This is a great site for kids to learn. Great help. Thank you.,
Brilliant idea of Right To Education. Thanks to all the Dedicated teachers.,
I loved this app but I think some features are only available on website not in app,
Best app and site for entrepreneurs and people who thinks knowledge is the key,
Yes it is very useful it is 100 times better than byjus,
This app is very useful thank you so much I love it,
It is very good but recently it closes off on its own,
Content of Class 11 india was great but after availing Hindi you ROCKS Khan Academy,

"The app is amazing but a LOT of time the audio and video quality drops so 
down that it's not understandable and i have to watch the video in YouTube 
which kills the point of making an app. I don't think it's my phone or 
connection because it plays nicely on YouTube. I'm giving 5 stars because 
of free and very usefull content but the quality drop in app is a huge 
minus. Please fix this or give us an option to change the quality back up.",
"I tried doing some practice problems in the geometry section but the 
sensors are so sensitive when I use my fingers to slide the figure exactly 
in place. It kept telling me that I was wrong unless I get the figure 
exactly in place. Plus they don't have any practice problems available for 
Sat on mobile. Overall it's a bad mobile app.",
"Dear Salman Khan, I humbly down my knees and kiss your foot but it is not

"The app will inconsistently not load all the information in a lesson, which 
so far are images. The keyboard is also not user friendly, when trying to 
swipe to a new page, I often need to swipe through a number and half the 
time the swipe doesnt register and I end up entering asomething I dont want.",
"This app supposedly synchronizes with your progress on the Khan Academy 
website, but it does not. After logging in, it only shows whatever ""badges"" 
you've earned. There is no way to see what lessons you're currently working 
on. You have to remember what lesson you're currently learning on the 
website and find it in the app.",
"I've been using this because my older cousin recommended this to me to 
watch math tutorials from YouTube. From watching khan academy on their 
YouTube channel to their official app. And eversince I've been using their 
app which is absolutely marvelous!! I love the mini activity problems and 
you can download their tutorial video in just kbof data keep up the 
simplicity and !! Compared to math videos from YouTube which requires gb of 
data. Thank you again khan academy team!! I'm now in 10th grade of junior 
high school been using this since 8th grade. Keep it up! 👍",
"Extraordinary, Marvelous, Splendid!! Amazing UI, Awesome Teachers, 
Wonderful Experience!! Now this is called an Educational App. Few days back 
I lost my faith to do well in CAT as I found my self very weak in Geometry 
but after using this application I must say that now I am ready to face any 
challenge as we should never give up!! Thumbs up Khan Academy Team👍 for 
helping me recover my faith❤️",
"I love love love Khan so much, its a lifesaver as I study for my GED. Right 
now there is a problem where none of the exercises will work, only the 
videos play. (It says ""Error making task progress"") I really hope this can 
be updated and fixed soon. Then it'll be 5 stars! *edit* Problem fixed! 
Thanks so much:)",
"I don't really have words for you guy's. You guys changed my life!!! I 
learned a lot from Khan Academy that I never get to learn from any 
institution in my country. Salman Khan, I'm really inspired by you man. May 
God bless you, and you keep supporting the world like this! This 
organization really changed the world or will. Thank you for this really 
greatfull. Love from Pakistan.",
Khan academy is really great. But I'm having a little issue over here. Whenever I open a video the app crashes. Please help me.,
"It's a very nice app , helped me lot during my exams and also to learn

Carbon and compounds Is a very important topic in class 10{india} so you should provide a good video series for it.,
"Bless you guys deeply and richly. Changing the world with free, HIGH CALIBER, well-conceived education. This is the gift that won't stop giving. I'm so thrilled to live in the same time as this group.",
"This app has helped me learn so much about science and biology that I can't 
help but be indebted to the creators of the app for making it.",
"The app is great but please add more exam prep like JSTSE, it would be really helpful for students in India.",
Khan Academy is one of the best things to have happened to the internet. People like Sal should be awarded Nobel prize in Education. I know there is no criteria for Education in Nobel. Make one for him.,
Back button doesn't work while in home page of the app. No option to exit either. Very strange behaviour for such an application.,
"Strong foundation for any subject makes you enjoy it. Thanks to Khan

"Its a nice app but it can be made the best with adding more options and 
more contents. I will like to see the changes fast as possible",
"Love the app, but there seem to be some sychnig issues between what I do on 
the app and what I do on my lap top. Sometimes not everything syncs with 
the app. It'll say I haven't done things I have, for example. Other than 
that its great",
"This is the best app for me so far. I only hope for VIDEO QUALITY setting 
so I can save up more data :(",
"Video and audio is so bad, its not my phone trust me my device is up-to-date and is a Samsung s9.",
"This is the best learning app available. It would make the app perfect if 
you add class 12 chemistry (india) too.",

"Its very good but the only problem is i can't sing up..it says enter valid

I so glad that I am using this app for studies. Today I installed this application and it helped me to clear all my problems in Mathematics. But I have an Suggestion for developer. Please add Diploma Level Syllabus in your future Updates. Thanks alot for this awesome App.,

starting your classes in college. It helps you go back to the basics.",
"I actually really really love the site. No problem with teaching. I love

problem and then I will change my review.",
"I like it but I uninstalled because Facebook log in is broken and I can't

find how. It just says ask community which I've aready tried.",
"Practical . Helpful keep adding things . It's amazing. Thank you for making 
this app free. You give people free knowledge.",
"This app is superb, this app is helping all to get a free education anywhere . I'm learning math in this app, they are explaining were well",
"The best advantage I find in this app is that it is COMPLETELY FREE and a NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION, unlike byjus which charges a lot and gives only cbse curriculum and not icse and lies to us . Love this educational app.",
The app is great but try improving it by adding the dashboard feature found on the website .. add it as a section below next to the bookmarks button so that i can find my subjects more easily,
"I solved many problems in physics and in other subjects through this app 
very easily. Through the videos one can understand much better than a book.",
"I have been a member of the site for years and absolutely loved it. The app

"This app is really awesome it helps me alot like learning new things and i 
love like learning new things. Hope this app should be top in playstore 
sooner because they deserve it. More power !!! - from Philippines.",
"Khan is a great app to learn different subjects. It can be quite long and 
difficult to understand sometimes due to its academic nature but it's 
what's needed to learn really.",
"In my humble opinion if any app comes up to the mark of this app, it is 
really really worth trying for.",
"This is OK, I mean, my daughter got bored REALLY quickly with this, and the 
teachers we good sometimes. My daughter really hates math, so I guess if 
you are into math and things, this would be good for you.",
"The videos have a delay. I've uninstalled the app and then reinstalled the app but, the videos are still not playing in real time. I even connected to 5G internet speed and it still won't work!! I am watching the content on YouTube but, not all the videos are uploaded!!! So frustrating!!",
"A Highly informative app. Helps in your school works also! Highly 
recommended for students, plus I have not encountered a bug in this app 
ever since. Kudos to the people that made this app.",
"This app is helping me pass 7th grade!I'm excited about this app because I 
get to chose what I need help with and the guy tells you in a way you will 
understand.",
"You can learn anything.I am able to understand the concepts of science and 
electrical engineering in a short period using Khan Academy.Loved the 
app.👌👌👌👌",
Its very good app. It helps me to review the previous lessons . But in the new version I jst can't access physics 11th (indian curriculum). So plz fix it.,

"Very difficult to find things. App appears to have no universal navigation, 
no menus.",
Correct the login via Google error in the android version of the app.... Furious user,
"This app is educational and can help with almost any subject 📚. If you 
want to learn this app is great. if you want play a game then maybe you 
shoud find something else like ABC mouse; like my daughter used to play 
when she was a 3 year old. 😉)",
"Actually I had installed this app for my 11th and 12th grade preparation, And for the first week it was there, But suddenly the topics for the same were missing. .... THAT'S THE REASON I CANNOT RATE IT E BEST. Such changes must be informed",

If yes ... then please tell me that from where I can get these exercises for practise ... I am in great need of it...,

"It is of no use for me I am a commerce student and I can't find all of my 
subjects I asked my younger brother in class 7 to use it but he said I 
would rather study from book instead of this as he had no interest after 
using it",

"Some videos are old (ish). Interview with Elon Musk for example. He has 
since succeeded in some of the advancements mentioned in the interview. I 
was hoping for more interaction as well. I can watch videos any time. Only 
problem I had with the app was backing out. Ultimately, I had to view and 
close apps to get back to my home screen. The back button just didn't work. 
All in all though, I'm satisfied with the app.",
"I LOVE THIS APP! So just for everyone who keeps saying ""it's a boring 
game""... it's not a GAME guys it a helpful learning app... it is meant to 
help you not entertain you. If you want a game then look for math games not 
an app that is focused on tutoring kids to help them with math. I think 
this app is amazing and is very helpful... I LOVE IT!",
"It's like the the best study app ever I really love it due to it's varied 
topics and great explanations of each one . Moreover , these can be taken 
offline and all this for free Thanks a lot team Khan academy",
"It is better than my expectations. I want to say thank you for what you are 
doing for us to improve our knowledge. And the point it is FREE. you 
deserve something more than thank you. I hope the universe will fulfill 
your desires",
"Your app is so buggy I was mistaken an empty screen for a loading page. 
Please fix UI and the links, I wish it was great again ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ",
"The best Organization you can find for learning stuffs across disciplines. 
I have been using this for like 3 years now and it has a lot of knowledge 
content.",
"It changed my life and I hope to meet Sal as soon as possible to express my 
gratitude... Love you Sal",
"I think it is an awesome app for learning. You get video lessons, practice, 
and test to see how much you have learned.",
"This is a pretty good app and contains a good amount of content. I found 
the bookmarks option to be very nice but it'd be better if we could have 
sorting options such as: alphabetical order, ordered by time added, 
categorically (e.g. maths, humanities etc.) This way finding bookmarks 
would be a little easier if you have many.",
"I'm trying to open class 7th article though i have good internet connection 
that article is unable to open.",
"It is really Helpful and i can understand it properly.Thank you Khan 
Academy God Bless You,you are doing a great Job comparing to other learning 
apps having a lot of ads and having irrelevant contents,you are really 
doing a great Job..May You Live Long..",
"I just love this app. Everything is explained so simply, I wish teachers 
were able to do the same. Also, thank you for making possible to increase 
the speed of the video. ♥️",
"I love Khan academy. It has help me understand so much, but the app keeps 
crahing. I'm still giving it 5 stars but please fix this.",
"This app get me good overview concepts before I go in-depth in my lecture 
classes. And best of all, it's free!",
"Even though learning is a pain in the butt, it taught me a lot and help me 
get better grades! It has all the things you need to learn for all the 
grades and Beyond! Totally recommend it! 💜🌻",
"Pls fix the errors regarding the articles..It says "" Could not be loaded""

it for preparing for the SAT.",
The best thing I have ever experienced in my life,
"This app is great for catching up on missed lessons and staying ahead in my 
AP classes",
Time is limited and the time spent on khan academy is no doubt worth it.,
"All I get no matter what I click is error, error, error.",
i love bc it gives u what u need to learn such as math or reading,
You're Great Sal Khan. May Almighty bless ya!,
Great app! Looking forward to the back-to-school updates,
I liked this app but the English is to fast,
This app is awesome and I reccomend everybody to use it,
As a bangladeshi I always feel proud for Salman Khan.,
No doubt this app is soo helpful... Thank you,
This is the best learning app ever.,
Thanks for making education accessible to all thanks,
"Learning something? This is the best app for learning! This app is the only 
reason I use my tablet... As said, ""you can learn anything""...this app 
makes it possible...",
Best explanation you can find,
Thanks for hearing my request khan academy..but there is still a lot of bugs,
Thanks for the hard work and dedication.,
"This is paradise..... Thanks a lot for all that content for free...... 
Awesome....",
I loved it! It's the best app for me....,
It's better if you add *subtitles* option.,
Best of All .. It's Free,
The articles r crashing,

"The app is fantastic for review and learning new subjects. The issue is 
that it is incredibly buggy, it takes awhile to load videos, sometimes the 
video won't play with the audio, other times I won't get completion points 
for finishing a video (this is a small problem, but still one of many). 
This app deserves five stars, except it has so many bugs.",
"Will forever share Khan Academy with friends and family. I believe what Sal 
has provided here is an incredibly generous gift to mankind. There's so 
much information readily available and content being added, it's great for 
all groups, I just can't say enough wonderful things about Khan Academy.",
"I would definitely give a 5 stars to this app if not because of the bugs. 
Pls. Fix the bugs. It is the only problem that I can find from this app. 
The app itself is so perfectly made for all ages to learn but because of 
their articles that won't open and their videos that will take too much 
time to load, it is so frustrating. Pls. Take some some time to fix this 
app ASAP. Because just imagine how much effort you do just to make this app 
and then it will just be a waste if you won't fix it. (P.S. I'm talking to 
the developers of this app.) So pls. pls. pls. I'm looking forward for a 
better app soon.",
"Its interesting but please make it more visually appealing. Add some 
animations, visualizations etc. I think I understand why some calls it 
""boring"", its just writing, writing and more writing (well on the math 
part). We are fed up with traditional teaching at school (talking and 
writing), we need something motivating maybe, something different. A 
different approach or something. Kudos!",
"This app would be great if it worked properly. Every time i try to take a 
unit test, the app stops working. Also some of the quizzes i can't complete 
because the drop down boxes won't pull up the characters. Therefore i can't 
input anything in the boxes and finish the test.",
"This is by far the best educational app that I've come across for school 
learning. I uninstalled Byju's and stuck to Khan Academy because you can 
simply find out the difference for yourself if you check even class VII 
content.",
"I am a big fan of khan academy and used to spend hours on the website. Now I use the app version, which is pretty great. I just wished it was more organized and less buggy. I also cannot access my previous data from what I used to watch on the website although the account is the same and I am sure of that because the username, the medals and energy points are the same. Please fix that.",
"I love it. This app provides education for all ages and because i felt fun 
learning the provide topics and problem solving thing. I suggest that you 
add a another topic under the earth geological and climatic history. The 
topic i wish to add is Continental Drift and Raisin theory or the Isostacy. 
I was kinda hoping that it was there when I open the earth geological and 
climatic history because there's the plate tectonic theory explained.. so i 
wish you add this topics and when you add them can you pinpoint some flaws 
of that theory? That's all i wish under the earth geological and climatic 
history.",
"At first I want to make clear I love khan academy in a browser on my 
desktop. The app seems totally unusable though. Creating a bookmark didn't 
download the chapters it contained. And some exercises where working but 
some just don't open at all or give and error. Quizes start as a blank page 
and articles don't load. I tried it on wifi and mobile data with or without 
loading it as a bookmark. I also tried removing app and cache data and when 
that didnt work I tried reinstalling... Still the same.",
"Really helpful for using on the go. Can download episodes so you can watch 
them without using your mobile data. Would benefit from being able to 
download the videos at higher resolutions. Have had various crashes when 
trying to press the 'bookmark' button next to subjects. New update changed 
the colour scheme, it is now more difficult to see which videos have been 
watched and which have not.",
"Makes me more focused and I can learn my most favorite subjects without the 
frightening effect of terror teacher's presence just about every year. 
Contents are updated, relevant and there are links to researches. Kudos to 
developers!",
"It's an amazing app and it has been really helpful with learning physics. 
It would be great if you included more video about particle physics 
including quarks, antiparticles, leptons, mesons, strangeness etc. I'm 
really interested in learning more about fundamental particles. Thank you 
for making this free to use!",
"I would have liked it, but since I'm a registered Khan Academy user, I have 
pending lessons I need to get to. In the app, there is no way for you to 
access those lessons and see your progress. Please fix this and I will 
definitely install this app again.",
"I love this app, it's been helping me with math and us history. in school I 
was ahead of my social study's class. I also think sal's voice is very 
calming, and makes learning easier when your i a bad emotional state",
"Amazing educational app. Thanks to khan academy team and sal personally I 
say you are a treasure man, may God keep you safe.",
"It is the one of the best free learning app which is free of cost and 
everything is superb.I can't have any words to describe it.No learning app 
can stand in front of this as comparing to provide free study material to 
the students.It is the blessing for those children who's financial 
condition is bad and could not afford any coaching or institute.Thanks to 
developers who developed this application.",
"I should give 5 stars but the problem is that I am not able to give test 
series after every video that is provided.... Plz tell me the problem 
#khanacademy",
"I love this app it's very useful. Most of all in breaking things down . You 
can pause and rewind and so easy and clear to understand . Without the 
pressure of asking a professor to repeat themselves a thousand times so you 
can understand .",
"Thought I'd get SAT prep done here instead of in browser. Wrong. Only 
videos are shown in app, can't do any quizzes in here. Save yourself the 
storage and just use the website.",
"The best app for self learning. Khan Academy helped me throughout my 
professional degree and I continue to gain more knowledge to this day.",
"It's really a very helpful app.. khan academy is really doing a great job 
helping many students like us get access to such beautiful learning free of 
cost.... Thank you!",
"The tests keep freezing. I even tried a wrong answer to try to get to the 
next question and it still says ""checking"" and stays like that. More 
concerning is that it said my wrong answer was right while it said it was 
checking.",
Awesome initiative... Would have been more helpful if Questions fir JEE AND IITS ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION... anyway thanks,
"Wonderful app for education . Mostly for concepts ,are very clear . TRULY 
LOVED THIS APP and also it's process of evaluating after every topic is 
wonderful.",
"For idiots who said it was ""Boring"" This app is for educational purpose. 
This is not a game. Go ahead and uninstall this app, you didn't deserve it. 
Play minecraft instead.",
"It's very good and help full I like the app but it can sometimes be 
annoying and it sometimes I said sometimes gets boring I can only stay on 
it for two hours or less.",
"The answer format should be specified in quizzes, i.e, fraction, decimal 
etc. Otherwise, it's a pain going through every single possibility.",
"Khan academy is great. Too bad if you dont use Google play, they 
discriminate against you and don't allow you to get the app. Host your app. 
wth. not everyone has Google play and I don't want to get the app from an 
unofficial source, nor use your website. Weak. Reach more people by making 
your app more readily available.",
"This is really helpful for international students but it takes a long time 
to play videos.You really should try it if you are international school 
student.",
"UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE DO NOT GET THIS APP IT SUCKES IT HAS SOOOOOOO MANY 
BUG U CAN'T GET THROUGH 1 LESSON WITHOUT A BUG 1 STAR NEVER GET THIS APP 
EVER I CAN'T EVEN UNDER STAND THE VEDIOS BECOUSE OF THE GUY NEVER GET THIS 
I AM SO ANGERY😠😡😡😡😠",
"Amazing teacher... No buddy can do a better job He loves to teach and is a 
pure minded teacher for sure",
"I like the app, but there are some bugs I'd like to point out: sometimes 
the videos don't check as seen, when I jump from a video to an exercise, it 
doesn't work, the app starts to shake, and in those exercises where I have 
the option of not filling any blank it doesn't check",
"It used to be much easier to see which videos/articles I hadn't done yet. 
The check marks make it much harder to see this at a glance than when the 
icons used to be coloured vs. grey. Please bring that back.",
"I just got this app, and I may need to change some settings, but as far as 
I can tell there is no scratchpad of any sort. Normally when I am on my 
phone I don't have paper near me and I don't want to use paper if they 
could just have a scratchpad this would probably be 5 stars. Please fix!",
"This app is good. But the library can not be edited like if you want 
organize the subjects. Like you can change the sequence of the tutorials in 
the library.",
"Guys Better Download Khan, It Has No Limit In Any topics, but byju's do So 
better use khan and improve your knowledge. Cheers to knowledge",

this app even better and that's what's keeping me to give this app 5 stars.",
"I love it! Khan academy is as only great as it's ever been, but that's only 
because there's almost no way to make it better.",

tutorials. And I wanna advise people not to hate this app. It is gradually 
developing.",

load. Please look into that.",
"I love how this is all free.. I had trouble finding apps free for learning 
thx a lot",
"The best, free for all, easy to use, and the most amazing teaching app out

major that will really suit me before I commit to it on paper.",
"This app really helped me learn a lot... I found physics difficult but this 
app made it easy for me to learn and understand the concepts of physics... 
I think that SOUND should also be introduced under class 9 for physics",
"I think this app is great but I think it could be better if there's a 
caption on the video directly rather than a transcript so that I could 
watch the video in full screen. I hope this could be done in the next update",
"Was really excited for this, but the app doesn't seem to have the ability 
to assign me problems based on my skill level the way the website does... 
Bummer!",
"It's already awesome...can u plz add subtitles and animations that being 
said u know it's kinda confusing to know where to start from If only u

to be fixed.",

Seniors). Have now made it into calculus and am really enjoying it for

app :)",
"The updates like IIT-JEE, class wise syllabus for India and college careers 
and more section are just fantastic!",

and grasping to the students.",

platform is amazing. You will find engaging content for every sort of 
fields. Best explanation. Totally free app for your education. I will be

most of the times it doesnt loads but at the same time it loads on web app 
so the fault might be in android app fix it. Once again Thanks fir having 
such a great idea.",

"Why can't I find the tests I already took? I can find it in computer in 
their site and review it as many times as I want, but they don't have that 
section in their app or what?",
Future education 🔥🔥🔥,
Bangla language,
Ok,
Super,
THANKS,
"It's a great helpful app for clearance and mastering of basics ,I am very thankful for this astounding and appreciable app.",
"I'm very glad to find this application. This has been very, very helpful to 
my education. Specifically in Math. 😁",
Thank you so much! Very intuitive design and informative lessons!,
The Education Of The Future!,
Thank You So Much,
Very innovative,
The best,
"It looks like this app is still in development. I ran into multiple bugs 
and things that seemed like bugs (no sound with correct answers), back 
button failing, not being able to scroll screen on math questions, etc. The 
worst part of this app is it doesn't show your progress which is extremely 
improtant so you don't get lost. I love the website, and I won't use this 
app until I can, at the very least, keep track my progress.",
"First thing I wanted to recover my account as I had forgotten the password 
but the process wouldn't complete. And now after I connected it to my FB 
account I am having problems accessing the articles. I can bookmark and 
download the videos but I can't do that with the articles. I can't even 
read them online. It says probelm loading the article and does not even try 
to explain what kind of problem it is so it gets even more irritating.",
"This is a wonderful app for anything! I have been layed up because of 
surgery, but this has been truly splendid for my academic activity in math. 
I must admit, the science videos don't make much sense, but that's normal 
for me. I don't quite enjoy science, and I'm not good at it either. Well 
now I am good at it because of this app. I'd like to say a big thanks to 
Sal Khan! I highly recommend this app.",
"I would like to get more help with operations with minus and changing signs  it would be really helpful,and i would like to see anything more complex  and more in depth maybe send more wikipedia links or something.Cramer's  formula,mayer's relation and the monotony table and the techniques for  making graphs of limits are missing,aside.. Its a really great app for  learning,and its free,something we dont get to see too often these days, it  it's very well made, theres a lot of effort to provide us learning,we  should be thankful for it,i am",
"The reason I am rating this a 2 star because it keep crashing in a middle 
in a lesson, every time a finish a video it do not count as progress, and 
everytime in halfway done with a exercise it just stops and will not let me 
continue. But this is a very good and educational app.",
"Khan Academy helps me a lot in learning lessons I didn't even get to 
understand when in school. I love how I'm understanding every lesson 
thoroughly with the videos, quizzes, and unit tests this application 
provides. I'm taking college entrance exams soon and this is my own way of 
reviewing alone. Wish me luck!",
"I love it, I use the actual website on my PC. I've been trying to brush up 
on my math skills for a college placement test and it's been extremely 
helpful plus you can learn SO much more than just one or two things. I 
HIGHLY recommend everyone try this app.",
"I love it and so does my 7 year old son. In the car he loves doing the math 
courses and showing me his test scores. Such a great resource. We had ABC 
mouse but he would get distracted decorating the kids room and shopping 
with his points. This removes those distractions and leaves the learning!",
"Best learning app out there on play store the interface is clean it make 
basic to harder level of any subject easy to understand in bit easy and 
fantastic way. I can not express my views in writing that how much i loved 
this app. Thanks you the creator of this app Who made online learning so 
much fun.",
"Great lessons with videos, text and exercises. However, links in lessons to 
other lessons open in chrome instead of the app. This needs to be fixed as 
lessons followed on chrome don't show up as current lesson in the app. I 
would also like to see more easily which ""courses"" I'm working on in the 
overview of a subject (give them another colour maybe?) Lastly, at the 
moment I'm not able to make an account.",
"I think that it is a great app but could be better as the software gliches 
quite a lot. You should make it more like your website, fun, interactive 
and way more user friendly than the app. BTW great concept sal, the lessons 
and exercises help me a lot with the troubling concepts in school.",
"This app is really good for many people but I need a course on anthropology 
which is not there, there are videos of it but I need a course of it. If 
things like that are integrated into different subjects such as quantum 
mechanics, geology etc it'll be greatly helpful to everyone.",
"Can't link to my Khan Academy via Google account, keeps giving an error. I 
created a new account online to test then tried logging into the app, says 
invalid password. I try the exact same password online and it logs in. Did 
this three times to ensure I was not typing password wrong. Kind of useless 
of we can't link our account with all its history.",
"This app is simply awesome, you can learn anything by free in the best 
possible way. Im learning Biology and Chemistry to prepare for the 
university entrance test of Iran, and this app helps me alot. So thanks to 
Mr. Khan and others for helping me out. and sorry for my English.",
"Grt initiative. There is one problem in the app, we can't practice for SAT 
in the app we have to so it online. If i am wrong kindly inform me how to 
do it and if i am right kindly try to make required upgrade for above 
stated problem.",
"It breaks my heart. Such an incredible concept but it will go nowhere with 
me. One thing about me is that I have to complete things thoroughly. The 
thing that drives me nuts is that Khan academy is awful at keeping your 
progress. One minute I've mastered addition, the next I have to do all the 
boring quizzes and unit tests AGAIN to get 100% and I'm sick and tired of 
doing basic math when I know I could be doing advanced maths and sciences. 
PLEASE fix this!!! It's wasting my time!!!",
"Love the idea , I wouldn't definitely volunteer but I need to get there 
first .I wish the app had a option to save on SD card instead of internal 
memory my cheap tab doesn't have much space. Peace",
"It's like a miracle t9 me because I am failing math to an f now i have a b 
thx Khan acadamy",
"This app is absolutely amazing. The only thing I ever needed was to learn 
mathematics from the beginning. This is the perfect solution. I can't thank 
you enough. :)",
"No doubt a great app to educate yourself about something. However, I prefer 
the website better. Would definitely recommend to anyone who thinks they 
have a better attention span than a goldfish (since it can be boring at 
times.)",
"This isn't just one of those crappy little school apps. This really 
explains how to do things and gives you free educational videos to burn the 
things into your mind. Because of Khan Academy, I got to skip 6th grade 
mathematics!",
"I am just in love with this app. All a student needs is a great way to 
learn and know anything that they want. And it allows us to do everything. 
Me and my friends always use this app to clear our doubts about any subject 
and topics.",
"It's a brilliant app, everything works nicely on mobile except for the 
keyboard when typing a maths quiz. When you try to slide from one side to 
the other, it invariably types in another character and messes up the 
equation",
"The app is great, it helps a lot especially with history and math but every 
time I get to one trig question it says ""checking"" after it says I got the 
answer right and hangs so now I can't practice trig reciprocals or continue 
with the unit test",
"Don't get me wrong, Khan academy is great. The app lacks the detail in 
tracking progress that the webpage has, so it makes it harder to know where 
you left off and to utilize both efficiently.",
"Nothing interesting. Nothing good to learn. Just a terrible unnecessary app 
for me. Just deleted it. Absolutely hated it(nothing that I need about 
computer science)",
"Great app, I've been learning calculus and making amazing progress. But 
certain questions crash when I try to enter my answer and I cannot figure 
out how to enter pi for the integration modules. Help on this would be 
greatly appreciated",
"It's a great app and really shows you can learn anything, no ads or 
anything a bunch of kids give this 1 star as they don't see true value in it",
"App keeps shutting off, downloads thing that are deleted and wont download 
the things i want.THIS app is trash... Just go to the site on Google or 
chrome",
"Great app of Khan Academy. Everything is great so far but I would give 5 
stars only if you would support sync that lets you continue what you've 
finished on PC.",
"Awesome app great content but searching for somethings we may not able to 
find them but best app plz keep it free always.",
"I like using this app because the way they explain stuff makes it easy for 
me to understand what I'm learning. I also like this because if I don't 
know how to do something at school, this app is what I can use. This is 
also a good study tool to use.",
"It's awesome for learning basics and to clear concepts but lately I am 
having trouble in article section. The check button is not working under 
this section. Kindly update soon",
"Anyone can use it easily and the explanation are very easy to understand, 
almost it covers whole thing in mathematics that you want to learn. Thanks 
a lot Khan sir for making this app",
"This new one is not so good for student trying to learn an exect topic. 
Suppose to start algebra 1 in 8th grade. And. I cant see it anywhere.",
"Amazing App. You can review your concepts you have learned in your school. 
Also useful for first time learners. One of the best learning app I have 
used",
"In math is unable to finish test. Drop down menu isn't working on tablets. 
In chemistry you have to remember examples to answer questions. It's not 
about knowledge.",
"This is app is very good. But this app can be more good if we can ask 
different type of questions. Otherwise it is the best learning app. Keep it 
up",
"Not Working On Galaxy A8 It Continuously Shows ""Unfortunately Khan Academy 
Stops Working""😠😠😠😡. Please Fix It As Soon As Possible",
"It cannot save offline the article which is the most important I'll change 
my ratings if you will improve it.",
"Best free learning app. If you want to learn and understand the concept 
then this is for you. The teaching way is good and brilliant minds are with 
you here. You can download videos of learning and can watch it offline. It 
is 100% free learning g portal.",
"Mind blowing app I never saw a app like this. It's really helpfull to all 
pupils in the world.",
"Best part of this app is great video explanation on every topic. It would 
be more useful if you can provide more number of questions",
"The Real application that makes the use of technology in a positive 
way..Truly a gift for knowledge seekers..Hats off to devolopers and Beloved 
Khan academy Team..",
"This app is making me mad because I get the right answer on my notes and on 
the app it says that is is wrong 😡😡😡😡",
"I like this app. And i'm using this app to study for my 12 class. The 
videos are interactive. Just the Bad Thing is that the chapters are need to 
be updated. So please add and update the chapters.",
"App is useful, I like using it. This app makes studying easier. Just 
disappointed in the constant crashes and won't load the subject after 
picking, the app asks me to refresh because my session has timed out. 
Please fix this bug!",
"Dear Khan Academy, I am very thankful to you for providing us such amazing 
app with in-depth lectures and your various college guidance videos are 
very helpful, but it would be great if there were more lectures on 
chemistry, topic like hydrogen, Mole, Carbon and it's compound. ~ Thank you",
"They really need to fix the network error issue when you click on the get 
help link in the quizzes. If they dont fix that im not going to use this 
for much longer.",
"This is a very nice app. FREE. But you should add an option of downloading 
a single article or video. Over a all its the best learning app.",
"I think u have done a really great job salman sir... N this add nd ur 
videos ae very much helpful for the students like uss 😊",
"I think it's a helpful and innovative app that makes learning more 
digestible. My only gripe is that the LSAT course is not available on the 
app yet.",
"This app is amazing. It helped me pass college math and I use it now to 
help my children as this app is extremely user friendly. They both have 
IPADs so they can watch it on the go especially during the summer. I also 
like the ability that could make their accounts so I can track their 
progress.",
"I loved this app because this app helped me a lot in maths and science. I 
can clearly assure that this app is much better than byju 's",
"The new update is so rubbish, it removed unit percentage completion 
indicator. I cannot see my progress in physics and chemistry. Pls bring 
this functionality back.",
"App was great for learning math but after the new update I can't get the 
lessons to work and I also can't get a hint for help without it crashing. 
Fix it and it will be a 5 star",
"I regretted updating the app. The old version stored bookmarked/downloaded 
video topics on SD(memory card) which was better unlike the current 
version. I deleted, reinstalled, rebooted phone . Not downloading. Problems 
persist . Pls kindly fix it.",
"It's not a bad app, but it doesn't do what I need it to. I'm in a PSAT prep 
class and we're requires to do SAT practice problems but I can't figure out 
how to do them on the app. I have to do them in the browser. So I have no 
use for this app.",
"It has really helped me a lot with lot many concepts which I couldn't 
understand in the class.",
"It's pretty good except that I can't use the keyboard to complete quizzes 
and exercises. I find it unwieldy.",
"click on topic title in video page then the app will crash. I'd rather use 
the browser, this app is useless.",
"You retards whoever says its a boring game you should learn how to read cuz 
it says ""academy"" not most amazing gamebin the world so if you your jusy a 
winer just keep it to your self its not like anyone wants to hear your 
nonsense!",
"just amazing. I have learned many things with this app. Thank you khan 
Academy.",
This app does not work. Too bad. It closes before I can do anything at all.,
"Very useful, but lags every time I download topics.",
"I'll give five stars if the app can really use without wifi or internet 
connection. But the app is good and helpful.",
"you do good work man. i am commerce student but now i also study science 
😃😃 for free of cost. thats great.",
"A very useful app but khan academy has to widen its topics and subjects. 
Absolutely needed for the contemporary students.",
"Well... the videos don't help me, all that much. A lot of the time, the 
videos don't get through to me so well because, they are usually only 
explained in one way. Sometimes, the even go too fast!",
"Fantastic app; it would be even better if I could edit the order of 
bookmarks rather than leave them in chronological order and if I could 
bookmark pertners (e.g. Pixar in a box, NASA...)",
"Very good tutorials but the app is awful - in quiz menu it crashes a lot 
and the keyboard in practice mode is really annoying. There is no way to 
switch between keyboard's tabs without tasting random keys",
"I used Khan Academy to brush up on math skills I've forgotten over the 
years. I needed to pass the math portion of my certification exam and 
studying with Khan Academy helped me prepare and pass with confidence. The 
videos are like being in a virtual classroom and practice quizzes helped 
prepare for the final unit test.",
"Best learning app in the world. Just missing eats to connect with my son 
through it. We both should be able to share knowledge and invite each other 
to learn stuff.",
"Couldn't find things after the layout changed. Thanks for the help Khan 
Academy!",
"I've been using this for years and now I decided to download the app for 
fast access and been very useful to me especially now that I'm going to 
college I'll gonna need something like this to rely on thank you very much 
keep up the good work and God bless",
"This is very helpful and easy to use, I'm a pharmacist and using this app 
makes me understand many concepts in a very easy and time-saving way. 
Thanks a lot",
"This app is extremely helpful for anybody of any age! If your using it for 
yourself or to help someone else you will find all the content inside very 
useful.",
"Just the best app ever, been using khan academy for 5years now I first read 
about it in Readers digest and it has helped me since to clear concepts and 
practice exercises . Best free app out there and the method and technique 
is 100%",
"This is worst app, they trying to promote their religion and name title 
,Khan, by using knowledge and academics",
"Who says the best things in life aren't free? This app is simply 
incredible. Decades of information at your fingertips to learn at your own 
pace.",
"Sal is amazing. However, this App needs a major overhaul. It needs to be 
more accessible like the webpage. As of now, finding topics is almost 
impossible and videos are all over the place. Many topics are also missing 
in the App but are available in the website.",
"I like being able to study on my own, but it's just too big and my phone 
slows to a crawl. This morning I can't even open Google. Uninstalling.",
"Finally I got what I have been looking for, from the time I got this app. I 
am relieved man now. Thank you Khan academy team.",
"Finally someone came forward for a good cause(free,quality online education)",
"The most amazing educational math app I have ever found. This app shows me 
step by step in all common core math and some! Absolutely love this app for 
studying and learning. I could use this app for school in my opinion.

is I learned to prioritize... a very big THANK YOU to Mr. Sal!!",
"Very nice initiative and well managed good content,best,far better than 
other costly and not worthy apps",
Bad and useless app because video take too long to load .either is good,
"Every student in the world should have this app because Its great and in 
fact learning here is free and good.",
"Woooow!!!!! What a learning app. Fell in love with this. But the app should 
be more simplified. And there should be more written things then video. 
Examples are great. Only the person speak in the videos says English too 
fast.",
"The way everything is being explained in this app is just awesome. It makes 
even maths easy to understand",
"Khan academy is doing a great job in helping people learn. But there are 
few unexpected failures in the app version. But still love it",
"I love this app because I'm learn lots of thing from this and the second 
best part is no ads, no need subscribe or pay for any rupee Thanks Khan 
academy app and makers",
"The app is great but why don't you give a tutorial of solving quadratic 
equations with completing square method",
"The best learning app you can find on this planet! Very simple yet crisp 
user interface, low data usage and thankfully no ads. Easy to understand 
lessons, examples and ample tests. Truly appreciate the Khan Academy 
movement!😊",
I've always struggled with division until now. Thank you developers!,
"This app explains everything in a easy and comfortable manner thereby makes 
the topic easier to us .This app did make a difference in my grade ,in my 
opinion it's a good app.",
It is way better than byjus.it is one of the best educational apps available in the market and is way better than those pricey ones.,
"Content is good. Unit tests suck in math because can't swype keyboard 
without selecting a number or function on the keyboard.",
"I use this website for my tutoring students. I would love to be able to 
check their progress in the go through the app. I am always on the go. I 
wish I didn't have to keep telling my students that I will check their 
progress later. Can you add this feature to the app or create one for 
coaches?",
"Actually i have a good opinion on this app but i think this app is best for 
students upto 12th for engineering students this is not much helpful..",
"content is good but app feature damn bad . there is no option to change 
video quality . and also I am not able to download video . not everywhere 
internet speed is good . so video option is required to make your app 
international .I had requested to add video quality option in this a year 
before but nothing was done until now . also for downloading there will 
option to in this app and the app server is very slow video buffer . but it 
is not the case with YouTube YouTube works fine",
"I like the app on the phone because it let's me Explore everything I want 
to but when I go on the computer it limits me and only let's me look at 
certain ones and I don't want that. How can I fix it to be able to explore?",

"Overall the app is wonderfull but it has a few problems that need to be 
fixed for example the bookmark feature does not save videos for offline 
viewing ,even after I clicked a 100 times. That is a bug which needs to be 
fixed",
"The app is very useful for students, but hope will have more video of each 
part to learn!❤",
"Khan Academy has been VERY helpful in improving my math skills. However, I 
started using it before I downloaded the app, and I can't seem to find my 
progress anywhere. If you don't have this issue, you should totally 
download the app.",
"Exceptionally Outstanding App! There is multiple courses, and they're all 
free! I take the courses just for fun, and they end up paying off! You get 
to learn stuff in your own environment! Perfect for school! The videos are 
excpetionaly comprehensive and incredibly helpful. This is such an 
exemplary app! Amazing!",
"Awesome app. Great for brushing up on many subjects, or just learning 
altogether new things. FREE!",
"No sé vale, cerró mi sesión y no me avisó, estaba estudiando y cuando 
quiero ver mi progreso ¡me pide iniciar sesión, lo hago y veo que no hay 
nada registrado! Además cuando la coloco en pantalla completa el audio se 
distorsiona, no me permite bajar la calidad del vídeo y además para repetir 
el vídeo consume muchos y más datos, yo no tengo acceso a WiFi ¿por qué no 
es como antes? Antes usaba algo de la memoria RAM. Quiero estudiar 
estadística pero los temas están desordenados.",

website preferable.",

by step after I have answered a question",
"Best for kids or anyone in life it made me accomplish quizzes in life

"Okay the idea is awesome, but why can't I record my progress? I need to see

I won't be able to keep the track of my study it would be useless for me 😞",
"This app is the best! There are so many subjects in it, especially if

Khan academy is the best it helped me to overcome phobias of some topics,

subjects - like Math 1, Computer Programming, etc? When that happens, I'll 
change this yo five stars!",

"Thanks a lot for making Khan Academy. I love learning, and Khan Academy is 
definitely a great education resource. It's free is yet another biggest 
advantage. Since I use it on a cell phone, I cannot use the Khan Academy 
Website properly on it. With the latest update; the Quiz and Unit Test 
features were added in the App; which I were not available in the app. I 
request you to add the other features available on the Website as well so 
that I can learn properly.",
"I love the app. It's even better than the website. I love the bookmark 
feature though it would be nice if I could group them somehow. For people 
like me who have a lot of bookmarks it makes it easier to search for them. 
But anyways, GREAT JOB GUYS, BEST APP EVER.",
"Intermediate circulatory system quiz is terrible. All the right answers are 
wrong and it keeps glitching. proficient explaining of subjects. Sub par if 
not horrible at answering feedback and fixing problems. After ""bug fixes 
and improvements"", these problems weren't fixed.",
"This is the world's best app ever, I can't believe how someone can give you 
everything for free, I mean NO ADS...No FEE, I can't explain the goodness 
of the App and people working backend. Just wish that God bless you all and 
give everything you desire",

tests)for IIT-JEE",
"Good. It is lucky that it was free. We can learn anything by this. 
Chemistery, physics, etc. I recommend you if you are during in testThis 
needs to be installed for everyone!:) I",
"Tried it out by taking a few of the physics quizes. The questions are easy 
enough that I was able to get most of them right without a calculator 
despite being relatively unintelligent and uneducated and they also 
repeated 2-3 times per quiz so a 10 question quiz would only have 3-4 
unique questions. Has a lot of potential but needs more testing and 
moderation..",

a share feature to the app.",
I love this app. It helps me a lot in studying. It helped me improve my grades in maths. This app is very nice. INSTALL IT!,

So helpful,

Tnx for this,
"Definitely the best free studying app available. I tend to daydream in 
class a lot,so this has really helped me-when I come home,I can find what I 
need to learn and the content is explained so well I understand everything 
better and I actually enjoy my study sessions. I hope this app continues to 
grow and makes more great content regularly.",
"Spent ages searching for my computer programming course but unable to find 
it. I went back to the PC and deleted the app.",
"Learned Back in 2014. Math then Science. Took 5 years, had lots of time do 
to Epilepsy.",
"Why isn't the comment system implemented in mobile yet? It's been years, 
it's just baffling. Also if you supported Alipay donations I would have 
donated long ago, I think most students in China agree.",
"Great, although the calculator is sensitive. If I were to swipe, the button 
would respond and the character would be shown.",
"Interface is awesome. The one thing I am facing is sync issue. Web and app 
version are not synced",
"I'm under 13 and I downloaded this app to revise for my SATs. Because of my 
age, I made an account on the website but I can't get my account on the 
app. It keeps saying that my password is invalid and when I go to change it 
it says that my parents email isn't assigned to an account. Except from 
having to use the website and not the actual app I enjoy it greatly.",
"It's hard to use and for math it explains but difficult to comprehend 
perhaps a more visual step by step would be a lot useful",
"These people are doing gr8 job . Teaching so muh valuable information for 
free that is quite appreciated.thx khan academy",
"you are the best sir. please make available the ability to change video 
quality in the app. thanks a lot. u r awsome",
"Excellent, App is excellent,providing such good videos for free. This app 
helps a lot",
"Someone recommend this app to me and after researching a lot about Khan 
academy I downloaded this and this is out of my imagination and it changed 
my thinking about free apps. A big thank you to Khan academy from my side",
"The maths india curriculum is not visible in my app but visible in my frnds 
app",
"This app is very useful app I have not ever seen the study app like Khan's 
acafy",
"Great app For learning or catching up On thing u might have forgotten 
Amazing that this is free",
"Best thing ever on the internet...i don't get it why the hell are these 
people calling it boaring?!....come on if you really wanna learn something 
from it then it's the coolest app in the world",
Brilliant app must buy .Don't need my crappy teachers anymore,
Excellent app for our generation and it'll be useful for the next gen also,

"The site is much better than the app.  If I scroll through my assignments that the teacher assigned me, it'll constantly glitch back up to the front and if I want to go through assignments I completed to look back on something, I have to go through all the incompleted ones first.  They should be in two different categories.  I wish the app had the same setup/format as the site, it would be much better.",
"Honestly the people who call it ""boring"" have not sat through a lecture before. The team at Khan Academy made a really well designed app to backup their content. It has does everything you require of the mobile app and really aids your learning. All without locking it behind a paywall. Well done.",
"Boring and redundant are watchwords here.  Functionally, this app serves as a Khan Academy video search engine and player.  Liken to a Ford Fiesta of the PlayStore carpark: compact, austere, and definitely not a hit with the ladies.  Save that valuable drive space on your Android device (cannot park the Fiesta on the SD card) and cruise KA with your favorite browser instead.",
It's the best app for education in free Really no one provides this quality education in free It is helping me a lot in maths 10 CBSE India. Quizzes challenges many more in free is very helpful who can't afford tuition or any other learning app Thank you Khan academy team.😊,
"Just love the way you guys teaches via the talk through, quizzes, challenges, and the projects...  Tried to compare other platforms but came back to realize that khan academy is the best, thanks for the app too haven't used it but already got too many experiences from the website and it was superb.   Thanks a lot.",
"My bookmarks which I have downloaded carefully overnight have suddenly disappeared fro, my device. I did not do anything that would make the downloaded bookmarks disappear and I have no clue why that has happened. Now, I am currently downloading  the bookmarks I once have in my device and will take ages to finish. Iam disappointed to why thus has happened and hope this can be fixed soon.",
"The app does not make it easy to pick up where you left off in a course. 
The content is great but finding it in the app is not intuitive. The 
profile section should have a list of your lessons in progress and 
completed lessons. Instead it is just a display of your ""energy points"" 
whatever those are.",
"Wow! I am so happy with the ease of getting around with this app. I will 
say here, it is still new to me; but, so far, I'm feeling very grateful to 
be able to learn Chemistry from the videos, along with an interactive text 
transcript. If you get lost - just back up, using the segmented transcript 
- and continue on! Thank you for this opportunity. I have to say, you'll 
get out of this, exactly what you put into it, so, it's up to you!",
"**Love the app - use it to study 2 hrs a day - right at the equations and expressions part in pre-algebra the excersises stopped working. Please help me with this problem, I have a deadline to study for to pass a college quiz :( **  -if this happens to you try uninstalling, then re-installing the app. May have been an update but I've fixed it and it works fine now :D",
"It's obviously a great app...but would have better if it had a track record 
or a progress. That would even help me at any point of time and would let 
me know my statistics,i.e.,what I am upto",
● Is should allow users to copy or select word to get the meaning. ● caption can be on screen with separate space ● better if material  like taxation etc are focused on other countries too ● and last one but not a big one LANGUAGE. Its consume time to learn if it's in another language you're not familiar with  These are not issues but suggestions if authorities consider.   It's a good platform. What stuff it provides is descriptive enough. But I found limited topics.(I dint searched though)   Thanks! ~A Learner,
"Keeps telling me error making task progress, wont let me do any quizzes or anything of that nature. I love the app, i use it basically every day. Ill go back to 5 stars, but could someone fix pls. .-.",
"I like it for the most part but it's really frustrating taking a quiz and 
the bottom answer is covered up by the ""get a hint"" option, and you are 
unable to either see or choose that answer. Fix that and it could be 
considered perfect",
"I started it up with pre algebra just to be sure I could move forward with 
confidence. However, when I started on the second set of quizzes they only 
provided a single question. Placing the same answer 5 time does not a 
proper quiz make. Please fix so I can come to feel I actually know and 
understand the subject at hand. Just ran into a second problem. Hints have 
the tendency to cause the app to crash and either move the quiz forward and 
count as a missed answer or shut down the quiz entirely",
"Really useful application, great videos and explanations. I love this app. It would be a good idea to add ""Night mode"" or dark skin for users, or to add the possibility to change the background color while reading articles. Thank you guys for excellent application and enormous work you done!",
"Really I was a dropout student until i met with Khan Academy, although ive taken up arts and humanities ive never though that ill be back into science which is still one of my fav. This app gives systematic approach towards the learner and moreover the learning process is extremely easy to understand. I feel sad that i cannot donate because im still a student but looking forward at the future ill make sure i do. I cannot thank enough to these guys!",
"this is the best learning app I think. and also their pronunciation is very 
good. but problem is, it downloading is too slow though my internet speed 
is super fast",
"The web version has a comment section, could you please add this feature 
too on the app version. Despite this little missing feature, KA is a very 
convenient and informative app. I'm a university student and this app is 
very useful. Well done Khan academy.",
Absolutely awesome app. Cannot retry the  practices. I have to exit then go back in. Other than that it is the best for learning chemistry.,
"The best learning app. Ever. The only thing I would suggest is a foreign 
languages course.",
App was unresponsive in the highest. Could not scroll through anything when I wanted to--app would instead change pages to something else. Could not click when I wanted to--app would instead scroll wildly. Eventually app became completely unresponsive. Persisted through all app launches.,
Best education app. The explanation technique is wonderful and awfully effective. These encourage students to learn more.👍,
"Please address the bug that results in the inability to scroll far enough 
down the page to select the correct answer of a question. VERY FRUSTRATING! 
Other than that, love Khan academy.",
"Sir, I want to study computing while in website it properly understandable 
but in app it not show computer programming & hour of code. Please make app 
just like website .",
The app is incredibly useful. It teaches all sorts of things. You won't regret downloading it.,
"Using it to study for the MCAT. Biggest problem is that the final answer to 
questions is preemptively cut off by ask for a hint option.",
"Seriously this is the BEST APP for those who like to study using their 
smart phone .And also it's free. It has an really good material for you to 
learn from .Thanks to the creators for making it free so that all of them 
can utilise it .if you use it you will see for yourself .but a new column 
for class 11 case subjects had gone",
Please implement offline exercises and offline text guides that will sync once back online. KA saved my life thank you!,
"Amazing but can't open any articles on mobile, other than that you guys have no excuse to be ignorant anymore with this app",
I take my statement back. If you sign out and sign back in if you're having task error problems it will work just fine.,
Amazing but it would be better if we could solve practise problems (for example: SAT grammar) like we can on the website. Despite that the app is easy to use and very neat.,
"Love this app specially for chemistry lectures but I can't understand some 
concepts of biology",
"Just want to thanks all the teachers of this app who bring the light of knowledge in my life , there is a vast ocean of knowledge to learn here.",
"I love it for learning, but the content is slightly limited. It's only for certain things that you learn.",
"Nice initiative , but I would rather like if you increase the difficulty 
level bcz the level of questions is very easy",
"I am a science student and I can learn almost everything which I find 
difficult to understand in Khan academy.",
Haven't even used it yet on a app but it's repetuation is undeniable. Also I used to use it as a class in grade 7-8,
"Amazing stuff! I can't recommend it enough. A huge thank you and a big well 
done to all the Khan Academy team!!",
Absolutely useful! I can always relie on it if I have difficulties with my homework. I highly recommend this app.,
"It is an amazing app for learning....that is if it did not glitch out on me. I tried to open an article only to end up having problems loading it, sometimes it would not even load at all.",
"Fabulous …it makes me feel like a small classroom…it explains u almost 
everything …in detail(all students should download it as it can become ur 
helping hand too💙)",
"For chrissakes please stop saying this app is boring! This app helped me to learn more about anatomy and physiology. To those who are saying this app is useless, get a life and go and play Flappy Bird!",
"What a marvelous program! Thank Mr. Khan! I am a life long learner (like 
everyone) but your program keeps me organized and very inspired to 
challenge myself and enjoy myself!",
"The explanation is very good and interesting👌👍.Things which seems difficult and boring, gathers my interest after seeing the videos.Through it now I can understand things better and can do study more efficiently.Thanks to Khan Academy.",
"This is crazy cool. I cant believe I didn't use this in high school. It 
would've been incredibly helpful.",
"It is a great educational app. It gives me a lot of information about my 
subjects but there is a problem and that is the Programing subjects like 
HTML, CSS and JS are not in the app to learn that I have to log in to the 
websites. Please do something about it !",
"I really wish there was a way to take the diagnostic tests in-app. I'm 
relearning math after years away from the subject but I have to use my 
phone's browser to retake the diagnostic tests to see where I'm currently 
at. Once that's done I'm sure the app will be lovely to use. :) (As a 
side-note, if you could let us change avatars in-app that would be great 
too.)",
Best app if u want to learn rather than mugging the knowledge,
"Great learning experience but back button is not working inside the app , while it works perfectly works with my other apps. Please fix this bug.",
"sir you have done world's greatest and beautiful work you have done. Thanks 
for this. If notes becomes offline that will be really helpful.",
"Khan Academy is the best, but the app is not as good as the site. There are no practices in between units in the app. I think I will be using khan academy more often if the feature is available in app too. Hope it will be added. Then it will be a 5 🌟🤗🤗",
"Thank you for the great app but has a glitch bug ""Error making progress"". Has been like this for half the day. Please fix it! Or give us some update what's happening. :(",
Should have a video quality control starting at least 240p to 720p cuz i have a slow internet connection and i need to reduce quality so that videos play smoothly .,
Ive never learned so much in such a short amount of time.,
"I love this app my teacher uses this if we are stuck on math so this will 
really help. 10000000000S stars.",
Good applications children can know study at home . I install this aap few minutes ago I don't know very well about this aap that is why I give it 4 Stars when I will knew this aap then I will give them 5 Stars☺🙂🤗😇😉,
"If you, your kids, or anyone you know has any kind of trouble with math or other studies get this app, it's a must-have!",
An excellent attempt towards moulding the minds of the youths.Its fantastic and the video lectures can be made more visual and more friendly.,
I love this app but recently I haven't been able to do any of the tests or quizzes because it seems like one of their services is failing.,
"To be honest, I can't figure it out how I can thank you for this. 
Khanacademy has a great scope of self development. I willing to rate more 
than 5 stars. 😂 Anyways, thanks again. ☺️",
"Videos won't load on app but overall love what you've done and made 
learning available to everyone especially older people going back to school",
nice app good for learning but download feature is very bad when ever a content is added on bookmark it downloads for a while and stops automatically. else a great application,
"I can't imagine my life without Khan Academy! I owe it a lot! Looking 
forward to learn more everyday! Thanks for empowering me...",
"I absolutely love this application. It helped me with a lot of exams and it even helped my mother, who is a physicist in a school",
"The most useful app. Thank you Sal for helping students like me. Education 
is important. Loved this app. ❤",
I love it but if you can please add more world war 1 and 2 lessons.👍,
"Awsome this gave me the knowledge to solve my grade 7 math. Cause i didint 
listen much in elementary lol",
"This is amazing I was trying to figure out how to relearn everything I 
learned in school because I had forgotten from lack of opportunities, this 
app let's me go back through everything I learned and in essence relearn 
everything it is amazing!!!",
Thank you  This helps me alot in my studies,
"I think it's a brilliant app which gives a thorough understanding of various subjects with ease ,the videos being amazing.. Just a suggestion can we have some videos around Securities Lending product?",
"It has a major bug that doesn't allow me to see the rest of my assignments, meaning I can't scroll down at all, it just loads me back at the top of the assignment page. Also, it isn't updating my assignments from my class, although I am getting notifications for them.",
The explanations are just perfect. The language used for explanation is simple and that makes it easier to understand.,
"Yes! That's a good app! And it's helpful and it's great, but there are glitches. Keep up the good work.",
WOW I love this app Not only me but my kid to I cant Believe it's free!,
"Do you add the videos which are uploaded on YouTube to the application side

"Really good app, deserves to be downloaded. Complete 5 🌟 stars rating for this",
"Literally a life saver for all my high school, college, and MCAT studying",
It is the first time I am rating 5 star to an app. I sincerely love it.,
Helped me pass gr 12 university biology. This app is a life saver.,
"Why this app isn't in top 10 free education apps? Although it is editor's 
choice but it must have a position in that list",
Excellent app for basic to extreme higher level studies. For me higher level videos are excellent,
In library every subject is not there ....but its good,
One can learn just anything using this app. It's to good.,
Stunning app with a bunch of bugs. Please align the entropy by fixing the bugs. and thanks for the greatest idea in the world,

"Khan Academy is hands down the best out there. Being a math major with upper level classes, there aren't any tutors once you get to your junior year in college. With a, not so good professor, students need all the help they can get if they can't turn to faculty for help. Khan academy is actually suggested by all of the professors on campus should a student need help. I've been using it for yeas and highly recommend it to everyone I talk to.",
"So  good  in  fact,  that  I  wish  I had something  like  this  during my  years at  school. You young  people  don't  know  how  lucky you are,  to  have  access  to  something  like  this. Nice  app  you've  got  going  here  mate.  I  hope you  can  include  more  topics  to  study  in  the  near  future. Keep  it  up. Maybe  add  some  simulation  exercises.",
"For all haters stop hating. This is the best educational app that actually helps its not about how boring it is about  what u learn. It is the best bc it testes u on what u know and what u need more help on makes u take practices and quizzes that are easy to take according on ur skills and and what u need help on. The videos and hints are there for u to help u, its like an online teacher, and points avatars,backgrounds, and prized games make it fun :)",
It's helpful. I'm failing biology & it helped me understand some things better. I do wish the videos weren't so boring though.... It makes me want to go to sleep. But I'm keeping the app to help me later since there are multiple subjects on here that i can use. Which I'm excited about,
"Best educational app that I have ever seen ...It Can be used for extra 
knowledge by any age group for any stream.. Also very amazing logical 
explanation especially mathematics.. ""The only thing I found was that there 
aren't much videos for commerce stream , so would you please upload videos 
on economics, accountancy, financial management etc"".",
"People in the comments sayin stupid things like ""it's boring"".. the hell did you expect, some fun game? Khan academy is supposed to be an educational site just like a school, it's for people determined to learn, the funniest thing I saw in the comments is ""I didn't learn anything and failed all my tests"" as though it's Khan academy's fault you're stupid as hell, ""Sal Khan should get a life"" 😑 I don't even need to say anything about that.",
I'm surprised people say it is not helpful.  I myself find this app quite interesting to me honest.  Not only is it free it helped me get straight a pluses for three tests in a row thanks Sal and company. Plus it is meant to be boring so why complain idiots.,
"So great App , about everything of science , history , philosophy and much more are in the app. in a simple way  the only thing I didnt like , that I can't save videos and topics in my sd card , there is no such option , it's only stored in phone storage , which I dont have enough space there , that's why I gave the app 3 stars only. If you can add this option , I would give the app 5 stars",
"Khan Academy is a great way to either learn or reinforce learning for content from kindergarten all the way up to first year university, along with some more advanced content (e.g. MCAT prep). The lessons almost always are easy to understand, and there is a large number of practice problems to hone and maintain skills. I would recommend KA to anyone and everyone as a way to continue learning, even if you've finished school a long time ago: there are probably subjects here that you haven't learned about.  The fact that everything is 100% free is one of the best parts of KA. Although they can't give out certificates or diplomas (you'd need to go to school or do a write-in test for that), Khan Academy means that anyone with access to the Internet can receive a secondary school level education, and explore some university level concepts.",
"Great standalone app for math, but just a good supplement for the other subjects.  The amount of interaction could be more consistent throughout the subjects; the math sections are amazing in that you can really practice what you learn, but the other subjects don't really offer a chance to review concepts and key terms. I think it really hinders the quality of the content overall, because the lectures can be a bit flighty and a little too informal at times, and something like a quiz at the end of each section would help to clarify things. That said, this app goes perfectly with either a textbook on hand or some diligent note-taking.",
"I really enjoy Khan Academy however the app sucks because it won't even allow me to sign in . the profile page has a long list of ways to sign up along with a sentence long description, but to sign in is all the way at the bottom. That only shows eagerness to have people sign up to Khan Academy, but not for those are already there. Should definitely be catering to those you have then not. It's sad because I desperately need math explanations.",
"Buggy and Irritating. The app screen doesn't fit well at all and part of it will be missing. So, when my daughter does the counting, she can never see all of the screen and gets most of the answers wrong. We'll just stick with our workbooks.",
I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this app if you want to brush up on math from any level. The math courses have really helped me understand the high school math I struggled with. One small problem I found is that moving the dots to the accurate position on a co-ordinate plane is too awkward on a touch screen.,
"Extrmely helpful, it makes me 'Feel' like a mathematician or a scientist. So much to explore and the guy teaches really well, clears all my doubts. We can pause, see the captions, and can change the speed of speaker's voice, which makes it the best... (khan academy and by jus, both have their own strenghts, cant compare them).....but khan academy is 5 percent more for me.",
"This is the greatest app on the planet. The lectures are really good. They 
are really slow paced , which makes learning easier. These guys should 
definitely get the Noble prize",
"Seria uma boa opção a de casting para televisões smart e Chromecast, é a única coisa que falta no app",
Its really great. Suprisingly my school runs off of Khans Academy's teachings in all subjects.,
"This app would be great if it downloaded content properly for offline viewing. The download process freezes at random. Sometimes if I remove the bookmark, then apply it again several times, it might download. Please fix this problem! It would be great to actually download bookmarks!",
"I definitely love the app. Developers can try to improve offline contents. I can watch videos from my bookmarks but i can't read documents. Still, a great app.",
Khan Academy lessons are meant for people who are serious in their quest for academic excellence. It is boring to people who expect entertainment instead of serious learning.,
"It crashes a lot, it has a lot of content but since it crashes so much I tend to use the website.",
It's great  we use it at my school I just wished you didn't have to go on a desktop to see your assignments. When you go to assignments  you only see completed.,
Honestly a great app . If you are not good at maths this app will help u to master over it . It even makes maths interesting,
Mathematics videos in this app are the best i have come across...great work sal and other tutors...i highly recommend this app for all the engineering aspirants!,
"The best app i have ever seen. Really thankful for creater, the main thing is that it's for free. Love it.",
"By the way, I found this very helpful. It is NOT A GAME! It's used for help in educational things and helps us understand a concept better.",
Very nice app for a mathematics students. The videos are easy to download for offline. I highly appreciated this app. Keep up the good work.😊,
A good app. My only problem  is the video takes alot of my data from phone,
Best app in the world really helpful for Students.  My Suggestion is please give a pdf file of every chapter.  Thank you😊,
"I dont know why the second and than download can't do and can be fix with re-install, and Please Add SD storage, my phone storage so small, it will make Khan App is Better. Thank you for this App.",
I have no words to describe HOW AWESOME THIS APP THIS and that too for free!! Am really really grateful to Sal khan sir plus everyon involved in this app Thank u very very much  I really can't express my gratitude in words,
It's nice but it's language doesn't turn to hindi  and also videos are not clear   .   It's not better than byju's,
Khan academy is highly useful not only to students but also to everybody who is interested to learn things and to get refreshed in different subjects.,
Love their contents. Only thing is not all the contents of the websites are available in the app.,
I loved it because i was failing math and this helped me when i found out about it on youtube,
"for the peoples that say this app is boring CONGRATULATION YOURE GRADUATED 
AS THE dUmmies of the world",
The Best!!!! Its a blessing how everything is so well organized and clear! Nobody has the right to complain about this app as its so great and educational AND its free! It can't get better. Make the most of it!!  Blessings 🍃,
"it's very nice app for any student learn any subject free ,thanks Sal.khan sir .you are  friends of student .",
its a very very great app and 100 percent free. Efforts taken for making this app is amazing. Contents are very easy to understand and are explained greatly,
It is very useful app.Thanks for providing free education it is very useful for preparind competitive exams as many app are not affordable,
"Honestly, this is a very great and helpful app. Its running for free to help people and I think its very informative, I don't get why people say its boring? If you really want to learn, it's very useful.  I've been using this to improve my biology and chemistry grades. And I'm overall very glad with the results.",
Very very very helpful. Especially for people who find math hard and confusing,
"Okay so. This is the best education you'll ever get on a smartphone, period.   I went from long division to linear functions in 9 months.   Plus it helped me get a job!  I'll be donating lots of money to you guys! 💲💲💲",
I wanted to know more about sociology bt it dosnt have tht subject,
"Even better than NCERT!, Must download it, the best app in world for studies! Am a fan by heart",
App is crashing constantly. 1. Use search to find any material. 2. Press the topic name.,
"used to work well. as of v5.0.0 , broken on my older Samsung Galaxy 7 ( 
Android 4.1.2 ). cannot run Exercises. only watch videos. loved app, but 
now it is unusable.",
It's not simply an app. IT IS A REVOLUTION.,
We love using this as a family to enhance our education. This is truly an invaluable app!,
I feel like there's no need for universities and schools anymore,
No programming language course 👎,
It's a fabulous app for students. It helps me a lot in my studies,
"Amazing app, Big fan of Sal and his style of teaching & explanation.",
Best educational app. Please add technical subjects also like Pharmacy.,
Please add programming option in app too. Although khan academy is amazing.,
"Awesome app, cleared all the concepts, thank you so much.",
"The idea of this app is to learn wherever you are and whenever you need, for me that is perfect. Thank you for this.",
"I love it but please add more subjects and more topics in mathematics, Thank you",
Learning things I forgot and learning things I couldn't understand earlier,
"If we have only one best app in the world , i think this is this app",
Used to have an issue and Khan Academy quickly solved and updated the app!,
A great app and the way they explain is descriptive and helps a lot to understand,
Very nice app but please improve it and add more lessons for mbbs students,
Best educational app ever  The method of teaching is very good,
Khan academy is doing best job in the world And please include IIT jee physics and chemistry,
I wish it had a botany/forestry course.,
No word can describe this app,
I love it but the quizzes on the app won't load.,
I think the app is usefull but could do something to get kids excited about using it,
Appreciate the effort put in to bring forth so many concepts the UI is very friendly too,
Even though I am in Pakistan this app helps me in covering my salybus and clear my concepts,
Super app for learning .It gives full definition from origin,
This app is the best I've ever used.,
I loved this app & it helps me in my exams also,
khan academy ...your team  is doing a gr8 job..i loved the way u teach...at last thank u khan academy😊,

We love you Khan Academy,
World class free learning app,

The world's #1 school-based app,

Gooodddd,
Wow,
Thank,
Best educator app ever! Keeps things clean and neat not tons of educators like Unacdemy centralised work made it better  Only thing I'm concerned is please include subjects like Accounts SP OC and Economics. This would be better! I love it!  Edit : It crashes while switching from one chapter to another. Please fix it! :(,
I love love this app. Its an angel in disguise. But I do have problems downloading videos for offline viewing. Any suggestions?,
Amazingly effective!,
Best,
"I really appreciate this App. When ever I have my phone with me and have time to spare, I'll sometimes just read some stuff about something I'm curious about and end up after 5 to 15 minutes with some knowledge I didn't know. I always feel good when I learn something new,  I think most people are the same way.",
"I like this app, but it won't refresh and update my assignments that my mentor gives me. It's been days and I can see them on the actual web page, but I can't see them in the app anymore. Even when it did work I had to force stop the app and reopen it to make it update. Very frustrating, as I use this app for convenience and when I can't bring my laptop with me.",
"The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I feel like it should also give access to the articles and tests they have on the website instead of requiring you to utilize both.    That aside, though, I LOVE this app and have learned (and re-learned) SO MUCH with its help!    Update: They did this and it's awesome.   Please also add the ability to save full playlists to tablets and play on high speed like is available on the Android phone.  Update (3/13/2018): It seems after some update I am regularly unable to successfully download playlists to my phone or tablet. :(  Please fix this as this is SUCH a helpful tool for me to study on the go!",
"Very good and useful app. I love it. But in present updated app there is some problem is sliding down the content , earlier it was not there",
Hello Khan Academy. I always loved the concept of yours.  But the app should have some fixes.  It is being crashed when opening a subject(moving charges and magnetism) and also the search results are not being displayed for a particular topic,
Its really a great app for learning. But a feature to choose resolution of offline videos should also be there. All offline videos are always downloaded in the lowest possible resolution.,
"This app is amazing at helping me prepare for the ACT. It doesn't specifically have an ACT class, but I can review any science, grammar, and math that I want in a way I can learn it.",
Give it a 10 star! This app is phenomenal for educational purposes. I would reccomend for all who are- 1) studying for a test; 2) refreshing on old content; 3) just want to learn something they haven't already.,
Please please please please add Statistics and Probability that is on your main website. I am doing psychology for school and really need it available on phone! Thanks,
"I have liked the app before, although I am having trouble signing in again after updating.",
"Great app. Wonderful wealth of knowledge. However it needs a 'report an error' function. Ideal Stoichiometry - Molar mass of Mg(H)2 is 26g. Molar mass of MgO(H)2 is 52.32. Just a typo, but an important one :) also could do with a 'back' function which allows you to revisit previous page",
"Everything is great excet the scrolling after a search or whenever it is needed is not smooth,gets stuck. Please fix this.",
"Best app 👌👌 for learning.I learned a lot of things. Very Very helpful. 
You can learn new things",
"Its really best tool that a user can find almost anything and its convenient without fees, i can study from anywhere i wish. Most important i can repeatly research without a tuitor infront of me. Really advance..salute to the programmer..Tq",
I've spent many hours on this app and it's made my life better. How many apps could you say that about? Top draw education for free and many subjects to choose from. I really can't put into words how highly I recommend this.,
It helped me a lot to learn and I can learn even more with the Khan academy.I recommend you to take a look at Khan Academy.,
Best Educational App ever!! Everything is Free and you can also download it to watch offline Thanks fot the creator of this app😊 Please Notice me,
"Wonderful wonderful app,It helped me understand a lot of concepts especially in chemistry.All for free😍😎",
I recently downloaded the app. I don't see where you are able to do pretest and practice work like I was able to do online. Can you please help me because I don't want to uninstall if that feature is available,
"Whenever I download a topic after a while it reports, ""could'nt download this topic"" this error keeps coming for a long time after being 20 to 30% downloaded and I have to re-download it again. My mobile's android version is 4.4.2. Please fix this issue for me.",
"This is good for an app version of Khan Academy's amazing online resource. I'm hoping to see a KA teacher's app in the near future that will allow me to check the progress of my students, send them messages and assignments, etc.",
I must say that this app is very helpful for studies .It saved me from reading boring ncert books .,
This app is for every student regardless of their age. They'll find something in this course. Moreover this has been the editors choice app so no doubt it has to be good.,
"It's not an app, it's an ocean of knowledge that can quench even the thirstiest ones.",
"if you can provide platform for all teacher to submit their interactive lesson, it might improve exponentially.",
This app is great! I needed help brushing up on my math skills and it helped so much. It explains everything to where it's easy to understand!,
OMG it is good app we can learn easily byju's is also a learning app but it will take money for video Sohan Academics is everything free I love it,
"It's extremely wonderful, very resourceful and I can utilise my time 
substantially.",
Very very useful application. Khan Academy is such an app to achieve knowledge on any subject which will help us in exams. I'll give it 👍👍👍👍👍. This is a school in our phone!,
"I'm a working class man, but I always enjoy studying physics. The lectures, the notes are so well written. Impressive work! I'm poor at probability, I'll learn it from Khan academy!",
It's great but I can't find my missions so if anyone could help me that would be great,
One of the best free app to learn more with out any problems and explanation is good.,
Super helpful app to everyone especially for a student thank you so much for creating such an amazing app and share with us for free!,
Really admire the fact that it is free and without ads. Good job!,
Best app  Best way to study so easily The only problem os that it is online,
"I love this service, it's really easy to use and the lessons are easy to follow and fun, I also love the exercises ! Sal Khan is the man !!",
The best place for E-learning starts with Khan Academy.,
"Superb App, just add a feature to save videos to SD cards👏",
Amazing app! Prepared me for going back to university without having any trouble in any subjects.,

It is the most useful app in learning for students of all levels . I loves it .,
"Great app! ,User-friendly ! ,and Packed with useful content ! This last update has been a real treat. I'm seeing so much progress in such a short time frame.  I'm on my way to mastery.",
The app is great but it won't open doc. files,
Thx I'm failing but this helps alot for me to learn,
"I love it! But, I would like the discussion or comments in a video to appear at the buttom just like in the normal website.",
Here I found a ocean of knowledge . Very well understanding videos. Excellent,
A very effective app. Must to download . I came 1 st in the class,
The best educational app and it's free and easy to learn for all ages,
The best app for education proud to be Khan Academy user. Keep the good work up Khan Academy.,
It is very easy to learn/study subjects and will help you study for tests.,
Best study app one could ever get in playstore,
This app helps me and its very great but can you add languages? Also when i do a quiz it sometimes just repeat the same two questions,
One of the most helpful top rated formal learning apps in the world,
Great app! Please bring SAT practice from your website to this app too,
This is going to change the world.,
Great!one of the best teachers of all time.,
Very clear reasoning to back up math mechanics to give a full understanding.,
"No dark theme?? Every modern app should automatically offer a dark theme for night reading. In Android Studio, it's just a matter of a few clicks to add that option to your app!",
I just started will add more later,
FREE SCHOOL  IT'S COOL but booring but still good,
Thank  you  Sir.  You providing knowledge at free of cost.,
Excellent app before that i used to follow Khan academy website but after i switch to app its very useful and best UI,

Please bring a solution in which....we can bookmark the whole topic .ex- To bookmark full class 10 math....there are only options to bookmark a chapter in it!,
Good,
Such a GODSEND.. Godbless,
Love it,
Awesome,
Hats off to your efforts,
Thanks for making this app there are very few people like you who gives free tution I even see your videos on you tube also alhhamdullilah I passed the exam because of you .,
where are the programming lessons? i dont find it here except in the website.  edit: yes its available in the app BUT it only has robot programming. where are the javascript lessons? you can even check it by yourself there are not much programming lessons compared to the website,
Super app,
Si!,
Not all courses are available. I saw the 'statistics and probability' course on the Kahn academy website but I can't find it in the app. Also the quizzes are buggy. Questions 4 & 5 are usually the same as 1 & 2,
"O melhor aplicativo quando se trata de ensino gratuito de qualidade, nele você pode encontrar conteúdos/aulas e exercícios variados. Ótimo para quem irá prestar vestibular e até mesmo aqueles que precisam revisar algo na faculdade.",
"This is an amazing learning resource. Some people say that it should be used to supplement other learning resources, but I'd have to disagree. This has taught me algebra in a way that no teacher has ever explained to me. I'm going to use this to learn calculus before I go to college and I'm not ashamed one bit. Hell, if I get some great career, I'll donate my first paycheck to Khan Academy.",
Awesome app for learning from budding learners to senior students.  No ads. Complete course and maintained syllabus.. Never seen any learning platform like this. Includes exercises too. Also video can be downloaded to watch later. It also have specilized courses for preparing for specific exams like IIT-JEE. Have a well organised course lectures for 11th and 12th class. I loved this app.,
"would you please give a setting option cause nawadays my net is running 
slow and i woundn't able to low the quality a bit",
"Thanks for being free and having the best explanations I've ever heard. I have an issue with the app itself, it doesn't auto rotate. This is a problem when I let my child do early math, and counting. In vertical view, you can't see all the foxes you put in the box.",
"Absolutely brilliant. First off I would like to thank Sal Khan for going out of his way and creating Khan Academy to help those struggling. Second off the app is amazing. Innovative design, beautiful interface, and the quality of the education astounds me. Thank you.",
A problem in the computing section. App is showing only one topic but there four topics in the website,
It's the best  platform to learn. Revolutionizing teaching in an unconventional way. Thanks Sal khan you've teached important lessons in various subjects at ease.,
Doesn't offer all the same courses on mobile as they do on PC. Not a huge complaint. Otherwise has more than enough material to help and beautiful structure for learning something new or studying a subject in school.,
"Its amazing helpful app but pleasee can you add IB subjects like Biology, chemistry and Physics. Thanks",
"It is a great source for the students, if they missed out a part or they didn't undestand something. Then this app would definitely help.",
"Amazing content. Made differentiation surprisingly easy. However it would be better to include the comments/FAQ box as available on the website, where the users can post their doubts. Also it would be nice to include captions synced with the video and it's speed.",
The app is very wonderful a complete replica of its website but the only issue I have with it is the part where the video does not generate the subtitles. If you can work on that it would be so lovely. Thanks guys you are doing a great job,
"When i download a video on my OnePlus 3t, the sound file size seems to be compressed, the sound gets distorted and the image quality is reduced. But the rest works fine and the content is wonderful.",
"It's terrible. I do all the work and I have everything correct, but then they come in and say your wrong. I hate Common core so much.",
"It's amazing but I love it even more for algebra,  it has explained to me in a way that no teacher has ever before",
Well if it actually worked i would give more stars but the thing is...i can not play the videos neither the exercices so...its basecly useless for me,
"Wouldn't even scroll down far enough to let me click sign in, and when I finally got there the app crashed. (EDIT 5 March 2018) It's still not letting me scroll, and it's still crashing. :(",
"Good and varied content, of many subjects, and at all levels. The videos are generally of very good quality, with transcript available, however it's not possible to watch subtitled videos in full screen.",
installing this app made my acct out of sync. signed in on the app and when i went to use my acct on desktop was set way back in progress. deleting.,
"This app is a lot useful . It has helped me a lot in my academics . But 
sometimes it laggs a lot",
"Great Educational Learning Tool. I use BOTH the website and the app. Outstanding performances from both, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone willing to further their knowledge and education.",
The videos are not being marked as complete even though I watched them on their integrity. The app is useless because I have to watch everything again on my computer. Uninstalling it now.,
"A brilliant portal for the curious, Khan Academy is just the place for someone who won't ever stop learning... Excellent nevertheless, the app could have been better if, like the website, it had the question and answer platform...",
"Lackluster effort on some of the learner tabs (e.g. African tab, etc)",
I will give it 5 🌟 if it has study material and notes and tests and has prescribed CBSE syllabus of chemistry and biology like physics in it,
"It lacks so many features. Search is not working properly, bookmark is only available for subtopics, no recently viewed section and options to change the video quality.",
"Amazing app , filled with features that's has helped me in middle school, high school and now in college . Love you guys .keep it going . Please don't stop !",
"Even after doing the suggested fix, the problem persisted. It was fine for the one assignment but I don't feel like uninstalling the app every time I complete an assignment",
Sorry But it dosnet have break apart one to make tens,
I just came here to give this amazing app 5-stars !,
"Great app. I've learned so much from this! There are a few exercises which do not load, but besides that, everything's cool. Am planning to donate as soon as I can! Keep on!",
"It's smooth. It's cool, but it crashes alot. Like a LOT. I rarely use it anymore.",
"I'm in iI think its great but, I'm in 8'th grade and even I need help with more complicated things in, lets say math, I'm learning reverse volume and I didn't see it",
Really Useful. Easy To Use. Explore New Things. Real Education.,
I just requested it..Right now I'm waiting for ur respond..Gonna change my star for u guys.,
Best of the best ! I enjoyed education for the first time in life🙏,
"Oh my gosh, that's the best app I have ever seen! It is really useful and nice. Thank you so much!",
Really beautiful interface and helps a lot. Your trustful last minute tutor!!,
"Really cool and reliable.Nice way of teaching is provided.Whole lot of 
topics covering.",
It makes me want to go up and beyond,
Cant believe that they teach these stuff for free,
"Very intuitive and sleek, but I wish it was compatible with Chromecast!",
This app disserves 500* only of it was possible. But can you add where I can view my subjects and write unit test in the App like the way it's online?,
Great app. Explanations provided are really simple and easy.,
best app i have ever use to learn and the best thing is its free,
Would suit for me if there's an option to choose video quality,
This is a great app with great info but I really wish you could share lessons!,
Very nice app loved it thank u so much,
Thanks to the developers of this great and precious app. I highly recommend this app to whoever seeks for knowledge.,

Good but need to provide videos for JEE physics & chemistry too,
Good edu App. Please provide chrome cast feature as well,
"It's a great app but some of the lectures are not there in the app... Like in Computing section, only computer science is available.... No programming section as shown in website...",
i like how it has vidios to help you learn that subject,
It is a very good app mind blowing explanation,

Khan academy is absolutely amazing!,
I love khan academy but I rather use the online version instead of the app I like the idea being mobile with my courses but it is hard for me to tell where I last left off compared to the online to this app wish it was more of a similar format to the online webpage,
My heartiest gratitude to the founder and developers.,
My only wish is that this allowed you to do programming.,
Great. I loved it. 👍,
Need an option to set external sd card as offline video storage.Because some devices internal storage is realy low.,

Amazed!!!,
"This app is really really good. It makes maths , physics biology and 
chemistry feel interesting and fun. The app is not as detailed as in 
websites but the app has many advantages too. You can add the videos at 
bookmark and view them offline. Also Sal teaches very nicely. Very helpful 
app. I totally recommend this to all my friend who are struggling in studies",
"An amazing app that covers various coarses. However, I did have one question. I noticed your app could not be moved to the microsd card. I understand that this can cause instability, but (if possible) I feel it would make the app that much better (my internal storage is a joke on my phone, so this would be vital for someone like me who can't root). (Also, I have not read the descriprion details yet, so I apologize if it is informed on there) GREAT APP 👍",
"I can't express my gratitude over this wonderful project! Knowledge and learning should  always be a priority in our lives. this initiative will certainly help our great young (and even old) minds to develop and be inspired, subsequently giving them a hand in becoming the scientists that will help transform our lives and planet through scientific innovation.",
"Hey devloper, everything is very nice but I think there's a bug. Test options a b c is working fine but option d is going green after many times press. Sometimes it's not greening up. Please fix this. Add feature to lower the video quality; it will help better to run videos in slow connections.",
"I am very thankful of this app! I wasn't able to attend formal schooling so I end up studying only in my home but thanks to this app, because it helped me in my studies. This app contains many valuable academic information. I love the style of its teaching. I just hope that I can take quizzes and read articles offline. I hope they can make that.",
"Respected ,  I am member of khan academy since very beginning . You prepare to good videos but the only thing that's your weak point is you upload videos too slowly . Sir now I am a MBBS student and would appreciate well if you prepare videos to the deep of the subjects. Please this time do it fast.        I liked your app soo much that I am referring it to my friend .  Thankyou for making this website and app",
"Hi, I downloaded khan academy app in a new mobile. My son is unable to login with his username because he forgot his password. While resetting, he gets a message 'something went wrong.please try again'. He tried around 4 times and the app throws the same error msg. Can someone help?    My son gets all  doubts from his school lessons clarified here. He has started learning programming as well.thanks Khan academy.",
This app is the ultimate source of learning almost Everything! I really love the UI & the method of teaching is so interactive. I was just looking for learning a few things. I am 23 years old and find myself using it in many ways. I am always going to refer to this app. When didn't I find it earlier. When I have kids I am gonna let them use this app! IT IS AWESOME!!! I've never given such a big review of anything on play store before. But this app literally deserves it. I hope it just keeps getting better! Thanks a lot Khan Academy! ❤❤❤😙😄😍😘,
"For the people who are saying this app is ""boring"" are people who expect to be babied and have answers without HARD work. Thank you khan academy ✌ for the free  review lessons. This app teaches or review stuff. If you want clear ""teaching"" and ""non boring"" teaching you should  1. Vist the original site 2. Pay ATTENTION in class and your teacher All this app does is review stuff you are SUPPOSED TO ALREADY KNOW!",
Best app for students. I really appreciate khan academy to tech poor people for free of cost.  Thier are some many apps having but they are not freely available for people..  I will recommend to every student which over field they must to download this app.😍😍😍😍,
"I used it already before on my previous device unfortunately I thought it was free to use offline and yet i need to download it before I can use it without wifi if you can change this factor even for a big memory storage, I'll rate it 5 stars (*)",
"Anytime I try to take the full test the app exits and on top of that I don't know how to take a practice test on a single topic,other than this it is a good app and I like it",
App is good. It's very educational. Only downside I can see right now is there's no option to adjust quality for the vudeos. I hope they will put it since there are some users who only use mobile data on their phones.,
"I love it. However , recently whenever I open it it closes down and shows me the home screen. I have a really big exam the day after tomorrow and I badly want to study right now.",
"The app is great! I love it and so thankfull for that. However, there is one thing that I think could make it better. Since I am not an English native speaker and I've been learning it, I may not understand some phrases, sentences and even hole text. I wanted to copy that and translate, but I couldn do that. So, please, could you fix it or is there some reasons in impossibility of copying texts?",
"This organization does good work but this app needs improvements. There are significant flaws in the interface that prevent the user from selecting certain things. And from the chemistry section specifically, I cannot download the periodic table, redox and electrochemistry, or the buffers/titration topics. I attempted on two different devices. Also you cannot choose the download location which means everything goes on the internal storage which is less than optimal. Also the app crashes often enough for having it for only two days. Sometimes nothing loads in the Bookmarks section even if I kill, restart the app, and try again",
"This is a great app, but it does have a boat load of problems. My biggest complaint is that you can't access the quizzes and tests via the app. This wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue if the website was better optimized for mobile, but alas not the case. Fix the issues and get a better score.",
Thanks khan academy. If you guys can also make test prep for UGC-NET it will be excellent. My humble request.,
This app made me wonder how much more knowledge I'd have absorbed during high school if I had a tool like that,
"Awesome app everything I wanted I get it from here .I love the the way they explains in computer science but the quality of the vedio I see are not really good ,it's a kind of fun to learn from this app within a short period of time .Vedios are actually of short span of time which is really great thing about it because of it don't get bored .",
I was struggling with my algebra and was falling a bit behind. Thanks to this lovely thing I was able to understand it a bit better and now live caught back up with class. Not only that but I can learn about cosmology and astronomy for free! Such a joy to have,
Its hard to navigate and u can't find how many skills u have masterd. I hate it and probley won't use it ever Use it. U wouldn't now recommend this app for any one,
Its a great app. I thought I could use the app for computer program for when Im on the go. Sadly it does not. 😂,
"The app is extremely helpful and good, but I hope there are updates that make it match with the website. Otherwise awesome😃",
I think that it's an amazing and interesting app for those who want to study from their phone in free time. ..and get some more information about the topic they want to be study...,
It is the worst when i download it  does  not even work when i log in and also when i do it in school on laptops it is so boring and dreadful i mean idk if it is because i am going to seventh grade soon or whatever but i hate khan academy.😠😠😠😠😠😠,
"It is a very useful app. I was able to prepare for my exams with this app 
without any teacher.I advice anyone to download this app because it is very 
good.",
"I like your app, though I think it would be more useful if it's possible to store the videos downloaded to the SD card.",
"Awsome for all ages. Great explanation to some core topics. Wish something like this existed when I was studying. Nevermind, never late to learn. Great stuff.",
"Great app, you can learn anything, super helpful, so easy to use and very understandable lessons. Thanks to Sal Khan for excellent thoughts",
This app is really beneficial for students who are willing to learn more about the subjects and Khan Academy has done almost every topics. And it has really helped me for my science wow keep up the good work guys 👍👍👍,
"I think those who are commenting ""boring"" need to understand that its a educational app not a game, it assists but the result is up to you. Get a lift people",
"Amazing app.would be good if you could add an early English section for parents to help their children with phonics, nouns, pronouns, adjectives etc. Love this app though",
"Its amazing, this really proved helpful in tackling out maths problems and I am very glad that I've became part of it..",
Do u think kids want to learn on some days out of school. Learning sucks,
"I really love this,it's high quality education,an you are very humble,for giving it free.i will kill those who said otherwise",
My teacher told me about this site & I been using it ever since. The app is great for on the go lessons! LOVE & worth the space on my phone. Lol,
This app works well & challenging the knowledge and your long-term memory and also learning a few things that you didn't cover...,
I love the app. It helps you understand the subject you're looking for. The only thing is I wish they had a reading catagory.,
"Super boring and didnt learn anything. i failed the test i was using the app for. thanks, Khan.",
"I learned in a 4 minute video something an arrogant teacher could not explain to me in 3 hours. Very very helpful to those who struggle in class, for catch up and revision purposes. Lots of love for this app!",
Do you guys have some institues or coachings in delhi or faridabad or near south delhi for class 11 and 12 . Please reply fast,
Thank you!! for you this social media  Can you do one more because we can practice English 1 English 2 like just English Pectus work,
"Problem: The app freezes and stops suddenly, cleaning my Ram. Suggestion: Let on subtitles under video in full-screen mode.",
I have a teacher that doesn't explain things to us so khan academy is basically a explanatory teacher,
Thanks you very much may Allah increase your knowledge and continue guiding you. You help me a lot...,
"Really amazing app, I have learned a lot from it.  Special thanks to honest staff of Khan Academy.",
Hats off for Mr.Khan for doing such a Job. Guys you should learn about the great person behind this app. Google it now.,
"in my opinion, this is one of the top 5 apps not in google but whole internet market.This app can really help to correct our broke educational systems where education is done only for grades.we all have different abilities anď not everyone needs a degree to express their intelligence",
ATTENTION REQUIRED! The app is great but PLEASE add the feature to download the content to SD CARD as not everyone has enough free storage in their phone...PLEASEE,
Free education Thank you people. The idea of free education is really humble and it is helping kids all over the world plus teachers are also good. Good bless you. Keep up. I will donate when I begin to earn (if you accept).,
"It's the best education app if you want to study trigonometry, differential calculus, integral calculus, mulrivariable calculus and quantum physics.",
It's a good app that actually helped me a bit. But please just add a marker feature so I could do the work on the screen....then I'll give 5 stars.,
I like this app a lot but PLEASE let me type my answers on iPad. The writing detection is SO BAD. Otherwise great app for learning,
Would love the app if would let me sign in. The app won't let me scroll down to sign into my account.,
"I remember when Khan first started and I liked them then. I love them even more now that they have an app. It makes everything super simple to find, and I can learn and be productive any time I have 10 minutes between classes, etc.",
"I like it, but the app keeps closing on my phone when downloading subjects. You guys should try khan academy on computer. It's way much better. I used to do it on computer most of the times.",
Hi . I am a home school parent and really enjoying using the app to teach and prepare my daughter for her GED in 2 years time.  I have a question regarding grammar (English ) . I don't see the subject info in the app however it's listed on the website.  Is there any way to access the info on the app ? Thanks ... Caroline,
"I took a placement test to go to college a couple of years ago and was placed on pre-algebra, but thanks to this educational website I was able to refresh my memory and when I took the placement test again I was placed on pre-calculus! Thanks Khan Academy",
This is so very useful but  Please add more lesson like in trigonometry so I will learn more about them :),
"Omg this app is great, it provides free education. Sooo much to learn from this app. There s a lot to learn. Great interface. I really appreciate the  team s work. Loved it:)",
A really good app with proper visual teachings.  I require chemistry.. for class 11 (India),
"I learn so much stuff from this, it has replaced my games, and my social media. Thanks khan academy",
"It provides me a lot of information and I really enjoy gaining facts about things like math, science, etc. I just wish there was a bit more categories to choose from. But other than that it's layout is well!",
Great app it's definitely a top learning app and good for keeping tuned on what you may already know also try the brilliant app,
very nice app so far I had watched chemistry videos nd the the way of teaching concept is good.,
The best app. U can learn anything and everything right here...,
"It's more interactive now, but for some reason, I get an error notification when I try to get more hints, to learn how to do a problem",
This is what i need! Unfortunately i cant change video quality and enable closed caption/subtitle like i always do in web version. Hope those will be added next time,
"I'm not able to download a single video everytime it shows""couldn't download this topic"" please help!!!",
This app is everything that a student and teacher both wants. The idea behind making this app is great. Just  amazed by it.,
"I love this app but i find it hard to download the topics, it pauses halfway",
Actually I have more doubts in chemistry this app clarify all my doubts,
Thank You Khan Academy For Giving Me A Chance To Learn And Expand My Knowledge.,
Khan academy is really helpful so you can get ready for any tests or exams  i reeeeealllly like it,

I love the app but suddenly it stopped showing the Indian curriculum for math!,
Battery draining and very slow even on 3g and 4g,
"Can't actually believe it is free !! Probably the best thing happened to internet .  But a question for dev, I'm not able in locating the 'Khan Academy India' part of Phyics or Maths .Where can I find that ? I've seen it once and only once coming to my home page. THANKS FOR DEVOTING YOUR TIME.",
Thank you for such an awsome app. We need more people and apps like this. ☺,
"Simple design like the Website. However, there are no missions unlike the Website.",
"Great app for you to learn Math, Science, and other things!",

"great, the videos aren't wrong and still show you everything you need to know about the topic",
Its Amazing with a capital A. It's easy to use and helpful. Even College Students use it.,
Stupid app and do cover all concepts,
So I thought it was for English pupils not Americans so it is useless to me but the interface seemed pretty good,
Amazing app and videos are available  offline also all of this for free...but the audio quality should be better....,
This app is just Fabulous! No words to express my results,
It Great!!! Although I wish there was a filter for articles and exercises,
no ad and the contents are free .,
Thank you Sal sir for bringing such a good app into existence.,
The premise is good and otherwise works well except you cannot get more then one hint without it saying there is an error and exits out of the question. Samsung s7,

I attended my first year of college in 2009 I've put that on hold since it's 2018 now and I took my accuplacer to re enroll  and scored 35 in arithmetic and 23 in algebra .  one week later after using this app to study I've re taken the accuplacer and scored a 90 arithmetic and 44 algebra  .   Thank you,
"Well designed, with generous and engaging resources. It's the first perfect app I've ever seen.",
I use this in school / class,
Best learning app I have ever seen...,
Perfect App!,
There's no indonesian languange yet?,
Very useful,
"I've been using to remember some very basic concepts, its great, but still i feel much more comfortable using the website, as it is much more intuitive to move from one topic to the next. In the app you can't easily find the unit test, or as many practices as in the website, or  ar least that's my perception, i thought I'd write it, doesn't mean I'm not thankful for this app",
"This is hands down one of the best educational learning apps I've ever came across. As we get older, we tend to forget certain things that we have learned from school many years ago and now our children are always asking us to help them on their homework.  This app helped me understand certain issues I had with math. It brought back memories and now I look into helping my children with their homework with an understanding point of view. Thank you Developers for creating such an amazing app.",
"The future in the making, right here. Free education granted to everyone who has access to not even something as grandiose as a laptop, but essentially just any regular smartphone?! Seriously. Wow. This is the kind of thing our planet needs more of. Let's do away with that nonsense that declares education a privilege only granted to few throughout this somewhat unstable social ecosystem. Intelligence is the only thing within our grasp to permit us to not longer exist so contemptuously apart. Free education ftw🙌",
"Website is better in so many ways. The app lack so many features of the site, like mastery challenge, detailed profile, progress check, also videos are in fixed resolution mode, one can't change it like with YouTube on the site in case if using with mobile data. But all in all i really appreciate the amount of time and skills devs contributed to create this app.",
"Loved the app. Best learning app I had ever used. Found it very useful in clearing doubts. Want to request the makers to add AIPMT test now (NEET)  to add in the app and to provide information regarding this test also as it is a big competitive exam which is given by lakhs of students every year. Please, think once and provide us knowledge regarding that too. And again loved the app so much. Thanks for providing such platform to students like me who prepare by their own without any coaching for competitive exams like NEET. Thank you.",
"The whole platform is amazing, no doubt. However :  ¬ If you could not end the video in such a hurry. Mostly you can't hear the last word in many of the world history videos.   ¬ There used to be crash courses of John Greene. If they can come back, that'll be great.   ¬ There are no courses on current affairs and happenings, if you can make short courses on events which will hold significant importance for a long time such as Brexit and say TPP or SDG. It'll be real help.   ¬ In the app, if you can introduce the 'minimise' mode (like in YouTube?) whete you can surf the app while listening to the course)   Thanks a lot anyway.",
"WOW! THANK YOU! I am a young adult that graduated High School recently. I have been so stressed because I feel like even after passing my college math class, I struggle to remember basic math skills. This app logically presents information on math that I can totally understand. It is very clear also. KEEP UP YOUR GENEROUS EFFORTS PLEASE!",
You should add the option where I can see all my subjects and edit them so everything is easier for me to find and I don't have to search it up. This is really annoying and is the only reason I didn't give it a full rating. You should also allow us to add subjects too to our account. I think it should be very close to the computer version.,
"Honestly, one of the BEST educational apps out there. I've been searching forever to find a decent app because math is what I struggle at. My teacher IRL has a horrible way of teaching the makes my brain hurt. This provides helpful skills and videos and goes basic, step by step interaction with multiple ways to visualise the data of any grade level. You can bookmark and download courses for when you're offline, and my favorite part, they even provide career paths! It the teaches you about plenty of high grossing jobs, and it teaches how much they get paid, requirements, ect. And they also do the same for colleges, the stuff they don't teach you in school. Although this can be better with a few tweaks and updates, this is the best free online course any grade can get. Very satisfied, 5 stars.",
I want to give Khan a 5 but the interactive images in the math section are hard to manipulate at times. This resulted in me skipping several math sections out of frustration. Also this app should have the ability to back track to previously answered questions while completing an activity.,
Its a very good app but it should have a progress checker as thats in most educational apps. It should also have an option for what subject of what age should do. And finally it should have an option for preparing exams like 11plus or sats or gcse e.t.c. All in all the app is very decent and the best thing is that you can learn for free!,
Regardning bookmarks there is no bookmark availability for articles. Only videos are being bookmarked. It will b more useful if articles are also can b bookmarked.,
Thank you so much mr.Khan. You just did a great thing. Your innovation is gonna help millions. Everything I've ever needed is here.,
"Really the BEST education app. It helps my daughter in studies. No doubt, it is really the BEST education app which had helped many students across the world.",
"The app gives me almost everything I want to learn but i think it should have english also, AS a subject.",
The app really helps in preparing for my SAT. Its a great playform for learning whatever you want and its free so that is a plus point.  Love it.,
"This app is very useful.while there are other apps which teach/review the same topics in a money making notion,this app is far too great, simple and useful too",
"Khan academy is very useful, helpful and good app for education.  I think it's the way to improve our knowledge. I like this app 💙",
"This is very informative and is very easy to use . I like it most because it provides us videos, exercises, description as well as our progress.",
What a wonderful work you are doing salman. Giving wonderful knowledge to students including me. I wish i get a chance to meet you someday. Thank you,
"It has a lot of excellent information, the only complaint I have is that the desktop version has a lot more to offer. I would love to see full SAT Practice on the app, that way it is a lot easier to use it in the go.",
"I am preparing for the MCAT, and my only resources is Khan Academy. I would really like this app to help improve my skills.",
"É muito bom, mas poderia ter uma traduçao completa em português. It's very good, but it would be better if it had a complete  translation in portuguese.",
"Its great ,due to this I can't go to any tuition BUT IT WOULD more better if you also make videos on Indian chemistry and biology",
This app and lesson are incredibly helpful to me the way you can learn without get bored and the bestest thing is it's free 100% this is a great app for those haven't time to classes,
AMAZING app. Honestly this app helps to learn and not just scoring. Love the way each and every fundamental is taught. Thank you very much.,
I appreciate the opportunity to learn for free because in my school we get get limited opportunities to expand our horizon due the  the lack of classes.,
"It's a really nice app, but I'd also like to be able to download the articles offline; sometimes I just don't have enough time to go through the videos.",
It's an amazing and appreciative app and too a platform to learn and explore without really doing all that formalities and paying huge amounts . Really great work Thank you!,
"I have problem with loading hints, it just gives me an error and says to try again later...",
Jiosecurity says you take emails and usernames of other accounts on my phone for phishing attack.,
Its amazing app. I can easily review anything that i want in math or in other subject. Then I can learn a lot while using this app. Because there is a video and it saves offline with less MB to download. Thank you so much for creating this app. It is the best and very useful app ever. I will never regtret in downloading it. Thank you and God bless. 😊❤,
i just want to ask two thing can u plss tell the..Educational Implications of these app..plss,
"Love the videos and the badges/points are cute! I use it for SAT prep and I'm relearning stuff I thought I had down but apparently I still need practice on. Will the practice questions be on the app anytime soon, alongside the videos? Cause it would make practicing on the road so much easier than having the app and a browser open.",
Learning should never stop. The Khan academy makes it easy for anyone to learn new subjects or brush up on old subjects.,
They've just fixed the app vs web credit discrepancy for challenges and videos. I'm pretty chuffed 😉.,
It works great from the student side once they know where to find their assignments. I wish that their was access on the APP from the COACHES side.,
"High quality and very clean app. Not a cheap trash can, like most of them. Amazing, recommend",
I've always wanted a way to express myself but couldn't...I always wanted to learn with no limit but couldn't I always needed a friend that understands me and my education Khan Academy is that friend.,
"Satisfied, good response from team for solving my issue... Really nice service, app works fine now",
How to change the U S standard of grades to Indian standard of classes.. Otherwise this is a great app but please do help me with my problem,
"Wow! This is what education through modern tech really should be. The best educational app ever created. I am proud of the developers and thank you so much for keeping it free. I will surely recommend it to others. Also,please add new content.",
"This ting is lit man! I learned how to do this 2+2-1 ting innit!   Ok, seriously, this is one of the best educational apps there is, thank you to everyone who got involved in this. It really saved me, got me into 6th form!!",
Despite having good internet connection the videos in the app doesn't play properly,
"You guys are awesome, most people would take money but this is absolutely free!!! Thank you so much Khan academy",
"I really like the app, but everytime a press sets in the mathematics section the app just crashes",
The videos are not visible but audio is heard. Please check the mistake.,
"Kudos to the team, providing such a quality content for free, great user interface, great lectures, great app, everything is awesome about this app #respect",
"The Indian curriculum section on the android app is missing. It's there on your website however, it doesn't exist here. Could you please add it? Thanks. Overall, I think it's a pretty impressive application since all the courses are available at no cost.",
"The videos should enable the subtitle option, like in the official website. That would make this app perfect",
"Incredible that all this education is free! I had been looking for something like that for a while to review some physics concepts! Love it, great app everyone should have!",
The best platform for free online learning. Also an excellent study aid for any school syllabus for all levels,
Worst app ever used!!! Doesn't show class 9 science. Only shows 11th & 12th class!! I recommend you to not download this app!!!,
Awesome teaching... Awesome videos... But in you tube you get extra videos like grammar but in your app it is not there.....thanks for the wonderful app,
Thanks khan academy because of you I'm always advance in my class. You should download this app. I give this app a 5 star.😄💖❤,
Please make your videos directly stream from YouTube. It would be a bit easier and time saver.,
Great work! But no q&a section in app. It inspires me to learn more. Curiosity has no boundaries. Happy learning :),
I would rather stay at home and learn from Khan academy than go to school,
Ty senpai khan for the great teaching methods and for all the other teachers as well.👍☺,
"Hands down to one of the best learning apps of today and hopefully, tomorrow! God bless ⭐",
One of the evergreen software on the play store....never miss it,
We thank you all for the wonderful encouragement to learn new things.,

I think khan academy is one of the best application for learning everything you want for free 😍,
OMG!! This is best app! I love it. Now I can learn as much as I want. Thank you Khan Academy.,
It's brilliant. So much helpful with various topics at one point. Easy-to-use and learn. Really loving it.,
I had given the correct answer but it shows not yet try again ....but when I see in hints it shows the same answer what I have given ....... the worst app I have seen ever,
"Great teachers, great lessons, and I like the way you teach guys. 
Everything is great",
The learning app! But some of the courses like SQL are not available on app while they are on website.,
Good for students preparing for competitive exams.please provide video quality options!,
Giving high quality education and for free!!! Really amazing app for education on the play store.,
"Apparently I ve used alot of apps(including Bijus, akash,  etc) but this is the best app around here....  Thankful to the creators 🌼❤️❤️❤️",
Not good graphics I think Graphics should be efficient also the face of the teacher should be revealed it helps understanding better,
It's a very useful app....one can learn multiple things related to any subject at the same place..,
Very useful & speacially thanks for your free service ..Best studying app in playstore,
Love it..Khan Academy Please try to put assignments of practice test for iitjee ..,
So helpful for those who can't afford the amount of higher education.,

It's okay,
I use khan academy on desktop but can you please bring Transcript shown in video itself?  Edit : i mean transcript showin inside the video itself like YouTube caption you got me?,
Five 🌟,
Muito bom,
Sangat membantu,
Epic app,
Ok,
🔥🔥,
This app is a must have for any student,
"Marvelous job by khan academy. Whatever they present is in perfect manner. But if you add General knowledge like Indian polity, Indian geography etc., then it would be more useful app and it will become a UNIQUE app. Eventhough you are replying for only negative feedback but as per me considering other parts i cant give negative feedback but if you add indian general knowledge then it would be helpful.",
"The courses are very informative and there's a lot of variety in subjects. KA is a great resource.   While KA is amazing and the app is wonderfully designed, there are several courses (specifically all the computer programming) that are not available in the app, meaning I still have to use the website anyway.    And although I didn't mark down for it, as I think it's more a bonus than a requirement, several videos don't have transcripts and none of the transcripts incorporate the visual examples given in the videos (such as diagrams, charts, drawings, etc).",
"I had previously rated this app 5 stars, but the devs didn't pay attention to what I complained about. I prefer the desktop version now, but it would be nice to have a good mobile app. Some videos are not available. They show up in the search box but i can't click on them. The unit test function randomly stops working. Please fix this soon!",
This application is a block buster. It alwAys helped me in exams. This is what I use to learn in my exam time.,
These app should have ratings 5.0 cause it's awesome by this app I got 93% in my half yearly examinations guys download it and rate it 5stars it's awesome app,
Best educational app This makes learning so much easier with all the information at your tips. Hats off to Sal Khan...,
"Good, but development needed. The videos stop downloading as soon as the app is in background. And sometimes the app stops working. But the topics and materials are very good during exams.",
"It needs a dashboard where I can see all my subjects. Also, captions in full screen would be nice",
I think this educational app stands in stars for me. I have never been so motivated while doing education with any app than this.,
Range of topics covered is impressive. The concepts are explained in such a manner that arouses the viewer's attention and clarifies misunderstandings. Awesome!,
The app I'm most grateful to. Thank you sal. I have one ardent request. Please add more math topics of college level. Thanks,
"I can not type my answers in, my key board won't pop up. Other than that I love khan Academy.",
"Absolutely love it! It has something for everyone. You actually learn, it's like home schooling. You get weekly progress reports, in addition to the ones you get when you try a session a second time. To top it all off, its FREE, what's not to love?",
"It is really a great app ,I have learned a lot of concepts of maths ,but now i  am facing  a issue about this app, in maths section the classes from 9 to 12 is not disclosed separately,which cause a great confusion.so please solve this issue as much as possible, I am waiting for your kind response.",
Extremely love it. It is just awesome I am a student of class 9 and I want to just learn extra so it is a very very good for me,
I started using Khan academy in college. I went from making c's to straight A's in Algebra. The lessons are taught and explained so indepthly and referenced back to prior material that everyone may learn all material and understand the priciples and apply them. Best learning aide available.,
"Salman sir, Can you please add an option to change the voice mode from 'globe' to 'Indian' so that it can become a little more convenient for people of India.",
App is good for learning. For developers : It stops working sometimes.,
"Great platform. App works well, could use improvements but already great so it can only get better.",
Good app. I just want to ask a question before reinstalling this app. Is there any text available instead of watching videos with sizes of 200 megabytes of data? If not then please add text or try to decrease the size of videos by 30-60%. Please reply to this review in Yes or No.,
I generally don't hate that this app exists but I wish the mastery challenges were available via app,
"Great app! I'll learnt in 3 hours what I couldn't in 5 years. The app is having problems though,crashing why taking the tests.",
I love it but you should make the app more like the website it should test me to see what my strengths and weaknesses are. Just a sugestion,
"Thank you so much for creating this app. Khan Academy really helps me in my 
examinations before",
"This app is incredibly useful! I'm home-schooled and this has been a lifesaver. It's hard to find any other apps or websites offering free courses and exercises and presented in a simple, easy to understand manner. Thanks a lot, Khan Academy!",
"This app is real good for who people want to improve theirselves!, This app is an good app to learn from and helpful at same time, I recommend you getting it If you interested in education&To learn!",
The best edu app but keeps crashing again n again pls fix it,
Please add video quality selecting option as here Internet is limited and  very expensive.,

"School is so unbelievably slow and mundane for me, particularly math, so I'm grateful for Khan Academy's existence, as it permits me to transcend the boundaries of school. Works brilliantly, and I've been using it for a couple of years now.  Note: number inteface lacks responsiveness on my Samsung Galaxy S2; I don't know if this is the case universally. Even so, I still use this app constantly.",
"Dear Khan academy,  First of all, I want to say that I will be forever grateful for how you have helped me, in so many ways. But I have experienced a few problems in the app, the biggest is the sound quality, all the audio sounds muffled, which is not the case in the same videos played in the browser. And also my bookmarks are not being saved, but that is a minor problem. It would be nice if these problems could be resolved.  Thanks again",
"This guy is awesome idk much about him never  did but in all the teachers I have studied under, this guy is the best . He clears your concepts you've been struggling with ,in little time . Thank you for doing this for free while majority of the rest of the world teaches if only given money. You are a true hero for students .",
I love this app. Great for all students. It would be really helpful if u guys add class 11 and 12 chemistry courses just like u have done for Physics and chemistry,
"I reall love this app. It lets me know all the lessons I am confused at school. The way they teach is superb!. Thank you for making this app possible. I've been using this for a year now, and all I can say is YOU'RE THE BEST!",
"In this Greedy world no one gives you FREE education but from the crowd stands a man who is different, who thinks everyone should receive education... He is the true messiah of students.... Hats off to Salman Khan, Ceo of Khan Academy",
I do not like how although I have linked my account with college board I am not able to practice the material I missed last time I tooqck the sat. Also I cant seem to find how to do practice problems on the app at all and only see videos. th experience on a pc is way better than the app which is only good for videos,
I Really appreciate this initiative. You guys are doing a wonderful job by helping the enthusiastic and needy learners who can't afford coaching classes. I m very thankful to khan academy.  Huge respect for you and your team Salman khan sir,
One of the best apps on Play Store that deserves editor's choice badge. No signup  No ads No subscriptions Free Knowledge. I don't know why it is still not a editor's choice,
"We mostly use the website for my son's home school curriculum, but the app has come in handy for when we are on the go or when I need to go over information beforehand.",
"I really love it the way you teach the lessons and also the quizzee after every lesson. The only problem I encountered is when I download large files, it wont finish downloading  :/",
This app is so good and gives so much access to a large amount of information. I do think that this app has helped me get good grades,
"There is a glitch in the addition and subtraction section. In the ""select strategies for adding within 100"" sometimes both give of the answers give the same number. And when you select the easiest one, the app found it as a mistake while it suppose to be right.",
"This is best app that helps me for school. I have tried many paid services,  but this is still. The best. Deserves a 5 star.",
"It's downloading functions need improvement, downloading is fine but it displays ""couldn't download this topic"", in actual it downloads them.",
I really loved this app. Thank u so much for this kind of educational app that provides education for free . A great solute for the creator.,
Really a superb app to learn almost everything.  But there's more videos in your website when compared to this app. Add more subjects in this app. Also bookmarks sometimes fails to save,
"This app is so amazing and very helpful we can easily take our courses on the go which makes Khan academy special because many websites or online academies don't really care about their phone users, but a little problem that I found is that not all the courses are brought to the app, there are few courses that i couldn't found on the app but they are on the website courses like programming, algorithms, and hour of code, other than that the app is wonderful.  Thanks",
I was having trouble in school but after I downloaded this app it helped me a lot. Now I understand subjects better,
"It's helpful, only that its work with Internet Explorer but not everyone on the world have a wider range of Internet Explorer. I suggest that Khan Academy establish an app that works with no videos",
"The application is good. I really like the subject list. The point system in the app does not work however. Completed videos are a great motivator for me to keep going, however it does not work properly. Completed videos randomly become uncompleted leading me to re-watch them.",
Wow its amazing its all for free I can't believe please Kp more chapters in physics but except that everything us awesome believe me Nd everybody download it❤❤,
"Excellent app when you re in need for a companion for studies. Got a lot of help in physics, chemistry and math and most importantly its free because in india, good education is fleecing ! Thank you khan academy.",
God bless the ceo salman khan .  god bless you Salman Khan god  bless him with worlds every happiness.i love this appp,
I wish it could hv Bangla subject for class 9 & 10 and College for bangladeshi students...many students are facing prblms in bangla.it would be very much effective if there is any section for explaination of bangla chapters of the respective class,
This app is finally fully integrated with interactive problems just like the website. You can earn points from anywhere on your mobile device. Keep up the great work!,
It is hard to find apps that are free and still very useful and easy to use.  The lessons are straight to the point and very explanatory,
Favorite education app. It helped me in my SAT as well as my other subjects with free help and assistance,
I like learning with this app it has so much stuff you can learn like animation even collage program's,
I just cannot express my love and gratitude towards Khan Academy and Mr. Khan! A very very very big Thanks. This app is helping me master my entrance syllabi which I don't have any idea about since I don't attend any tutions nor do I attend the college! Thank you sincerely!,
Khan Academy makes learning simple and allows users to set their own pace and repeat lessons as needed. This app and the website are both incredible tools! Thank you!,
Excellent initiate  to fill knowledge gap created by schools and formal education system,
"To think this is all free. Amazing app contents, ease of use. All around. Thanks lol im grateful for this.",
The app doesn't let you input exponents when answering free response questions.  This literally makes some impossible to answer correctly on the app.  The videos work okay though.,
Knowledge is power and should be free and not controlled. Thank you Sal. And thank Bill Gates for funding.,
"I have good Internet speed but the app doesn't load a video fully or if it does it is a poor quality. Also it doesn't let me download and store video, please solve this problem",
It's awesome because you learn many things like algebra and programing.,
"I love it. And asking to add ""Grammar"" subject on this app. Which is available on Khan Academy website.",
I'd love to give more than three stars but the thing is I can't start any videos .it just buffers for too long and never stops .so idk anything about the content . Please solve this issue ASAP.,
Khan academy is seriously the best unselfish app in this greedy world,
It's an amazing app to the aid of any student.   It's an app that should be approved in all educational institutions in the world.,
Sir i m not able to download video only 3or4 happen and other are not happen,
It's tge best studying app i had ever used i have being using it for my IIT preparation and its the most helpful for me and most thanks to Sal to make the video,
Really don't like the search part. Better without it. Because it does not help me anytime.,
Love this app it help me with things I need to know this os amazing,
Amazing app I totally love it.Sal is doing a gud job.,
it's definitely the best way to learn everything i've ever wanted. thank you very much!,
Was going all well...until I couldn't log in ! Really disappointed,
Great! Adding a video of visual stories about each concepts at last of every topic. Would clear & remember the concepts by seeing it.,
This is a perfect app but one problem--some of the videos are in bad quality which i don't liked.....,
Nice app to clear doubts but only one problem the clips are short And no example of how to implement the formula in the question,
I love the way you help me with my math class. I'm in love with this app,
Couldn't have asked for more,
First I want to thank Mr Sal Khan for this amazing app ever.,
Most useful app for a student. Thanks god that it is free of cost.,
App wants access to contacts for no other reason than data hoarding,
How could I cleared my doubts,
The best *educational* content which is offered free of cost which gets even better with the app... ☺,
Just wow! Amazing! Finally someone so nice to share their knowledge to all! I wish i could give this man a hug!,
I love very much this app and it is the best study appppp  Of all,
I love to earn badge through learning i want more exciting bagdes,
Extremely good but would help if the business and history could have regions,
This.Is.Amazing. This app is great at explaining subjects. Definitely improved my grades!,
One of the only few apps I feel worthy of a 5 star,
I will got first rank from this thank you Khan academy for free training thanks a lot,
Now I am ahead than everyone in class! Thank you!,
Khan Academy needs a little improvement in graphics in videos (especially History related) but it is a best classroom!,
Why there is no new content,
Brilliant App :) Very useful for all who are interested in learning.,
I have this in my computer and its awsome for me to study.,

"Please make a separate option for GED like you have for SAT,MCAT and others",
Please make it also for Primary because I want to study for my grades,

Its the best app for learning .,

Thanks for the humanity.,
"This is a really great app, especially if there was a lesson you didn't 
quite understand. Khan academy has videos/lessons and even exercises which 
can help you practice your skills in a particular lesson or subject. It's 
very helpful and I really thank Khan Academy for helping me with my 
schoolwork :>",
"It's a really helpful app. I've been using Khan Academy for a while now and I have an A in algebra 2 because of it. If you need to study for an exam or to catch up on something in class you should definitely download this app. And everyone rating this app 1 star and calling it bad because it's ""boring"" are very immature and stupid. I'd get it if it was something like the controls were horrible or if lagged too much, but saying it's bad because it's boring is completely stupid. It's not a game, it is supposed to help you study or learn something new.",
"Absolutely wonderful education tool for self-learners. You can skip what you already know and focus on what really challenges you, and every lesson plan is easy to navigate. And the bookmark feature is super handy. Mr. Khan is a highly effective teacher, and I wish I'd had one like him growing up. Great app and a truly world-class program FOR FREE!",
"! Sorry for asking stupid questions but I can't actually put +, %, * in the khan academy app!! Please would request u to help me out. Im using Redmi 4 and also the app crashes sometimes..!! Don't mind that but actually Im unable to put the following symbols",
"Indeed, a very education app for all individuals and with a variety of things to LEARN! It is promoting academic success for all ages and also helping inspire kids to being one of the giants that other kids will rest on the shoulders of, in a figurative sense, of course.",
"This app is fantastic. ""SO good comment... but why has he given 4 stars?"", you might be wondering right? The answer to your question is- in the seek option, the 10 second seek is fixed, it would have been better if we choose how much we want to seek would have made this app THE BEST APP😊👍👍👍",
This is the best educational app ever.They made up the lessons very creatively and  anyone can easily learn with it.Must install.,
"Nice app but it has only learning features, it should have tests also for many course and subjects like Neet too...",
This app has really a good sense. My teacher was absent before some day and I had to learn chemistry then I took help from 'KHAN ACADEMY' and I'v got 20 out of 20 in my chemistry exam. So thank you so much Khan Academy and make more educational apps like Khan Academy,
Uninstalled : / I was learning Grammar course by David from Khan Academy. Today I opened Khan Academy App in my phone to discover it's not available.I looked up the course in Art and Humanities section and it's not there. I really want to complete the course and please fix it as soon as possible Edit- I think i have the latest version your app and still cant find grammar session Help me,
A bit difficult to use. Khan Academy helpers how di I go to my eureka math on phone its difficult for me,
"Sir this app is really very effective for us we need this please reply me if you need any help from me but not financially,,☺☺",
"Sometimes The video gets reduced in quality and audio quality gets too poor,I didn't see any option to change the quality back",
"This is wonderfully unbelievable!😵😲when I use this app , I feel like I'm in the heaven of education! The most appreciated fact is that it's totally free and serves he highest quality even better than the costing programs..👍👌m in love with it...I would surely rate it million stars if I could..🤗Keep it up Khan academy ...",
"Shal Khan, thank you sooo much making this app,along with everyone else who contributed. I love Khan academy, especially Pixar in a box!",
"It is very good app. I love this app , please add engineering drawing/graphics in it. That will be helpful for engineering students",
"Excellent educational app! Currently studying degree level physiotherapy at university as a mature student, having been out of education for a long time! Extremely useful memory jogger! Chromecast feature would be good, to throw it on TV! Eyes are not what they used to be! Great work!",
This app is just like Christmas Morning and a chance to meet Father Christmas himself...😊😊😊😊 Good job and best of luck for the app developers as well as the teachers👍👌,
Its a really amazing app We we'll understand everything they teach Hope they add videos which covers the entire syllabus of 11th and 12th,
I like the APP. It is a great application. I got all of the Subject in it .And i want study with Germany language but there is not.Thanks,
This app has helped me to push myself into new knowledge. Salman Khan and his team deserve respect for their hard work and passion.,
"From math to history, Khan Academy is the best app to learn everything in easiest possible way. I hope the creator will also include more subjects and topics that the app is missing. And last not the least, thank you for such an initiative.",
"An amazing app for homeschooling and students who want to get ahead. Great lessons, get interface, all around just a great app. :)",
"No doubt bout the app , it's doing its job very well.. almost for the grades..  It's also have a section on electrical engineering but it would quite better if some more engineering lectures are available for different branches like mechanical... Hope u guys guys will be forward to that...",
"I can't do the exercises because it won't allow me to put in my answers, my keyboard won't come up",
App don't have all the topics like computer programming etc.,
Trash. It is nothing like my lessons that I'm in (AP high school Geometry),
"I am incredibly greatful for khan academy and the support it has lent my studies. Awesome app, and website, I highly reccomend it.  I used it for college level mathmatics supplemental lecture and practice.  Chemistry and art appreciation and physics.  all at the college level.",
"Omg, its really a very useful app. I suggest every one to try it at least one time.",
"Great for offline content on-the-go. But needs to support SD card storage. A lot of offline content is hundreds of megabytes. Also, the UI lacks the mission concept so does not allow kids to progress as they would on the web version. It's completely free-form.",
"Sal sir please give India's NCERT  content separately for physics,chemistry,maths and biology please .",
"Phenomenal app, very well done and the best part you have kept it free... keep up the good work :). Just a small suggestion - It would be nice if you also include other competitive exam modules and prep strategy like CAT, Civil services etc. Kudos !!",
I was not aware abt the academy earlier but thanks to Mr Batchan and kbc for asking question about the founder of khan academy,
I really appreciate Mr.Salman Khan for this initiative. The app is tottaly free and is too good for the people who are interested in learning.,
"I have never seen better learning app than this, it's great awesome",
"Very nice ,totally free and good videos but must include more videos on a particular topic..",
Thank you for everything you are giving me and every other Khan academy user. You guys are really helpful thank you guys for all the help you are giving. you are doing a great job. You guys are totally awesome!!!! And your videos are even more awesome and super useful. I can understand each and every topic with ease with the help of your videos. Thank again guys for your help.you are totally awesome!!!😊😊,
Very Helpful. I' ve been using this since 8th grade. Been getting good grades.,
This is amazing and the fact u can download videos and watch the videos offline just makes it unreal. It makes u wonder how this is all free.,
Educational app This app helped me in competitive exams by teaching me difficult topics.,
I put a answer and it says I'm wrong and then I find it has to be specific,
"Such a valuable  tool! As a parent I use it as well, to refresh my memory.",
Not able to access english grammar course.. kindly guide ..,
"Hi I'm 9 and im in primary 5 and I'm studying to become an operational doctor, and this app is really helping allot!!!thanks to the creators 😊👍 very impressive.",
App is good but one request please add transcript in full video like youtube....,
I think it is a great way to learn new things and to fresh up previous knowledge,
Videos won't load. It's not my internet connection. Works fine on my phone but not the tablet.,
"God bless the creator's of this, you guys seriously deserve awards for greatness!",
There is no option in app for subject which i want to learn there is no computer language course program  Worst experience,
"This is really awesome❤like, I got full in my chem test with this app!! Thanks sal",
I mean if you had to start learning something new they would give you from basics to advance they are awesome,
I voted for 5 out of 5 stars without even using the app... As I'm sure that Khan Academy is the best app...,
This app is wonderfully educational! It really helps me with math!,
Incredible app but I downloaded a bunch of stuff and the app wouldnt work so I had to reinstall it,
I am in 6th grade learning Algebra 1 and this  really helps me for tests and trying to understand concepts,
It helps to get good understanding of subject with different angle of approach towards subject,
I liked it. It was a little too much. I do like this app,
This is best app I have ever seen for education thankyou khan academy,
"Dear all User, pls fully support K.A in term of words and donation",
"Very good app and sure, free education anyway anyone..",

Please put a search bar to ease the looking up of different topics,
One of the best (if not the best) learning app,
I have to do this at school to and I just really do like like this math site,
It does what it says it does and it does it very well.,
"Whenever i download videos of a certain topic ,they couldn't download...please fix it",

"This app is pure educational, thank you for everyone who makes this app possible in Google Play, now everyone can learn things without purchasing",
"I'm writing review for first time because I find this app is awesome and helpful. I want to thanks the developers and as well the entire team who has contribution to develop this platform to learn.☺☺☺.  I Really appreciate it. Keep it up. And I would also like to sugest to add about JAVA,C++ and many more other subjects...",
I wish the lessons had more written articles rather then video. I find it hard to follow along with the video. I would rather read then listen.,
This App is Good it's teaches you right from the basics to an advance level of study. Try not to miss this app you could be doing yourself more harm than good. Trust me :),
"Awesome system. It would be great to be able to see streak info (especially did I or did I not studied something today). I'm sure it's already on the backlog, so I'll just wait :)",
"I would be better if subjects like political science ,geography and sociology are added,5 star for quick reply",
"This app is incredibly useful! Even though the school system is flawed and students don't get to learn what they want to learn, this app allows me to learn subjects not taught at my school, like music and animation.",
This app helped me with my studies! I'm now first in my class Academically. ( Now I just need to work on attendance ;u;),
I really recommend this app. It helps me to do my homework and to practice for my tests.,
Plz add if possible high level education...Like Graduation level ...I am student of Economics,
It's very interested app i loved it  Most helpful iit jee app,
The best to help you archive your greater goal,
Pretty good. Teaches the concepts properly and with clear Understanding,
"Most helpful educational app,👏",
"So easy to learn, maths is so much fun",
"Thank u, it was such a good work",
This is the best app or site of lerning were u get world free class educating and the basics r cleared here and u can test your self,

Very wonderful,
When all the content will be avaiable in the app?,
Love it,
I cant find now option for physics india please help,
"It's best free eucation app I've ever used. I gave it five stars. But it has few flaws. First, it pauses often when I'm watching the lessons or talks. Second, most subtitles don't come out with right timing when the videoes become near to the end, and the subtitles occupy the half of the screen. That make a little disturb for watching. Hope you will fix these problems in next version.",
It's the greatest free educational app out there. I love how they simplify common problems like for example math equations. It's just a nice app to have if you're a student struggling to understand what his/her professor is saying. Hopefully you guys won't have a pro version in the future...,
"""These is very helpful to me,its an ammazing app. I am very thank ful to khan academy that you provide the education free in the world wide. From khan academy i can learn any thing especially maths and physics and yes english too...Thank you very much for this app.I was waiting for these kind of app....""",
"A Fantabulous App to learn anything you want and all at your finger tips.. thanks to educator Sal Khan who made this possible.. it helped me a lot with my board exams as well my Olympiads..Thanks to Khan Academy for that I can learn anything I want and I have nobody to say ""You too young to know it."" I have had tried many online educational portals but ""East or West Khan Academy is the best""..",
"the organization of this app is nothing like the web site. on the website there was a subjects menu from which you could access material by grade, such as grade 5. In this app, its just not there or hidden somewhere I cannot find. instead, I have to figure out what the grade 5 material is and then search for it using the search function. Then go through the search results to make sure it is at the level that corresponds to my childs math book. You're better off sticking to using the website if you require finding practice material by grade level. This app gets 1 star because the material is invaluable if you can find it.",
"Khan Academy helped me through my college math 4 years ago. We were in a tough financial bind. My instructor advised Khan Academy and it worked wonders! I still use it for my children when the teachers and myself don't quite explain it throughout their understanding. I am now homeschooling and use Khan Academy as a tool when Math, even ELA, gets tough. My 3 daughters are in 9th grade, my sons are in 5th, 3rd, and my youngest two are in 1st grade.  DOWNLOAD THIS APP ON YOU PHONE, COMPUTER, TABLET,  heck EVERY DEVICE POSSIBLE! It helps not just grade school, but ""Kindergarten and BEYOND!""",
"I love the concept as well the website version. As a parent I do not care for the app. Though. Maybe I haven't figured it out or did something wrong, but from the app I cannot monitor my child's progress with assignments. It seems I can just learn or watch videos as if I am the actual child on the app. That is it. But when I go to the website and sign in I get a complete overview of what my child is doing. The idea is GREAT! But I would like to use the app in keeping an eye of when my child has homework assigned through school. Until then this app has become pretty useless to me. I go to the web to check assignments and rarely touch this app. If I'm missing something, please someone let me know. Maybe I didn't sign up correctly, but like I said from the website version I'm able to get on and see assignments no problem. It just isn't translating to the app the same and for that reason the app is generously getting 3 stars.",
"It is the best app ever created regarding education which is 100% free. It explains the concepts so clearly that all my doubts get cleared on the spot. I just loved. If I could, I would have given 100 stars to this app.",
Im struggling with my math subject but through this app It helps me a lot to improve.. Thank you,
"Khan Academy reminds us that education should be available for everyone - for free. Thank you Khan Academy for transcending cultural, social and economic barriers. I firmly believe that education can help shape a better world we so desperately need.",
"It's great that there is finally a version of Khan for smart devices! I have just entered the new school year and could not be happier about all the new possibilities that follow this change. Just tried it, tou should too! It is truly amazing. 😁",
This App is very helpful especially in mathematics.  I've been working on this app with some students and those kids finds it interesting too. Learning beyond classroom.  Learning in a fun way.,
"This is the best learning tool I ever used, even my teacher recommended it to the whe class. AND IT'S FREE.",
"Great for my students to practice what I assigned. Wondering if there is a ""coach"" version so I can assign items from my phone versus the computer.",
Great app by khan academy team.One thing I would suggest that please keep an option for doubt solving in the app and keep doing the good work.,
"Best app. What I feel is that it lacks , with the materials for Mechanical Engineering. So.. Please provide some materials for Mechanical Engineering and for GATE exams. Thanks",
It is excellent. They teach you the simplest way they can . Instead of by Jus app where you have to pay money here it is free,
"It's a great app to learn in a less boring way.Can you guys add a filmmaking course,that would be great",
"Well, this app is actually pretty good but what's horrible is this freezes, crashes, and even DOESN'T SHOW THE QUESTION! Also easily lost it's network, please fix because this app is amazing without all that, if you can fix it i will make it 5 stars thanks :-)",
#grattitude to Khan academy and it's team it's a huge help for the students but I couldn't download the videos in the bookmarks Completely I mean continuously it stops in the middle and shows couldn't download this topic even though I have strong network please solve this,
I was not good in physics after using  this I am able to understand physics.  Perfect app for all subjects.,
This app is really helpful...It helped to understand some hard things in easiest ways,
The app is perfect but for some reason I can't download any video for offline mode.,
Thanks for including class 11 and 12 physics and maths courses and also thanks for providing all these for free.,
"Apps great! Company's great! I lover being able to just pull up a quick video, learn something and then practice what I learned!",
I absolutely love Khan Academy but they should at least have those mastery challenges on here...,
Points have been explained in the easiest way possible..u can't find a better learning app..thank u sal,
No Indian curriculum maths can be found on app whereas it is available on website.,
Helpful to people like me to learn more get help and study for a quiz and a test,
"So I'm a freshman coming back to school from the summer,  and I forgot almost everything I've learned in 8th,  and since school doesn't adequately teach u anything,  this app is real useful",
Very useful app. ♡ But there is a problem downloading some videos for offline purposes. Thank you!,
This is a very good app if u are looking for the best and detailed explaination for college and high school students. Love it.,
"50% of my time in college was spent on Khan Academy. Without this website, I would've been much more stressed. Thank you so much for making this accessible and free for us. It is truly an invaluable resource that educates the community.",
This is a good app but may I suggest adding Zoology and Animal Sciences as well as Biochemistry. Please.,
Starting maths in university and this really sorry helps iron out little things and remind about bigger ones,
Helpful beyond words.  An eternal gratitude from me for making Khan Academy.,
"It's  pretty  cool, And I LIKE THE way they  provide good  details",
All the other apps I have tried JUST revise 1 thing but khan academy is perfect,
Its great! It really helped me when i wasnt sure about what i was learning in class,
"Amazing quality . 100% free . Good explanation and complete topics of 
syllabus . Good for entrance exams like CET , JEE etc .",
I was bad at math but this app really helped so much and it only toke me 2 to 3 weeks,
"Can't believe this is free! The app deploys a series of videos via a really simple teaching technique (coloured 'pens' on a black slate) which ensures terms are explained as they are introduced. This means that you never fall behind, which is particularly helpful in the science topics. In addition, the narration is incredibly engaging; I even watched two hours of history topics (not my area at all) on my second day with the app. A must-have addition to your Android /iOS device...",
Very *boring* and I can't understand it well as it get boring in a minute,
Helped me pass both college math classes. Math isn't my best subject! :),
"One of the best designs I have ever seen, very intuitive and comfortable to use.",
Should be 5 Stars. Gold Standard right to the point. Amazing Step by steps!,
Guys keep up the good work. This is a very useful app. Thanks,

There is no computer algorithm section in this app. Take a look abt that,
Great app but there should be sat 2 also,
I want more information and more subjects from you,
Absolute greatness!free tutor!free app!the only thing to stop you is you!,
This is the best for free education. After starting this now i love maths.,
Makes every topic fall in love with learning like play,
Could use a few improvements but it is nonetheless a great app,

Math Sucks,
thanks sal,
",👌",
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,
I honestly wouldn't mind if you guys had ads in your vids because each of them is worth it. I'm in pre-med and your videos honestly helped me understand a few topics from my classes. Now if only you guys had a broader coverage on subjects *cough* medical ones please *cough*. That would be really really appreciated.,
I'm really thankful to this app for helping me gain so much knowledge and making things easier to understand in an interesting way.Highly recommend this app.Till now I've not found a single app(that is free) with such great features.Once again thank you so much Khan academy!  Edit: Thanku so much for adding 11th and 12th maths NCERT videos...Would be really helpful if you add physics and chemistry NCERT videos too.Some chapters of Chemistry in the NCERT book are really a lot more puzzling and many students are found struggling.,
"I really liked this app but one thing I prefer is learn while reading. Yes I would suggest, maybe, that you could make a feature that enables the student to choose the video lesson or the wrote lesson. I think it's a good upgrade, I dont even know if there is people who agree with me.",
I donot see option to go to my son's school mission program... it is confusing website and mobile app program,
I love it. It helps you if you don't get it. It goes at your own pace. You can choose what lesson. There are mastery challenges that make sure you master the skills you practice. No glitches. One bad thing is that you have to have WiFi and Internet to do. I would recommend getting it.,
In my child's profile on the app we cannot enter info in fields provided.  Extemely frustrating.  I exited the app and still no keyboard.,
That's a perfect app. I don't have words to describe it. Thank you so much for this awesome app.,
"Best math application, and teacher I've ever had. I've been using it every night before bed. I haven't enjoyed math my entire life, but now I look forward to doing it just for fun.",
"I want to say it is good but it has alot of bugs that NEED to get fixed! I want to see this app inprove, it's useful if you get these bugs out.",
"Thanks a lot sir,  Your app is of great help to students. The video lectures are interesting and also absolutely free.",
"I learn new things everyday with this app! I love that you can download content so you can learn ""on the go"". There is such a wide range of subjects you can learn from. I can't imagine what I would do all day without Khan Academy.",
"Half my time is spent watching the video lesson play out, the other half is spent watching the video lesson buffer. This is never a problem on YouTube. So forget this app. I'll just watch on YouTube. Great content though!",
I'm shy student. It helped me a lot,
"Great app, so much to learn and it's a productive way to kill time",
Fatabulous! Awesome!  I thank you from bottom of my heart Good work !,
I can't find programming languages.,
Helpful app really helpful in IIT Preparation and others gain lot of knowledge and experience is good love it but teaching is very high level most of students can't understand it teach in simple way and language,
"Hey everything's working fine. I just have one concern though, why is it that whenever I download for offline reading, the articles would not open? It says to download once again. Hope you could fix this! Thank you! More power!",
This app is for kids and I especially love it so much . Thank you Khan academy,
I can't able to practice and not able to accomplish my mission in this app,
Much better than other e-learning sites and in addition to that it's completely free,
I love this app but it needs the ability to cast then I would give it 5 stars.,
"Best app ever,my middle school uses it and it works incredibly well.",
Good app but keeps crashing,
One of very few apps deserving of a 5 star rating!,
There should be option of downloading into SDcard,
"it helped me allot , explanation videos  Are  awesome",
You people are doing great work.,
Wow its  perfect and surprisingly free,
God bless the man who made this.,
The only app I found which have relevant topics which are free.❤❤❤✌,
The best !!!!!! Not nothing More to say .,
Please make a widget for this app and this will officially be the only app on the playstore students need in their lives,
Excelente aplicación. Aprende distintos temas,
Bangla version er app ?,
Perhaps the best app for learning,
nice.,
lots to learn here,
The best,
Good,
Nice,
Amazing,
Super!!!!!!!,
Awsam,
"This is the future of learning. For the last 3 years I've had bad teachers in both physics and math, and even though I'm German and English isn't my mother tongue, with Khan Acedemy I had no problem keeping up. Sal is an amazing educator, with his calming voice he's able to impart each topic in a both professional and clear way. Thank you.",
"Fantastic Application. I love the design data usage is minimal but there are some slight issues.  First while watching videos, we should have the ability to rotate the screen horizontally and still be able to see the transcripts.  Then we should be able to practice for SAT in the app. Not online.   Finally Schedules for study sessions should be created. I'll love a notification saying ""Aniekanabasi it's time for your medical classes""   I'll really appreciate that.",
"I'm a high school student, and my teacher has a coach page, which there is no way to enroll into it on this app. So I went online and enrolled there, which worked on the browser, but when I opened the app with the same account, it still shows nothing. There is no way to find coaches or even do work for them on the app. This was very frustrating please add a way to enroll and do work for coaches.",
I'm 24 now and didnt even know my timetables. That is embarrassing! I have been studying for months on end. The interface is somewhat addictive because I enjoy getting points for learning. I am now studying biochemistry all thanks to Khan genius website and app. This has changed my life. Thank you so much.,
It is amazing how a free app offers you a bunch of knowledge in various subjects. I just started today and it feels like going back to school to hone the things I already learned AND learn more things. I would totally recommend this to my younger cousins who are still in school to help them. Great work!  [Edit] the voice quality of the video changes when you download it. Can you fix it on your next update please? Thank you 😄,
"Better than I expected. A little glitchy, but works well for me. Before using this, I knew for certain I would be flopping the ACT because most of my mathematical skills went out the window over the years. Pretty sure that if I keep at this app as hard as I have been, I'll be able to go to the college that I want... But minus one teensy star (would be half a star if it were allowed) for the occassional glitches that count my answer wrong when the hints assure me I'm right. Slows down my progress a little. :(",
I had a hard time to understand chemistry from my tutor but the way they teach and explain is just so awesome it makes me come back again and again... Great job and kudos to the tutors and heads of khan academy for making an impact on the education system,
Nothing to say about you khan sir you are genius just you made us complete its amazing app I have ever seen on android. Basically I don't review any of the app. First of all it uses so less data. The most important thing this is not a battery draining app.😘,
This is the best educational purpose app out there.I thank Sal Khan for every effort he has put in through his videos. Through Khan Academy I was able to learn a lot of things previously I didn't had any knowledge of.How each and every topic whether in the field of science or computer or history is explained with such simplicity that it attracts the interest of everyone. I am really thankfull for the support and knowledge they provide through their videos They helped me a lot to prepare for my studies and give me a better understanding apart from book knowledge. Thank You for Making this happen!,
"I've read the comments and there is Alot of hate, to me this app has everything you need to get where you need to be in math, any of the negative comments are just looking  for a quick cheat sheet, this explained everything for you to understand it, and then do it yourself, if you think it's boring, then your not trying! I came across these videos on YouTube and have watched quite a few on repeat there, then found out it was also in an app, so thank you very much for this! It's means more than you know for someone with not even enough money to pay bills, let alone have to pay for tutor or books and all that,  thank you for helping me work on furthering my education!",
This is an amazing learning tool for both teachers and students!  Students can watch videos on the topics they are struggling on and practice with different problems. I have posted a few videos on Google Classroom for clarification.  This program is by no means boring or useless like some students say on reviews.,
"Well, this app doesn't needs any reviews and ratings as it is just fabulous in itself. The videos, syllabus, explanations, every content is just perfect and makes you addicted towards learning. Highly appreciable initiative of respected KHAN SIR.... Gratitude... 😊",
I'm so thankful to you Sal. You are an awesome teacher. Great job by you and your staff. Thank you for adding Class 11 and 12 chapters According to the Indian syllabus. IIT JEE also helps. A request Pls add more problems and their solutions.,
"A great gift to humanity, sharing the most valuable thing in the universe for free, knowledge. Thank you to all the incredible group of people that made Khan academy happen and work on continuously making it better. Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of knowledge for free.",
"I like the app, the only thing I would like is that I could cast the videos to my TV from within the app, since I have a tablet that doesn't have that feature natively.",
I love just wandering through it and picking up new bits of info. It's like having a resource library in pocket size.,
This app is meant for learning not having fun. Math is my favorite subject so I don't have a problem with it. Very helpful and insightful.,
"Maybe it was just my luck/my phone, but the all seemed to be very unresponsive and caused all my work to be deleted.",
"Really amazing app. It's great for learning math when you don't have access to a computer. Easy to use, responds well, and has all the functionality of the website.",
This app is just what you need when you feel exhausted after searching all the world.... really helpful,
"Trying Khan's app after their website. Overall I strongly recommend the content from Khan Academy, in my case, to anyone who's studying anatomy. I like it a lot so far and have learned a lot of information from them before I hit the real books.",
I could not be more thankful for this program. There is a lot to be gained here and it's free.,
"I grew up with some khan academy in my life.  Everytime I need a good refresher, I know a good place to go to.",
The most helpful tool for beginners. It helps me get threw school much easier! Thank you Khan Academy.💗,
The app doesn't have all the courses available on it's website. Actually the app has very few of them. I couldn't find any course on programming.😡,
Awesome app. Best app to understand any particular concept. Overall basic understanding of a concept can be improved by watching this videos. The features of the app are also amazing.I especially liked the offline feature which facilitates the chance of studying on the go in any place if we download beforehand. Thanks a lot for sharing knowledge in a very modern and smart way.,
"It is very useful. it helps me so much to understand biology, physics and chemistry. Even schools should start using it.",
I am from Pakistan.... Thank you for supporting students not only in India but in every corner of the world thanks again,
"This is  my one of the most  favourite  applications. Like others, I love  Khan  Academy very much. Especially  it is extremely  useful  for those people  who want to learn something related to their academy.",
I swear I haven't used it yet but am still rating it whole 5 stars since I've been through   many of their videos on YouTube.  Such a heaven for students!  Keep up the good work peeps!,
"Well it was good at first, great actually. But now when i tap on any video, ANY actually, it just says: link failed to upload. My WiFi was having good connectivity. So guys just watch out.",
Brilliant app/site/way of learning.  One request though. Chromecast support for the vids would be brilliant.  Cherrs,
The greatest thing you could do is spread knowledge and this person is doing the great job. Simply love the app.,
"Thank you for the amazing things you gave us with this initiative, Sal Khan! I learn a lot from you. Knowledge must be spread, and you are helping millions! Thank you very, very, very much!",
"Very glad someone makes it easy to gain quality education. Thank you for taking the time to teach the public for free, your a true dog Khan.",
Very very useful app but downloading full courses not working properly it's always shows couldn't download this topic,
This is really wonderful app.This is so much educative and now I really believe that I can learn anything.Thanks Khan Academy.,
I mean.. It's totally free and it has almost every concept you need  to know. Than you Khan Academy.,
I loved the app. Please add more on Quantum Physics and Electronics. I just love it. Please also add SD CARD save option.,
Amazing service and great that there's an app. App just needs more functionality to make it seamless from using the website.,
Never stop learning anyway you can. Thank you for another way to learn and give millions an alternative way.,
LOVE! I've been using Khan academy for years to help me understand various subjects from chemistry to biology to physics. It's phenomenal.,
"Please... Add an option to change the video quality to 240p. Everybody doesn't have broadband and wifi services. I watch videos on mobile data. If there is 240p quality option available then one can watch twice the videos with the same amount of data. Otherwise The app is really great, no doubt about that...",
Since khan academy app is free and contains no ads it's a great opportunity for student.Thank you for the contribution to free education.,
"This one is really helpful. It really is worth downloading, I recommend it, no matter which subject you are struggling with. Also, you should watch/search Crash Course. Those guys are absolutely great :)",
Videos are playing fine now. Still lacking a few lesson plans from the website.,
Their SAT practice is horribly difficult and the explanation is very unclear when is comes to detangling the messier problems.,
Was struggling in college with calcus and this app helped me to get the basic all the was and now I get it alot better,
I recommend this for most schools even the school I go in mathematics is were im bad im still confused with percentage and percentage quantity,
"I love what Khan Academy is doing, and the content is great. This app would be even better if you could Cast the videos to Google Cast devices. You can find the videos on YouTube and do it, it would just be more convenient in-app.",
Videos should be available in more languages (atleast hindi) and there should be videos on CBSE course too.. Good luck...  App is awesome for concepts,
Amazing app. So easy to learn and lots of rewards make learning more enjoyable. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone!,
Finally i found excellent app for listening classes this app is simply superb  ⛤⛤⛤⛤⛤ my suggestion is please give option to change vid quality,
"As MOOC sites continue to reduce features for free users, Khan academy just keeps improving! I love the achievements and that it marks content complete as I finish it",
Im in fifth grade and forgot to do long division and this refreashed my memory on this,
"This is the best online learning source, now I can brag my skills in school!",
"It's not the app that is so great. It's the idea of Mr. Khan that is helping students, educator and learner's. You can learn n no time.",
Simply ★★★★★ .But you guys need to make the description and pics above more convincing. The things above don't reflect the kind of goodies you offer for free.  Ps. Add English as a subject.,
Khan Academy is one of the few things around that suggests the future isn't going to be shi++y,
TOO HARD  A nice app but too hard there's nothing that matches me and nothing my level,
"Mastery based learning on here, superb if you need to catch up on classes you didn't quite get at the time and incredibly vast courses!",
This academy helped me get a 10 in organic chemistry at university and since then I am participating in teaching it. Thanks a lot Khan Academy!,
"It would be 5 stars if there's a German language. Come on, you have it on Web.",
Helps very much in education. It can also be used in classrooms. A precious thanks to Sal Khan.,
I will give him 2 more stars if he adds grammer and English I need help on it badly,
The app is great and the videos aid learning complex subjects in an incredible way. One addition that would be great would be the ability to choose the downloads folder so that videos could be saved on an SD card. Thanks!!,
The most brilliant study app. Thank u Sal Khan for your excellent teaching.  One request - pls add biology and chemistry for (class 11 and 12 India). I've learned loads already from this app. Thank u again.,
I wanted to do the practices on my phone. After the update exactly that is possible super thankful. Khan Academy is awesome!,
This app definitely help me with my study.. Love the free videos and lesson.. Very helpful,
Very nice app for pcm stream no other app can help you like this,
Omg this took away all my stress Thank you so much,
They don't have the 'practice' option on the app. Website is better than the actual App  👎,
"Good for a few subjects, haven't added anything for computers in months and months.",
"Best App! Its very decent, easy to use and more specifically, subject oriented. It has a wide variety of questions that get you through that intense prep easily! I love it. ❤️😃",
"What an app this is ? It has helped me since i knew it over many subjects and different kind of school level subjects it offers too but all this for free, i just wanted to let know the founders of this app that he will change the world.     This will help your child try it and you will see by your self",

"Please add subjects from the web version that are not on the app, e.g. computer programming, as well as topics like algorithms. Both of these are there on the website but not on the app.",

"The content is great; but the format/UI of the app I find very cumbersome. It would help a lot if it were at least a little closer to the website. It's easier to write with the scratch pad on a tablet by leaps and bounds, but it's hard to get to where you were on the tablet. I usually just do the missions & practice work, but having to scroll and fumble through every little subcategory is very tedious.",
"Khan Academy has helped me in learning a lot of things that I didn't have any interest in at school. It makes learning fun, open and rewarding. Although, there are some videos that are huge in size. I usually download videos at night (when the internet connection is fast) and watch the videos during the day, so some videos that are 10 minutes long are like 120 MB in size and some videos that are 5 minutes long are under 1 or 2 MB. I hope the team makes the videos more compressed so it isn't too big. I think 20 - 30 MB at max would be really helpful.",
"Very nice app with courses on a very diverse collection of topics. All the videos are high-quality and the learning experience overall is great.   The only problem I faced is that when downloading a course, I am constantly getting ""Can't download this topic"" errors, even though my connection is stable. (If this information is any helpful, I am using WiFi, I have enabled Autostart for this app, I am not using power saving mode, I have tried to download without locking the screen and no other app is conflicting with it).   In the end, this is a great app and I strongly recommend to check it out.",
"It's a good app, but I have a suggestion, it would be awesome if there's a workspace or something handy to solve math problems in the app, like anything that isn't included in the in-app questions, I want to solve a math problem, but I don't have a tool which would guide me with that particular sum. So if you had a tool, it would just be a wonderful thing, thanks",
This is by far the best app for refreshing on math skills and learning new subjects. Extremely thorough. Keeps me intrigued and I can challenge myself.,
Great app but at the end of every video the next video does not play automatically and even when I touch to play the next video it switches back again to portrait mode. two really small bugs but considering the length of the videos are very small like less than 5 minutes in most cases it's really annoying,
"I use Khan academy mostly because my teachers force us to log hours during the summer, but I still understand the use that people have for it and how it can be helpful. But, on the app, you can barely do anything. You can't add coaches on the app, you can starts missions, and you can't see anything to do with missions. And if you can, then it is expertly hidden. The app is simply a lot worse than just using the browser on my phone or the computer. Please update the app the have the same use and features that it does on my computer. It's annoying and I am disappointed in the company for not making a better app.",
"A suggestion... I'm completely in ❤ with this app, but the only prblm i face is downloading the videos when there's some internet issues. Pls add a feature to download and save the videos so we can watch it whenever we want even without internet... Lyk some offline feature... Hope this will be taken into consideration. 😊",
Thank you...thanks a lot. You guys helped me to understand the concepts which made almost no sense back at the collage.,
"I really love this wbesite/app, it has alot of good information on it, and has helped me get through many classes. My only recommendation is that they add a few lessons about the asvab. Otherwise this is perfect.",
"I just downloaded this, but why wont any video play? Ive been trying to reload the videos but nothing happens. I also do not have problems with my internet. Its disappointing, I was looking forward to this app. Hope it gets fixed soon.",
The way guy the explained a lot of things was kind of confusing me. Other than that a pretty good app.,
best best best best ...... update: please provide HD videos for offline in differential calculus and algebra. Video quality is good for physics but poor for these mentioned above. And also sometimes audio of offline videos is blurred. I hope to see the changes in the next update.,
Its a great app. It helps u to clear ur basics. Concepts can be easily learned with access to videos. A great help for competitive exams.Thank you,
"Its a nice app, but works bit differently from the original website. Which creates problems.",
We use this in homeschooling almost daily. My daughter has struggled with math in the past at public school but the videos & instruction on this app have really changed that. Thank you!,
This app is really good! I think it could also be a lot better when you can try putting quizzes and such (as well as missions) on the KA app,
"As an animator that got accepted into artschool but can't afford to go, Khans Academy is a godsend.I still have to learn my craft and an opem source like this with real information I can learn and grow from is beyond amazing.",
"I want give something, if developer agree with me. I want you to add some setting about watching video with transcript in landscape mode it to become simple",
Thank you for giving us platform like this.In this app teacher start teaching in the basic so student can understand better.this is free so student like me studying without help of their parent .app like this make phone useful.In this age teaching and education is a business.thank you for giving us free education,
"This is the best education app and it's free. I love to study and learning , I hopes someday I can become like APJ Abdul Kalam And Salman Khan, Thank you for making this happen, Salman Khan",
I think this is the best app for learning thing's like math science and other stuff thank u Salman Khan for making this app,
The best learning app with everything you want learn. Even iit jee problems,
Life changing app👌👍ever since I started using it (last year I think) I've been getting really good marks 🙌and it helps a lot for lazy people like me 🙋 who don't like reading textbooks😘,
"I have not used the app yet, but I didnt know how else I could reach out to you. I have been learning physics through your website and I love it. I learned a lot. However I want to know what physics topics are included in the mcat becuase the vidoes go above and beyond topics. Pls help me!",
"Amazing organization. But the app doesn't seem to have all the content. Few courses are missing like intro to grammar, courses related to basics of coding, etc",
best app to learn all subject knowledge basic to advance (free of cost) Thank you salman khan for making this app free of cost,
"This is the best education app i have ever used , its too supportive... And I really mean it This app has taken my studies to a different level, I will always be thankful to you",
"The app is truly great but I would like to request to make 
Coding(JavaScript) Tutorial available on the app.",
Probably the most useful Educational app on play store. I'm using it since two days and I'm really amazed with the teaching techniques. You will never feel boring or tired of using it. It is so interesting.,
Before this update I was able to watch videos easily but now when my Tablet is placed horzontaly in landscape mode only the text is visible and the video is not. please fix this this is one of my favourite apps but I am not able to watch videos comfertably now. please fix this fast,
From googling a question on Kirchhoff's law to confidently downloading an app that starts with letter K. Calculate the probability of that happening on a Sunday afternoon and the answer gives you a glimpse to the enormity of solution you proffer....Bravo!,
I've installed and uninstalled this app many times over the past few years due to the easier navigation and resources on the actually website. I just downloaded it once again and I have to say... magnificent job. Easy interface and tons of updated education.. for free.  Def rec'd for free courses,
"The videos are good enough but I have trouble navigating. I want to practice SAT questions but all that comes up are the videos. If anyone could guide me on this,  that would be great.",
Awesome work guys. But there's a little problem in video quality. Still it's worth of 5 🌟.,
"Khan academy is in our school also(BAL bAHarti Public school, Haryana ) ..nd. there is a specified period given to khan academy. Nd  I m loving it",
Worked fine initially but now the video only displays a plain green sheet without any writing for all videos making it impossible to understand concepts.plz fix it ASAP,
Great app! It helps me relearning the basics to most difficult.,
It's kinda useless to me that mastery challenge functionality isn't available on the app.,
I have found a new teacher to whom I can look forward to every single moment and still it is endless.,
It helped me survived and triumphed in high school. And I am here to give respect to the creator of this app.,
this is really a great app... loved it.. guys who are still thinking to install it or not.. go ahead and install it...  i m sure u won't regret,
"I am shivam and I comment for first time on any app and my review is that ""It is so good to be explained""",
I learn everything off of this app. My son thinks I'm a genius because I have an answer for any homework that he has!!!,
I think the skill check tests difficulty level should be increased for gaining more perfection in a topic,
You really need to fix the downloading feature of the app for slow networks as it keeps on restarting the download from 0 percent,
I used to use this on PC then i was curious and i checked if there was an app and there was!!,
God for the study for poor people's and this helps people's Who are unable to go to  school,
I hate you Sal Khan kill yourself please.,
This app is so educational and useful that it would help me a lot with my assignments and studying. This app is worth it.,
Wonderful app. I just downloaded the new update and the app won't open again.,
This app is extremely wonderful no other educational app can be as wonderful as khan academy,
Best app for studying. Please download this. This app has helped me a lot. Thanks,
Great app! My only suggestion is that you can send and reply to comments.,
Love the content! But please add support for Chromecast and picture in picture video.,
"Thank you developer and the creator, You are one of the kindest people in this world.",
Awesome app and everything is free here to learn...great of u khan academy,
I understand things so fast and they explain things through,
"One of the finest EDUCATIONAL app ever seen..!! U people are doing a great job... The topics provided are very much clear and ""THE BEST THING"" absolutely FREE.. all topics are easily understandable...👍👍",
App is useless. No access to dashboard,
Good content but hangs my tablet and restarts it,
"I am trying to open this app , but it crashes suddenly. It doesn't open also . What should I do , How can I fix this? Please help me.",
"Amazing, hope I get that A in Organic Chemistry haha thanks a lot guys",
More skill checks and tests should be added in arts and chemistry,
It's good but needs more videos including examples on organic chemistry Loved it,
Excellent and thorough explanation of every topic you would need. Great work by the founder.,
A great way to catch up on your school work,
It is very good app but more updates required,
Amazing app made me learn many subjects especially physics,
Great app I love it must have app as well as the best app on the market love it,

"The best app I've ever encountered in my life. I think it's not only an app but a true teacher and i really wanted to be it's deciple because the way they deliver the topic and provide authentic information is just priceless. Thank you so much sal khana and team, you people are making a difference in true sense.",
"Highly integrated system - can't believe it's free. It list all educational material in order, as you would learn it naturally. Video lessons with computerized test. I've been able to refresh a whole semester of school on difficult subjects like algebra. Some have rated it one star for boring. Actual real learning usually is. These one stars just prove the program works.",
Fabulous idea by the creators of this app.Feels like we can study the same way line Finland. Just one request I want to mention is that give option for decreasing the video quality as to save Internet because its costly and not everyone can afford it. Other than that everything is good. Keep it up.😊,
"Good stuff, must have learning app. Some if the earlier videos by Khan himself are in need of a redoing though, and those being the more obscure advanced topics, are also frustrating when encountered. Also, courses/playlists such as English Grammar are available as a youtube playlist but not in the app. That shouldn't happen.  17/10 recommended to all learners.",
Love that everything is free. There atre a lot of subjects and grades. One complaint is when the guy explains us a lesson he can be very confusing.,
"Very helpful. I used this the summer after 6th grade and I started on seventh grade level to get ready for seventh grade, and it taught me things that I hadn't learned in 6th grade, that I needed to know before moving on the seventh grade.",
I have been searching this kind of helpful and educational app for a long time and its free!! I would like to thank you for this. So easy to understand and makes me want to study more more and more as a college student. May God bless😊😄,
"It is probably the worst thing that has happened to me in the 6th grade, 👎 and I'm forced to use it making it worse",
This app makes math boring. It also makes little to no sense. Don't buy it.,
Wow I thought it was going to be boring but it turned out cool.... My mom wanted me to download it,
"Best study application ever designed for students to understand any topic with ease. I really found it very helpful during my studies. It has all type of contents, that too for free. Surely the best learning application of this century. All the best Sal Khan,  keep your good work going. You are really a great person.",
I have a learning disability and this has helped me so much..I love this app.,
Makes history (and other nerdy things) more interesting and easyer to understand. I now even use it in my spare time.,
"Thank you, your perhaps the only organization giving free education and I say thank you.. people of all ages, races and economic areas can access an education. Look some may be stale but at least they are offering it to everyone. Thank you.",
Really great app. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn new things or just to be refreshed on certain stuff. Teaching style us easy to follow as well,
"Amazing! Really helped me with studies, concept explanations are easy to understand and the written explanations and exercises helps in quick understanding. Thank you for an amazing app",
The best app i ever came across.  This is very helpful.  A must to download . Great lectures . Good pace and easy to use . Loved it all over ...... A big thank you to the whole team of khan academy. You are doing a great job .,
"For me, one of the best learning apps out there.Easy to understand, free for all and a very noble idea from the creator of this app.",
"Well this is a good app to study,it video didn't make me sleep instead I can get the idea even the most ridiculous quantum mechanics. I loved it.",
"The app looks good, but bookmarking doesn't download text resources, and comments don't show despite being helpful for learning. Therefore, I often find myself having to use the website instead of this app.",
Thank you for providing this free learning opportunity from basic to advanced. It is useful to refresh past knowledge and also to start learning topics of different branches ranging from natural to social sciences. Let's check it out!,
"I'm speechless. I hardly recommend this app ,very helpful and takes everything step-by-step for a better understanding. I'd like to thank Mr Khan for making this state-of-the-art app and thank you to everyone that working at this educational organisation.",
This app really helped me understand our lessons better(especially in math and science).,
It was so annoying😠I accidentally click the wrong one and the I can't my answer,
I always learn math in khan academy on youtube. I never even new there was an app. I've never tried it yet but 5 stars for khan!,
Khan academy they provide free education and their mission is to provide free and world class education to everyone. Plz give your contribution​ in this mission.,
BEST APP EVER !!!,
Honestly this app was better cause u can any thing with free of cost,
Thank you Khan academy. This might help me realize a dream I have.really appreciate it.,
I'm in love with this app. It's super easy to use. I'm currently working on my GED and this app helps me re learn and practice certain lesson in an easy and simple way. So grateful THANK YOU KHAN 🙌🙏,
This is by far one of the best learning app and site that has ever been created. Thank you Mr. Khan.,
Absolutely amazing.But I feel that Khan academy needs to make more videos for JEE mains and advanced.,
I failed my Math GED test. Downloaded this App and passed the next week! Thank you Khan!,
This application is the most useful ever for a student . It is amazing that every bit of knowledge is free of cost,
It's called Khan academy. I don't know how people say it's boring? It's a learning app not a game for crying out loud!,
I loved this before but now its crashing after latest  update,
I loved this app first of all it does not require any log in and is so easy to use and as they say you've got almost everything to learn,
"""We can learn understand any thing by this app"" very helpful",
I think it's boring. It doesn't help me like I thought it would with my math!!!,
i love this apps so much. really useful and helpful for me. thank you so much our modern technology.,
"Clean and organized user interface, this app has helped me pursue my passion for science",
It's the best application till I have seen now.,
Helpful I've never learned so well so easily n effectively,
"Kahn is a great tutorial and, having the app, allows me to keep up while on the go",
Best app from my side to study and prepare for official SAT examination...loved it...keep it up guys,
"Superb!  Everything rearding Science,  Philosphy & Life is there in it described through videos",
Free education is what we need in world right now.,
Helpful in summer I now know half of the stuff in school and I get extra credit,
Inferior to ios version :(,
It helps me in my study.Thanks Khan Academy.  -Foundation Science student in Malaysia-,
Excellent just loved the app. Never expected to have so much stuff in one little app,
"This has helped a lot, even with the college work I'm doing.",
i want to do problems not watch videos,
my daughter told me that this app helped her to pass her basic electronics subject,
It is very good and generous donation feom khan to every students who cannot afford the most expensive books,
This is a very helpful app I can use it for homework,
Awesome but should add higher level like MSC type level courses,
Reviewing is a whole lot easier for me thanks to this app! Two thumbs up!! :D,
This app is usefull I think khan acadamy also add content about examination of sat cat,
"I think this is one of the best math apps I've ever used!! Im in love with the levels and math!! It's surprisingly easy and even fun!! And when I'm bored, I just grab my tablet and go on with it!! That's why I rate this 5!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

"Setting new bars for education, keep up the great work, Sal & team !",
"It would be great if I could practice SAT math using the app, but the SAT Math Practice area is just a list of videos, not the exercises that can be practiced on the website, although strangely other exercises can be accessed through search. Just not the math SAT prep. What a bummer, because Khan Academy is pretty useful on the website.",
"This app is great. You can learn anything from math to economics to the arts. But there's only one bad thing about it. Most of the time when I'm trying to download a subject, it stops right before it's done or at 2% and says it can't be downloaded. I love this app, and sal. Sal is cool 😎",
"I am currently working towards my GED so that I may join the navy, and have to retake my math test. The man doing the math videos is absolutely amazing. I have higher hopes of passing this time thanks to him. This isn't just some quick 5 star review with pretty words. This gentleman has earnes my respect and gratitude and deserves recognition beyond his work with this app. Thank you for helping someone to better understand and grasp concepts that have otherwise been unable to take root.",
"The app runs perfectly for me so far. I've been using it for a couple months now and in order to make the app perfect; I have a few suggestions.  First and most importantly- I think it would be cool if in the exercises where it shows videos to watch for that subject, it would provide a link to the prerequisites required to do that exercise.   Unlike the website version, I can't rate the videos or ask questions in the forum below. Most of the videos are fantastic, but there are some that I would like to ask questions on, or rate when I'm not able to use my computer.  It would be amazing to have a couple different videos on one subject(like math) incase we can't understand that specific way to do it.   The website version allows you to watch a video while attempting to solve a problem. This would be great in the app version for tablets.  Overall this app is really great! Thanks so much for providing it :)",
"Love khan academy, 3 stars because,  Need the app to play media in the background.. Where I sometimes just want to listen to the audio.. Like when exercising.. Desperately need that.  Please oblige.  P. S also need control over the quality of video",
"Nice lectures from lower class to higher class students, but for engineering a lot more subjects have to be added. But it's a great effort. make use of advertising in this site, as it was difficult to run this organization without profit....thank u all the team of Khan academy.....",
"I'd be a C student if it weren't for Khan Academy, highly recommended to anyone and everyone. You can learn anything.",
Videos make no sense. They do not tell what are going  to do and how we can do it easily. Videos are not so much good they make everything very difficult. Very bad app. But layout is good,
It doesn't feel like the website. Also it did not bring up the keyboard for a problem. I could not answer it.,
"It is really great for studying, for me it goes into more depth than what the teachers teach us. I highly recommend this app.",
"Under NCLEX RN I think the answers are not regestering correctly, I got 4 wrong that I believe are right under Hepatitis 1.  When I read the rationals they suggest my answers are right but they are marked wrong.",
Its the best I think it mostly helped me out rather than studying in school its really cool to know you have something to do at home and at school it kinda hard to focus because of the environment and people at home its quiet and because of this app I've been going through the roof with my study's 😊,
"I never write reviews for apps, but this app is absolutely fantastic. It has helped me so much in brushing up on math. It  is so easy to navigate and very thorough.",
Everythung work flawlessly but it will be nice to have the HUMANITIES AND GRAMMAR section in that app. I know that HUMANITIES AND GRAMMAR are in the khan academy website. Please add it in the app.,
An awesome app for students which also helps to prepare for exams and last but not the least helps us to analyze our score as well as providing sum badges which make it interesting😊....And the best thing it isn't commercial like Byjus or merit nation and so on....it absolutely free for which I salute them👍,
Just we could test skills once again.just if u could add NEET and CAT to in test preparation like IIT JEE.The app will become perfect,
It's a great source of help. I always use Khan Academy for helping me study for my Math exams and also tests.,
It's the best educational app I have found. The best part is it doesn't limit only till my current grade.,
"It's one of the best websites I've ever been told about, I can't afford college and this helps me explore new educational paths so I feel productive when I'm not working. I've always wanted something like this.",
"Thnx for such a wonderful app felling short of words and have mouth gaped with the quality, quantity and zero fost",
Loved this app .Totally satisfied.This app helps me to clear all my doubts related to topics. Very helpful . Thanks Khan academy.,
Oh god please let us resize the screen! I'm scrolling all over the place and it's often impossible to see all the options or even that there are options offscreen. This is really horrible design!,
Thank you khan acadmy. You just sweeped away fear of calculus from me. I'm very grateful to you 😇😇,
"Really great content. Lots of different subjects well-explained by good teachers. Also, I really like the transcript option.",
"I never really got to go to school. I am far behind, so when I became hungry for knowledge someone recomended this and it's amazing and never messes up. A blessing for people like me. Thank you to who ever made it.......",
I love how I can learn or relearn just about anything with Khan Academy for free. I like the badge and energy points system too! I'm going to be using this app all the time when school starts.,
"This is the most amazing learning experience I have ever had. DEFIANTLY recommend. And it'd not just for math. It's for kids 3 and up. So from simply adding to calculus, and biology, and physics",
Love khanacademy . It has helped me a lot . My grades have been better than ever . I am just in 6 class. But because of khanacademy I have improved and I am the new me,
"More content needed.  And  not just videos,  some of the work could just be solved,  like it is on the website.",
This app teaches you a lot about everything you need to know in school so you can be a head of all your fellow classmates in school. Amazing app I never seen anything like it.,
It stinks because its summer homework for me and in 5th next year i have to do it for 20 minutes every day.  for the year,
"It's just the best. The methodology to see,think and then learn is amazing. Hats off to the team. Please include more topics in a similar way in your videos.",
"Never found such app on play store. It gives you guidance on every doubt you will face in all of your study time. I wish i had money(i am a student) for the donations, as it totally runs on donations. This is one hell of an app.",
We use It All The Time! My son loves to use this app.  It explains things to him in a way that is easy for him to understand.,
"The overall app interface and the exercises and videos are easily accessible, though I wish Mastery Challenges were on the mobile app.",
Very helpful and the explanations are much better than many school teachers. Kids who call it boring are losers at school and in life in general.,
"I am using Khan Academy for several years, and it always helped me with my lessons! Thanks!",
Of course its great! Free education is the  best thing you can have. But please give those videos a resolution option 👌,
I am grateful for free resources that Sal has created. Thank you for thinking about others so that they can gain access to education at their fingertips.,
It can get a five star if i can save the videos on my sd card.,
Just want to say that if you can add the subtitle within the video not by side that would be great.,
This app makes you feel your world wide weird feeling,
I think it's a waste of my time It doesn't gi've a good example,
This is helpful with the videos but i dont know hout to do the exercies please.help me but it works 100% i love it,
I liken the app  But inspite of creating things yourself try to add animations,
"I love it. Beside I've been thinking of how to get something to keep me busy in my discipline, this is awesome.",
My son which is in 11th Class likes this app but now  class11 india option has disappeared  from the app plz check  it,
This is such an amazing and well  thought out app. It gives you all the information and training you need to exel in any subgect at any grade level. Children of all ages can benifet from this app free of charge!!!,
When you a open a finished exercise the app will stop working,
It's very helpful and free educational app. Thank you so much Khan academy,
"The best-best-best app. Thank you Mr.Salman khan, for promoting free education to millions in world & helping to change lives.",
"Excellent app! It's the first time in a long time that I've felt happy about making mistakes in learning and actually have a good laugh! Thank you very much, Khan Foundation! 👏👏👏",
"this is my second request from you to add c/c++ programming, Data structure, Degital logic design. Please add these topics. I shall be very thankful .....  please include COMPUTER SCIENCE TOPICS",
Actually you could do this instead of school it's awesome I like to program on here to and do computer skills,
This really does help you my childs teacher told me about it and my child has improved tremendously since then.🖒🖒🖒🖒,
Very good app. Someone who is greedy for knowledge then this app is best.,
Well the content is pretty good but in spite of having good internet connection the buffering time is pretty much High,
This is my favorite app/website. There isn't a single thing I would change.,
Alot of thanks to khan academy team learning has become more efficient and effective.,
"Awesome app...... Just one thing, it is having some issues signing in with google or facebook.... And please add some more assignments on each topic.",
Only one problem here is that they do not seprates the courses so that we can easily find  the subject topic we lost too much time on searching the topics of our classes but accept this i think m very luky for having such an app which make my life not only my but all those students who having a trouble and they have to face unstoppable blackmail in the name of study only to get some money ...... And you guys are very good and please keep it up world needed not wants..needed the person like you...all the best guys,
I think this app this very modern and easy to understand. Keep up the good work! Sharing is caring.,
Wow! This app is very helpful for learners like me.,
Love it! I love to learn and this app is great for all ages.,
Wish this was around when I was younger but better late than never. Kudos to you Khan!,
It dosnt tell you the % of any grades poorly made,
"It's a great learning app. Stop saying it's ""boring"". Also it isn't a game, it's to help learn. Smh",
"The best app for education, He does this hard work for no profit but for education.",
"AWESOME Just sometimes though, the video will end at 00:01 left and it won't count as finished",
Best educational app. But please add information like Wikipedia other than videos,
"Great for learning​, but the website is much better and has more  has more subjects.",
It's good but I can't read articles on the app,
"Only one word to describe it and I'm gonna spell it out for ya ""a-w-e-s-o-m-e""",
Mind blowing app. Teaches everything clearly and you can set the pace of teaching.,
a really good app. allows you to learn almost anything for free,
Keeps crashing everytime I go to polynomial page.,
"I love this app, it had help me with so much and still is",

Best that's it only best no more words just loved it,
Please add SD card support. Will make the app better.😀,
Great ...give some real world examples in engineering subjects,
Is there a way to lower the video quality? It's  kinda heavy for my connection. Thanks.,
Great app! Must download it.,

"You literally got rid of math sorted by grade. I need to study grade 7 math, but there's no category for that grade! Only grade 6! Please bring that back! I really need it soon!",
Its amaze,
It's,
Like it,
Humm,
Superrrrr,
"I am a 9th grade student learning algebra and I suck at it, but my teacher told me get on khan academy and since then I have been able to understand more things than I use to. Its a very good program and it helps kids who struggle in math or something else surpass that subject. Its a berry good investment to get your childern. Thanks it's a big help.",
"Overall it's great. I really appreciate Khan academy in general, but this app could use some work. There's no clear progression in any category. Sometimes you can just hit 'next' to move on, other times you find yourself hitting the back button repeatedly then trying to find where you left off. The Avatar and the energy points; I don't really get it. Also, I progressed for about two weeks, realised I wasn't logged in, subsequently logged in, and it erased all my progress. I love it. I hate it.",
"This was a very useful and educational app. If you are too challenged or not challenged enough, then you can go backwards or forwards easily. To those who called it boring, it is either because A. You thought it was a game and clearly did not read the description, or B. You have no interest in learning. Those of you who relate to B, I'll see you on the streets, or on your parents couch if you are really spoiled. Personally I am overjoyed at the fact that I can continue my studies throughout summer. In brief, thank you Khan Academy, I am most grateful.",
I'd love yo give 5 stars but the buffering kills it. I listen to the videos while at work and the videos done in the black screen have no issues playing but any other video buffers 3 or more times. I've been on 4glte and Wi-Fi and still have the same problem. If a video is 1:36 and it has to buffer 4 times it ruins the continuity.,
It is a wonderful app.I would give it infinite STARS if I could. I have learnt so much. Khan academy has always helped me. However I would have liked it even more if the app also had the feature to download VIDEOS and watch them offline.,
"I have been using Khan Academy long before anyone has ever heard of it, since I was a sophomore in high school (2013). Now I'm a sophomore in COLLEGE and I STILL find this app useful...somewhat. It is more useful for grades k-12, not college level. But as a Biology major, I still find myself coming back to this app from time to time for chemistry or bio. Still, an amazing app. It has so many different subjects, for so many grade levels. And the best part: it's free. My parents (as many other parents) couldn't afford tutoring, so this was what helped me in math and high school chemistry. Basically, it helped me a lot in my high school years.",
"I think the content and idea is great! But the apps lacked the profile page explanation and you almost cannot change anything in the profile. As someone using Khan Academy in the apps as the first time, It confused me with the submitting comment etc especially in the pixar storytelling class",
"We had to do this in 7 grade and it was horrible. I hated it. But, they have better 8 grade info than they do 7 grade.",
"Wonderful App. Lives up to it's word. Not like other apps that demand money to teach, although they claim to be free. Thank you Khan Academy for the noble work.",
I really love this app. I wish though you could have a online classroom where you could see who's in it in a better format. Perhaps have a scoreboard with a competitive sense to it.,
"I have been using this app from the 11th grade , it just amazing! I stopped going to tution because I had this app. I saved money and time Thank you so much♥️",
Am just speechless about these guys.  Very good quality teachers offering free education.  Its unbelievable,
Doesn't show the progress properly. And going directly back to home is missing and also couldn't find few courses which are found on website,
"I didin't liked this app because there's no programing course, as it has in the Khan website, although this  mistake, the app has good subjects and it is very interesting yet./ Não me agradou pela falta de cursos presentes no aplicativo web - o de progamação em javascript , por exemplo - fora o limite de funcionalidades ainda é interessante.",
I'm going back to school pre-med and upon realizing that I had not taken a math class in more than 8 years decided to download Khan and brush up on (and frankly improve) my math skills. Exceeded my expectations in every way.,
You can use it to almost learn anything. I tell everyone about Khan anytime they mention wanting to learn something or build themselves. I'm ery grateful khan academy exists.,
I can't type the answer for some reason the keyboard dosnt show up  But it's a great app I found it on my computer,
"It is the best free academy which includes earning points, having avatars, video lessons, challenges, practice quizes, shirt reviews and summaries, and it teaches all subjects",
"I know tons of people love videos but not everyone. The transcripts of the videos here are formatted like movie/interview transcripts and dont have any of the other media (I.e. pictures, diagrams) included. I know making videos is a lot of effort and there is a lot of content here, but it would need to be packaged into a better textual format for me to want to use it.",
Great app. Use as a refresher or just to learn some things. NOT A GAME.  6/7 Tried opening and app keeps force closing immediately. Started happening after update.,
"The quality of the downloaded videos is horrible, there could be options for better qualities such as 480p,720p and others, that's the only flaw for me.",
"Efficient for learning up to Bachelor level ,that i think  Best and free ...u have to try it once  to rate it 5 star",
It is a wonderful app helping students all around the world without asking for a single fee. This is too good to be true.,
People don't appreciate how expensive knowledge is. This app is amazing and I look forward to many hours spent using it.,
I like Khan Academy. I had used the site before but when I acquired a new phone I had forgotten to transfer Academy to it. With a new interest in learning something new my first thought was Khan Academy.  Thank you Khan Academy.,
People should stop saying it's boring. It helps alot. It's not a game bc it's suppose to help you a d it does. Everything is great about.,
A friend referred me to this app. I'm so glad I tried it. It's amazing so far. I was so clueless about certain things. I'm not an expert yet but I have a better understanding in some things now than I did before.,
It's awesome because I've learned a lot about what my school teaches me.,
"This app is good but needs improvement, the website contains more lessons and subjects to which I can't access from this app, like computer programming, hour of code etc. But I can't access these lessons from the app, plz update this app. Thank you",
"Really useful and helpful when learning, I love that even the topics that are more complex are explained in a very easy way",
"I feel like there should be a home screen apart from the explore screen where you can find all of the subjects that you've actually been working on and/or have shown interest in, because I can't find a lot a my subjects and projects and it's kinda frustrating",
Khan Academy makes Math friendly for students from foe. Thank you very much Sal. Your times and all the efforts you give to educate  and make education accessible to everyone is beyond compare. You deserve all the good credit. Please never walk away from Khan Academy.,
"This is one of the best educational app I have ever used. Just one suggestion though: please try to add transcript with full screen mode, so that we can see the subtitles with the video while in full screen mode.",
"Very educational it has taught me HTML,JS,and CSS a ton about bio and chem an im currently expandinh my knowledge in physics and im just 12! Khan academy is a great resource and i would recommend it to anyone",
"The best app ever. Helpful lessons on various topics, reliable content, great teacher. Thank you",
Please divide science acc. To Indian curriculum also like maths,
"Its aweaome ,plus i loved it and this app solves all the problem related to tuitions or extra classes . Its very helpful. Thanxx for making this app.",
"We need apps like this in other field tooo!!! Adding up physical education, or making the whole app to have a social network kinda provision; with features like chatting with fellow passionate frnds or chatting in a study grp with stranger that are having th3 same subjects and most importantly have a chat with educators.  I don't want the replis from the educators to be instant; but atleast have replies within a week",
It's the best app to learn and I'm weak in maths this app improved me awesome app I just love it,
"Hey there, Hi While watching videos, there is a lot of buffering and the video is also not visible clearly despite of having a good internet connection. Please fix this.",
One of best educational app I have ever seen thanks a lot to whole team   of Khan's academy for this great app,
Its kind of like your teacher in the subject you choose or the little helper. This app helps me in math the most so I highly reccomend it of you struggle in math.,
"I love all of it, i just wish it could allow you to take the tests and quizzes like the website allows you to for the SAT practice",
My sorority sister told me to try this to prepare for economics. She was 1110% right. I love love the teachers and this app.,
"I love the app, especially since I'm home schooled, tbh my parents are getting suspicious that I'm saying up till 2 studying from your website  And to all the 1 star reviews who say it is ""boring"" if you download an app completely aimed for education don't expect it to be the most fun, especially if your in a public school anyways",
This app is a legend for those students who want to study but waste much of their time in searching videos in internet . I can bet that this app will become most downloaded app in play store,
"It's a great app with great explanations, thanks everyone who has worked hard for making Khan academy amazing.",
Perfect educational app ranging from basic to advanced studies. Best wishes to those who created and took part in this learning app,
"Instead of books and teachers teaching in class thy should project this in class with permission of of this academy by paying. For it student subscription """,
There is no perfect. Animation and the content spoked in the lecture is to fast to understand,
This app when I open it crashes down and it does it often I have exams and am unable to use this app,
Loved this app so much. Thanx Sal sir for providing these. Please make it as per IIT JEE COURSE. PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY ARE MISSING FOR IIT. IN INDIA PLEASE MAKE A SEPARATE OPTION FOR IIT JEE.  FIRST 11 CLASS SYLLABUS AND THEN CLASS 12. QUESTION SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN SPECIALLY AS PER IIT PAPER.  YOU COULD DO THIS GETTING A GOOD RANK WILL BE EASY FOR US.   ONCE AGAIN THANKS  HARE KRISHNA   YOURS SINCERELY  SIDDHANT BHARDWAJ,
Love this app. There mission to provide free education to all students is great. Well done. 👌,
Helped me so much in math for 6th grade! Definitely more then 5 stars and an app i will for sure donate to!,
"In the past this app has worked well, but now there is a problem, every time I try to do a math exercise it just tells me (could not load exercise, try again). I have updated, restarted, and nothing works. Please help!     Thank you!!  Abby.",
The app is quiet good well you have lectures that build up you concept pretty well.,
Hey really? How is this app perfect?!! When i signed in unlike byju's it did'nt ask in what standard i am studying and also the vedios are also not too good no tests nothing why the hell is it rated 4.6,
Indian math classes not accessible on the app! Please fix it!,
This is an amazing app. I suggest it to download.  They explain it soo perfectly.,
It has learned me a very much. It is a very educational app,
"Why are people saying it's boring? it's meant for learning, what did you expect? a game? Don't be immature and give it a unfair rating. I thought it was very useful.",
Excellent app. I never seen in my past life .. it's totally free...,
My only regret is that there are a finite number of categories..,
All the learning apps should learn from this app. Knowledge is to Share Not to Sell.,
Content is good but not able to download any video offline,
Perfect app i love it and it helps m e evrytime i want to study something new! 😍,
Still can't input answers to math problems. Stick to desktop site.,
"Easy to navigate, best educational app ever, keep it up and thanks.",
It covers all subjects and explains them deeply .I loved it.,
"Awesome. But no links for grammar in the app, which is otherwise there in the web versio.",
I think it's very well and it also helps me with my starr,

I downloaded Khan academy and I opened the app and I gone to math part it is coming for 1 St grade .  I don't know what should I do for turning it to 8th,
Sal is just amazing in explaining concepts. He makes you understand the intuition​ behind things. Thank you so much for such a great content.,
One of the best learning apps available on play store. Can you please add sound chapter over there. It would be very helpful.,
Awesome.  Better than my teacher I can now learn about quantum physics in class 9 and the best part is.... Its free,
Khan Academy has taught me more than I ever thought possible. Definitely much more than I could've learnt from the classroom. Thank you.,
Khan Academy is legit a hidden gem that more people need to be aware of. It's basically ABC Mouse for adults. It's a great tool for children in middle school and up as well. That being said I prefer the website to the app. The app lacks the interactive quizzes. Great for on the go however.,
Good app it has helped me in maths which I like most.I have a problem in logarithm this app helped me much to understand about it.This the best app,
"It's very much helpful for begginers of any subject.  Specially,  when you have no idea about that subject. It helped me a lot in my university life 💜",
It's an excellent app that I plan to use as I continue my educational career. It would benefit many to add practice questions with every lesson on the SAT practice similar to that on the website. Other than that it would be a 5/5,
Best learning app I've seen. Please add more tech coding engineering investment lessons and in demand skills.,
Khan Academy is the best - they explained things much better than my $300 textbook + professor. They don't have all the subjects in this app though.,
6 stars and a solution to our education crisis ..would love to work with these guys as a teacher and doctor,
"Great, but I prefer the online version. I was not able to do my missions or see my progress. Looking forward for future updates!",
This is the best ever application for free learning. I thank all the one for this efforts. Hope you add more and get more,
Overall it's good. However this app will be better if computer programming subjects exist in mobile version.,
"This is an amazing all for everyone, of all ages. I appreciate Sal Khan for making study so beautiful,interesting and exciting.",
The courses are well simplified. Khan academy has helped me a lot in MCAT prep. Awesome app,
"Been watching Sal on YouTube for years. it's great to see what the academy has become, great for all ages! Hopefully, existing and upcoming learning resources will remain FREE!",
Khanacademy made me realised that I had missed a lot of basic knowledge.. I'm on the way of making recovery.,
"The explanations make complete sense, the material covered is just what I need!",
THANK YOU so much that how you clearly tech us the chapter without any lroblem and you had gave us the extra questions also.... So thank you once again. Khan sir if you had read this message plzz like this message so i can come to know that you have read this message. 😀😀,
Great app. Sal khan is doing a great job by truly providing the world free first class education.,
Generated interest in lots of diverse topics i never thought i would even try to learn.Sal khan is best teacher.,
Downlaoding bookmarking problem .. The server is very unstable please optimize downloading,
"It's classic one initiative..  One thing which I want to mention is ,"" Can you please add the analysis of Indian history!! You have added the history of Americans.. Now can you please add analysis about the Indian history """,
"The best app I have ever seen,, but dear developers, there is little more need to this app,, please localize it in Urdu language",
"I'm home schooled, and this app has taught me in a way that nothing else has. I love that there are videos to follow and understand, this app is the best thing I've ever seen!!!!",

Superbb....,
Awosme,
"Best free education app, period. One suggestion for the app though - It would be nice if you guys could add a feature in the settings to control the video quality like  360p, 480p or 720p, because in the app the videos always play with the highest quality and when the internet speed is slow, the video buffers a lot and that interferes with the flow of learning stuff.",
"Thank you so much..   I think You r not less than lord. I mean it is not easy task to teach young generation without charging any money.   You are the best.   God Bless You.   I wish from the bottom of my Heart that You will Become One of Most Successful And Kind Person of This World.  I will make You sure That I will get Good marks in Physics, chemistry, as well as maths in My Boards Examination.     - Harsh Kesarwani   Student Of Vashisth Vatsalya Public School Allahabad,  India.          Thanks A lot.   God bless You.   Love You. ",
"Good app, dissapointing it doesn't support the mastery challenges etc so I have to use the less than ideal mobile web browser. Seems strange, seeing a i mostly want the app for revising on the move, not for learning new things (I would do that on the laptop at home!)",
I have no world to describe your kindness.. i'll surely donate your non porfit organization & contribute small amount to full filling your dream to give the world free world class education.. You are my idol salman sir & always inspire me to do great & kind work.. Thank u you very much sir for the person you are.. also thanks to whole khan academy members to make this big imagination to change in learning style to reality..,
Best app as it teaches in an intuitive way with concepts explained​ deeply and providing such facility without any cost is just amazing. It's very helpful for students like us and I appreciate the khan academy teams work. Hats off👏👏,
"I don't believe people come here     thinking this is a game and call it boring. This is one of the greatest apps out there and has helped people who failed maths passing to the next grade and also people who don't have access to this subject understand at least something. Thank you, Sal, for everything.",
I wish I could donate for you but there is  no credit card to do that.and you provide me with the best help for my exams❤,
"A wonderful app, very well thought through and considerate. Helped me get distinctions in tests and helped me understand the work much better.",
Best app ever thank god I found this. I thought it would be like other ones but it is very intertaining and teaches you many stuff.,
*I would give this 5 Star*   I would definitely give this five star cos everything is almost perfect thought i find wanna annoy u if u r already working on this but i just want to know why there isn't English/Literacy cos im having to use ixl for English/literacy the for reading this it means a lot to me 😘😍❤,
"The application is much worse than the awesome website, which beautifully supports mobile phones too. Does not include Mastery Skill Challenge.  So, instead of using this app, you're better off using the website on your phone.",
"Although it can help you but if you can't figure out how to do something gonna it and the video doesn't help, your screwed. Also, it is VERY BORING",
I didn't  know they made apps like these anymore.  This one is the best if it's kind.  Truly impressive,
"This the best best best app in the world i think to learn easily without any hindrance  Adds free ,lovely interface, and easy to use ,its a best app for the new generation education",
"Worst learning app, if you use you are wasting your costly data. Everything is just random nothing seems organised, so it won't help you in any way.",
Thanks guys 👍 free education is pretty rare these days...  God bless the developers and all the supporters,
It seems pretty well made and has a wide array of subjects to choose from. The only issue I have is I can't seem to open any of the articles in any of the subjects - the videos work fine it's just the articles....Please help,
Amazing app and if they add more to it and improve on videos where we can control then otherwise this app is amazing and adding a few extra features like creative ones🌟👍♥,
"I think this is the great app for everyone . One most amazing this about this app is it is free of cost ,making it very easily accessble for poor one. I love this app . It is like heaven.",
"It's weird. Just another way of showing you tube videos. Also, you only get to see part of the ""tutorial"" the first 2 minutes. How can you see the rest? OK, so I know its free, but even so it's very hard to use and a bit pointless.",
Most of the contents available in webpage is not available on April .. also incurred problems taking tests And reading notes...but A great work,
Awesome app.Thank you so much for helping students all over the world.Thanks for adding indian ncert syllabus.Salman khan of khan academy is great than actor salman khan😀,
"Great app but it lacks the feature to change video quality. I wanted to roll in beta but it's full, heartbreaking 😢",
"All is good and excellent. But, I am unable to access the Grammar section in the app. Please help.",
i love it. i learn trig and other things that my classmates don't know. Makes me feel aware of the world.,
Thanks to the developer for providing free videos. There are lot of people in this world who can't afford to get good education but through this app they can easily learn and understand whatever they want. Thanks Sal Khan.,
Recently started a job where physics and maths is important and this app is fantastic for refreshing some of the knowledge I've forgotten over the years.,
It is  really good to  learn more about math. if you want your child to learn math go to khan Khan Academy contact how many Khan Academy .,
Brilliant app really enjoying and grasping many new concepts ...A great contribution towards learning...But having some problem in downloading videos from app ..plz resolve it .,
"Great app. I just wish it were possible to change the due date on recommendations without having to delete and reassign. Deleting and reassigning causes students to lose their progress. It would be great to allow for date extensions by having a ""change-the-due-date feature"". Hopefully you guys can look into it soon. Thanks!",
"I just love this app and the community who build this app... You are so important for the future world, keep doing good work.",
"This is the best app I have come across.It explains everything very well, and I like the little test at the end of every lesson. Well done .",
The best learning app I used ever. Its almost free with quick analysis of what we studied. Also there are many subjects and contents to learn. The videos available are best and easy to understand and mainly it contains Indian syllabus required by me also has videos and practices for IIT-JEE..👌👌👍,
It's an innovation in learning in the age of information technology. So anyone can learn from here doesn't matter which country he/she belongs to.,
The only problem is that when you bookmark and download playlists the video and sound quality is low.,
Its awesome . I choose 3 for u to read my comment . Can fix the part relating for the not loading part.  All articles are not loading . I need them for my SAT at May 6 . Plzzzzzz its urgent,
Thanks to all of the teachers who made such a wonderful app. There is a need of such a wonderful app for us students. It is very appreciable to remain the app free of any cost. Really really thank you Teachers.,
It helped me to prepare for GRE Quantitative section. Good thing is it have very basic tutoring videos and very ellaborative and explaining lessons. But due to she speaker and background you may get bored.,
"Explains well, covers everything I wanted to learn. I like the quizzes at the end of each chapter. This almost feels too good to be true haha",
Making the a better place. This app has made things easier for me and my kids.,
Great app but taking videos offline is a headache. Would be really happy if fixed! It's buggy and refuses to download. Same with the bookmarking.. if I uninstall the app my book marks are deleted please fix.,
"Very very usefull and ITS FOR FREE!!! Really useful for people like us who are in school, except one more feature, like bookmarking for future viewing would be great! Thanks a lot for this app!",
Khan academy is amazing.  Way better than the math foundations course I spent 300$ on at Kaplan.,
It's good but I suggest if you can divide the course according to class 10 and all. Also plz... Add subjects such as English sst and hindi,
"Keeps crashing for I-don't-know-what reason. Really, love Khan Academy​, but this app has suddenly turned kind of extremely sick.",
Great when it worked.  Latest patch makes it crash every time on startup.,
I feel I'm really learning now with u. Thank you so much for making me to think and learn.,
"Does not contain all the concepts in physics,chemistry and math.I wish to cover all the concepts at last thankful for the selfless service.",
My teacher is so upsesed wth this so much that we have to do 150 min. Of it each night! I hate it!,
"Useful, it is great, everytime I have a test the next day I study using this app, not once have I gotten a failing grade",
"When I didn't take my free high school education too seriously, this free education made up for it.",
I love this app.  My go to guide for all my problems.,
"Khan academy is fantastic,  it's a great opportunity to learn many things , thank you guys... thanks a lot.",
If you add log in by google in the app it's would be better because I just have a google account and I have homework on it too,
App is great but if I could make one suggestion it would be to implement languages..then it will be complete,
Best free education app. The best part is they don't call for buying course,
It's the best and the happiest learning. Institution to a student it's very good for me it is the best app with free studying is given to a student,
I cannot do the Mastery Challenges in the app :(,
"I would like for Khan Academy to have a section based on Pert test practice, it would help a lot if they also made videos that actually helped solve the problem at hand and not change completely to another problem on the videos that are recommended for the question",
Best educational platform for all and best part it doesnt charge you for anything and so is available to all.,
I wasn't able to use it. It crashes when I try to play videos.,
This is the best educational app I've come across to. Very very VERY worth it. I would give more than 5 stars if I could!,
An amazing app this app helped me through 6th grade while I was struggling with school because of medical trouble. Thank you to all involved😊,
"Simple as that. Its a free tool to learn virtually anything you want. I have one request... would it be possible to make this compatible to Google Chromecast so I can stream it easily on my TV? All in all, don't pass this app up. If you want to learn, highly recommend this one.",
Increase the sound of all videos.It didn't hear.except this all is good,
Great app! It works well and helps a lot. The only problem is that the exercises and articles are not working. Fix this and I'll give it 5 stars. Edit: The problem's fixed! Thank you!,
Omg te founder of this program probably deserves a place in heaven. Helped me a lot in academic studies.,
God bless you guys. I don't even know what to say. To offer opportunities like this for nil? Y'all are bloody fantastic. Thank you for saving students in crisis such as myself.,
"This is boring, the app is squished together and not well thought of, as well as useless",
This is best thing what you have done to take information sharing to next level.Love It,

"For those  that want to say the app or  Sal Kahn is boring, perhaps you should try learning outside of a school establishment and if you're willing to learn a subject rather than being forced to. Learning in beautiful when you're willing and ready to take on a subject and Sal does a wonderful job of giving this education out for free.  I can say, without a doubt, this has given me a new taken on education.",
"Thank you so much khan academy for clearing my doubts and introducing me to new concepts. The Explore section is wonderful. Khan academy has made studies as an infotainment for me because I live in India and studies here is hectic. I love the way professors at the khan academy teach. They explain us as if it's not a big deal , the way they explain relieves my tension and broadens my knowledge towards a particular topic as they give me ample of examples. Thank you once again. ☺",
"America's education system is ridiculous. While the majority of our society are only concerned with social media and maintaining the dumbed down status quo, it is refreshing to find apks like this that enrich and engage higher learning for free. These types of developers should be praised in times like these. Keep up the great work.  Thank you",
"Mr Salman Khan, THANK YOU. You are doing such a noble job. It costs nothing and that doesn't mean that we're compromising with the quality. You are providing high quality stuff and I don't have enough words to express my gratitude. I cannot express how much you've helped me. Thanks again",
I have been using the website for a long time and have learnt several new things. Sal Khan and the other tutors have are the epitome of excellence in their enchanting and fashionable teaching methodology. The app is equally useful with an simple yet attractive user interface. Thank you so much Khan Academy!,
"Since I've been outta school I've been looking for a way to keep myself educated. This app provides what I need. Khan academy allows me to revise what I learned in school, and even learn what I missed or have forgotten. I would most definitely recommend this app to students, or individuals like myself who just want to keep their brains active.",
"I love using Khan Acadamy!: I use Khan Academy to refresh myself on some lost or faded subjects and even have a peek at what im going to learn. The instructions are clear, consice, and easy to understand, because if i cant be confused by logarithms, than thats saying something.",
Great educational app Best overall education app available in world. It is very useful for all kinds students. And the best thing is that it is free of cost.,
"the best app, the best website!! khan academy has been so useful, so important to me, since it's my main form of studying (and I don't feel like it's missing anything for that). I am brazilian and public education here is simply a doomed system, in which I can not learn what I need to learn and would never have it as interestingly and as complete as in this platform. It has so many content!!! About so much!! I almost get pretty damn emotional when I think about how much and how... easily?! this has helped me so far. For any misspellings and wrong sentences, my apologies!! For this app, my gratitude.",
"It's the best online learning portal and I mean it when I say it. For all those folks out there who thinks maths is difficult, let  me tell you, if u have this app in your mobile, you are going to love maths.",
"This app is perfect. It's great for those who wish to learn something new or help improve their knowledge.  The only thing I wish that could be included is computer science like CIS, networking, etc. Other than that, I love it.",
"It's awesome, explanation is really good and easy to understand, even the most difficult concepts can be learnt and understood easily. I loved it",
It's a great app for students . In a country like India where education is so expensive such useful apps do work much easier for those who want to home study . And special thanks for these new topics which include indian syllabus,
"Hi there. Excellent app but my suggestion is that you add a feature to download a video for offline usage. Overall, this app deserves the 5 stars. Many thanks.",
this is a great study guide because of this app i can go directly into my major instead of taking pre reqs for math thank you 😊,
"Khan Academy has drove me further on the road of math, science, and history and took me to its world.",
"Well written.  Timely progression. Makes learning interesting by connecting previous lessons to other subjects.  Teaches, not just learns, to think about thinking.",
It is great for using to catch up or get a better understanding of the material you learn in school from k-12 grade.,
It is a very helpful app for an adult learner  relearning English Literature in order to obtain their high school diploma. Thank you!,
"Khan Academy is helping me re-learn some of the things I didn't understand in school, but at my own pace.",
First time my interest in physics enhanced. But actually you should promote it through different​ social networking therefore more and more people will know about it and enjoy your videos,
Khan Academy is really awesome I totally recommend it. I learned a lot about geometry and the best thing is that you download the lessons so when you don't have Wifi you can still be learning. I'm in 4th grade and my big sis says that im learning stuff about High School!!!,
"I've been using this app for about a year now and I can tell you I've learned so much. It's so informative and yet so easy to understand because they're so good at explaining. If you hunger for information as I do, you've found the jackpot!",
Thanks a lot for providing free access for everyone to learn a lot of things. Thank you Salman Sal Khan and everyone who contributed in the creation of the app and website. I really really do appreciate your efforts and goodwill.,
"Asome app. So many children here calling it boring. They should be grateful. Not everyone has the means to go to school, or to learn.",
I really appreciate you sir Salman Khan for your work for a new tomorrow. Sir please include JEE in the app. There are bright students in India who does not Get Enough entrance coaching because of poverty.,
Best school ever honestly I've been to regular schools and it has stressed me out but here I feel happier ^^,
It has helped not just my kids but I can use the app too.,
I love this app I am in fifth grade and kahn academy has helped me so much me and my friend just love it. It has almost anything and everything you can possibly want to learn.,
"Missions aren't available, and there are a ton of bugs/errors. For example, I tried typing in 24 as part of my answer and it wouldn't show up",
Actually I search for the best learning app I found the byjus app I found this app very impressive they want to be type a code for verification but  they didn't send The khan academy required only  my email address that's  it  there are some reason why can't every one can give personal information like number so it is necessary to give a sign in option love the khan academy aap,
"This is the first thing, I downloaded after getting a phone. This app is awesome and I love it.",
It is great app and It is free to use. Education is such a prevlage that people take for granted. The next chance I have I am going to donate towards this nonprofit. Thank you to the people who put this tool into action.,
Amazing. Just amazing. I was able to study physics 1 at the highest level over the summer and get a straight 100 in an AP class. Thank you so much for this app.,
"Its hard to use. Its harder to get to where I'm supposed to be than on the computer. But I still love the app and the website, they're extremely helpful. Be grateful, not everyone had this ability.",
Thankyou khan academy for clearing my doubts. I really love the way of explanation !!!,
Thank you very much for your work and deeds. You are helping more than i could admit.,
This app is great at teaching me new higher level skills that will enable me to succeed in school.,
Don't know why but I can't find statistics and probability in the app,
Evolutionists they teach the wrong things also half the time its wrong also most the time its down because of some error and or being maintained,
"I believe this app is gonna change many people's life, including mine.",
Educating for free is a very good work and this app reflects the same.  Thanks a ton Khan team,
Excellent app ever!!! Thank you so much khan academy for creating such an interesting app... 👌👌👌 It clears all my doubts ..,
One of the most useful app my hope is stayed free and continue helping people in need.,

I would give 5 star rating if this can support split screen for SAMSUNG.,
"Great app, would be nice to see SD card support.",
Best educational app ever!! No other app can beat it..... best thing 'bout it is it's absolutely free!!,
"God bless this company! Love you guys! Don't know how people can rate this 1,2,3,4 starts.",
"Much better than any class at school. Very informative, interesting, and well made.",
A modification for 2g & 3g speeds the reduced speeds for videos on phones already out of  fast internet.,
It's so educational and you can code on it I love thissss,
"Amazing span of lectures. Replaces my iTunesU. Funny how I hear Sal's voice every week, every semester, no matter the class, lol. Thank you, KA!",

Mad people are calling this app boring. Leave studies no if you find study boring.  This app has actually helped me in my AS and i don't take tuitions because Khan Academy is everything. Thank you Sal Khan! The downloads are a bit buggy though.,
It'd be perfect adding subtitles in another languages as to help more people understand the world all around them and enlighten their minds :),
A great app   I really like this project in all its aspects but I am having a problem with downloading the content for some reason I don't seem to understand . It always stop downloading and take forever even though it is a small files. And it is making me furious  please fix that guys,
"The host teacher on the early stages of mathematics does not understand that when he says three hundred ""and"" ninety-four that translates to 300.94. Please use correct syntax when you are pronouncing numbers because this affects us all.",
"Best thing to happen for education and those trying to learn. So useful and 
fantastic. The only way I have been able to be successful with learning 
math. Only reason I was able to graduate college. I'm so thankful for Khan 
academy.",
Excellent app to help my kids advance their knowledge on subjects in school. It helps me as well triggering my memory on certain subjects long forgotten.,
The website is fantastic. The iPad app is ok. But the Android app sucks. Won't load most content for some reason and just gives an error,
"Please add more content for class 12th, especially in Chemistry and tests on IIT and other subjects. It would be a great help. :-)",
This app is  integral part of learning. It is very useful for those who are unable to pay huge fees to coaching shops.,
It is the best educational resource on the Internet .I would easily recommend it to anyone .It has all the topics you want . The only thing that is better than this is attending live classes . It is too good.,
Just awesome  Good for serious learners Everything for free You can also watch videos offline.  12 min video 1 mb.  😀😀😀,
"How to change the location of saving offline videos.. Why no more videos save offline.. Why it always says ""couldn't download this video."" or document... Khan academy is the best website but this app is worst.  junk",
Best education experience but sometimes the videos load slowly.But still very grateful to Khan Academy for all your hard work,
One of the greatest apps designed ever..Thanks entire team involved in this.. I would be happier to share feedback/improvements in the contents to cater many communities,
Great app. Sadly the kast month or two only videos work. Anything else states its unavailable and hasnt changed. Sucks cause i love this app and use it all the time,
As much as I love the website the strongest weakness of this app is that I cannot save any of the modules or files to my SD card.,
"The app and site both are very very good. Please just create a division of grade 11 in science also. There's a treasure of knowledge inside. This app is great, I left my coaching classes and joined in here. Thank you all who are behind this app l, whatever you all have developed is just awesome.",
"I was hoping for an app that links seamlessly with the website but was let down. On the website I am doing highschool math but this is not available within the app, only the individual modules. Also progress on the website doesn't seem carried to the app properly.",
"Great app, but there are two major issues that need to be addressed:  1. After completing a whole set of exercises, the app crashes, 2. Tapping the notification about downloading forces the abovementioned process to stop.",
I love Khan Academy . But I also want Science NCERT tutorial . Please include this feature ASAP THANKS,
"This app dosn't only help me, with my homework ot explains and It makes me one step ahead in class. Thank you so much",
"The content of Khan Academy is amazing, right from the atom to a fully functional living being. Loved the chemistry, biology and human medicine section. I owe much of my knowledge to you! Thanks a ton.",
Allah's Blessings  All the supplication and hope for your kind heart ، intention ، intuition and efforts Mr. Salman Khan ، you did great for humanity which counts most and of course for yourself in the hereafter ، the whole world and next generation will appreciate your work ، I couldn't help but to honestly show my gratitude to you first ، and now I can say this is so far the greatest and most humanity dedicated app ever ، ego free and wholehearted ، so thank you Sir ، I'd surely recommend .,
This is such a nice app and I think it's pakistani and helps me get good marks thanks for mankind such a useful free app,
"helpful and educational, I love it, though I wish I could do practice problems like on the website",
You guys have taught me so much!  Thank you Khan Academy! Hope you stay best forever. May god bless you!  😍,
Extremely informational and easy to use. Great resource for learning a new subject as well as brushing up on old topics.,
"I have my NEET exams this May,Biology Crash Course in it really helps,no need to revise,means you can see the video and start to practice multiple choice questions",
Love Khan Academy. I am currently using the SAT prep as my GED prep very similar information.,
"I am speechless..what really made me like this app is the sole purpose why it was started - ""to make  people understand concepts better for free"" luv u guys 4 the hardship and pain u had to undergo to make this a reality.",
I was hoping it was like the website where you could so problems but its still helpful,
Few things to be updated like a comment section for the videos and doubt corner for a topic well juzz a suggestion,
"Great app,the best thing is you can do it online on your laptop.",
If ya tryna get sum extra knowledge stop wasting ur time and get this app its ridiculous,
Not useful for deaf learners. Needs captions on videos.,
Khan academy taught me SOO MANY things that I never knew!! They teach it slowly and also make sure that our know it before you move on!! They even give you test!! And you can learn at your own pace!!,
Have been waiting for the mobile version of Khan Academy for a while. Finally it is here! I can do the assignments and watch the videos all in one nifty app. Amazing!!!,

Really helped me out to clear my doubts and to build concepts. Plays a big role in improving my grades in exams. Great app. Loved it. It's amazing.,
This is very helpful.It helped in my exam.I totally depend on it and the lecture  who is conducting these is very clearly conducting and Aldo I hope others will take some use of this,
"Content is great not the app, i would rather play khan videos on youtube, as i have the option to choose the quality of video. With this app, HD is the default, we don't have that great internet and data plan to watch HD, so it would be great you could add quality option in videos(240p,360p,480p)",
I like that khan academy has lots of content but they don't cover all the things that I learn in math 10-C,
Plzzzz change that voice of the history teacher I don't know why you have appointed him. He sounds too slow in a sleepy way,
Good app. But plz provide an option for offline reading of articles. We can watch offline video after downloading it. I am looking for same with text articles.,
"Great resource as it is intended to be. Ignore the small children with bad grammar that claim it is ""boring"".",
"One thing I really liked is the use of a black background in the videos, so this would reduce strain on our eyes.",
I love this app. I hope i could love the windows version too...  Please fix thw windows version thanks :),
I think we should be able to save exercises (and probably  other sections) on device and study every course in this app namely Programming courses.,
"It's a very good app for studying. Thx you. And for all the people who said this is boring, don't blame them. They are superior human beings who are immune to logic and understanding.",
"It's amazing, it's way above any other learning app out there and is brilliant for anyone of any age that wants to learn",
"Overall,it's a pretty amazing package. But I hope that the developers can implement the option of storing videos on the external SD card in the next update",
It's really good app enjoyed using it.it has every thing I need,
It's ok but I prefer the computer version much better. In this app it won't let me work on my mission. Or maybe it can and I do not know how? Please reply and tell me how I can work on my mission. Thanks!🤔,
Khan sir its very good app or can say its of its own type ... for graduate student  but i deemand for P.G material in physics ....and research .ican say alegend work in educational field of bthis centuray.,
I'm trying to save video offline but it is not downloading.,
"Spanish translation is hilarious because it's not proper, it glitches somewhat. Other then that for what I'm currently exercising on is kinda alright. Though do hope for improvements.",
"Great app, Khan academy is great, but Nowadays the app closes just after it is opened . There is a bug in this app. Khan academy please fix it",
"The best teacher I ever learned from, in my life very good lectures and the best thing is that they teach intuitively",
"Awesome app! This is the best educational app I've ever used. It does exactly what it says. I became fascinated the moment I used it for the first time. Seriously! I'm not exaggerating. After using it for the past two weeks, I'm fully satisfied now, and that's why I thought this was the right time to rate it. Thank you Khan Academy!",
"I share Khan Academy with many people. There are so many interesting topics and presentations to learn from.   A great way to fill ""Down Time"", or to ""learn something new every day"" ....",
"It is so amazing and important to have an online college, teaching people for free. Thank for the person who made it and i appreciate it",
Glad to see transcript for vedeos as we don't follow accent in vedeos. The best app for free .,
It's like an important thing to have in students' phone.,
Best thing anybody has done for the world in self education thank you I love you,
"Extremely resourceful, ignore the retards here calling it boring. You want to study ? Then this is an invaluable tool for you.",
"This app makes learning all the more fun but there is a problem with the videos they take hours, literally hours to load and that isn't helpful at all. Fix it. Please!",
"The content can be updated though. Other than that, the best free learning app this is.",
I think that I love your app and I want you to keep it free I love you for what you have done and keep it up for all the people out there like me who can't afford to pay for courses like this thank a million times bye,
"A fantastic site for learning. A wealth of categories and topics, and it's free!",
The best educational app ever downloaded Don't listen to others who talk non sense about this app,
Very helpful! It's like having a personal tutor in your pocket,
Videos are not much effective.,

"If science would set according to Indian curriculum ,it would be 5 stars",

"Sal is a great explainer, he derives every formula and show the logical way to understand each formula. He isn't a kind of teacher who just simply gives you a quick way without tells you the first principle. He is always very helpful, especially in math. In the perfect world, there would be a good teacher and a good student. In reality, simply said, everyone who said he was boring are not a good students.",
"What a remarkable resource! I completed my formal education many many years ago (Ph.D.) and lots of wonderful things have been learned since then. This app has helped me catch up, look at things in a different way, and study things I didn't have time for as a student or worker. Love it and recommend it highly.",
"Its it actually what we tell fun studying.... When I first saw the app I was just thinking that it would not be educational or we will not be able to understand the concepts but...now under the great man supervision I got a very merry opportunity to understand an learn or recall the past the present and even the future ... I think the dumbs or the people who never liked to study thought it to be boring.. I myself is a science lover and with a great gratitude I would express my clear views on the same , as it is my favorite subject I never expected such an extra ordinary spectacle as no one even in my school or tuition explained me so nicely that the concept was not only cleared but also learnt very well only in one sight which is in my views a result of well and good explanation... I loved it but at last the only  thing that was missing in it was English grammar which is a very important subject to the youth so I will very dearly ask to keep English also ... And the last question of mine is that even if I try I cannot ask the points which was not clear .. All points were clearly mentioned but the points in which I had doubt I cannot ask ..... So I request the subject English and clearance of doubt to be done..............THANKS AND LOVED THE WAY OF EXPRESSION ...,☺",
"Khan Academy is an incredible learning resource! Their motto that anyone can learn anything is quite true. It may sound as if I am exaggerating, but I mean this...This changed my life. I never had confidence in learning before, and thought I was not smart. I am now pursuing a calling that I never knew I could answer. With this app my whole family can learn and grow...And love doing so! This is for everyone.",
I truly appreciate the efforts of the developer to make an app which can  really be useful for the students.  You can get all the information on each and every topic in maths or science. Your videos on YouTube are simply awesome and I wish that you suceed in achieving whatever aim you have set to achieve in the future.,
"First i underestimated this app. However this is the best application that you can learn about almost anything. Videos in almost every topic is very easy to follow and understand. On top of that this is free and no other paid application can get any better than this. I do not rate good apps usually. But this is a rarity. Really, thanks.",
"Material Design is terrible for.many seniors and people with eye problems. I have Fuch's Dystrophy. It is very hard to impossible to read gray font on brilliant white. Or to read white on light icons of green, yellow or orange. Thuscapp could be immensely heloed by adding a dark or night mode. It's in the android code, it jyst needs to be implemented like many other apps have done. See tge recent Google Movie and TV app as an example. Your goal is laudable but please don't leave out access to visually impaired people who want to learn. Discrimination by omission when there is a fix available is not acceptable in view of your otherwise laudable concept.",
"Every time i try to play a video, i get an error saying it cant load even while i am on my wifi please fix",
"Honestly, this app has helped me so much in school. The videos that they have posted are very educational and very simple. If you don't understand what one video had there are so much more you can view. And even with the little quizzes, they're set up in a way that you can keep trying until you get the answer. When you get an answer wrong, they will show you where you went wrong with your answer and you can try again. I absolutely love it! ❤❤❤",
"On phones, decent. On tablets, pretty poor. On tablet: it isn't apparent how to bookmark a whole course;  returning to the index of videos after following the video links at the bottom several times is annoying (have to hit 'back' lots); doesn't appear to be a way to view favorites. It is possible to download videos for offline viewing, but can't pre-download text/image pages. Some courses on the site do not appear in the app at all (e.g. Com sci/Algorithms). There are probably sound reasons for that, but it is frustrating to not be able to store those videos offline and there is no explanation for the absence which is confusing. Really needs some usability testing. Khan Academy itself is great, but the app needs improvement.",
"This app is great and i can even pay/donate if the option is available in the app, good work guys. But I got an issue, and that's there are no test papers/ skill checking stuff pls add them soon thank you",
This is absolutely a great app. But there is one problem in this update. This is not showing the indian ncert math which was available in previous versions. Please reply ASAP,
Khan Academy is my go to productive application! in so many exciting ways it teaches me well because of my position in school. I think i'm safe while learning math and smart by studying algebra and the history of every lessons are amazing to learn. I also have liked this this application.,
"Edit: Thank you! Problem fixed and everything is working now!   We use this often to help with our home school curriculum. Was working just fine yesterday and now today none of the videos will load on the app. Due to an update, maybe? I'm so tired of people reinventing the wheel. It was a great app until you started messing with stuff that wasn't broken.",
Helping a lot.Best app for self study Now I dont study  for exams but for  Knowledge.  Thanks a lot Sal.  This is the first time I really  enjoyed  Maths.,
Best edu. App but i am having a problem in many videos like crash course videos and many others they get buffer after each 5-10 seconds but many videos play nice at the same time with same network. Please solve it khan academy.... Thanks,
"This is extraordinary! My teacher showed our class this app and it is really amazing. It's completely free, and there's everything! From math to science to art to history......the list goes on! There is also SAT and AP prep section. This is such a useful resource to learn from. The content and explanations are clear and simple. It has all the age groups; from grade 1 to the end of high school. What's even more amazing is that I still think this would be an extremely useful app for a someone in university or an adult! It has helped me so much in school, I highly recommend this app to any student.",
recommended u can have more written notes than having videos so that it could be easy for quick recap..otherwise it is simply osum,
The app crashes when I try to hit the full screen mode. I really love learning from it and so I request you to please fix this bug.,
As someone who didnt finish highschool and is currently trying to get my g.e.d..this app is extremely helpful.,
I was advised to use for nursing school. Defines and explains without the nutty professor syndrome. Great online don't know about the app yet tho.,
"Issues remain. On my smartphone, I could participate in exercises on the app but it's very slow and sluggish. It's not the RAM on my smartphone.",
"If you're saying it's boring go play a game (yeah this is not a game for those of you too smart to not know) and continue being ignorant. Khan Academy is not a game, and if it's boring for you, no one cares. Khan Academy is a great resource to learn from, especially in the fact it's free.",
It's nice but not giving option to download videos to sdcard. Please update it in two one day as my exams are very near.,
This app helps me with every subject. They get straight to the point and hit all the high notes. Hope they add biochemistry in the future,
"I want to be able to work at my high school geometry mission through the app. However, I don't see a dashboard or mastery challenges. I like the quizzes and their elegance compared to the online version.",
"Thank u very much .The best educational app ever, whenever a problem i look for khan academy ,i really appreciate your efforts",
"Excellent app for learning new things, very simple explanation and awesome UI. Only suggestion I have is that it would be nice if video quality can be adjusted",
This app is enough for all the stuff we don't need any other app for information well done team,
"Every single exercise will not load. This app is great if you only want to watch videos, but too flaky to otherwise be useful.",
"You are doing something which can change people's lives, and for free! Im not stupid enough to not give this 5 stars.",
Loved it. So easy explanations. Made very difficult concepts easy. But just make it movable to SD Card. Except everything is fine.,
"My go-to website to pick up, refresh materials I learnt and have forgotten. And also learn new materials. Great resource",
"Great app when compared w.r.t. toppr and plancess. While watching videos the quality of video and sound deteriorates suddenly and after sometime again returns to good quality . Please, check out this problem.",
A great resource and very well designed app. I used Khan Academy frequently for GRE prep and the lessons were especially helpful for reviewing foundations of mathematics.,
In India parents spend a huge amt of money to get their sons and daughters clear the competitive exams but u did it for free. And really fabulous and deep explanation about subject.😃😃😃😃,
I hope this helps me with my whole degree - helping a learning disability here :),
Thanks For Your work I WOULD LIKE IT MORE IF U WILL ADD  #COUNTRY OPTION IN OUR PROFILE SO THAT WE CAN SELECT #BOARD AND CAN FIND OUR #ACADEMIC TOPICS EASILY #PLEASE_TRY_TO_DO_ God bless YOU AND yourTEAM,
"Trouble with the videos . When a video starts, it is of fine quality and suddenly it becomes blurred and hard to understand what is being taught....Please upgrade the video quality.",
"I love the app but when i use it in my tab it doesnt show class like 12 or 11 and other  in maths category , on phone it shows.",
Offline feature doesn't work properly otherwise app is great As i don't have Wi-Fi connection always so i used to save it offline but it takes too much time even I've a good connection.,
"Bros what have you done, after the last update my downloaded videos keep on buffering every few sec, made the app completely unusable",
"I cannot get CBSE Maths videos, it is just showing American Grades Videos.",
"I downloaded it just few days before because I was searching for an app which could help me I learning English grammar,I am preparing for banking jobs and although I belong to English medium but for for jobs I have to work hard and have command on my English grammar.I downloaded the app and started learning grammar through videos provided, and the videos are awesome,and explanation are very nice.hoping all the videos being brilliant. And once again thanks Khan academy,your works being worth it.",
Its one of the awesome teaching app .learning content is pretty good but i rated it 3 star because there should be an option to tune  video quality so that i can run it even at slow speed  .please fix it,
It's great and the main thing is that there no class wise syllabus so one can learn universally everything from just on click. 😋and its free,
"When you are bored or just want to learn something new, Khan Academy  will be your best friend.",
Absolutely awesome. I was always terrible a math but with this I'm doing it all with ease. Fantastic,
Thank you Sal for creating this wonderful platform for learning. I think the fact that most of us call you by your first name shows the very real connection that you've made with us.The lectures are brilliant and the topics well structured.May you live long and prosper,
"This app is educational, wich is important. It has videos, plus hints to explain the material. Thank you.",
"I like the vast amount of subjects available to learn. However what I would like to learn more about is epilepsy, which is very limited on research as it is. If you could make a subject regarding that subject it would be awesome.",
Today 11 March is my result day in my school. And I am 8 moving student to 9 and I have got only 82.20% of marks and I am not happy with my % . I hope Khan's academy help me to score more than 90% of marks in 9 standard,
I think this app is awesome! You can study for any exams or tests and prepare for it - I have my SATs coming up soon and this is a great resource to help me revise all the subjects I need to learn. Defenitely try this out!😊,
You are the best.keep going and thanks.But i regret why couldn't i found this app earlier  in the bigning .,
why is the video stucking at some point and wasting someones mobile data .....comeon i have trying to stream a part but its not working .....so what is the problem,
"Boring, time wasting, unproductive, and noninformative app. The style of teaching is very sucky.",
"This help me A LOT!. it would be better tho if it could save the video to sd card + add/view comment section in the app. Beside that, love it",
Khan academy is the most helpful learning apps...I need this app so badly because my exams are knocking the door,
"জীবনের শুরুতেই বিজ্ঞানের যুগ পেয়েছি,এটার বিস্তৃতি  ক্রমশ বেড়েই চলেছে। এই যুগের সাথে অল্প হলেও তাল মিলিয়ে চলতে বিজ্ঞানের হাতেখড়ি শিখতে পারছি এই অ্যাপের দ্বারা এটাকে এক কথায় প্রকাশ করার মত কমেন্ট করতে পারছি না। (At the beginning of life race,i got science period.and its possibilities is so much increasing.In this period, a little bit learn of science i found here.its just not a app for learn also for feeling that study is life.",
Me 5 yr old loves the math on this app and website! Thank you for what you guys work so hard for!,
"Love Khan Academy, BUT with the last update none of the videos will load on my Galaxy Grand Prime",
"Please fix intro to biology, question two. Not all living things are made up of ""cells"" some living creatures are only a cell. Rewording the question is needed.",
"Khan academy gave me hope to pass all the semesters. Really helpful indeed. 10stars! Also, i love the voice",
Its amazing  I DON'T HAVE WORDS ITS FAR FAR BETTER THAN BYJU'S PLS DOWNLOAD IT,
It's the best educational application and help me to understand many subjects with very detail and correct. I love it ! 😁😁,
I wish If I could download high quality videos instead of the obligatory low quality ones with unclear sound,
"The best amongst the educational apps, I have come across.Their dedication and selfless service to seekers of knowledge is unparalleled.Keep it up guys...U have shared the greatest asset with needy.... Knowledge!!!",
This explains everything to me better than any teacher I ever had. Why can't teachers be this informative!,
"A great app for learning. All the negative reviews are from kids, who only hate it because its not a game and they actually have to learn.",
"It's informative and intuitive and the best part, it is free. Hats off to mr. Salman and his team",
The app crashes right after starting it. Please fix it. This app is of great help!,
Please Put A Setting Where u can download the stuffs and put it in the sd card because I can only download little data to my device storage due to small capacity.,
"Mohammad Imran Khan Sir always make free and good apps, but this app is the best.",
It doesn't play the videos anymore. Kinda useless at this point.,
Hats off! I'm regretting for not downloading this earlier.,
Great app. Very knowledgeable with lots of informative videos. 🔰Do watch the videos on interest and dept.  Has offline download options also.,
Salman is the greatest man in this whole world. thank for create this app its Really very helpful..,
Killer for all other apps. Have a breaks with khan academy app.,
Best studying app. This is just fabulous.... But  there is only one problem... It usually provides advance knowledge than basic... For eg.  If in computer we open intro to java... It is far more advanced than intro... Still its the best for me,
"I thought it would be like byju's and will teach classes. The only difference will be that it will be free but byju's isn't . I was wrong . It's no worthwhile. If u wanna download educational app pls download byju's . Not this....👎👎😟Really disappointed from this app. Was having more expectations than what it proved. Huh......😟😟😟😣😣😕😞😯😝😒😦😖 So,now gonna uninstall it bcos I don't like trash in my tab.",
"I'm pretty sure that if any of you is not very good at math/physics that it really is literally life-changing to begin with kinder-garden math and to go through all the grades in sequence (like, within a week or two) watching Shan Khan explanations and to do the same with physics, you will be able to skip all and any math/physics related classes, which ordinary schools try to teach with years of more-or-less through torturing and boredom.",
to see this become an app is amazing! I used their website and videos in all my previous calculus classes. they have helped me so much! to have it all conveniently here in an app what I can have only hoped for,
The best ever app I have downloaded till now.it is very useful for scoring better marks and good explanation,
The app is very nice but I have problem in accessing indian curriculum on app,
"As a medical student , its really helpful to revise the basics which cannot be found in most textbooks",
"Didn't ever got up specially to review an app but after seeing this app, it made me to anyhow rate this a 5 star! Amazing and free of cost!",
"It's an amazing app, just what I have been looking for. I suggest that you add: download to SD card option. Thanks alot 👍👍",
Great work sir. may you please enable app to download articles and skill check too .Thank you for your efforts.,
My teacher made a khauntest on who can get the moat energy points in March and I won,
"It looks a nice app, very helpful and it's very easy to use also. Thanks to the developers of the app.",
"Awesome! But, I wish there were courses or stuff more on enviornmental science.",
Sir you done a great job thanks sir for making subjects which were difficult for me way thx a lot..😊😊😊,
Loved it. But put some extra videos or articles on function group of organic chemistry and there properties.,
I love khan academy I'm so glad you guys released it for  mobile! :D,
Great app and I never review apps but this right here is a excellent app.,
It's ok but the only problem that this have to show the recommendation,
An app teaches you many things in all age groups...,
"Well designed app, without annoying bugs, quality learning material. Only question: Why are not all the topics (that are in normal browser) available in this app?",
Brilliant app. And a wonderful approach. Can't get better and simpler.,
"I cried, when I got enlightened to math ! I'm 31 and I tried so hard to learn it in highschool and even college.",
Great app for all....☺  But sometimes the video quality become very  bad Please do something,

"I like how many subjects available for learning. The videos are a fair length and good explanations. I would've rated higher, but the app requires you to keep clicking for the next lesson. It would help to have a playlist option at least  (i.e., be able to personally select videos to play automatically after one finishes). Otherwise, the app works well, and it's worth the time to check out.",
"Great.  Aesthetically it is great, the UI is simple nothing distracting in the eye, i love it when app have pleasing UI's. Im glad they have their own video player, i was expecting a external link if i watch the videos but surprisingly the videos are well organized in the app. Video is at highest quality, the voice is clear, and if you have problem hearing there's a Transcript option for you, which is great for me. The Offline feature is a plus, its helpful if your on the go and cant find a better connection.",
"I loved your videos on youtube. When I found out Khan Academy had an app a few days ago i downloaded it right away. They are very well explained vidoes with lots of background knowledge. Your videos explain WHY and how to grasp the concepts for your self knowledge. Thank you for the app it's much better than searching through the videos on YouTube. I Love it! I don't rate apps but this one gets 5 stars no doubt, if you need a good app for help learning you should get this one.",
"I couldn't be more tickled to have fount this! Tech Coach gave me the idea through Verizon. I've always wanted to brush up on basic education and to move up on other subjects. The only issue that occurred while in progress was a error message; Khan Academy not working at this time. Otherwise, I love it.",
"Watching the informed videos are great. But when doing the excersises at the end are so frustrating if you're using a phone. Especially the matching portion. You should make it where you can zoom in or out, it would make is so much better. And when moving the answers, make it so the screen doesn't move with it.PLEASE FIX!!! I would much appreciate it.",
"I've been watching all the human anatomy & physiology videos to help me study for a huge test, and everything they've gone over has stuck, because the teaching is that good. Can't wait to explore the other topics. I'm in love with this app!",
i found just one negative point: I cant download or move videos to my sd card.,
"I would have given 5 stars for sure But there is some downloading issues with app  For ex ,while downloading a file of 500 mb it stucks several times in 80-90% then it starts again with zero . Soto download it completely i had to spent nearly 1.5 gb.  Do something for this",
"It is helpful for me. But I am struggling with the harder questions. Also upgrade this app and get more vedios on maths and science only,not English. However English doesn't help me with anything, try something very realistic.",
Some videos in the app are incomplete. For eg:  video on triangle angles in basic geometry which is incomplete. The same video on khan academy website is of 8 minutes but in the app its just of 6 minutes. Hope you will fix it.,
"It's a great idea, great database, but the UX is terrible. Please improve the User Interface and the User Experience.",
Way too verbose. There's no need to add little tid bits to show how smart you are. Just get to the point.,
"This app is great, it really helped me with some of the activities even though the videos take up too much of my mobile data",
Well this app isn't perfect. But something is better than nothing.  I really thanks khan acadamey team for such a great work.  Make this app more better by adding all ncert topics from science and maths.,
"Being a graduate, even I'm learning new things from this app. Strongly recommending it to school students.",
Honestly this app was a really big help in high school when I was taking multiple AP classes. It's like having a second teacher that helps you with whatever topic you need help with and when ever you need it.,
It is very helpful to me because I am new in USA and I don't know anything about its history so I found this app and it taught me everything about the country. It's like taking free tuitions at home. Highly recommended.,
"This is a great app,  help keep track of what you are learning, my son love it because he can go as fast or slow as he wants.",
This app is awesome for instructional help. I find the instructor specific and is able to go over things multiple times without sounding too repetitive. Good for even home schooling. Love this app!,
Its simply amazing. The most complex topics are explained in simple ways. My daughters now don't hate studies anymore.,
It's a wonderful app I study in 7th and it helped me a lot in understanding maths and science guys download it. It will be helpful to you,
You people could actually add an  option to set up the resolution of the video that is being played.. Luv the app though👍,
"Great content and interface. Congrats to the tutors for being able to convey information so effectively. Congrats to everybody contributing for committing into delivering and spreading knowledge to everyone, without limits. That's noble.",
"Thank to this app I have A+ in math so much love, thank you good people! &lt;3",
"Khan Academy is the most useful and easy to learn anything from computer to astronomy, all free. Thanks to Khan Academy for painstaking efforts to build this wonderful site. A. S. Bhasker Raj Bangalore  India",
"This app is awesome. It taught me how to progrqm, use HTML, and Javascript. Get it if you want to learn anything!",
"It's just a fabulous app.it provides u everything even downloads too,translation,n it's doesn't cost u..it provides a deep knowledge of basic things...tht i need to know..thnks im so grateful that there is really an amazing app which we can handle so easily.",
Hey users u have to install it 1:it is quite understanding  2:more reliable  3:most video animated Note:u have to use 4g r 3g And higher device,
Khan academy has proved very useful for learning. I have used it for an intro to electrical engineering and for home schooling of a grandchild.  One has to work within the structure of the app's courses but it can help one learn.   Very good.,
"It's just an organized view for the videos.  I would like to see something more, like exercises.  The iOS version is quite a bit further along than the Android one.",
"Excellent,  not only it has covered my syllabus. But I also learned advance stuff.",
"I want to say khan academy is a blessing for all kids and learner out there , other apps charges are so high , when you just want some general knowledge,so this app is best for such ones , who don't want to vow to take a particular course but are non occasional learners....",
"I use Khan academy on my computer all the time to help me build a greater understanding of concepts I can't quite fully grasp, and I think it's great that there is an app now so I can use it on the go",
"Too much fast teaching and explaining rest all its good, this should be fixed and no proper words used",
"This app has really helped me a lot with my HSC  studies, I give them a big credit for my HSC percentage",
I have recently gone back to school after a 12 year absence and I am finding this app to be a great help. Keep up the good work! And can't wait to see where else this app may go.,
Everyone saying that it's boring is just very immature and don't know the definition of  studying. This is an excellent learning tool and it is helping me understand some parts of a subject better than I would have without it.,
The app and it's motives  are great but the content should be organised such as the NCERT textbook for students to prepare for  exams both boards and entrance alike. Once again thank you for giving us a chance to succeed.,
Try it! Maybe my words dose not mean much but try it and decided is it worth or not. It's all up to you but keep in mind when you download this you will love it.,
This app covers all the subjects and topics needed to refresh/learn concepts for person with any age.,
I'm in 3rd grade and it's making me do 48÷8 and that's the easiest thing it's asked me,
I have had a lot of experience with KA via YouTube. I'm not 100% certain how this app is going to be but I'm confident that I will be impressed as they have impressed me already.,
The world is a smarter place because of such beautiful innovative apps like this.  Thank you Khan Academy.,
"I love this app. I am currently a 6th grade hack/world/lifeschooler and I find this app very educational and helpful for furthering my academic knowledge. I hope to use this app for many years in the future and definitely recommend this great learning app. Love, Kali Web, amateur app reviewer",
It is the best educational app I have to say only one thing you can learn anything!!!,
Download just crashing  Waste a lot of data then again start from beginning,
It gteat i also go to the place and its worth the money try it  it suprised me 😮,
No words can describe this. Math made easy for the first time,
Best app for  those who love to learn. Only thing that app needs is to save articles.,
So happy they added interactive exercises to the app. The offline bookmarks are a nice touch too,
App crashes Everytime I go to bookmark :(,
"I give their website 4 stars, but the app gets 3 due to missing functionality.  Course material on both the website and the mobile app(s) needs to be updated and reinforced with more detailed information, such as is available in a text book in the margins, providing either more details such as clear dates and examples of applied course material.  Still does not replace an actual class which nowadays in higher education has a khan academy style online section, a physical/digital textbook, the online syllabus, and physical workbooks for labs.  It would be cool if lab work and methods for finding nearby physical labs to work in and sign waivers to learn in was available.  I am just a dreamer?",
I didnt even need to open it to know its worth 5 stars,
"This app is really helping me with my computer science course, thanks so much for making this app!",
This application is a BEAST. Amazing!! Lots of Love and Respect.,
This is the best of all. I dont need a teacher anymore.,
Best app to help my young child achieve her goals. Very intuitive!,
"I love khan academy, you can learn anything!",
"Thank You Sal Khan, and all the others who create easy to understand, free videos!",
"Even as a graduate student, Khan academy is clear, concise, and very helpful.",
Best ever app for students.  If compared with Biju's app it is 1000 times better.,
"Each and every lesson is clear understandable. However, I have a request. Can you add more practice tasks for other subjects?  What kind of subjects I mean is physics, chemistry and electrical engineering.",
I'm fine with it but I want to be able to make it a overlay floating or double multi app so I can run like calculator or my s note so I can draw it on there as it stresses me out for how your app is setted up for it,
"Salman Khan sir, u have done a great job  for us.",
Its awesome!!! I learned a lot of things from it,
Please add Ayurveda in it I have already given five star to it and its a very good app for learners,
Great app; I almost learn everything from here especially math,
Liked it so much at school I am using it on my phone.,
if we can have the option for offline viewing the videos then this app will be supreme!,
Its awesome app and most of topic in NCERT also needed to add.,
"Excellent. But, I can't find the field of computer programming in the app , I found it on the website only ! please can you put these fields in The app ?",
This app has helped me reach my full potential!,
"Math is awesome, but one star less for missing the world of math challenge.",
Fantastic. Love it really helping me. The fact is its free... which is also double bonus.,
Great app to educate yourself. Offline saving available to learn on the go.,
Very helpful in explaining in detail with visual effects. My Go To App for detail info.,
Videos won't play or download. Night 7.1.2 on 5x,
"This is a great app, I just wish you could bookmark the articles.",
This sucks I don't like it cause it messes up every time,
Great app! The videos make concepts so easy to understand and the exercise questions are great!,
Very good app for all examinations. Well explained lessons. A must-have app.,
Not as good as on the computer though.,
"Refreshing today have such an informative app. It is extensive, fun, and definitely challenging!!!",
Please Fix!! Has answers requiring pi but doesn't let me input it for area integrals,
"Sal Khan is my hero! One of them, anyway!",
I HATE it its SSSOOO much WORK and get this i don't even LEARN from it!! MY PARENTS MAKE ME DO IT!!! -_-👹👹,
"I love you all, but could you make a night mode? The bright interface hurts my eyes..",
I am rating it down to 4 stars just because..my downloaded videos of about 5GB just wiped away in a instance....just after updating the app.😭😭😭😭😭😭,
It's a amazing app for learning.,
Thank you a lot for providing knowledge for free.Love you guys for this😇😇,
Helps my 9 year old so much,
if they app have translate is very good,
Best app for student who is preparing for any entrance exam,
Best and worth downloading! Appreciate the hard work for us,
I learn better on Khan Academy than in school,
Love this app 💕  A hearty thanks to the khan team😊😊,
"Finally this is what is was looking for all this time, awesome app.",

"Would have been absolutely amazing if you could practice within the app. Was even hoping to use the stylus on my device's screen, since writing with the mouse on the pc screen is a bit of a struggle. Unfortunately none of this is possible. Still a nice app but not quite what I was expecting.",
"Mobile website is better, I downloaded this because I do lile how khan has great resources for most subjects. But now after installing,  I can access most of the courses and anything I try to open om the site ,like a video.  It opens the app now and says ""cannot load"". Love what Khan Academy is doing and if they fix this issue, I will get it again. But right now it's usless to me 🙁",
"I picked up the app hoping to avoid the issues I was having with entering values (particularly fractions) in the Web interface on my tablet. No problems in that regard, but the app has no mastery, no scratchpad, and no calculator available in exercises as far as I can tell, which makes it just about useless for me. Would be okay if I were primarily watching videos to learn new skills, but not helpful in brushing up on old skills, which is what I use it for, and lack of scratchpad and/or calculator makes working on advanced math problems difficult unless I also have physical scratch paper on me.",
Very good app. We can learn anything for free. But there is a problem which stops me from using the app. It does not give exact info like from the textbook. I live in goa india and what they teach me here is very different from what the app teaches me. It is good for maths but difficult for science. Hope you take this complain seriously because i am uninstalling the app n downloading BUJU'S LEARNING APP.,
What a super app. Math was never my strong suit but the app has really helped me a lot. There's so much to love about it. The video tutorials are easy to follow and super helpful. The app also tracks my learning progress and displays it visually. Really makes learning fun. I am totally grateful that all this content is free.,
"Fine , informative , but all was just in  mouse- PC writing  things which was bit of a struggle... Things are not getting visualized properly.. The person who made these videos was really good and really knowledgeable ... But maybe teaching and videos with some graphics is more kind of useful... But to the ones who are of good imagination and smart thinking this app is just great... This is free and useful .. It provides everything just like school.. But e learning should be more visualized  than mere teaching... Overall useful to obtain knowledge for free.",
"Because of Khan academy, I don't have to take maths 95 at college. One math class costs almost $1,000 and I can't afford to pay this. Thanks again Sal Khan. Hopefully, this is the start of a higher education revolution. Colleges are theives.",
I REALLY DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET TO MY COACHES AND IT IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING I HATE THIS APP IT DIDNT EVEN UPDATE THE RECENT CRAP THAT I DID ON THE DAMN INTERNET! 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,
"Excellent app for improving your knowledge, i think they should add  adult friendly content better for those looking to broaden their foundation.",
"Amazing app, it is my free tutor when I don't understand material in my online classes. It has helped me ace my homework and tests and I cannot thank the founder and staff enough for their dedication to providing free, high quality, education.",
"I encourage everybody to use this app, and before you start view the interview section you will bee amazed. Very happy I found this app.",
KHAN ACADEMY: PLEASE ADD NCERT FEATURES SO INDIAND CAN ALSO STUDY.  OTJERWISE GRAMMER SECRIOM IS HELPFUL,
There's a lot you can learn fro this app. I never stop studying when I get in here.,
I love khan academy. It's so great cuz it helps me get good grades on my school work,
"I have tried this on many devices. In the 5th grade math, I am unable to get a keyboard to pop up when a box is selected to put in the answer.",
"I can't believe I'm saying this about an app for learning, but this is an awesome app. I have no troubles with it, what so ever.",
"Those who are Saying boring  Are Spam bots paid by ""Byjus app"". SAL YOU ARE ALWAYS THE BEST.",
This app is very helpful. It is fun and you can learn about things that interest you. Helped me out a lot.,
"I love it , the best and easy way to learn in anywhere and anytime , i just hope if you can add 2 things : 1- quiz after every video 2- the ability to ask questions or comment about anything in the video inside the app like the website version  And thank you alot for everyone who teaching us or share in anyway to spered the knowledge , I really love you guys and appreciate you so much 😊😊",
Best app for studying for free. This app doesn't contains any ad. which makes clear that it is developed to provide us best education for FREE.,
Awesome helps me with school and really fun thank you creators I have the right anwser and It says it's wrong,
Amazing videos and exercises that really help. Would definately recommend the app to anyone who wants to learn new skills or simply brush up on old ones. Thank you KhanAcademy!,
Khanacademy has offered the best education platform i have ever seen. There are a multitude of things you could delve your mind in and it surely helps me pass the time or study for my exams. Truly a great tool.,
best learning app ever seen.i am frim india and because of khan academy i was able to clear iit.one of the most prestigeous examinations in india.,
"It is excellent for being ahead of your class and learning something the teacher won't show you, I highly recommend this to a student.",
"First I saw the bio section but there was nothing which i wanted to learn and in the chemistry section I saw the organic chemistry which I wanted to learn so, I read for few minutes and I just loved Ur videos and explanations. It is really good. It is helpful for all",
It has helped me to study difficult topics easily.... Thank you kham academy for providing us education,
"the best, if not one of the best educational apps ever. Those saying it is stupid are haters. Do not let them put you guys down!",
"Hi Khan Acadmy  You Are  One Of The Best Educational App, I have Ever Downloaded on Google Play  The Most inspiring Thing Is This App's Caring Learners like Their Own Child  This is an amazing work for free of cost  This is a contribution to society or learners like me  I really thankful to the entire Khan Acadmy Team  Thank You Khan Acadmy  Irfan",
"This is the best Educational App ever, it helps me whenever I don't understand any classes, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",
Well the efforts of khan academy deserve a salute. Khan Academy has changed the traditional perspective of learning. I cant just say in words but Thank U Sal Khan for all your efforts and hardwork to provide free education. Keep Proggressing!!,
"Khan academy has changed the way we conventionally study, I hope with more great work we can eventually break those limited barriers for education. I love you Sal Khan.",
I'm really enjoying the interface. I've used Khan Academy for a while and I only just realised there was an app. I'm glad it's so easy to use!,
"This app and the website are a very cool tool to have either when I am bored or when I want to learn about something. Keep up the good work, Sal!",
Long time fan of Khan Academy. Very excited they added the options to actually excercise the knowlege within the app itself. Hopefully they can do it with all of their lessons. Thank you.,
"I love it sooooooo much. This is the best aducational, and fun app ever. It really helped me a lot in studying",
Khan academy has probably helped me just as much as some of my teachers. I appreciate this app and all your videos alot. This is the most helpful app i have ever came across.,
"I use this for myself as well as my 3 kids grade 7,5, and kindergarten. Thank you so much for creating this!",
But I just wanted a list of math formulas. Thought I'd leave 5 stars before deleting this app as a sign of gesture and token of appreciation.,
Wow I really happy with did app bcz it is able to download videos n teaching is very awesome... It is useful to every on in d world plz download all f u n encourage these guys plzzzzzzzzz,
I can't believe I get to attend these informative lessons for free! I finally manage to cope with my school work and learn few extras too! Thanks for whoever who created this app.,
"So easy to use, it will be really helpful for preparing to any kind of exam. They are still proving the app. Loved it",
"Khan academy is the best educational app ,it has helped me a lot with my studies . It has made me love physics",
It's great helpes u learn new things and a lot of teachers do use this app. My teacher for 6th grade is teaching us things it is a thing to have khan as a tool for learning.,
"Unable to practice within the app just have to watch videos that show how it's done but there's nothing to practice an learn from within the app, yet I love the PC version",
Just spent a few minutes here but got off with a well of information .keep up the good work,
On my first appearance..it is quite awesome app..thank you very much for open such a wonderful academy..one help please make available more space to download,
Is a really good ideal and an app. I can just thank Khan academy to   still helping me with my studies and other persons throughout the world.,
"Amazing! Brilliant! Khan academy really does great work teaching the world so many things, no matter what topic. Try it at least.",
Its excellent. I  can learn anything for free It has helped me with my competitive exams,
Great app which can be used to learn almost anything. Revolutionary idea of a learning platform whose awesomeness and brilliance can be matched by none of its adversaries,
"Khan Academy is the best way to learn and practice something on the internet. The app is great but it could run everything that it can be run on a computer, also needs to be more fast on loading and playing the content.",
This app helps me a lot. I made a bet that I would learn Calculus In a month and this app would make it easy for me. Thanks Sal Khan!!!,
Its great. It really helps me when i fall behind on class work:),
Best learning corner for matured minds plus my favorite app. Love you Sal!,
If everyone is accessible to this app then I'm sure that this app can change the world. Thank you Sal for giving us the best gift that's your knowledge. I'd definitely like to help by sharing it with everyone.,
It is very helpful and makes learning east and it is free I've been using this for a very long time # loveit,
Well I would have fun if could practice within the app itself or else very interesting 👍👍,
"Amazing app! I'm in sixth grade and my teacher tells me do trigonometry, very good at explaining but a little fast.",
"Who ever doing this,  doing a great job and keep it up. This app help many students a lot",
My favorite education app out there. The feature to speed up videos is especially helpful!! Thank you Khan Academy!,

Its the best educational app. U can learn almost anything and that too for free. And the way they teach OMG!! Its an amazing app.,
Too boring!! Add some jokes! Some funny videos! I fall asleep with the boredom  it has now,
Hey friends I suggest u to download this bcoz it's completely free and do not has any ads at all,
Good but would have become more great if it included plays like Julius Caesar poems like rime of the ancient mariner and also include nationalism in India ( all are the part CBSE 10 ncert ),
It's amazing. The computer science is amazing. I loved that. I really love maths now i do calculas a lot . Thanx,
Really appreciate you guys for making all of this free education content.  But subtitle for the video would be great because its a bit hard to see the transcript while watching videos,
It was fine but when I started downloading videoa it stopped working please developers do something about it,
Wow No NEED FOR SCHOOL  I ILKED THIS APP  REALLY IMPRESSED,
Well it's it helps me to not have to cheat on everything so it's pretty good I guess.,
5 stars for information and use as a resource. 3 stars for production of the videos. The audio in the videos gets very distracting and I find myself focused more on the voices than the information they are giving. Wonderful app. Poor audio.,
"Wow, great app! It is so useful if I did not understand something in class! I highly recommend it!",
All content in this app is awesome. I love it.The explanations are so nice.Thanks to this app.,
Best app I've downloaded in my life! Delete Facebook and download Khan . You'll be much more productive!,

Can u ask the grade because it is really hard to find out some videos.,
"I couldnt thank Khan Academy more! It has everything i need. I do not need to go for extra classes to understand everything because of Khan! I think this is the BEST app i have ever come across with!  Thanks, Khan!",

"The Khan Academy app is just made for everyone as it is free yet it doesn't have any cons which make it look like its free which other free app has, it just feels so great, the teachers are highly skilled,. The app says that this much MB is required to download the vid offline, but the good thing is, it takes alot less than that, Khan Academy proved that learning is not a luxury, it should be for everyone, I am a kid but I promise when I will be able, I will contribute to it, keep up the great work,",
"I have downloaded many apps but did find this app so much better, it has explanation with videos and videos explanations too.  I found it awesome. But I suggest to add some subjects too such as Managerial accounting, financial accounting, corporate accounting and Financial management. It will be so good to add some  marketing subjects too. At all I helps more with college students.",
"What can I say about this app,this app is a  perfect learning app in all aspects. We can read all the topics which we want .we can see videos which describe all about our topic.We also can know about  new things which we do not have to learn in our academics  but are very important .  We can listen to great speech . It is a unique app. Great regards to Mr Salman Khan who is doing so much efforts for childrens free of cost.",
"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Khan academy opens the doors to struggle free, creative, hands on, and new and exiting ways of learning. I have used khan as a teacher and if I have any spare time I  use it as a student so I can sharpen my skills while having fun. What I like the best about khan is, the fact that you can go to any subject and select any lesson you like. This app not only helps my students understand the subject but, it helps me be the best teacher I can. Khan academy can help you too! 🌟",
"This is a splendid learning app. I have studied science ever since high school and had no idea about commerce. However, thanks to Sal Khan's effective teaching technique, I can now say that I have learnt economics really well. I do have one slight complaint though. Some of the videos when played, do not show up on the played list of videos, neither on the app nor on the website.",
"This app has been a lifesaver! My daughter is more of an interactive learner. Her teacher doesn't teach this way... She's more fast paced. My daughter learns more and way better with this app than with her 6th grade teacher. I love this app!!! Although at times her teacher has gotten upset because my daughter solves problems the khan academy way, but like I tell my daughter it doesn't matter as long as you get the answer right!",
"khan academy is one of, if not the best external learning tool which can help you advance your skills and understanding of almost anything. its the greatest thing a person can utilize to help learning whether you a in school, Uni or just generally want to learn it helps you a massive amount",
This is the best app for education. I was gonna give it 5 star rating but there is lacking of material of accounting etc. For any subject this app is the best but it would be great if developers try to provide more of Commerce. Well this is just a suggestion not a complain.,
"Very nice app This app is really very useful and easy to use app. As it provides with almost everything, if a person can't understand what the school teacher is teaching then no need to worry cause Khan academy is there...As they say anytime anywhere",
If you want to be in love with creative it's a right place to be one.                      Sir your way of teaching very good this is what I wanted and I suggest every good learner who really wants to learn go for it.                                        Sir I am student of computer science so I wanted learn things at very deep level so may I know where from can I get it.    Thanks alot,
"Damn, wish Android were in my hand 10 years ago along with this app.i could not manage a private teacher for any subject during my education life. Nobody helped but me myself. These days everything is inside an android phone  Even this Khan academy !!! Improve video quality plz.",
its great if your learning something  new. its better then trying to teach yourself something new from a book. theirs no way of telling if you got it right. this site  will let you know if you got it wrong.you'll re do it unil you get it  right. it hurts but  its worth it.,
"This app seems like the work of a true scientist. The thought that education must be free, unbiased and limitless is just awesome. Other apps maybe good but they're narrowed down. This one's the definition of education — Everything",
"I stumbled upon Khan academy a few months ago and it had been a game-changer for me. Every video teaches me something new which is incredible. I haven't seen this type of education anywhere, and this is the best. Period.",
I'm a GCSE student in England who struggled with mathematics and this app alone raised my grade from 6+ to 7 not much but enough to get me into my desired college. Would totally recommend  (And have done) to peers.,
I haven't been to school in over 10 years and I'm going to college. This app has helped me brush up so I feel capable! Thank you so much Kahn Academy! Helps my son with his homework too. Easily laid out and multiple subjects. Find myself on here whenever I have extra time.,
"This is a great way to learn almost anything anywhere conveniently on my phone or tablet! The website is frequently used in classrooms at all academic levels with content created by respected professors, universities and institutions. I detest bloatware however I think this app should be installed on all phones and tablets by the manufacturers in my opinion.",
"Khan Academy is one of the best things to happen to the internet (5 stars to them!), but this app lacks a lot of the content available online and ultimately makes it less appealing. I also adjust the video speed when learning online, but that feature is not in the app.",
So much to learn. All free. Lots of options. Detailed explanations. You can also download the video for offline use. They give you 5 gb space to download. Simply great. Thanks,
"Khan academy is a great resource but the tree on the app needs to be cleaned and a ""continue working"" button added. Other than that the app is great.",
"This app is great. Khan academy requires no payment to learn, and they have multiple education videos. This is helpful even if you are in college. Just as good as being in a lecture room, if not better.",
"I've used this for 2 months and totally loved it! They teached us in a simple way—we can easily get it. I'm not an english speaker, but i can get it well, and this app allowed me to passed my exam with excellent grade! Thank you Khan Academy!",
excellent site. Help me to know much. Teach me things I forgot long ago in school. I appreciate your teaching thank you.,
"Great app buuttt, notification bar doesn't leave during videos, a bit distracting. I'm 90% sure this is app related, something to do with immersive mode. If its not app specific let me know and ill change to 5 stars :) Great app otherwise.",
"Video playing are so slow, please add options to change the video resolution to a much lower bitrate",
Best for self studies but advanced video feature should there means should be no required to draw images video should be just in Bygu app of learning☺👍,
I didn't have a look the app but whenever i can't understand something in the book i just watch his videos on YouTube and everything is clear.,
"Basically all of you people who say it's ""boring"",your just too idiotic to know the fact that Khan Academy is an educational and explicit website/app.As a matter of fact,all you haters ever do is play around like there's no tomorrow.P.S, your mean comments are so meaningless, they became obsolete.",
I wish it had a set up more like the computer version so that I can see my progress and do mastery challenges. I'd that were to happen I'd rate a 5,
This application can make even the dumbest student... A pretty smart one.,
Such high quality of education without premium is an awesome experience. Thank you,
"I just don't like giving any reviews on the apps I installed, but this is so beautiful to be ignored and not to give a 5 star review! Bravo for the team of khan academy! Thank you khan! This would be a great part of my whole life",
"This app is very good , the lectures are awesome but there is some problem in auto rotation during video playback...hope they will resolve this problem asap.",
Best for learning my subject...and if u ppl can do these videos in hindi,
"The best app for students. It has got everything you need. You can download video lectures, watch online. Really useful.",
I do this at school and I always sleep while it's on also the videos are boring to. SAL KHAN IS BORING AS HELL,
Cannot see the comment section in app. Please add the feature so that learning will be greatly improved,
I love this app you can learn so many great things in an innovative manner. Awesome app. Worth downloading. 😀,
I had previously rated this app poorly because it didn't include any practice problems. I have visited the app again and discovered that they implemented those missing features. Keep up the good work.,
I love mathematics and I am able to fix my missing issues with this academy. Thank you so much.,
"It's the best app for self-study but it omit some content what you can only find in YouTube, e.g. I can't find the classification of Possibility and Statistics in the app. That's the only one to improve.",
This app allows me to break free of restraint... And makes study Fun,
A very very great app. Instead of visting other app. Don't waste ur time. Just download 'khan academy' other app always for money. And the teaching way is also not good. But khan academy does not ask for money and has best teaching. Truly excellent.,
I didn not understand some subjects in my university or from manual solutions. I just understand it well from khan Academy.,
"I have been looking forward to seeing calculation can be done on top of the question you've been asked, like the iPad but on my infinix note 3 there is no calculation allowed to be done on top of the same question and that means you need to have a paper and a pen every time you're solving a math question.",
This app is very helpful and informative. The explanations are spot-on and the videos are very easy to understand.,
This app has noticeably improved. I'd like to see a math exercises only section. It would be fun and educational.,
The only thing I don't like about the app is that I'm not able to choose the Download folder for my off line videos.,
"It would be 5 stars if you could watch these videos using Chromecast. Still, awesome.",
"My complaint is with the app, not Khan Academy.  The app is missing everything parent/coach related for monitoring my child's progress, which sucks because their web interface is not very good on mobile devices.   UNINSTALLING IT.",
Love this app helps me understand and study every subject just has awesome video clips and the language used is amazing completely understandable!,
Im in six grade math but my techer was just about to teach about data. We got the assignment i watched a video now i now what to do before i even got to school today. Im sure in the next 5-6 weeks i can be proficient or advanced in six grade math im also taking this in the summer so i can be ready for 7th grade math and its not just math on this app i just needed help with math,
I can't do practice question unless go on the website like that's stupid how is it going to see my progress ._.,
This highly beneficial app is an educational boon in the virtual world of teaching & learning. It will go a long way empowering & enriching global learners of the Global Village. Bravo! Khan Academy.,
"I used this app because I couldn't understand math well and I got an F. This made me understand math well and for the final grades I had a B. This app is a life saver, thanks for making this app",
This is the best educational app that i have came across after downloading thousands of just profit earning educational app... Please add cat entrance exam preparation in your entrance exam section.. .,
This is THE best learning app. I just love it. It is probably better than my teachers. It is great,
"The app is full of knowledge, very easy to use and it helps me a lot. I have followed Khan Academy since I was a 9th grader, and now I'm about to graduate from University. I want to say thank you for your dedication to the world.",
Whoever says it's boring should go play Subway Surfers this isn't supposed to be a game! It's about learning! If you don't like learning then why come to this app? Just to give it a bad review? I don't think so.,
"If you appreciate the efforts, don't shy away from making donations as well.",
"I like it, but some things aren't available like they are on the computer.",
"Well done lessons, lots of material, nice user interface, stable app (for me at least). Leaves little to be desired.",
This is a must for every human being with a smartphone. Use your phones and learn learn learn! Get rid of snapchat and the other rubbish,
This helps alot I like this alot and this means a lot to me!,
"As a student I have learned many information, and is intrigued by it's teaching methods (which my teachers aren't good at!). There are many quizzes that helps you to know where you are in the various topics, and also there are topics that are not even available at my school. Many thanks to this company! Especially since it's free!!! Education at its best!!!",
I always used it online for math homework back in 6th grade. I had no idea they had an app.,
It is very nice app and the way of teaching is very nice also i loved it and it can make a dull student bright.,
"Easy with so much detailed explanation, can you add the programming languages also as a subject...In this app....",
"I love everything about this app, but it would be nice if you guys can make it possible to view the articles offline, just like with the videos, thanks!",
the only complaint i have is not being able to download entire courses at once. i have to go and download them for offline use one by one.,
"I got exempt from my calculus final because I did so well in my other tests, Khan is the best!",
I will be highly grateful to you if you add video of programming languages like java and c++.,
Best App of all.  Father of all teaching apps. I got 100-100 after its use. Very thankful to KHAN,
What a great app with a crap load of content thanks to the devs it kicks ass,
"Good app but sometimes Sal khan needs to give chance to other teachers to explain some topic,",
Superb content. But one bug. Math by grade is unavailable which was available before,
People who say this is boring are just jocks and the popular people that get horrible grades and on drugs,
The app is very useful for an academic student & also those who want to know non-academically. It helped me many times to know topics of science. So thanks a lot Salman Khan(Founder) & all of them who have developed khan academy.,
This app opens my mind. Thanks to the team. I love you all.,
"I am 33 years old now, i am so bad at math and i hate this subject, thx to this app, now i love math, i wonder whose fault that im so bad at math when im younger.",
I helps a lot to get me ahead of the class it's amazing I even play at school sometimes.,
Khan academy allows you to study almost anything and everything for free. I totally recommend it over robomate and byjus. They are all commercial junk but Khan academy is just great for all kinds of study and all kinds of students.. Great work!!,
But its so hard to press the buttons I will give you five stars if it didn't had to be so hard press the buttons,
"Best educational app ever, everything I don't understand in school I can understand from this app",
I'm someone who has struggled with math and so far Khan Academy has been really helpful.,
This app is really good for students because they get exactly what they want. One can easily learn any topic and is user friendly also ! Thanks *Khan academy*.,
"Pretty good app. Mastery challenge is available on web but not on app. If added, that'll be great",
I have been able to advance my children's knowledge using it.,
This is very helpful for learning. I strongly support the development of this application. Thank you so much,
I honestly love it! I would have just studied my whole life instead of 'learning' if khan academy wasn't here. Thanks for helping me see that interesting universe! I am grateful.,
"Gets stuck at times, prefer using the computer version than the app",
"Personally, using this app, I've learned algebra quicker than any of my classmates",
"Thanks to khan, I passed my exams swiftly.. Please try to add advanced subjects such as medical biochemistry and human anatomy in the health section , it will really be of great help to students like me in health sciences. Thanks",
Because it's very helpful. this is my school so you just DOWNLOAD this APPS,
"It would be nice if the app could be moved to a secondary SD card, instead of only the main SD card.",
My textbooks for college are so hard to understand but Khan Academy has helped me greatly in my success getting through school! Recommend 150%!,
I am very glad. So nice app. Thanks khanji. For more best performance pleade includes projects.,
Learning just to keep my brain busy & positive . Khan sparked a renewed love of learning for me !  What a wonderful resource!,
All of you ples downlod is helpful,
i hope u add more difficult problems to solve and more subject in engineering,
It is just too good for learners like me. You can learn just about anything in the world. Love it.,
"Love it, love the teaching and even through tough topics Khan Academy will teach in a simple and understandable manner.  Amazing!!",
It is best app than byjus bcoz it is not free but khan academy is best in explanation than byjus,
A cool fantabulous mindblowing pocket universe of unlimited knowledge !! Truly Amazing ! Hattttsss Offf to Sal ! Really love the way u teach,
I give 5 stars because its really amazing app I never seen app like this....,

I loved it.... Because it can teach you really helpful things ... And secondly even if we do not understand we can ask questions... And ... It's really teaching something worth .... It's not just made for fun ... It's for the real knowledge we students need .... To decorate our mark sheets !!!,
The best app to learn almost every thing about science.,
"The problems Sal teaches in the videos are easy but if you do it on your own, it appears to be complicated.",
This is the future of education. Abd I totally support and love it!,
Best app i have came across..no words to describe it..jst loved it,
I would like to thanks to the developer of the app for providing those free videos...it is a good help for many children....,

"I want to say it's an amazing app and perfect for studying. 5 stars. However, with WiFi speeds as poor as mine it's vital to have quality options for downloading, as at the moment I'm downloading at such a poor quality the audio is practically unfathomable and I can barely make out the demonstrations due to the graphics. I'd be extremely thankful if a feature was added that would allow me to choose what quality I want to download the video at for offline use instead of the automatic feature in place now.",
"I like Khan academy, I really do, but I can't seem to find my missions that I can find on the computer when I'm on my phone",
Best app for education..but it has very few topics in statistics. It will be very helpful if u include more topics on stats.,
Love Khan Academy to bits. Luckily the Web site is well designed and responsive so I just use that because this app refuses to open any video or practice doc. Just use the Web site directly.,
I can't even desire better than this..Plz just add videos on particle theory even.,
"It doesn't matter if you are a student, teacher, home-schooler, principal, adult returning to the classroom after 20 years, or a friendly alien just trying to get a leg up in earthly biology—Khan Academy's materials and resources are available to you completely free of charge.",
"Nice and easy to use app, but waiting for new videos to be uploaded, not everything you see on website is available..",
"We've been using this site as a supplement to our son's homeschooling. But it is great for everybody, young and old. There are  ideas for understanding interests rates, stocks and bonds....It is wonderful that there is an app for Khan Academy so we can take our education with us anywhere we go. I love it!",
This is one of the best educational apps ever. Sal Khan and his team did a fabulous task in providing us with this. Here a few adjustments which I recommend as to provide students with a more warming experience:       1)Cover more subjects such as the different types of rocks and general information flashcards. That would be a nice touch😃                                   2) Use diagrams and more animation to create your content,
"Amazing app and service, love it. Would be made even better with chromecast support, hopefully that's in the pipeline.",
"I am not able to access any of the learning materials whenever I try to tap into each specific subject, the app immediately closed itself after that. Could you mind looking into this problem, please?",
This is one of the best app I have ever downloaded. I call it pocket teacher. Best app thanks for the knowledge.,
"It'd be great if we can download to SD card instead, plus a dark theme and more direct lectures. Also, an option to download articles offline would be great. But, it's really helpful app",
Savin' up on that tutor money. Great job.,
This is a really good job you guys are doing. I really appreciate the effort. It helps.,
"loved it a lot Salman sir this is the best app for lerners because of You, i love organic chemistry",
It just shows that sorry khan academy has stopped working... Zero stars...,
It helped me alot facing my STPM.,
It's helpful app for me as a student. Thank you Khan academy team .,
I liked it so much . I can never underestimate this app. It helped me a lot. thanks.,
the khan academy provide well study material with videos for free it is always better then TOPPER and BYJUS,
It is the very best app for the learners and is in simple understanding language.,
It can be use for Revision after complition of our classess and before an hour of EXAM,
The other app like this isnt free. I LOVED IT.,
If I could give it 100 stars I would without thinking twice,
Has very good graphics and very simple to use. It has very good stuff and has very good test preparation.,
"Made me a better student, thank you Sal.",
This is an wonderful app because we can learn all type of education we need,
Good but please make app in pure hindi,
It really help me with my math homework and other stuff such as science history and some more,
U r doing a great work .. keep it up,
The best app ever! Nothing to worry,
This app is very educational and explains the concepts very well.,
Nice job guys...ideal learning in the 21st century,
It's not that bad it's very good,
Needs Android nougat optimization,

Super boringgggg,
∆,
Faaaaad,
"AMAZING; however, this recent update locked me into viewing the videos in the app version, which means when I use Google Chrome to get in, I can't make comments anymore and can do it only on a laptop or desktop 😢. Please bring the ability to see and make comments in the app version. Some of us don't have personal computers, for now 😏.",
"No mastery challenges like one the website. It's good for teachers,maybe. You can't find half the things you want to do. And if you try to search h something that you want to do it comes up with so many results and there not based on what you searched. The little scratch pad thing on there is not that useful either there is a limited space you can sketch in. SO IN CONCLUSION, I GIVE IT A 4 OUT OF 10 OR IN THIS CASE A 3 OUT OF 5.",
"I am upset at the people saying boring... Probably why they are online seeking learning tools, it's education not vacation. Then to actually try and detour others is simply rude, mean, and shouldn't be allowed to post on apps in this category. Clearly Trump voters!! Moron is as Moron does.....",
I cannot but give 5 star. No way I can avoid him praying for his great job he did. So easy and really understandable.,
Your effort Will go a long way in empowering the poor with knowledge,
I found that education can get addicted with this.Love you Sal.,
Its a very useful app but..sometimes it freezes and then force closes. Please help.,
"It is such a great tool for learning so many things.  There is so much information to learn, and they are always adding more. Every video i have watched is fantastically done and sal is such a naturally great teacher!",
Looked for things to help with accuplacer testing and came across this.  Super helpful and if you don't understand something you can review the video as much or little as you need with discretion.,
Apps like this can beat almost all schools in teaching in India especially gov schools if government provide free internet to all people.,
Now a days Education has become a business. But you are giving the knowledge without any charge. Such a great effort. You are living a meaningful life. Dear developers Thank you very much.,
"The app is well designed and intuitive and the learning is easy, but the web/browser version is way more complete.",
I really appreciate as there is no fees for it and appreciate your step.It is such generous of you.😁😀Thank you Khan academy!!!,
otherwise easy 5 star,
I downloaded it because I wanted to take Course about graphic design but when I searched it gave me no result :-(,
Loved but lots of contents are missing in the app while available on your website... Plzz add the also,
I take geometry and I'm in eight grade it really helped me get a's,
"Simply superb,it makes you feel attending your favourite teacher's class.",
"Respected sir ,can you provide quantitative aptitude  series for competetive exam",
A little short on contents For Computer Science else great,
Great app! Great for all ages. The videos are useful. But sometimes for hints I don't always want a full video to watch I'll take a tip note,
I agree with most of the others. Really useful educational app. Does need comments,
I recommend for who wants study at any time,

This is incredible,
Just brilliant,
Nice videos,
Yeah good,
I'm currently working on Intro to JS: drawing and animation online and thought I'd try the app. None of the lessons under this title are available on the app.,
Best,
All is well,
Thankyou,
"We, in our class are supposed to do 80 minutes each week of khan academy.  Its boring but its fun to race with your friends.  Thank you for caring about all kids who wants to go to collage. (im only in sixth and im thinkin bout collage eheheh)",
"In the recent update, as you have reduced the size you have put down a lot of other features also there's a bug 1) the audio amidst the video gets distorted and sal sounds like a robot please fix this 2)can't choose the quality of streaming (due to which it loads slow)",
You don't know how grateful I am for this aop. My first semester in school since 2005 and I was so lost. This app has helped me to understand what I couldn't learn in class. My last exam score is all because of all the great ppl that had a hand creating and maintaining this app...thank you,
"I used many educational sites like Meritnation, cbsencert solutions sites etc but when i downloaded this app it's an awesome experience to study & learn the things. The best part of about this, it contains too useful videos having a suitable explanation of terms. You can also install meritnation, Byjus and aakash for reference.",
"The math graphing function is the biggest gripe I have. As it stands now, you can only use your finger tips to set plot points on the graph. Sometimes it's very difficult to get the point to stay in place especially on a small screen. Also, when calculating the plot points I frequently have to do the calculations several times, even after getting a correct solution, because it tends to only allow placement of points on whole or half numbers. Please create option to TYPE in the coordinates for plot points.",
"Khan Academy is amazing! There is just something I'd like to see. I'd like to be able to see the video in full screen with subtitles on it (not two separate things). When I read the transcript, I can't see the video so well. This surely would be a major improvement, because what we see on the video is extremely important for the fundamental understanding. Keep up the great work.",
"My fone is Samsung galaxy Core Gt i8262...I use khan academy for my preparation of sat.But in my phone Khan academy app is not working at all.Everytime I I open the App and after clicking on the full length Sat preparation,the app crashes and it shows that ""the app has stopped working...""I've installed the app for several times...",
This app is great. My 4 year old starting adding and subtracting just by watching the first video. Awsome. I'm going to see how far my 8 year old can get on the cryptography challenge. Way to go Kahn. I have always believed in teaching anything I know to anyone who is willing or wants to learn. All they have to do is ask. That is how God intended knowledge. Not to hold it hostage for profit. How much more advanced would our society be if everyone's knowledge of everything was shared freely?,
"I love Khan and regularly donate. My kids were homeschooled and Khan played a huge role in their success. I'm using it myself now, to review and fill in gaps in my own knowledge. The mobile app does a poor job in keeping you in track. In fact, it doesn't keep you on track at all. I have very little time to spare, so I'd like to just open the app and continue where I left off, moving forward on whichever track I'm currently following. If that's possible, I don't see it.",
"Being able to do exercises in the app was a long awaited feature. The only thing that I see as improvable is the personalized browsing experience, making it easier to choose and continue with one course or a series of lessons. Overall, though, very thankful for this app.",
The application is great. The user experience is certainty better than other online education provider's applications. But for the last two days the servers seem to be very laggy. Videos don't download and buffer alot in online mode.,
Leaderboard & Quiz battle wanted plus How to challenge friends in the app,
"It's freaking awesome... Notes, knowledge, summaries and never ending assurance for success from khan Academy- Thanks for makin life easier✌",
I love it very much. It helps me to learn many things. If I don't understand anything I ask in this and I get answer of my question.,
One problem idk if it's fixed. I wish the videos u download go in their own catagory. Becuz ID like to download like all Ur math vids there's sooooo much tho n it goes on one long list. It's like scrolling down forever.,
I absolutely loved this app (who didn't?) The blackboard style teaching videos are awesome but...The only problem is the search some topic feature...If I want to search about some partucular topic I need to be specific and use the coreect terms...If my search text doesn't exactly matches the topic's name it shows no results...So that's my only suggestion for Making The Best App Even Better...Again Thank you Khan Academy,
"Hi, i would like to recommend that you add coding to this list. And in this list it would include languages and game design, if you did this it would only make your ratings go up. Thank you",
This app is so amazing. These people love teaching or else they wouldn't do this. The quality really shines.,
"After using it well for weeks, there's a problem occurred. When I clicked in the video, it just hang there, and seconds later , it forced close. Hope you guys fix this asap, then I'll rate five. Thanks!",
App is very good and I am happy to use Khan academy on my phone. But the thing that bugs me is that I am unable to change the video quality. I don't have a very good internet connection. So please do this little tweak.thank you.,
Haven't done a certain type of math in generations....the Khan academy's presentation of the material is first rate...looking forward to delving into subjects I've always avoided....like some science,
I am forced to do khan academy but I do not like it.It is a waste of my time.,
I love the online one but and can't see my profile and find things easy.,
"1) i would like to know that,when we guys donate to khan academy..that money should just be used to make videos..why distribution of prizes is done ? 2) please make application little smooth...its free i can't complain i know..these are just suggestions",
I love this app.we can learn anything we want for free.but it takes more time to load only some videos,
"Thanks #team_khan_academy . you guys are amazing, with your help I was able to clear ASAT in 25 days.",
This feels more like a dashboard for Khan academy. And more confusing than website.,
It's really very good.  I can understand and learn from this app.  Thanks a lot whom create it. May progress their job like this.,
I am giving it 3 stars because it's offline option has some lacking. I need an option to save for offline the whole course in one click. please add this option.,
They provide world class education almost for free. If u r planning to learn things about science just go for it.,
"lots of classes ,though one downside is that it doesn't has a profile section where i can add and manage subjects to easier return to..",
"I regret ever donating a dime. The site has the same problems it had a few years ago despite hundreds of people reporting them and asking for a fix. I reported a few problems 2yrs ago, that could be fixed in less than an hour, and I get automated emails asking if I still experience problems every few weeks. And. That's it. They obviously have other priorities than the users. The lessons introduce terms without ever explaining what they are or what the terms mean so users are lost for the rest of the lesson",
It is a wonderful experience studying in khanacademy. *But there was problem with caption in app. In pc we get the subtitles but not in app.*please bring it,
This the single app give course about everything you want. Please download useful for child to old men. One stop solution. Thank khan Academy.,
"Makes learning certain subjects easier but, it would be less boring if you had to test out of lessons to get to the next. It would help retain the info. Thanks for a great educational application!",
I can't learn math by watching videos. That's why I want a game so I can do it myself. Pointless app for me.,
An app with all the things to help me improve my grades and keep my children grade up. Since they have been using it for their own school subjects are a breeze to them and I need no tutors.,
Many videos aren't being saved online.  I get an error while saving,
"I am so happy that ,such. Billion people have created this  awesome and useful app ,,Thank you KHAN ACADEMY app Developers.",
"👍👌Add please all our engineering electric subject topics to understand in easiest tricky way  ,which is usefull to both casusual study and entrance exam that's it hope u will...",
I use it for school and I don't think that having to get 5 questions right in a row is fair. If you are stuff that takes 5minutes to solve/answer and you have 4 right and the fifth you get wrong you have to start all over again. it gets annoying.,
"This app is really worth getting, it puts everything into a course, the best thing is that it is free.",
"Honesty, I wish I had this when I was in school but now my niece and nephew are getting much help with it. Thank you 😀",
It is an app which fulfills all requirements of knowledge and information in all spheres of education through interactive and easy to understand videos in best way possible.,
"Apart from psychiatry, other medical topics have a lot of scope for detail. This is a great platform for everyone trying to improve the quality and ease of learning.",
"But there are many topics of physics which were not there . Like orbital velocity, artificial gravity, geostationary orbit, communication satellite, etc.🙁",
"I love Khan Academy but I can't access certain topics with this app, such as Statistics and Probability, without the app crashing.",
"I've been visiting your website before and I already loved it and when I heard that you had an app, I was really excited. Khan really helped me in subjects where I have a hard time understanding. I hope you'll be able to make the articles offline, not just the videos. 😀Thank you very much for helping me! 😁😁❤❤",
I love khan it has taught me so much. There are so many subjects to chose from and it is for free! Which is great if you are a home schooler like me.,
"It really is helping me a lot with sat prep. However, it seems that passages repeat themselves if you practice them  enough.",
"Great app. Makes learning easy & fun. Another benefit of this app, which was unexpected, is that it taught me to be a better teacher to others. I love how you'll get taught the different ways problems can be solved & the reason as to why it works....",
I can't download any Wireless Philosophy videos. Trying to download Wireless Philosophy videos and it stops at 2%. Try answering questions in the Philosophy lessons and it kicks me out of the app.                                  It won't load any articles in the Math lessons. EDIT: I can't download ANY videos except math!,
"There's something special about this app. It signifies the good of man, sharing of knowledge, freedom of education. May future humans be sculpted to share and work together for a common good.",
I am currently doing the sat prep and I only have 19 days left . . . I would love to be able to do the exams and such on my phone as well,
"Khan Academy is the best teacher to me, Detail explanation with an example + training always help me more understanding the lesson that I've got at school",
Thank you so much for this app😳 but I would like a topic to be added i.e. insurance and annuity please!,
"Slow processing ,cannot find the exact subject what I wanted ,no clear explanation worst",
I used to do it on computer and didn't know about the online app. Now I can practise my math on road!,
"I've seen many apps but this is the ultimate free, sincere app. I've lost the need for a teacher. They don't completely reach the Indian standard, but what are books for!",
Please solve this issue. Videos play fine but the articles won't load at all.,
"As a TAFE teacher, I am always looking for useful resources to assist my students. The Khan Academy is a great source of material on the Web, and this app is perfect for students on the go!",
I don't usually review apps but hats off to the guys that gathered to make this app. This is a very essential tool for anybody on almost any education level. Thank you.,
Free of cost highly descriptive and good way of teaching followed by sums and problems to test ur knowledge....keep up thw good work,
App can be difficult to navigate but well worth the effort.,
"I already use this great learning tool on my PC, and now I can have it on my phone and tablet. Thank you!!!",
"This allows students to watch what they are learning in class, if they don't understand the concept they are learning in class, they can see another method being explained so they can understand!",
Yes I saw the transcript but there's no option to enable captions. But btw thanks for the knowledge,
Anyone who criticises this app should Change their mind as this app allows to study without any cost,
my daughter uses it and she's always on it she's like daddy can I go on  khan academy and she's always happy when I say yes,
Very helpful!! They teach in such a way that it triggers new thoughts and uplifts the readers imagination and that too all for free!!!. I don't know how much the world owes sal khan. Absolutely amazing sir! :),
I'm a slow learner specially  in math and their videos and practice problems are amazing for me! I'm using it to prepare for my entrance exam for college!,
"I absolutely love khan  Academy....and above all I love the fact that its free.....love u guys.I just wish that can u guys please include more of the creative field classes such as learning fashion designing, textile designing, stylist,illustration,photoshop,drawing, painting etc",
Im loving this application. There are alot of things that I have learned from it and I would like to get more topics on chemistry. Keep improving this app cause it's the best !,
Totally free and very knowledgeable best app ever,
Teaches me anything for fee school is a breeze now,
Keep this doing this work and keep improving. The whole team will get the reward for this generous act. Ameen,
They should make the app more interesting and categorise topics according to the desired level too !!,
"This app has helped my a bunch at school but do you think it would be possible to embed the sat problems into the app, otherwise great job.",
Please don't waste your time by downloading  this app,
"Work nicely on my android, but are there any way to show subtitle while playing video on app? I have no idea bout that, the only way to show subtitle is watch from youtube",
This app really helped me pass a test and it also helps me with what I struggle with in school. I rate this app 5 stars!!!!!!,
It's a great app but it would be alot better if it had a Chromecast option.,
"It says it was incorrect,  so I check online, I log out then back in, worked fine, so I decided to changed it, thinking it was the password that wasn't typing correctly, I changed to something simple, I log out and back in online, worked fine, yet in the app kept on saying incorrect password? May please fix this",
"it's purely awesome, please add multi window support for tablets",
Its really helpful when no one is there to teach u,
"Grt app, thx Khan academy and SAL!! For providing an opportunity for me to learn what I really wanted. 😊",
"Love is program, I wish they had something like this when I was a kid.",
This app is amazing. I am preparing myself for next year and khan academy has everything i need to learn! Thank you so much!😄😄,
But stuff like the mastery challenges should be added,
The free offered content has all ranges of math and science concepts and as a high school student I can say I refer to this definetly more than my teachers.,
"I wish I was old enough to have a credit card or paypal account to donate money to them. Soon enough, I hope.",
It always help me when I stuck and they offer help in other areas.,
"I love it, I am using it since three years now it is just Excellent!",
"The only thing that's missing is a  study plan like they do in school and actually getting a degree from Khan Academy,but besides that's great",
"A program and foundation that is providing knowledge  (an indescribably valuable resource) to any/everyone. For free! A truly noble and phenomenal endeavor!  Well executed and thorough. Thank you Mr. Khan and all the presenters/professors/lecturers /teachers /etc., thank you, very much!",
Freaking amazing app!!!  It's a must have if you really want to learn quickly and Affordably,
"I loved going to this site online, so I wanted to download the app. I ended up deleting a lot of my apps so I could have enough space for the app. It ended up being really stupid!!!! :(",
"Thank you for making this app, for freely sharing knowledge, and, in doing so, changing the world!",
"Brilliant, top quality education...loving it! Please add videos and sections for psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and English grammar (and other languages too). Kudos to the entire team!",
It has helped me so much with whatever I do not know and it is always accurate!,

"Может сама программа не самая удобная, но уроки Кхана это чистое золото, и очень хорошо иметь удобный доступ к ним на ведройде.",
Lol,
Heli,
Yaaaaaasssssss,
Thank You!!!!!,
Coo,
Wow,
"Few subjects like Math by grade, computer programming etc are missing from the app. Even topics like algorithms are missing. On the other hand it has subjects/features which are not available on website e.g KA educators, partner contents and talks & interviews etc. Looks like either the app or the website isn't updated.",
😊😊😊,
😘😘😘😘😘,
Ok,
"I think this is a great app and program to have as a resource. Between the videos, the practice questions, the interactive design, and the positive feedback and hints I feel quite prepared to take the exam. Also, in regard to khan academy in general, applying to med school is crazy expensive and khan makes it easier for us broke pre meds to prep for it by giving us this free app.",
OMG! I am from Calcutta . I have never seen a teaching methods like this.I was also using other apps but this app is much more better than that app. I really appreciate their work . You all doing great. If this will continue like this the dream of Sal Khan of one global classroom will surely become true. God bless all of you are just doing great,
I very first wanted to thanks khan academy. Because of this useful app I was able to crack IIT-JEE . I am doing B.tech in civil engg. The study material and explanation to the concepts is awesome. Every single doubt is cleared. I will recommend this app to every student willing to seek B.tech or IIT college's. Thank you once again khan academy. Loved it,
It's 100% free and 5 star quality. I've only done math with it. But I've never been able to pick up concepts so fast before. Super clear and easy to understand and it only let's you progress when you're ready. I never wrote reviews about anything and I am on this. This is really helping me with some extra studying for my college classes,
"This app is one of the best educational app that's out there in the store for FREE. The way instructors teach the courses are just phenomenal. This app has helped students before and it will help more students in the coming future. This app doesn't only focuses on one subject but it gives students to choose from a variety of subjects which will help them grow and learn more about something else rather than just focus on one. Also, they teach by step by step process and makes it easier. Great job team on providing with such awesome videos and making in interactive while learning.  Soon Salman Khan's dream of one big global classroom will become true. Keep on the hard work team. Thumbs up!",
"I'm just a nerd in ninth grade. Khan academy taught me half the trig course in 3 weeks a year ago. I'm currently in algebra II, and we're not even gonna go into trig for a while! Khan academy makes it easy to learn material much higher than the standards expected of you.",
"There was time when I was scoring 8,4,6 out of 70 in my college... Because of this app I can learn anything anywhere anytime and practice in what am weak in... After working out with this app i have really improved in my marks thank you so much S.khan😊😊",
I always doubted it was free. And now it has helped on my journey for knowledge. And hope for a better job though learning and schooling and the help of this app. Thank you.,
Like the app. Just one glitch when it comes to completion of a module. Don't know why but even after watching a video from start to finish twice it still shows in progress.,
"I guess a description will require 100 pages, this app is soo soo much useful i can't explain, i mean the concepts i wasn't able to understand from years are cleared here, god thank you so much, thank you so much to the whole team of khan academy.",
It's like a treasure to me   it teaches me even better than my physics teacher. I loved it. It deserves 5 stars,
"I don't know if it's just mine but the sound is too low when I'm on my headphones, can barely understand what you're saying even on full volume.",
This really helped with me with intro to physics. All the topics I was struggling in I now understand. Thank you so much!,
I learned a whole lot from this. Everyone who says this app is boring are just typical time wasters who cant even count the number of fingers they have on one hand.,
Great App. As someone said in another review this app does better than my teachers. Has great videos and its specific info is easy to understand. Great Job appmakers👍⚡,
Its really easy to use and the lectures are very easy to understand and informative. Loads of love to you guys. Keep the better work doing. &lt;3 &lt;3,
I have no words to explain my feelings. This app is like a cave to learn skills.,
"Lots of info for your general topics e.g. cells, however you would only find one video for 'cell organelles' and topics such as biological molecules or energy levels",
"Human stupidity is always amusing. This app is intended for those who want to learn and progress. If its ""boring"" download mindless app games rather than complain.",
"Even though it does not have a structured system for people in other syllabi, it has helped me get ahead in studies. Keep going Sal.",
"Very good app compared to Robomate(the newcomers)who reached 1 million downloads with ads.U can also reach 2million downloads,ur far better than them.I will recommend this to everyone",
Why don't you add Sat subject test Playlist.. Please it would help alot,
It's amazing. Whoever calls it boring just is not interested in making a bright future. So keep that boring to yourself.,
This's a very useful app for learning. There're so many many courses that I wish to learn. The explanations are so   clear to follow. I adore this app. Thank you all of my heart!,
Crashes often. Skill checks don't work. Would like to see Chromecast support.,
"""Khan academy""  must be added in best apps of Google play store",
Many people told me this app wont work out for me.but after i got the app i started to know that it explains better than my teacher,
"Alhamdulillah, I have used Khan Academy for my High school and it was productive and attractive the way you teach and explain is awesome, simple and clear. Great keep it up",
In video quality the sound is also getting blurred when video quality is low Fix that bug.,
The way of teaching is awesome. I love this app. These guy did an excellent job and this app is completely free no in app purchase content like beeju app,
This app is awesome overall. Although overall they just dictate it orally with some drawings on a blackboard instead of 3D explanation still they do a spectalular job. It is an awesome app.,
"The app is nice, but a few issues: 1) The app needs a Quit (Exit) button. 2) Needs option to save Downloads to SD card instead of internal phone memory",
"Great, whenever I'm having trouble on my homework. This app saves me HAAHAHA",
This is an excellent app. Very helpful. Am doing A-Biology and this contains just the right type of info in a simple manner that anyone can understand.,
Khan Academy is one of those places I always go to when studying or just curious about stuff. The app is flexible and you can really get the most out of the programme on the go.,
It has helped me through different classes. I will use it for my children.,
It is really good to see all these incredible materials in one places thank you for app.,
The best thing ever made helps me so much i started loving it from the advertisement and the pics on here definetly 10/10 you have video for practise then an article then a exercise this will help pass my GCSE'S 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜,

Such a great platform to polish your knowledge. Videos are really good with exceptional teaching. Thank you Sal Khan I'm very grateful to you.,
Thanks a lot khan Academy.  I have passed my economic exam with your guidance.,
"I use this website for school, and I love it more than any other Website I've ever used. It's super helpful, and great to warm up your brain. Great job👏👏👏",

"Khan academy is my lifesaver, have been watching the videos on utube since I was in 7th standard.Its really appreciable that they post it all for free ♥♥♥",
I had problems in trigonometry and  functionals but this app solved it,
"When I watch a video, there's still a white stripe on the top of the screen which is annoying. Could this be solved for the app to be perfect?",
thanks for spreading the science for the humanity i appreciate it,
"Great app, very organised and super helpful videos :)  The videos are literally life-changing!  They help me understand my school material so much better than when some teachers explain.",
"I play this on my laptop mostly but still, it is a good resource and helpful for more advanced thinkers so as my self. I realy do recommended the app. I can't explain my feelings it is so good!!!😄😄",
Maths has never been explained to me in such a way! I've never understood maths till now!! Thank you,

"Awesome explanation of physics ,chemistry,biology,history,mathematics. My son has found this app very interesting and has no need for tution Khan Academy haz provide us free which is a very good social work but somewhere I know that the guy is making a huge profit.",
"Unlike the PC website, which is easy to navigate and is more flushed out, this app is still working, but a bit more confusing to work around. Additionally, about three minutes into my homework for the first time on this app, I encountered an error message, which booted me out. I think I shall stick to the PC port. Thank you for creating this, but it just isn't working for me.",
"I love Kahn Academy for what it does but the android app is obviously in need of much improvement, especially on a phone. Some drop down menus do not always populate and graphing and precise point placement is near impossible. This makes answers incomplete or wrong.",
"This is awesome! I can't believe that this could help me a lot! I just installed it because I'm finding my way to review for our geometry subject because we're having our periodical exam tomorrow and I don't even understand my teacher. But with this! Everything was cleared, good explanations and very understandable, and the also give some exercises and here. everything is solved! Thank you! Love you guys! especially the for guy  is teaching in geometry. Because of you, I have the confidence to pass the exam",
Love Khan and have been tracking the development of this online university for years now. Please fix the drop down menus in the skills tests. They do not work on my Android phone. Other than that it is truly wonderful.,
"I'm a first year college student, who was struggling (failing) in biology and this really helped me out. The videos explain the complicated processes in a way that is very understandable, that I just couldn't grasp in class. Very happy that it's free too. Thank you!",
"I can't find where to ask questions relating to the videos. On website its more interactive because we can ask questions and also view and answer other people questions. Plus on our dashbord page we can view our activities, badges, discussions, etc. I can't find these options on the app. Please help",
The idea is that people can requst and ask for things they might want to learn... and one where they can vote on ideas,
Won't let me do the exercises its keeps on saying unexpected error or try again when i try to open or do an execrise,
I wish I would have found this app long time ago. I just love it. It makes everything so easy to understand and apply.,
I'm taking chem 1 in college and my teacher is so bad. So lucky I thought to look at khan Academy! Everything makes a lot more sense and they provide lots of examples which is really helpful.,
Khan Academy is a great app for anyone who needs help in any subject. If you use this app im sure you will excel in life:),
No words to describe this App..Simply Brilliant..You all should've try it once and you never gonaa be delete it..,
Amazing just started. Excellent explain. Sometimes would be nice to ask questions to clarify my right or wrong underestanding. Best up to self educate. Thanks!,
This app is very useful in doing my homework. I'm a 8th class student and it is very useful to me.,
It's great it helps me understand my math better and help me with my GED subjects THANK U FOR ALL THE HELP 😊,
"I love this app, it's been really helpfull to my academic life and understanding of concepts. Cool and neat organization of topics. Nice job.",
"This is the best learning app I have seen. It is also free, unlike Byjus learning app, which is only for 15 days.",
I learn 100× more here in 10 mins than in my boring class.,
"Many activities were unable to open in app, which made me leave my Pixar in a box course in the middle.",
The videos and contents are fantastic. Keep it up. Any number of praises for you wouldn't be enough. Not everyone can afford to pay for education. Great work Mr. Khan,
"If there is an email I could send pictures too, there are a couple of exercises where there aren't options to choose an answer from in questions and where the ""see how we answered it"" section doesn't match the question.",
"If the subjects are what you want it might be worth a look. After reading the reviews, I was disappointed. Uninstalling.",
"I love it, it really helps me study. I would really like it, if there was an option to somehow 'favourite' specific topic and have easier access to them.",
I loved online courses in college. Khan Academy's courses are structured masterfully.  They seriously improved my comprehension of calculus and other difficult subjects. Bravo!,
"This is an out standing work, and world class educational resource, which enables learners who can access the internet a free a to z education. This is the best I have ever seen. Thank you Mr Sal Khan and his teem, as well as the other helpers, to mention few the MIT university, google, Mr Bill Gates, the other doners. I hope the world will recognize you, and will appreciate your good deed's. Thank you all.",
Sal is a great teacher! I predict he will be written into the history book for his contribution to humanity.,
"My professor at MDC sucks, Kahn Academy has saved my little PreNursing butt.  It breaks down Chemistry into a chewable, and easy to understand manner.",
The app is difficult to get to my school work I still can't get to it and so it is causing me to have to wait and get in trouble in class since I could not do it the Website is way better,
If you get a practice question wrong. It crashes when you try to view the answer.,
"IV been using this site for over 3 years now and it's gotten me As in all my college math, biology, and chemistry. This is one of the best ideas on the planet. Free in-depth information in an easy to understand format. I love it.",
"Having trouble remembering what you learned in Math today? No problem heres how to do EVERYTHING (edited Tuesday, October 8th) I still love this app, but when I save and download videos it, it saves the videos in the order that I downloaded them which can get unorganized. Could you please add an portion to save them in folders??? Thank you!",
It is very educational because it helps me learn what ever I'm learning in school and it keeps me up to date with school. I highly recommend this app if you are trying to go to college.,
Its just amazing..everything single topic is clearly defined in detailed way...you will find every single topic u r searching for..thank u to whomever it is concrnd..u did a great job,
"I always use it, whenever i got confused on any topic. I love it.",

I am satisfied enough how Khan Academy is doing their great activities. I wish their wonderful successful.,
I like it. It helps me with my math skills. It lets me work on my math when not in school.,
It's boring but I have to do it for homework. I like the avatars though. It's very educational too. It could be a little hard.😟😞😒,
Really useful and best content!! I salute you guy's efforts,
Really good as it's contents are from experts in that field.,
Learn many many things for free! Recommended,
"Doesn't integrate the full offering of the website, but an awesome app and tool for the whole family!",
This is most important app for every students. I use it most...,
Best app for studying any subject and offers a basic to higher level. Best for beginners,
Good work but its less interactive as compared to desktop version as am unable to ask questions and there is no notification panel there,
"Khan academy is good, but I need 7th grade for ontario :(",
It is a good game for kids,
I have been doing this on pc and it teaches you a lot,
Has taught me more than any of my teachers has in the past,
Not option for selecting class 10,
They are providing everything in free..and that's the best part...the way they explain is very much understandable...loving it..THANKS!,

It is very helpful for us or every type of student who wants to learn fast and get best tips to learn easily. Once again I appreciate K.A work. Thank you very much to spread knowledge!,
"I use this to touch up on concepts before I go to Chemistry class, and also just to take lessons on random topics like art history while I'm on the bus or in a waiting room etc. I am a little bit of a smartass so this app is really helpful in terms of keeping me updated and intellectual in a variety of areas. Love it!!!",
The most fantastic study app. The whole content is clear and easy to understand. I have developed my skill in many subjects. The videos in this app are very very very helpful. I also liked this app as it helped in clearing all my doubts and it is free. It shows all the various topics which I want to see. It has also developed my maths and science skill in some days only. I loved this app.,
"I've always struggled with any sort of math. I'm in Calc 1 now, and Khan academy explains the concepts and examples much better than my professor! Would definitely( and have) recommended to others who struggle.",

"Many thanks for this, but it is simpler to go directly to the website. the screens don't fit on my phone (Droid turbo 2)  and the screen won't rotate so I can't use the larger answer pad for entering exponents and other special characters -preventing me from entering correct answers; this does not happen when I connect directly through the website. I'm uninstalling the app and will continue to go directly to the 50+ star website.",
"Sal Khan is one of the most inspiring teachers I've come across. I 
understand that different people have different opinions so please don't 
just listen to the negative reviews, read the positive ones too and give it 
a try yourself. And remember, even if it doesn't help you, it helps others, 
so don't be rude",
"The keyboard is bad. You have to hold down on one key a few times until you get a letter. Then sometimes the keyboard doesn't work at all. The backspace takes away about 3 spaces with one tap, not 1. Then the practices are completely different from the unhelpful videos and worksheets. This is horrible for Algebra ll, or any subject at all for that matter. If I could rate it lower than 1 star, I would be more than happy to. Also glitchy, the screen take too long to load up. Again, NOT HELPFUL. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.",
"This app has transformed my knowledge of math over night. The videos give very good details of the topic chosen. And the best part is the test after that shows how much you actually understood. Besides adding some other categories, this app couldn't be better!",
"I must say that day by day I am getting addicted to your videos and study materials. Not only videos but the materials you provide are so wonderful that I am happy to have someone teach me basics of everything I want. Thank you very much. Now, coming to app, I found few glitches but I think they are the bugs you are trying to resolve, so yes I gave that big five star to your app! Awesome Academy.",
"I have always looked for something like this! Educative, fun, actualized, with a lot of attention to detail; dedication. This application allows  people the possibility to learn, even if you don't have money. (Like my case :P). In my country the education is not so good, and I could never pay a course to learn all I wish I had learned in school. But I always wanted to know more! Thank you Khan academy team, for your excellent work, dedication, and nonprofit heart. :)",
"I use this app almost daily for education purposes. You can find here huge variety of topics from math to history, from physiology to probability. Many topics have problems you can use to test what you learned. I also signed up my three kids and encourage them to watch a video every day. I am then getting a weekly report on how much time each of my students spent learning on Khan Academy.",
"I use offline a lot but trying to find the videos I've downloaded is painful to say the least. Could you put a folder dedicated to downloaded video files? Also, it is extremely easy to remove your downloaded videos (one slip of the finger and you have to download again) could you also put a confirmation message to delete the videos? Thanks",
"I can't load videos, or download them. The app is not well designed and has a lot of bugs. App is not so reliable.",
The video doesn't download properly. It stops in the mid way of download. Always it gets downloaded only after 4 or 5 attempts.,
Would've been better if you guys had addes the comput tree r programming section on to  this. Also please add the missions,
"Public schools are a joke, they don't teach you anything. I'm basically half way through med. school with this app, it's amazing",
This is one of the best learning apps I've encountered. I probably learn more here than I do at school.,
"The app is pretty decent, but it's missing a 'recent missions' and 'resume learning' screen. The website is much better.",
I love the app it's helping us actually learn something new and not mug up but expand our knowledge and the best part is its free of cost,
Maths never stuck after school and I'm personally using it as a preparation tool for the entrance level exams. I'll be applying to university this year and It's really kicked my butt into learning mode. Thank you!,
"This provides a bit more info and it explains well, so I'm doing much better in school now.",
Sal Khan and the team at Khan Academy thank you so much. I'm sure if I put in the work needed I will get though with my math.,
"I have been using this website for about 3 years now and had the app on my phone for 2 and it is an essential.  In my spare time, I watch videos on subjects I am stuck on and when I sit down to do homework, the knowledge is already there.  I download the videos ahead of time and watch them later without using my data, but the dl's are a little grainy on my Galaxy S7.  I'm excited to check out the new ""interactive problems"" feature; that was the one thing it was missing.  Ty KhanAcademy!",
"I had many teachers who never went into full depth with lectures in high school, especially in Chemistry. The Kahn Academy tutorials are the only reason I was able to pass my classes with Bs or higher!",
"Great application. I would be happy if future versions support screen cast from the app, so I can cast it to my tv with high quality.",
I have tried many other apps but I am sure this is by far the best of the best.thumps up,
Buttons can be unresposive.If you accidentally click out of your practice session it resets all of your answers honestly the most frustrating app I've ever seen.,
"I really like Khan Academy, and I mean really, really like it. Sometimes the videos won't load so if any suggestions on that then Thank You",
I didn't decide to give this app a rating until I checked out the other apps available for learning. Khan Academy is easily the best app and totally free.,
Wish it could be moved from internal storage to the SD card. I'm running out of space. Uninstalled.,
Study material & videos are awesome. Enjoying learning. But the download section is pathetic. Nothing works correctly. Majority of videos won't download. Download stops in background. Please rectify it.,
Really really helpful loved it alot. Would recommend that you use this app. Clears my concepts and misunderstandings,
Making life easier for many people who cram to understand concepts..A Salute to the people working on this app and the videos are just vivacious😍,
"It has helped me teach my brother some math concepts, and has helped me be successful in math. Can wait to try the help in Biology.",
This app is an awesome study tool for on the go and refreshers. I primarily use it during breaks at work.,
"This is the best app to study.It doesn't matter in which class you are,this app is perfect for all classes.It is far better than apps like meritnation and byju's,they are all money-minded.",
This app helps you learn everything you want to know and if you don't like learning just try learning is fun and it will help succeed in life 😊,
"While it's nice to have for free and on the go, it is nowhere near the fully glory of the website. I wish the learning plans were listed first, not the a la cart lessons",
"Hello, I just wanted to ask about how I can delete the completed download videos on the list without redownloading them again? I can't download anymore videos because every time I try to this app keeps crashing or it forcing to close. I think those long completed download videos are the reason why I can't dl anymore videos. Thanks in Advance.",
Khan Academy is awesome. Exercises now available but it sucks for doing any problem with graphs so I had to take away a star. :(,
Great app especially for those who missed out in school and want strong basics,
"It's too interesting and is teaching me calculus when I am in grade 8th. The people who think that it is boring, they don't want to learn anything",
Love that I can use it to my kids and at the same time I can go back and re learn stuff from my high school and college years. Very useful app. Thanks Khan Academy!,
I think it's amazing that there is an app out there like this! I tried a few of the lessons and they were simple and easy to comprehend. Cuddos for helping so many people :),
"Love Khan Academy, and you should too!  Having video speed control is awesome - even YouTube does not allow that.  Wishes: I would love to be able to download the whole topic with one tap, e.g. Linear Algebra, or Calculus, and have it be available offline.",
This team has gotten farther and more bold than I ever had imagined they would. True pioneers here.,
This app is so helpful thank you to the developers for creating this and making easily accessible on mobile. Thank you so much you guys/girls saved me.,
the way the videos show things is very easy to remember       but      loading of video is very slow,
"Khan academy helped me so much in things I never knew I could understand, with it exercises and videos. Khan academy is really  educational, interactive, enjoyable, and helps you to learn step by step.  I dought that  one day Khan academy will be the best learning application in the world.",
Thank you so much Khan academy.,
"See, i have downloaded videos for offline content. Now when i open this app, it was not there, it nearly wasted 800+ mb of my data package. I need a solution, can anyone help me?",
I am using Khan Academy to learn Math and Science. It helps alot!,
I usually practice SAT in Khan it's helpful. I got a very high score in Math part. 😂,
Finally the phone version. I know it is hard being a non profit organisation but thank you for this I have been waiting a long time. Even if there are glitchs free knowledge that is at this level is very welcome!,
Thanx Sal. Khan academy has always helped me a lot. Keep going... It wud b gr8 if uh hav some content on Turbo C++ as well....,
Easy to use they don't talk over your head.,
"I can't find the videos I've already watched. I can't see the courses in already enrolled in. I can't stream videos to my Chromecast. Why do you need to see all of my contacts? Please don't misinterpret me: Khan Academy is an great organisation but this app gets a C-, must try harder.",
This app.makes studying awesome and very very interesting!! The concepts are explained very convincingly and the visual videos and exercises help a lot too. I really appreciate the people who explained the concepts excellently!! I absolutely llllloooovvveedd it!!!!😁,
I am unable to save the videos for offline viewing. Though overall the app is good.,
It's really helpful for public that want to learn  and I think this apps is the best apps in my phone,
"I'm having trouble with long division. This is so helpful!!! If you're having trouble with math, I recommend to get this app.",
This app is very helpful and educational. There are many subjects to explore. It's very easy to understand.,
Awesome app. I love being able to click on various topics and learn. Very simple navigation.,
"Sometimes when i want to skill check, it pops out a dialog box saying ""error at making task progress"" i hope khan academy can fix it....",
Khan Academy is all great but if you may can you kindly help me? I have to do Khan Academy according to my school classes and I'm using it on a phone. Is it possible to join my class on the phone as well or does it only work on a laptop?,
This app is never used anf somehow uses between 200 and 500MB of data each month.  For users without unlimited data this is unacceptable,
"Bravo Khan, education should free and easily accessible! Respect to all that support this app and the entire Khan Academy project!",
The app is very good.Need subtitles' functionality for the app. The website of khan academy has the feature. Please add feature for subtitles in app,
Great place to learn many things.,
"I use it as part of my homeschooling program my first grader, and my 7 th grader the are both ahead in their grade. Thanks, or helping make my job easier!",
"Beautiful and simple interface, but it doesnt save where you left in a lesson.",
"This is the future learning ,it offers a more flexible experience suited for each individual",
This is the best educational app.Please add and update subjects like english.,
Love it! it has advances me in math so much.,
It keeps my son's attention and continues his desire to learn.,
This is real and complete education...... I insist that most of the schools must have it,
"Good work, keep it free, make sure you all donate!",
"I love this app, it is great for learning almost anywhere!",
One of the best examples of how beautiful internet is. Amazing job.,
Loved it. It is important learning part of supporting the growth. Thanks.,
"I've learned physics,chemistry,cosmology,algebra 1 and the twist im only 11 and i understand it completely.",
I use it and it's very useful.. recommend to everyone,
"I can learn about music, which is my favorite topic! I really love this app!",
I love that I can go back and review so many STEM classes!,
Please add a feature to move the data to sd card the videos are filling phone's internal storage,
It's very useful and helped me a lot in physics and chemistry too!,
Thanks to this I can catch up on what I miss and forgot! Thank you !,
"The best learning app I ever seen, keep going on",
Thank you for sharing and helping us all to improve...,
Go to resource when trying to figure out what ILC expects from me.,
"Interesting, we'll made, a great app to help with your school subjects.",
Pls add option to change the Video Quality.,
Do you think you could keep the videos going even when the screen is off,
Great videos.  Nice step adding some exercises.  We need mastery challenge.,
Helped me in math alot.,
"Great Resource for learning, excelling and growing!",
"Great job, keep working on it!",
It's really good.. would love it if u could include test preps for  NEET also..,

My only regret is that I didn't download this sooner....amazingly helpful app,
Best in my life get you ready for the next grade,
Allows you to learn multiple topics and the videos really help in aiding my learning,
Not good worst I guess,
Add video streaming for REALLY SLOW Internet speeds as well like YouTube had until 144p would be really helpful,
Very good  application  at study of all field's basics,
Love it! I love KhanAcademy.,
I love it because I get to learn,
I had to do this for homework and it was nice to be able to do it on the phone,

"Gorgeous Interface, fluid function, incredible content, arguably the greatest educational app available on any platform. Only thing left to do is expand. I can trust that breadth and depth of Khan Academy's content will increase with time.   With all the praise, like any educational vehicle, it should not be used alone. For extra enforcement of material, I'd recommend downloading Memrise or subscribing to Crash Course on YouTube.",
"This app has a clean, direct interface, is easy to navigate, and filled with useful information. I'm in love with it lol. I do wish there were even more categories (Which I hope are coming), but that is a first world problem; the fact that this is at our fingertips at all is a blessing. A must download for anyone that has a thirst for knowledge. Ideal for all learning levels, or for anyone that has ever been curious...",
"My daughter and I always go on here when we don't understand her homework or need a refresher. 9/10 times its does the trick. Love this App, I also check it out when I want to brush up on some skills myself lol",
"This app is good from a purely instructional standpoint. This app only offers videos but none of the exercises that the web app and ios app offers. In those apps, you are given questions to work out and answer along with mastery challenges to ensure you grasp the material. Please, please, please add that functionality to the android app!",
"It clarifies all doubts .it is really a amazing app. But the length of videos needs to be shortened slightly, also it would be helpfull to us if the short recap in written form of the topics is provided.  Still it continues to be my fav. Study app.thanks to khan academy team",
"I love the website but the app is to hard to get around, doesn't show what the website does, and the answer boxes are in the wrong places (if there is more than one box). This may be perfectly fine on a tablet but for the phone user it is not.",
"Can't understand how to use the app. Search results alwayd show ""0 results"". Even after logging in, app doesn't show my previous work I did on Laptop and my pending courses. Will improve the rating if Khan Academy clarifies it.",
Haven't even open the app in 2 weeks but it has used 178mb of data. Worrying that the app transfers so much data when it's not even in use,
"This app is really very helpful to all elementary knowledge seeker and I can bet.. This is the best app.. Great interface, easy understanding",
"Can you please put the ""add coaches"" tab on the app like on the website because I have things assigned by my teacher and can't get to them.",
"My biology teacher speaks in a weird accent like she is teaching a four year- old, she repeats the same thing, lowers and higher her voice I couldn't even understand the 💩she says. I am sure this app will help me. 😆",
"Khan academy is a life saver.Their lectures are sooo easy to understand and yet very precise,and the most important thing is, they are FREE. A big thanks to all those who make these lectures possible, You guys are doing an amazing job 😃 :)",
It is a better choice as is contains many nice things which would definitely improve knowledge.,
"Crashed within 10 minutes of usage. Content is great, interface easy to understand. But the exercises don't call the keyboard, so doesn't work",
"My only nagging problem is I can't go full screen in videos, instead there's a solid white bare where the status bar would be (android 6 btw). Fix that and 5 stars for sure!",
Khan academy stuff are the best! Muchas gracias! Ps: Most exams are now based on problem solving...I hope you could add a little bit of more problems especially for the sciences..but you doing super great so far!,
"Amazing! Well explained videos all for free. I love this so much and it's 
helped me so many times. Thank you again",
In my motorola rarz d1 do not reproduce videos.,
Am excited to try Kahn but none of the videos will play and I have a good wifi connection. Please help. 😃,
"I wrote a review when the app first came out, when it was little more than a collection of videos from the website. I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, now that the exercises have been added to the app, I'm more than happy to rate this 5 stars.",
I cannot express in words how awestruck I am. This application is absolutely mystical. It has everything you would ever want as a student 💓💓💓💓,
"This app and people who have put it together, did a very good job. I am pleased to say it's worth putting it on all my kids devices. Love it",
My initial review for the Khan Academy app complained that I cannot see the video.  They fixed it and replied to my comment saying so.  I tested it and it works.  These people care!  It shows.  I'm impressed.,
This app is awesome! The lessons are explained to you in plain English and the visuals make it so easy follow and understand. I would recommend to anyone no matter what level you are.,
This app does not give me mastery challenges and skills to practice as the PC web version does.,
"I use this whenever I'm struggling with math homework and it's honestly so helpful. I have ADHD and have a really hard time paying attention in class, so this really helps catch me up.",
"Amazing app, I am writing to get accepted to do my degree, so I'm writing an exam on maths, physical science and biology, I've really been stressing as I have a short time to do so, but this app  helps a lot and gives me hope that I can accomplish my goals. Awesome app, love it",
"This app will absolutely work for you , whether you were a teacher , a free learner , or an IGCSE student like me. Provides lots of information in a spectacular way. Along with wide varities of topics. Hats off to the hard working people behind the academy 😚😍",
"Now I can study anytime and anywhere, no need to bring my 10 kgs books since I found this app, very helpful for me, wish the computer programming is in this app.",
In the mobile version it's only good for reviewing videos and that's it. There are no practice problems. In math there needs to be more practice problems.,
"I'm happy to be able to do on Khan Academy on an android app rather then using Chrome app, but I don't like that it doesn't have the mission on the subjects.",
I love of what what information and videos it  already consists; only hope for an even greater quantity of videos.,
Very good content but even better than the content is the quality of the app itself. Unlike most other educational apps this app is snappy and works absolutely the way it's supposed to. Simple and effective. Better functionality than even YouTube as a video player.,
But.. i would be thrilled to have some more challenges. Love it. Thank you.,
The ability to go to the home screen from any video. I have not figured out how to do that in this app. Maybe the layout is different on my tablet. Any recommendations? Otherwise he subject matter is great.,
Thank you for making all these free. Its very useful.,
Download has some issues.. it stops if app is running in background,
"My son enjoys this app very much. Which, has this mom to be happy 😊",
Best online free acedmy..my god very easy and best explaination of the topics,
Are you a student.Check. Do you want good grades.Check. Should you use Khan academy.Check Check Check Check Check.,
Its so good because if you dont understand you learn there and practice for free,
Khan Academy truly is an invaluable tool for learning and this app makes it is easy to navigate it's excellent content.,
"Love it! Its easy to understand...and the practice questions arent a whole lot, virtually the right ammount...really helps to sement, what you've just learned.",
The way they explain things are very easy to understand,
"Yay, thank you guys! Mobile login is working. Time to get back to studying on the go!",
Really helpful to know the things in a better way. The purpose to make it free is great.,
"If this supposed to worrk for poor users, then it's better provide the option to choose video quality. This time i am unlucky, player stops for each 10 sec.",
But is sufficient for jee or not.   Because I am study jee so tell me,
You deserve a Nobel prize Sal. Wish we could replicate your work in various languages to reach the remotest parts of the world,
"I've always loved learning , now I can on the go! So fun.",
Simply the best..,
Statistics and probability not coming in my phone. But coming in my tab😢loving the app,
It's a nice app. Every student must try it and it is very nice knowledge providing app.,
But it would be better if it shows video duration in the list.,
May Allah reward you guys for your great effort...,
This app opens a new world for anyone in any level of knowledge.,
"Very helpful, step by step you can learn a whole subject",
It is better than robomate  plz install this one,
This is the best learning app I have seen among all other apps developed for learning process with some motivational interviews with some great and successful people,
Because of this app I am able to get a head start in my future career!,
"For the first time someone is giving a free content, that's better than paid content",
A very useful program to help when a subject needs more understanding.,
This app is awesome!,
good app to get new details explains concept in short time,
Helped me understand much more than what is taught in class,
It is the best app even better than Meritnation or Byju,
"I need only one thing, please make it fully offline! Because I don't want to use it with internet connection. It costs too much!",
Awesome 😎,
I learn all the stuff I want to know! Thanks!,
It is the best app and specially amazing that it is not profit app,
Please add options to save articles for offline use and to download  whole chapters in bundle!!!,
Superb way of learning...its the best learning app...step by step videos are extremely beneficial,
I will be pleased is if you can add a biochemistry branch it would be really helpful     thank you,

"There is currently no syncing between progress on the Android app and progress elsewhere, so if you watch a video on the website, it won't display as watched on the app.",
Super,
No test sucks,
Vg,
"This is by far an application you must always have on your devices! I love the people who brought this all together and have such a motive to ensure education is accessible to anyone. I love the fact that it's free because a lot of us don't have money for college or we just are researching to see what we want to major in. Definitely recommend this to all my friends, family, and strangers religiously.",
I've downloaded the app and have been using ever since.The UI so clean and the tutorials and videos really let you learn stuff the fun way. The method of teaching is so interactive and interesting that I can't stop learning.Wow just amazed by the app....,
"I've used the website and Sal's lessons to learn amateur astronomy, and the courses in physics, mathematics, history, and coding is better than any education I received in high school (barring a few teachers). I'd highly recommend it if you are eager to learn new things 😊",
I usually use this site for homework but its better to have the app because i can just do it on the go but without being able to the recommendations that my teacher gave me I need to look for the exercises myself and that's very time consuming.,
"It is nice having access to the videos, but the exercises are what I appreciate most. 8/30/16 Just changed to 2 stars, had over 700 MB of background data usage not attributed to my watching videos. Will stick with desk top version.",
"This app has saved me in multiple classes. It's easy to navigate a problem you are having by watching a couple videos. They make it alot easier to understand than teachers because they can afford to spend 10 minutes on one problem for every type of ""trick"" a problem can throw at you",
"I love this app, it helps so much with chemistry and maths, but recently I can't see the videos - when I click on a video, I can see the video for a split second before I'm taken to the transcript instead. 😞 it started after the last update 😭 Hoping you can fix this",
"The app is useful, but I don't know what it thinks it's doing as the biggest consumer of my mobile data, despite not having been used in the billing period. It's used more data in the background than my browser has in the foreground! I've now restricted its use of background data - and if that means it stops working, I'd rather uninstall it.",
"Been using the website for a while, no problems. When i sign in with google on the app it throws a sign in error, so i cant continue my progress ive made on pc on the app. Ill check back for updates, hopefully this is fixed soon. Love the website.",
"Its nice being able to have 2 workouts at the same time, body and brain together ❤ love this app",
"I installed this app in my tablet and cellphone and I'm using my google account for the login. With the tablet I don't have problem with the login and I'm enjoying the app!! this is great but I cannot login into my account with my cellphone . The error message is ""There was an issue signing in with Google"".",
"Everything is cool as promised, but the app is not really working well. The videos can never be watch properly. I'd give 5 stars if that problem is fixed.",
"This idea is genius, providing a quality education for free, regardless of your socio-economic status is a massive force for good!",
"When i want play any video suddenly jump out of application and i can,t use it anymore😞",
"I love this app, it really helps me go through mathematics.There is a problem about graphing though, I'm having trouble adjusting the radius of the circle but overall it is really impressive",
"Few suggestions: In maths, use simple examples for understanding, imagine and solving the problems. Use Animation, gif.",
"It would be really useful if it allowed you to download an entire playlist for offline learning, as I'de like to use it on the go but it takes too much data. I know I could go to each video and save it, but that takes a lot of time.",
I have learned many things from it. It has a very good explanations of everything. Thanks khan academy :),
"It's so intuitive. Everything is so easy to use as well as organised. I love Khan Academy a lot already, but this app sure is swell! (The offline download really brings it up a notch too!) Thank you, Khan Academy. As always. ((:",
"I love this app, because it allows you to easily access a very wide variety of subjects and topics, made available on a beautiful interface. The learning system is excellent. I would only say that there should be a Chromecast Plugin for watching videos.",
I am a great fan of sal man khan. This official app have helped me a lot. Thanks,
"Multiple time auto exiting from exercise, crashing on wifi download and not all courses are in mobile version like computer programming e.g introduction to js",
This is the best educational game ever . I was really falling behind in math and economics but after this i am the best in class,
My computer is always glitching out so it's great that there's an app,
I can't see the video when my device is on landscape mode. The quality is less than 240p.,
This app has Malware. Norton found it after it keep screwing with my browser. The app is good if you don't mind the Malware.  I would have bought it if they got rid of the Malware.,
I really love the way he explains and breaks it down .also Ease to understand. I'm really enjoying math.,
"Working at your own pace, having subject matter easily broken own and easily accessible makes Khan Academy the best website ever created for the advancement of knowledge!",
Best app for those who wanna learn. And it's 100% FREE (Salman Bro u r BEST I wish I could join this khan academy team in future and spread knowledge to make world better place 😊 ),
"If you're either looking to reinforce your school subjects, or remembering what you studying long ago, this is the most linear, logical and easiest way to go about it.",
Allowed me to catch up and learn ahead after my summer break of losing knowledge.,
"This has been amazing for college extra practice all the way to  3rd grade learning.  I tell everyone from teachers, parents and high schoolers!",
It's nice to finally be able to do exercises in the app. But it is ridiculously difficult to hit the check boxes of the answers on a 10' tablet.,
I reset my password and It still says invalid password,
Khan academy is a great platform for learning and become good with fundamentals for any student.,
This is a great app. After you learn a lesson there is an activity to do. Tells you whether you're making progress or not. This is a must have app. I recommend this app to anyone who is having a hard time learning.Its really fun.Plus you get badges. I love this app so much. Its like homeschooling. It is not boring.,
"I love this app! It is amazing, and I love how much you can learn from this! Except it just recently updated on my device, and now I can't watch the videos. Please fix! Thank you.",
The best app ever!!! But the problem is we want to save the app in sd card not in internal storage,
The Khan Academy app is finally flawless in offering what the website has contributed to education for everyone of all ages around the world. This is also a personal thank you for the help Khan Academy has given me.,
"It's super amazing. Whether you're learning something on your own accord or getting ready for the big upcoming test, Khan academy is always right there and ready to help!",
It stopped working whenever I press the topic above the video title,
This is not so great because when u are looking for your teacher u can't,
Why wouldn't the viewer be compatable with a $$LG-G4 Runing 6. No mods. Yet...about to see how bad vr is now. Im worried. Never even had a chance beyond 15 min with this ap. Still on got around same time n sat tablet w/no mic... 😒,
The letter-press option(eg.c/d or b/d) isn't working properly in algebra-1 problem solving questions.l haven't tried other questions in other maths playlists though!l would request you to kindly add similar problem-solving questions in the physics playlist also.,
"I am going to a new school, and a while ago I was held back BC of age, so now, in this new school, I'll have a chance to go to middle school! I'm gonna NAIL IT. Thankziez! Those who say this is boring? You're haters.",
Overall the app is great and easy to use but the website is far better as a lot of features and personalised courses e.g SAT are only available on the website.I would really appreciate it if you could make the mobile app more like the website.,
Awesome! This App is the best thing I have ever seen on Google Play...,
Great app for people who love math but want to do other stuff and its a fun way to enjoy math and learning.,
Recent update won't let me watch the video when in landscape. Please help,
"Thank you so much Khan Academy for helping me through various of courses for high school! However, please add more ap's so that we can focus on more areas!",
Today this used 70mb of my data in 'the background' even though I have it set to WiFi only and have only once even used the app. Please explain? Not happy!,
I have learned so much with Khan Academy. The things that I learn in school that are cloudy and difficult to understand are made clear and easy through Khan Academy. THANK YOU!,
I would have given a 5 star rating if preparation for the GED test was provided. That is a major issue for continuing adult education for a large group of people.,
Running in startup/bootup apps even after disabling it in startup apps in marshmallow,
Most learning apps today have a casting feature to cast your videos on your TV. This would be great with this amazing app. Really great!,
"Hard to use these courses without subs, transcript is not good enough on the phone",
Ive learned so much from the lessons offered. A great app if your curious and love to learn :),
Omg this app is amazing the developer must be an absolute genius it's free plus I can use it anywhere,
Can you please get this app to be able to play the videos in background? that would be very helpful! When I drive I like to connect my phone to the Bluetooth.,
Thanks very much. It's been a ++ to me.,
It gives the perfect solution and helps a lot in improving!!  Just loved it!!,
Very usefull for all kind of users with different ages. Thanx a lot!,
For every mom out there who worries about there child future I highly recommend this app for you it has science maths chemistry etc it's damn awesome good for you if you install and I mean very very good for you,
No words to describe it. Just amazing!,
A must have app for students.,
"For being free! Knowledge is power! And some guard theirs, but you give it freely!",
Could you tune the app for some emerging economies as well? This app teaches me some great stuff that I couldn't possibly understand from all the rote learning hypocrisy in my country.,
For the learners whom wants to learn even if not in the scenario...Bless To have that kind of App...,
"Plz download it . Its a very useful app . primary school , high school n collages",
When I solve quizzes using the website  I hear nice comfortable sound and nice smile face I hope you can add this sound to android app and try to improve it as much as you can. Thank you,
"Allows to learn pretty much anything,right? Well, all I wanted is some Greece history, its not extremely hard or whatever...I got no results whatsoever. One!result and its ancient Greece quiz...",
"Matrix, Math",
I would never do this will in math without it.,
First I  hated maths but this app solved that problem and I would just like to say THANK YOU to whoever made this app,
"very very very good app,very useful for students for grade 9",
This app is very useful for take information about any subject and to learn anything about world.,
"Helps teach loads of content through an understandable, unbiased, user-friendly interface. 10/10",
Really a  revolutionary step in educational field! The Indian Education system should learn something...,
Thanks to you guys my grades are increasing at a very fast pace!! AMAZING WORK GUYS!,
I use to love this app now i cant find anything on reading or writing,
Joining here free off cost and you will got the education of your decision on whether or something like,
It is the best aap I have ever seen,

It would be nice if the video played in lanscape mode on the tablet,
Could not move to external storage- removed,
Jackass app giving  free study,
"It is great, like school!",
It reset my progress and I won't let me sign in.,
Its ok but its boring,
"Love its free of cost ,loved its education ,loves its contents",
"Easy to use, lots of information.",
You can learn for free!!!!! You just have to want it,
Amazing work!,
The official KA app is finally here for Android! Thank you!,

Love it,
Loved it,
"Exercises have been added, and like the text transcripts as well. Will be using this more now for sure :)",
wow,
Bravo,
The app keeps giving me the unresponsive bar every 5 to 10 minutes and closing the app. Sadly until you get some better developers working on your project. I'll have to continue rating this app one star. Once I can use this application without it crashing I'll give it a 5 star.,
"The videos are fine, but so far the app has none of the other features of the awesome web site. No assessment, exercises, dashboard, or progress indicators. At logon it shows my badges but with no labels or links to explanations on the web site they're meaningless. I understand more functions are to be developed (please do), but as long as it's just videos, please remove opening badge display & rename the app ""Khan Academy Videos."" That way users won't be misled about what it actually does.",
The resources this app gives access to are vast enough to assist in most subjects. My only complaint is that since the videos feel to slow (only some) I have to use the speed multiplier. The issue is at times the audio cuts out randomly ( for me it's while using 2x). Other than this minor glitch the app is incredibly good and needs more additions in subjects where possible.,
"I can't believe this app is free. There are so many comprehensive, in-depth videos for all the hardest AP subjects, from economics to physics. Add-free and distraction-free, it's excellent for review before a test or if you missed a day of class. Khan Academy has saved me many times!",
"The front page has a curated list of some courses, but not all. The search function finds individual lessons, but not courses (and there's no way to get from a lesson to a course).  Basically impossible to find anything unless you want 3rd grade math.",
I love this and in going to the 7th grade and it really helps more than the teachers. At first I didn't like studying but now its fun you learn new stuff u might even be so smart u can teach your own class.,
Khan Academy helped me so much last year. I had really good teachers that pushed us very far compared to normal. It felt so good acquiring so much knowledge and knowing so much new stuff and understanding. I really miss it. Anyway khan Academy is amazing!! Peace✌,
I am doing much better on tests and homework because of o.j. the go learning. Keep up the good work Sal.,
It's helping me get clear on basics of maths which earlier I used to hate. I am using it to prepare for GRE.,
I really appreciate the hard work of you guys..I have been using this app for over a week now and I have seen improvements in my career academy..! I highly recommend all of you guys to use this app if you WANT to learn something rather than mugging up things..!,
"Great app overall. I use it on the go offline (a lot!).  Please update the content according to 14th Aug update, especially calculus; Unfortunately the curriculum right now is outdated.",
"Since I'm Going to   6th grade, I can learn cool stuff we will do next year",
"I click on what I want to learn and the videos keep saying ""ok so I'll pick up where I left off"" I don't even know where he started. For example if you click on Health and Medicine - Human Anatomy and Physiology, then click the very first video...",
It's helpful in strengthening the content I learned in class and as also helps as a review of basics. It's a wonderful idea and the videos really help me.,
"Studying chemistry and body and anatomy, I prefered this over what my lecturers were pre-recorded for the course.",
"I had fear in statistics and physics.By watching the videos and doing the exercises, now I have no fear.Thank you.😊😀",
The number lines for math problems are very unreadable thus making problems impossible to solve. Also the app will crash and say it can not save progress. Using an android.,
Thats a wonderful app no doubt of that but a lite version can a very preferable one for people without broadband. Thank you.,
I adore the maker for the wonderful idea of initiating free education through internet. It really helped me...... hats off,
"This app is very easy to use nd is very educational with math, computer sciences and etc... This app is really great if you want to expand your knowledge and understanding of computer code and other subjects. As well as numerous subjects under math and has different grade from kind garden to I think 8 or higher.",
"i loved using khan academy..through my p.c ,but now i find it great as this app allows me to access khan academy anywhere, any time",
"This is such a great app! I was struggling with math and this helps me understand what I'm doing wrong, what I don't understand, etc. I'm so happy I found it. Although... Sometimes it does quit out on me when I'm doing the practice work, but it doesn't happen often. But it's still such a great app!",
I recommend this application to everyone interested in having the upper hand as far as education. To sum it up this app is great and teaches you almost everything you need to know as you get through your highschool years and even give you some basics for college. BY FAR THE BEST EDUCATIONAL APP!,
Thank you Sal Khan and software engineering team to make an on the go app. No complaints from me.,
"""The day I started khan academy was the day I started advanced math thats how fast time passes when your enjoying studing thank you Khan""",
"To those that say it's boring: It's not intended to be entertaining. It is a handy tool for learning and studying. Great app, and very helpful!",
Not able to play any video. This app just closes automatically.,
I don't need videos. I need testing! Ooh. They started to include problems. Arigatoo.,
"Had this installed for a while but since the last update it's been using a lot of data in background mode and caused me to go over my monthly allowance, costing me money... Will be uninstalling it.",
I'm getting ready to go back to school after more than a year out to retake a class I initially failed. This app has helped me so much to get reacquainted with the material. I feel so much more confident going back to school!!,
Okay im a freshman student and I LOVE computer science is like my favorite subject thanks to khan for giving me free lessons on something never knew about !,
But there is one problem i want to change my avatar how to do it ? If talking about online site i loved it. If u can tell me the solution it would be a blessing.,
I Appreciate your work man learned alot. Thanks,
"This might be the absolutely best tool to learn, practice and ultimately master any topic presented here. It's an incredible tool for students on any level (up to bachelor degrees, I assume). Completely free and ad free and syncs with your Google account to keep track. Has video and written materias to learn the topics and great tools for practicing what you've learned with helpful feedback.",
🎃🎃🎃,
Pls fix the downloading issue .,
"I like it so much, you did so much work in you app i really like it dude tnx for creating this kind of app!!!",
"Highly recommend for deep learner, Visually the concept with great videos..",
I feel bad that i only noticed this app just now. This app is very helpful for my studies as a college student. Really thumbs up! 👍,
"One of the best learning app for students, teachers and actually anybody! Best for developing conceptual clarity. Quick downloading videos for offline learning has to be the best feature. Strongly recommended!!",
"Its the best of all yet,to the next exam fear.both helped me a lot",
I am so glad I got this app because I want to get good grades on my report card for better education because I am only in fourth grade. I am now smart.Yaaaaayy.,
"Mr Khan , you have helped so much by making this app free. #Respect",
"Even though i havent opened the app in weeks, nor open in the background, it used up 120 mb background data! Probably loaded with spyware and trojans!",
Sal khan u n ur team is doing a great job . I m a student n I knw what problems we face with r studies but knw using khan academy app studying has become fun thnks alot,
"Khan Academy is honestly the best way to learn independently, even for university level maths and science",
I learn alot from it and now I know every thing,
Humanitarian acts will always have a 5 stars.,
"This is a wondr app....jst the best of both worlds. Sal, keep up the good work...ur way of teaching is completely unique n fun to watch.  Keep inspiring wd ur motivational speeches.  May God bless u..for providing all these for free :D",
"Khan has helped me study for tests, prepare for the new school year, and much more!!",
It was an amazing experience  using this app . It helped me alot for my SAT preparation.,
Khan is a leader in online education. May your work continue to bring clarification to all students.,
It helping poor people to learn high eaild subjects,
"Everything is ok. But when I try to play a video, it doesn't play and get back to my phone's home screen. May be, this is a super app but I can't enjoy this.",
Just like the website this is a wonderful resource to learn and test what you have learned.,
"Its a useful and easy to use and  I really like it. My only problem is that you  can't sign in with gmail, But it doesn't bother me much. 👍👍👍",
"It's sad, that great mobile app has videos in English only. :( on your site you have thousands of translated to Polish versions. Waiting for my language.",
A leisured learning app recommended for everyone !,
"This app was a kinda helpful and it makes my brain and I to study more and more and more. And its because that this app that came from you ""Khan Academy"" makes me happy, while I'm watching those... My brain excell to know more. And also, please ""khan Academy"" make more and More and MORE!! Apps from you that can helps us Students to learn more. And please make offline apps... Please. And Thank You Very Much Again For This App.           L.O.V.E.D. I.T. S.O. M.U.C.H.!!!",
Thank you So Much for your free services. ❤,
M njyng dis classes so much. N its fun.,
Searching for app like it and finally found this .everything is free to learn just loved it,
There is no caption on the video and I can't understand what it talk about.,
But it hangs most of the time,
You can easily learn anything. Just enter your grade and learn.,
It's not where I'd like to see it yet. The content on the app is different from the content on the website.,
Hope mastery challenge soon will available as well...,
I really hope Khan academy continues changing education for the better!,
5 stars for  for starting to integrate exercises awesome.,
This will create my base and guide you to the path of sucess.,
The videos buffer a looooot..than youtube...enough to leave one leasson to learning,

"Khan Academy video is huge in size, so please add option to set download video to MicroSD in the future update, it will save my internal storage. thank you :)",
Super application for learners,
Data hog,
Whichever video I click in is isn't working. They just speak but nothing comes on the screen. I'm giving it two stars because at least they speak. Please fix this thing ASAP. I really wanna learn calculus but the videos ain't working.,
Awesome now skills exercises have been added. Hope to see mastery challenges some time soon!,
Loving the new update!! Exercises here we go!!,
It explained the steps in doing a particular task by analyzing the task and bringing down to how the learner can understand it,
I LOVE THIS app  and,
Really awesome,
Best ever,
I can't explain how much Khan Academy helped me last year. My AP Biology readings were very dry at times and sometimes I just couldn't keep track. I found some videos and they explain the important info I needed and many more. It's well organized and very easy to navigate. I would love if Psychology was added as a subject.,
"Cannot recommend this app enough! The content is fantastic, if you are looking to learn math or science this app is for you. It starts off with the basics and gets more complex as the app progresses. Sal is amazingly good at explaining things and makes the learning enjoyable as well as structured in a logical and suitable way. Best app by far for education.",
This app is great for learning stuff(especially math) it follows along really well with the junk we learn in school lol. But on a serious note I recommend this app to anyone who is eager to learn more to have a great education. If only there were more subjects....aka history:-),
"Wouldn't  download the videos over cell data or wifi, I updated it and now it just crashes every time you open it.  Fix the bug please as I really like the videos! They're great for watching on the plane, but I need to get them offline in advance!",
"This will teach you about anything you need for free. This is too good! So much variety  at high quality. Great app. 💖Thank you Kahn Academy. My parents don't really make enough money for prep, and I'm relieved to find an app like this.",
I'd give it that 5th star if there was a way to incorporate streaming to chromecast from the app. Aside from that this app is excellent.,
The videos are not downloading and interruption like couldn't load video are being faced. Pls help,
"I love everything about it, I started out becaming the noob of every subject but I used khan academy, I became a nerd of math, science, language art, history and microeconomics. Thanks to khan academy. I got the education that I need and the gift of knowledge to trying to get to MIT.",
"I really appreciate your attempt to provide free education about anything 
for anyone. But bugs interrupt during playing a video. Pls fix this.Also 
pls add an option to download videos to SD card instead of internal memory.",
I can learn many things from khan academy especially maths and related subjects.,
I'm living my childhood again that I didn't get in Burmese education system. Standing ovation for Khan Academy app.,
I love the app because its easy to use and it really help me studying about many things that i didnt learn in school. It would be great if you add practice feature as you did in the website.,
Im going to study finance at uni and i can honestly say this app is awesome. Its helped me soo much in learning all the basic terms and methods. Thank you once again.,
I'M just speechless. This is the most amazing app that I've ever seen for learning,
Khan academy helped me refresh some basic and advanced skills I needed to gain a promotion.,
Exercises or quizzes are needed to make it interactive. The videos are very informative. But I'd like to test my knowledge as well.,
Easy to browse by category and watch a quick clip on any particular topic you feel a little underprepared on. I used it to get back in form for a tutoring position and I am so glad I did.,
I love it.helps me understand some concepts i would never get in class,
The best app that provides you basic to intermediate information regarding to certain topics in an engaging way. Especially with the transcript feature. Deserved my first 5 STARS.,
It is very easy to use and to handle too.              The teachers are also very Excellent that helps in understanding  facts.,
"It is awesome because all the lessons are for free , it is not in all the apps so there is no limit for learning I thank very much for the thought",
"Changed my life. Our education system is so wrong, but this little app made me love learning again. Thank you!",
This is literally the best App there is. I don't let the low educational standards hold me down anymore in Chicago. With this I can excel way ahead of my class.,
"I learn more in an hour on ka than I do in most college classes. App needs ability to browse videos while one is playing, and more granular playback speed setting (in 0.1x increments perhaps). Need more comp Sci content.",
Thanks khan academy u r the best. But I am anxiously waiting for other subjects. I also wanted to know developer's email address for reporting.,
"Everything is good except you don't get notifications about badges or points like in the iPad or PC apps. Also, why can't I take exercises and mastery challenges?",
Better if there was a notebook installed in it to take notes. And if you could share progress with others,
The site is where I started learning coding and I love it! They provide videos and hands on programs I'm just sad I cant access that from the mobile app.... Yet ?!,
Not letting me put in answers. Website is great tho.,
Computer programming which is available on PC is not provided on the Android app. Please provide the update ASAP.,
Concepts are too easy and doesn't take much time to understand them...,
This is great for school we will be pretty advance in subjects and that's great for young minds this is just awesome,
3 stars because you can't practice problems like on the web version. If this app ever gets problem practice support then I will change this review to 5 stars.,
"I use the videos to teach my children about physics, biology and advanced math in our home school. Classic literature and essay writing would be great additions. Can't wait for U.S. government section!",
Helps me all the time. Really happy with it. Wish it had more subjects. I need more lol,
"Its easy to understand, and of course they do an awesome job in explaining, very helpful",
Easy to use and very helpful for the students keep it up .!,
It's very helpful! It helps me study more about economics. Good job guys!,
One of the best app I've ever used... Really appreciate your work,
On the browser we are able to sign in to site but not on the app. The app keeps returning invalid password. Hope someone can fix?,
It cleared so many of my doubts !  :),
Feels like school minus the classroom. I love it!,
"Love everything about this app, just wish it would sync with Chromecast.",
It is a great source of information for the people. It provides easy to understand lessons for the students,
"Great educational app I have seen ever,thank yoy kham academy",
It's a great way to learn more and more. But it can be more better. Although it’s good.,
But robomate is not compitable in my device. This is interesting,
This app provides best in class knowledge for free to every one,
very easy to learnand make putting future,
Physics has become a Lot more easier after I watched your videos...Thank you!!!,
This app is good to learn maths and other subjects,
Very helpful I'm in pre-ap mat and this helps,
it move offline video to my tab storage not to ext memory card taking lot of space in my tab,
"Sir, Hindi language is required.",
The app is really helpful if you need a good reference or study material,
my teacher loves this 😄😀,
Very very USE full it's help alot,
This app is very helpful for learning,
It is the best educational app,
This app can help you learn a ton,
This app is very helpful god bless,
Please be available for chromecast,
BEST learning app in the whole World,
It amazing I'm loving it.,
Every student should have this app.,
Damn its good for everyone,
There is no 9th class CBSE board,
Good for any highschool grade,
Helped with school VERY well,
"Please add the world of math, i need to do that for school. Thanks :)",
The quality of videos are low and and not working right,
Website is wayyyy better,
One of the best learning app and absolutely free of cost ..... Thanks 😊,
Very helpful... Thumbs up,
Thank you!,
Thank you.....,
This has helped me,
Excellent feature for learning,
Great study tool,
Loved it!!!,

Thankyou salman khan,
.,
The best,
It is good,
Great,
Awesome app,
Great,
Love it,
Loved it,
Awesome,
"The videos are great, i have nothing to complain about in that respect, but it lacks the practice modules from the browser version of the website. Because of this it's to somewhat of a disatvantage to those like myself, who learn much more by practicing. Of course i could do so from a book, but nonetheless, when only my phone is available, i'm unable to practice. For those with a busy schedule, it would be great if that would also be included, so they can practice even when they have but 5 minutes to spare.",
"A big thank you Sir Khan and the team. The app is too useful to describe its usefulness.  I am taking help from you from last couple of months, and I always found it helpful in understanding the concepts of science and mathematics.  Yesterday I updated this app and since then I lost all of my saved videos,  also I am facing difficulty in watching videos after updating.  Please resolve this issue.  Thank you again.",
i skipped three levels of maths because of this site. it inspired me to push my educational limits and see what i can do. i will soon graduate high school with a two-year college degree and will have bumped myself up to an upperclassman standpoint in the two majors i'm going for because of the fire that khanacademy has put in me. more people need to know about it.,
"All that I can see in the app is to find new courses and my badges and points (obviously after signing in).  There is no feature or option to continue the courses I signed up at website, or atleast check the progress. No tab or option is provided. Khan academy deserves a five star, but not its android app",
"I got mutually attracted towards this app coz , the teaching resembles if u are sitting in front of a virtual teacher . This is gonna be the best part of the app  that it contain each n every thing from basic levels . Another thing which makes it more awesome is its free of cost. If r searching for a good lecture site , don't spend money in the useless institutions , better have a time here...",
"It lets you learn stuff, but only piecemeal. I can't find the ""missions"" like it has on the website. Also, it'd be great if coaches could use it on a mobile device as well to check their students' progress. Perhaps that is an option and I just haven't found it yet, though.",
The Khan Academy app on was my favorite on ios.. Bt now the lack of a single download button per subject is disturbing.. One had to open every video to download it.. Imean on ios I used to download whole topics.. Please developers.. Lets be serious and realistic.. Opening &gt;100 to download them is a tedious job and unnecessary.. Put a single download button per topic/subject,
1.  whenever i fast forward video it again buffer for video which was loaded completely before fast forward  it is demerit for person with slow  Internet connection                         2.  it doesnt have download whole playlist option which is not very big issue but sometime it  feel like it would make better                                  3. well you cant solve your exercises in mobile app. and partner  courses doesnt play correctly it shows very pixilated  video and wrong colour in every  course,
"I would be flunking College Algebra if not for Khan Academy being so great.  It's been 16 years since I took algebra 2 in high school and with Khan Academy I can look up all of those things with fractions, decimals, and more that I have forgotten.  Sal Khan explains things in such an easier to learn way.",
When i go to videos list it closes out the app and stops working. Please fix this so I can watch more on pollution.,
"We really appreciate your efforts. That's a fabulous ,fantastic and awesome app I have seen on the play store it is very easy to use you can get any type of information through this app GOD bless you guyzZz a really big thanks to the developers.... we love you all.......;)",
It is easy to watch videos. Would be perfect if I could see my son's report summary.,
Explains what professors are too lazy to explain these days. This app is helping me through my college classes. Thanks,
"This is an extraordinary app includes vast knowledge for almost everything you need, I wish this existed when I was younger.",
Very helpful ! I learned what I needed in no time. Some things were a bit too  developped (term not explained or very vaguely) for a beginner. This is a great source of learning! Discovered ans enjoyed crash course !,
If i use for somtime suddenly it hangs and notified that khan academy stops working...update it i will give five stars,
WE CAN NOT MOVE IT TO SD CARD.  IT IS NOT SUPPORTING MOVE TO SD CARD.  TAKING INTERNAL MEMORY OF DEVICE .,
I used this during school (about to go to seventh) and it helped me so so much.  I'm a visual learner so this up is a life saver for me.  Looking forward to using it next school year,
"This app helped me improve in Mathematics. This is helpful, had a well explained video and all the information we need to know is all here. That are the reasons why I love this educational app called ""KhamAcademy"". :D.",
After every 2 second it loads  for 15 second. Then how can we watch it. This is a very bad drawback.,
I couldn't find dashboard option. I cannot take tests in the app like in browser. Please add dashboard option,
It's just awesome. What I mean is that it's everything. It' s very helpful for students like me. Explanations are dope and easy to understand. You can experience high quality education for free. I really love it. Thank you for making this wonderful app.,
It won't let me play any of the videos it will let me on the computer but not on my phone. Please fix it.,
"I absolutely love Khan Academy, and this app just as well. However, not being able to do practice problems, or have any of the missions/ goals from the actual site on the computer was a huge inconvenience for ""learning on the go.""",
"The app is great, well done and very useful but....it consumes an insane amount of datas on the background!!! I just found out that it did cut my data bundles....without me using it at all!!! Be aware and download it ONLY if you have unlimited connection.  I am forced to unistall it, I hope you can fix this :/",
It's much better than even some paid app for education like bijus etc. I m having a great time using it. Fantastic work.,
One thing I wish u could add was a question answering section I am still confused after learning stuff. I hope something is done about that.😊,
Improvements such as problems and not just fill in the blank,
I love it but I hope you guys put challenges and warm ups just like the website because it will be more fun to test on what we learned from the video.,
"The app is great if you are searching how to make the exercises in math or looking for some kind of information in the other subjects, but the app doesn't have any courses for practicing like in the website. I guess this is really useful just to watch and learn, but to make the exercises... go to the website. It's much better.",
Good tutorials but App needs more work. Why not make provision for downloading entire topic and also allocate more memory to download. Maybe this will prevent app from Crashing during downloads.,
"""Unfortunately, Khan Academy has stopped"". That's what I get each time I try to open the app. Please fix it.",
"Its fun to actually study, lectures are soo clean, studying was never fun before ,but now it is ,",
free lessons that i failed to follow when i was at scholl back then....  now i learn those for free on Khan Academy 😂,
It's really hard to find apps that help to learn something for free. This is a great app. Every concept is explained very well. Loved it :),
"I have had time to see only a few videos, and some do not have very good audio quality, but the mere concept, the initiative and the content deserves the 5 stars.",
I do like all kinds of apps but this.. This is pure gold coded into simple app with very well made videos and very understandable explanation. Honestly this should be included as a standard app with the google aps package. Videos are exceptionally good!,
I swear this is one of the most interesting apps I've used. A must-have.,
"Loved this App. The content which is  available is awesome and  easy to understand . While others are offering the same content as a paid service ,KA is giving us the same for free. Keep it up KA. You deserve this 5 star.",
All I need to study is included in this one app and it saves my time because of the videos directly available in the app... Wish they may add some more.... But really this app is awesome...,
I recommend this. Because it gives you a good explanation on almost everything. But please add a favorite subject list to make me easier to continuing my targets,
This apps teaches complex  things like abc. Thank You Mr. Khan,
But sometimes what I want I don't get axactly that video otherwise gr8,
"Its so much fun using the app, plenty to learn.... I would like to give a suggestion cuz I noticed the website gives theory or notes to read, I think that should also be added to the app... Thanks for this wonderful way of learning",
Worthless. It's just the videos which you can view on youtube,
It was very helpful to me to get any information I want .. well designed application .. easy to use .. it allows most particular easy and even interesting videos in each branch ..,
"First, on web. Now, an app. Really hope Khan Academy would keep on improving and provide the world a new concept on learning. Loving it!",
This is an app that everyone should have!! It covers all aspects of education. Please download!!!,
"The app's design is simple and nice. The content is good. If possible, do add some content related to law.",
"I really like the Ochem lecture formatting on this app a lot better than the YouTube play list, but I'd really like a resolution option since I'm not sure how much data I'm eating up with ATTs new data cap on home internet.",
No need to see what app contains! If it's Salman Khan it definitely going to be the best! Cause his lectures are the best (Y),
"If you save videos, and they can be kept in separate folders created by us, things would be a lot easier! Great app btw",
There also should be live classes videos section in hindi english and many other languages. otherwise it was a good app,
"My school curriculum tends to lag behind me, but Khan Academy gives me the chance to learn things that I'm interested in.",
When I click to play video it stop responding and crash,
Very(raise to the power of 9999•99999) helpful. loving the math and science sections,
No practice available.Please fulfill this ASAP .,
"Great app, would be better if it let you do math problems. It could be a substitute for app games.",
"Bringing effective learning in such an accessible way.. And the videos are so engaging and informative. These sorts of people are really making all our lives better, putting technology to wonderful use.",
Yes it is. It's easy and fun to use! It covers just about every topic through its many videos and practice questions which makes it a very useful learning companion for those of us looking to brush up on a bit of knowledge. ;),
This is the perfect place you should send your kids to study there after school.,
You actually can learn a lot of things I mean it,
Having trouble with word problems indept videos on solving them would be nice,
I want back to school on this site. I've been telling everyone about it. The brilliant one's already know about & use it!,
This guys deserves an award. This site is the only reason I understand some of my classes.,
I loved it so much..I mean you guys are doing grt thing for students...because i know how students are learning in colleges..boring classes..conventional classes..you guys are making huge interest in students..I am one of them..I and my friends are using your apps daily ..even more times than whatsapp that time consuming app....thank you guys...keep it on..for a good cause.,
"EXTREMELY HELPFUL & USEFUL. KHAN ACADEMY HAS SAVED MY GRADES MANY TIMES! I STARTED USING IT FRESHMAN YEAR, NOW I'M A SOPHOMORE. 🤗 I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS APP!",
Awesome work by Sal Khan. Providing quality education is a very commendable job. Kudos!,
"Amazing app, full of knowledge and extremely helpful as well as concise with the lessons.",
Really saving my ass...would love to see mechanical courses too...you guys are uranium nuclear missiles!,
I CANT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THIS APP! THIS IS AWESOME. IT HELPS ME A LOT! THANK YOU. I WILL RECOMEND THIS TO THE WHOLE CLASS. UPDATE THE APP SOON PLEASE. TO THE CREATOR AND CO. KUDOS TO YOU ALL. YOU ARE SUCH A GENIUS!,
This app is simply awesome. A big thanks to Khan Academy team. The concepts of science and maths are clearly explained and I'm addicted to it....... Continue your good work....,
Love the app but needs to be updated with all edits found on the website. Other wise amazing!,
We can learn any thing,
Sal khan! I first of all thank you for establishing khan academy. Khan academy has been always helping me understand many concepts for a while now. I wish u success you are really doing a great job.,
Just wonderful. God bless you all.,
The app crashes whenever I play a video.,
Khan acadamy has always helped in conceptual clarity,
Best job done by khan academy giving through is just paying but good explanation and free videos is by only khan academy,
It is helping me learn all sorts of wonderful things,
The UI  is simply stunning. The flow of the topics are very good.,
I did not no how to do negatives but now it is very easy and fun,
And the best things is that it is absolutely free for anyone😄😄😃😃😃,
This apps really help me to  pass my catch up test,
It suddenly stops. I love Khan academy but something's wrong with the app I guess. Or is it just me?,
Now get all you want to know in easy and cool way,
This is the best educational app i have ever used,
Free on line school,
The best in the play store useful for all ages,
I do not do good in math I just got the app just by look at everything I no its going to make me smarter,
A really good apps with a lot of course to learn :D. It's just too bad that it is only in English(I'm French) ^^,
"I am just speechless!! Totally, love it 💖💖😍",
I luv the way u explain guyss... But yeah pls introduce the problem solving area for the app version too... But still its gr8.. Thanq khan academy...,
It's super helpful and easy to use !,
It is a very good app for learning.,
This is an awesome app!,
TI hope this will help me for 8th grade but I give you a five star because I am very nice,
It's really a gr8 app for students...a must hav app,
Khan Academy helped me to go to advanced math. GOD BLESS SAL!!!!,
Learning a lot from this app in such a short time !,
So it's just the videos? We can't actually do the exercises? Hope they add the ability to do work later.,
I like it I use it everyday and it's a good learning source,
The practice exercises seem to be missing,
This helps me with math.,
It's simply superb. Loved it.,
Always helps me while understanding something,
Superb help me to undersatand better,
i wish i started using this years ago!,
I can learn anything for free!,
Ita ok if we cant change the language but it is never a good idea not to add subtitles :(,

"Love it, its great to study with. Can you guys please  add the ASVAB, AFQT to the study prep section please. I only use this app to help with my ASVAB test for the military. The AFQT is just 4 sections out of the 9 section test. The AFQT is just the score that says weather you can enlist or not the rest of the test our for job placement. The AFQT consist of, 1- mathematic knowledge, 2- word knowledge, 3- arithmetic reasoning, and 4- paragraph comprehension. Thank you.",
"English is the most important subject and I can't find a subject that says ""English"" and English is the most important language to learn and there's nothing at all for English which is very shocking. The good thing is that there is every other subject. I will give five stars if u add a subject called English and every single thing and rule to do with English. If u add the subject English I rate this app with five full stars.",
"Great for studying and taking notes, all of the videos I've seen so far has captions and that's perfect for a dyslexic girl who doesn't know how to spell every word in the English language. I would like to see an update that would allow me to do problems like on the website.",
I usually do khan academy on a computer but I wanted to try it on a phone. But for some odd reason it only shows video when I go into a grade level and pick a category. Please comment if you know how to fix.,
This is a really nice app that allows you to study whatever you want for free. Isn't that great? Salman Khan and his team have worked really hard on this app to deliver quality education to all. There is a nice and simple to use UI and the concepts are cleared really nicely in Khan Academy.  I would really recommend it.,
"The app has been extremely helpful for me! I had this horrible chemistry teacher and didn't learn much last year, I reviewed all the year's topics in a few hourse with this app c:        I would love if they added Chromecast support though. It would be great for many people studying together the same topic and viewing the videos on a TV or such. As well as for small devices it makes it a lot more comortablr. Really lookimg forward for the updates on the app. Keep Up The Good Job!!",
This helps me greatly. You don't even have to stress about studying compared to reading notes and trying to memorize things.,
When I don't know grammar then I downloaded Khan academy it was very use full now i know about grammer I thank the  creater of Khan academy!,
"Usually teaching the tough topics Sal give us appreciation for learning it. What i m gonna do now...,give Sal my heartiest appreciation for making such an application that may be in future make me a better science student. Other apps do provide some useful educational videos but they all are hanged up with the money tags. When i dwnloded  Khan academy i found all content freeeeee..This is actually a humanity.So, Sal, here is your biggg fan...",
"if I don't understand something, I can always come back to this amazing app. everything is explained so thoroughly and well. 😊😊",
"I tried to go through the courses, but none of the videos would work. They all automatically were at the end and reverted back immediately when I tried to start back. If someone knows how to remedy this, I would be happy to change my rating.",
"While Khan Academy is incredibly helpful, a lot of the videos on the website are not available on the app, same goes for playlists. I can't find the Quantum Physics playlist nor some of its videos. That's a big problem",
They have a variety of information. Its like the world of knowledge is at your finger tips. I love khan academy the only problem with the app is that it doesn't have interactive parts that allows you to test your understanding like it does online,
"The content is great and the app is user-friendly. My only issue is with downloading. Whenever i go offline, download stops n when i am back on, download does not resume. Rather download start over from scratch..",
"Sadly, it's now grown to 46MB. I don't have room for such large apps. Please streamline it and pull down more content interactively.",
"It's great except there should a feature to add and  entire subjects/topics to ""my list"" at once and begin downloading them",
I got this for my new LG phone and it is not useful at all because I cannot practice problems with it. Only videos are available.,
I really appreciate this app.  It works correctly and perfect.  I recommend this informational app for you guys plz don't miss this app download hurry up it is late.,
"But i can not track my progress on topics. Its SAT prep which i do on web but app doesnt show my progress in topics covered, even i canot practice questions in it.",
It is indeed a beautifully amazing application one must come through if he or she has any difficulties regarding any subject.,
This game is awesome at least it helps kids learn and you can pick any grade and some apps only give you a certain grade level and it freaking sucks because you have to have the level you are on or go up a level.,
"The information is wonderful, but without missions I can't apply it, which is what I love about the web experience. It would be an incredible feature to have in my pocket.",
Good although it doesn't always show that a video has been watched no matter how many times I watch it.,
Khan Academy is an AWESOME resource but this app is missing something very important featured in the website: the quizzes. Would rate 5 stars if that were added !,
"Just started using this app and absolutely love it bro, honestly when I can't get help from my teacher this is where I go and its helped me so much. Hope more videos will be out soon thanks guys 😇",
Not rating this app and the site for this great and noble initiative would be injustice..the variety of contents and information available is overwhelming..,
"For computing, you only put computer science but not computer programming and you forgot English too so not too impressed",
Awesome app for advanced learning. It helps to learn a vast variety of things. Really liked the app 5 stars.,
"Its nice that Khan finally made an application for mobile devices. But the other half of learning is doing, please update and include ability to do exercises similar to the main site. There is a developer who made this exact function prior to your app creation, it worked perfectly. Maybe collab with them, the app is called Viewer for Khan Academy and you can actually do exercises in the app.",
The app is good...but I'm having trouble saving videos for offline watching...they always stop downloading in the middle and a message pops up saying download not possible.,
We use this on the  computer love it but can you Please make the mastery challenges available on this app.   Then the kids can do them any where.,
Its too great to handle.  Its just that. Could you add the practice thing just like in the browser. Coz its really helpful. But good job anyways. Hehe,
Its great man. The Khan Academy team gives free and quality education. Special thanks to Mr. Salmam Khan. Keep it up guys👍👍,
"I love KA, and I've been using it for years,  but it would be amazing if you could do the quizzes and exercises on the app too.",
"I don't know how the Khan Academy team is able to provide these complete lessons free of charge, but I am forever grateful. This app is incredibly convenient for study on the go. Thank you!",
"Khan academy may d almighty Jehovah bless u. You have just made my life, education easy. I love u",
I have been learning from Khan Academy since a year. It's super  exciting and fun to learn. I'm so glad that they have introduced an app now. Happy Learning. ☺,
I wish i had tried this out earlier. Khan academy is very helpful for math. I understand things alot easier. Glad it's an app now!,
"An extremely quality app with amazing resources for practically any subject. Thank you Sal Khan. Now why not help us by putting the assignments on the app, too? The videos aren't much help if I cannot practice the new knowledge!",
With the same internet speed I'm able to play the video on my notebook but the video doesn't play smoothly on the app.,
The quality of the actual app is amazing you can't believe it's free. Very good for people studying for exams but also enables anyone to get a free education even if they're not. One of the best Revision apps on the play store,
"Why no exercises though, it's great to be able to watch videos but I was looking forward to being able to practise with some of the exercises",
"This app is fun to just get on and learn something. The videos have a great way of making you actually understand it. Would love to see a test after each section, just to see  how much you have learned",
I joined Kahn's website a few months ago and was hooked. So I got their app too! Great way to learn while covering a wide range of subjects.,
"I love the videos! They are very helpful, but I thought the app would also have some questions like the website...",
"I tried the others, they failed me.",
"Whenever i opens the app a pop up appears "" unfortunately khan academy has stopped "" ..2 days before it was running smoothly but not it even doesnt gets open at all.",
Also thanks because it has videos offline and can be seen anytime but I hope that you won't apply or charge money in future. Very much thanks for providing this app.,
I never rate apps but I just had to rate this one. Thanks to this app I've managed to excel in all my classes. Everyone should download it!,
I am a girl who hates school but it made me love school more,
"Content is good, but it looks like a lazy iOS port.",
Lovely app.. Quick access to a whole world of knowledge for any age group into any profession. Great job guys!,
"I genuinely love Kahn Academy. It's helped me tremendously with Algebra. However, the only thing I don't like is that the app doesn't provide the practice questions to ""master"" anything, like the website does.",
"All are good. I've been learning for 2 years with khan academy. It is really helpful. Now that it has their mobile app, I just wish I could also do the mastery skills training and everything, like in the browser, at the app. I'm waiting for this update asap ^_^ pleeaaaase! THANKS! 4 stars for now 😁",
This is one of the most essential apps and should definitely be acquired by any person who is interested in learning and exploring new things.,
It's Simply free compared to all other online education app or sites. Keep it up Khan Academy. Made my life.,
Perfect really.. beats the boring classroom environment..The app works flawlessly and covers a lot of subjects which are well presented 👌. More subjects could be added though to get that last star 😉!..LOVE IT,
Can't downloand entire modules for offline viewing.  Have to go video by video...very tedious.  Would be a five otherwise,
"Would appreciate if you provide download / offline options for the FULL COURSE, rather than just Chapter level video offline access.         And, please add GRAMMAR COURSES.",
A well maintained effective application for everyone. Khan academy has every topics from every subjects and provide a great UI for learning. Just try it and happy learning.,
"Depuis quelques temps, certains sujets n'apparaissent plus et impossible de les trouver (Economics, etc.) Il s'agit uniquement de la version française. Quand je mets mon téléphone en anglais, tous les sujets apparaissent. Il faudrait mettre une option pour changer la langue de l'app.",
This is the best education app I've ever seen on Google play. It's completely free and it's so good I wish they had a donate button so I could support them.,
Khan Academy Is very awsome educational app that helped me to understand basics of math and algebra. Thanks Khan Academy,
I really really love this app because it literilly has what I need to learn but I wish there was a way you can find ideos you downloaded for offline viewing. But it is almost better than than my real school teacher.,
Everything I want to learn is all here from simple facts to equations. Credits to the creators of this app.,
"So I like the app,  however I don't like how I can't continue doing the work via app,  once this is implemented I will rate 5 stars. Videos are nothing if I can't practice what I'm learning.",
Khan academy really helps me understand a lot of concepts. The videos load fast and the platform is also very user friendly. AND THEY GIVE ALL THIS FOR FREE.,
"I downloaded the app to continue my progress on the internet in khan academy, but I can't see my coach and my progress.",
Thank so much. Khan Academy has become one of the most important part of my life.,
"I just recently graduated high school and I still find Khan Academy useful. The way they go about teaching and examples is wonderful and makes so much sense.  The achievement system adds a unique layer of interactivity that makes it quite engaging. I highly recommend this to students of any age, whether you're just starting to add or are wanting to learn some linear algebra!",
"Very educational, one of the best apps I have ever installed, will recommend this to friends and family. Keep up the very Good work! :-)",
I wish I could pay them to get my credits instead of regular college. They make learning so much fun and so easy!,
It is very handy. I had a f in math now i have a b. It is also handy when i dont have my laptop,
"I'm a student here and I'm searching for apps that can help me with my studies especially in Physics and Chemistry. Then, I found this amazing app. It's very useful to me and I tend to understand more of this than in the books.",
"No registration, excellent ui, all the content of the web. Didn't expected. 5 STARS",
Helped me alot in my portion which I missed out in school.,
"This is a great project. It helped me very much to make concepts clear. But in my mobile version of this app , I can't access to some videos and specially I don't have access to computer programming...",
"I use this app in the Summer to keep learning! Love it, but can be slow at some times",
I signed in but it doesn't show my progress and nowhere can I find what I am looking for. It is showing me all other search results except the one I asked for! Website is way better.,
"This is a great starter bit I'd like to see more humanities, social sciences, and test prep. I'm pre-law and would love an LSAT section as well as sections on ethics, historic law, classic lit, international relations, and sociology.",
"I wanted to get ahead of my other classmates over the summer. Khan helped me learn so much about geometry and it's easy to understand. I have no complaints, but I have a request. Can we get an option where we can ask questions in case we have any? Thank you!",
Wonderful app. The only thing missing is the ability to Chromecast to a TV or projector. Should be easy with the YouTube backend!,
I tried this out for my math subject and it worked wonders! It helped me very much. Now I could slack off in math class and study math in my house and still pass the exam 😂.  THANKYOU!,
I did not need to my the graphic cds saving me a lot of money.,
Great app but the progress ive made on the browser version is not reflected in the app. The reason i got the app was to continue my progress but now ill just go back to my broswer.,
Good learning app to enhance your knowledge in all fields..,
This is very superb app for those how want to know about the basics concepts and brief content thanks@Khan's academy,
I can't believe this app exists. You can access so much knowledge over a variety of different subjects; and its all free! Its awesome. It makes self-teach and class preparation so much easier and expedites the process aswell!,
I like the way Sal shows the information and writes all the names and draws diagrams to make it easier to understand,
I started on basic math and have now pass my Cal III class. On the diffeq!,
"Learning every thing as im learning in school,great work",
There are good explanations for everything. This is better than Edx app.,
Awesome love khan academy very helpful n i am horrible in math.check out his youtube channel so helpful!!!,
My internet is perfect and YouTube and Netflix don't buffer on my internet and this app does,
"I really wanna thanks to Sal for helping millions like me, during self-study the videos help a lot !! The app is also good and works properly.",
This app has saved my butt several times from failing an exam,
To download for offline one have to actually play a video first,
The app is good but while i am opening offline videos the is closing itself and video is not playing.,
I can't believe  this app is free honestly this is the best app and really motivates me to do better in school thank you so much Khan academy you are the best,
"I mean when this much education is for free, who wouldn't take advantage of that? I use this for my SAT prep and let me tell you that it has really help me a lot and I hope I'm actually prepare. Thank you so much!!!",
It's already summer and I'm going to high school and I didn't understand math the entire but can academy help Me with understanding something that I couldn't understand within a entire school year,
I'ts crashes when I open videos,
Why we cannot save the videos on sd card,
This app is great for revision in many subjects! I can't fault it ❤,
I can't find anthing but tutorials. Where are the practice questions? I will gladly give a better rating if I could find this useful.,
Best app for learners. Love it!,
Great app but need some improvement in video animations and numericala problems,
Its helpful so I'll be smarter in 3 grade and I get more knowledge,
"Hats off, Sir.",
You can learn what you want and discuss your questions with others like us,
"This app solved tons of doubts I've been having for the past few 
months..... I love this app. It's awesome 😍😍😍",
This app helped me learn Calculus! They explain the concepts very well (much better than my professors). You really should check it out!,
"Math, physics, chemistry, biology, programming this app has everything and very well explained.",
The app's great but it would be nice to be able to choose video quality for offline especially.,
It's good and it's free . Amazing how you people do it .  But I want more courses to be added.,
I really needed to learn math and this is helping so much!! I really appreciate this app and that it's free. Thank you so much.,
I swear this is awesome app to learn tnx Khan academy,
This is good if you are home schooled this will maybe help alot,
Useless for me(an engineering student) . But good app,
Thank you Khan academy I learnt many things,

It eats a lot of mb s... The language of the instructor is not clear and loud; that's dull.,
"Until the latest update, now I go in to the app, and it kicks me out! Grr! I'm so upset.😒",
I usually use it on my laptop but now I can use my account anywhere!,
God bless that peron who want make the people aware by education .,

It has all the units but it dosent explain well,
The offline video save feature is great btw,
Clearly explained by salman khan,
It really made concepts easier to understand,
"UI is clunky, videos are pretty bad",
This app helps us to gain a lot of knowledge so please download this app,

Please add a section which allows us to learn about agriculture,
It helps me alot,
Please add chromecast support!,
We would like to be your volunteers please accept our request,
Very great study app useful for my physics,
Missing if we compare it with iit course,
Every time I play Khan  Academy at school it inspired me,
My teacher told me about this and I've use it on google,
"Today when I opened this app for studying physics, physics & chemistry both were vanished from the science menu....😑😠😠",
App should be able to detect external SD card and download the content there.,
It crashes everytime I open it.,
My life changing app          u can learn any thing from this app....,
"Great work by u...but please include solutions, especially the topic vapour pressure in chemistry",
"How selfless could you be? I mean creating such a great FREE service? Very humble, kind and Generous. Thank you Sal and Khan team!",
"Hi, the Chemistry and Physics Icons are no longer available on my app. This just screwed my study plan. Fix it urgently, please!",
Nice app which is easy to use,
I CAN'T DOWNLOAD VIDEOS AND WATCH IT ONLINE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!,
Can't get any better,
"Great for homeschooling.  Also, enjoyable",
I cant believe sth like this is available for free. Cant put my phone down,
I have used many study apps like byju  but none of them was Iike this one,
This is what I was searching.,
"Awesome very user friendly, glitch free app",
If i don't give 5 stars then it will be disgrace for such initiatives... thank you khan academy... you saved my macroeconomics paper ... I also follow you on youtube ...,
Love you guys. Please make articles available offline.,
So helpful to have Khan Academy in your mobile 😊,

Awesomeee,
Jabardast,
Wow,
"I'm a user of Khan Academy for a year, and I love it. But the app never plays the videos properly (always showing error, try again message). If my issue was fixed, I would rate 5 stars, 'cause Khan Academy is my best source for learning.",
"some videos can't be saved to be viewed offline. one of the examples is ""centripetal force problem solving"" - i already undownloaded and removed it for a few times but still error. i really appreciate your works with the app and the lessons, but just please fix that.",
i love the videos... but hopefully u can improve the way you explain things.. ur explanation is fine.. .. its just becoz i hv a problem with english.. if u go a bit slower.. then ill probably be able to understand the entire video,
I really can't appreciate this Step of yours in mere words. This Application has almost everything as your description says. I really thought it would be like today's educational Apps. Use for 30 days and then subscribe. But no. This thing really is a McPerfect thingie. Thanks a lot for your Unconditional volunteering in promoting education among humans.,
"Thanks to Khan academy learning hasn't been easier, great and simple lectures that makes understanding easier better than my college teachers.",
I like it and it teaches me Maths and Science using English. I wish I would like to go to an international school next time.😊,
I love to give 5 star to this app but I am having trouble with sign up even I complained many times . The e-mail that I should receive on my e-mail id didn't receive at all.,
"A revolution in education; those that want to learn can, wind th out the financial barriers.",
It is perfect for...everyone I mean it has all the grades it helps it rely does,
Thank you so much for making Khan Academy. The videos are very easy to understand that helped me to catch up in class especially our teacher is a bit bad at teaching mathematics. This made me love math again!,
The app will not let me sign in using the same information sign in on my computer with. Verified login and password several times on different devices yet it still does not work on the app.,
"To the khan academy team, I love the app and I love the content. I'd like to see a feature where videos may be cast to Google's chrome cast with future updates",
"What can I say,  It is an wonderful site for learners,I am practicing maths but now it fulfilling what I was missed in my child hood in a remote village location, l can say outstanding.",
"AS far as the app is concern is it pretty good but it lacked in the number of topics like you can add java,c++",
Used 343mb of data in one week and I haven't opened the app once.,
I guess 5 star is enough to show my gratitude. Everything or almost everything is free with Khan Academy. Learning for free. I just want to suggest something please make the articles downloadable so that I can open it offline.,
I love Khan Academys app but the videos load up very slow.,
"I hope the Khan Academy is succesful, because they deserve to be. It's a pity that, according to my app manager, the app uses over 16% of my battery even when it's not being used. Like a car that uses fuel when it's parked up.",
Amazing app. Easy 5 star. I love that you can download videos to watch offline. A recommendation I have is to allow users to save and download entire series of videos at a time instead of them having to go through vidoes one a time to save them to the user's list.,
"The UI is great, as well with functionality. However, a major issue is that you cannot complete or answer any practice questions for the SAT portion.",
"Here in my part of the world, bandwidth is extremely expensive. Option to download videos for later viewing on encountering free WiFi will save lots of costs.",
"Best app ever for those who are studying or just curious about histort, art, music, math, etc. You can also watch it offline.",
An hudge hug to the founder of this app cause it is pretty useful! Science tutorial are so well and every thing work perfectly! :),
Thank you for making such a helpful app. I also use the online version thank you very much mr. Salman khan for making such a helpful app and website. God bless you...,
"I'd love to be able to do the exercises on my smartphone, rather than use my desktop everytime. It would be great if you could look into that.",
There are limited courses & I find none of them is worth spending time,
Love how easy they make learning new topics. There are always new subjects. I wish you would add computer coding and networking. Because of this app I have been able to maintain straight A's through my first year and a half of college so far. Thank you Khan Academy!!! This is my #1 go to app for educational purposes.,
I would love to be able to do the practice questions on the app like I can on the website.  I would rather just use the website at this point because watching the videos is only half of the learning process.  I need to practice and complete the Missions as well.  P.s.  I love Khan Academy!,
It would be great if i could take the practice tests .. I mean continue my missions or start a new mission in the app.. Rather going to the webpage.,
"I don't understand anything, the way you teach, personally is bad",
"It's a great source of knowledge for  everyone, from kids to professionals, I've enjoyed every lection they have, but I really miss some good themes like statistics, econometric, computer science, an so on. Keep the good work!",
"Sal, Khan Academy, you guys are great! I so much appreciate the work going on behind the screen. I have learnt a lot...I mean I'm being educated by you, and am still learning. I love the app: I can study on my device anytime, anywhere; I can download video for offline purposes. it's awesome. Thank you! And Sal, please can you make it possible for one to download each lessons articles via the app, like the videos which can be downloaded for offline uses? Pleaseee! Osita",
"It's really good, but it's not as good as the desktop one.",
This is the best free app for study and for doubt clearance.,
"I and my younger brother both use khan academy for learning and love it a lot so please add option for multiple accounts, also please add math skill practice mode",
This works better than a paid tutor. Videos r fun and easy to understand.,
Wonderful app..made me truly enlightened one about mathematics and physics . Just love it !,
"Pls help, i really want to save videos is high quality but can't",
This app has helped me understand difficult concepts in my classes as well as allowed me to score higher on my compass test so now I can test into Calc versus being placed in algebra or trig.,
This app is really awesome!! It helps me a lot .! I learned a lot and I like how every videos are made pretty clear and step by step procedures are also included..  Very organized ! Your doing great ! Keep up the good work ... BTW... I suggest that you should put a fun games and worksheet in every lesson so we can enjoy learning ! But anyway its still an amazing app I've ever downloaded !,
"It's really an awesome app. Any confusion, just open the app, search, learn and done. Great to handle and really very great app. I loved it",
"Khan academy is doing such a great work, keep it up guys.",
"It is very helpful, easy to understand and can be downloaded for offline viewing.",
Thank you very much for translate this awesome application to the Spanish 🙆💙,
"Excellent app, needs the ability to download all videos in a series at once!",
Nice App + Khan Academy Rocks every Times :D,
A really great app for learning almost everything....simple and great explanations for everything....highly recommend it,
It would really help if we could connect to our CollegeBoard account and do our personalized practices on the app!,
I love this app but I would suggest If u add Exercises in the app as on the website.,
This is great for my YouTube channel Great for schools and rated for everyone!,
I can learn anything here and now im prepared to go to school everyday thanks to you guys,
A  big thank u to the team behind this informative portal,
It sould be like the khan acadamy on the compiter with work,

Just got it and I'm already in love with it!,
The official KHAN ACADEMY APP ON ANDROID IS FINALLY HERE AFTER WAITED FOR SO LONG YES YES YES!!!!,
Sal and co I have been using this since I was in 7th and I gave been reaping benefits of Khan Academy. Thank you for developing such a brilliant app.,
It is the best tool to help students to get educated!,
"This app helps me a lot. I'm struggling with my studies due to a very over-the-top busy daily schedule, but I'm doing okay now, :)",
No words to explain its importance.............,
The new UI & offline video downloads awesome!!,
It is super easy to use I LOVE it,
It open a new door in my life,
Its great. Study whatever wherever.,
None of the videos load.,
Help me a lot,
Learn something new everyday,
We can learn easily,
Masha Allah very helpful app,
Easy to use and explanations are awesome.,
Too good.....really helped me and will in future...thank u guys,
No objectives to do just videos,
I wish there were more computer science courses available,
Never knew something like this existed,
One of the best,
Very descriptive and good videos.,
Strange that I can't play and listen in the background? I was hoping I could study while i worked..,
Amazing for mi keds,
Android 6 0 1 Marshmallow,
Loving it so far.,
If you could add some more topics in the science section... The previous topics seem very reserved...,
Very useful... must download who are looking for knowledge.,
Very helpful!,
I've improved a lot.,
Nothing for upsc preparation :(,
So far so good...,
Why I can not download videos to my offline list?!,
:),
This is just magnificent.,
This app is awesome.,
How do I access practice problems after video?,
A best educator app..........,

Superb app,
Sal Khan - 10/10,
Awesome,
Awesome,
Bakwas,
I want to thank this program and all the people that put this together. It is a blessing to have information and education in this fashion. I do not leave it up to the public schools to prepare my son for life.  I am just very grateful as a single parent that there is no excuse to excel in education with all this free information that the world shares nowadays. Thank you very much.,
"This app is amazing. The creators of Khan Academy had taken personal the wish for knowledge to be spread and taught in an amazingly descriptive and coherent way. Whatever you want to learn or improve on is on the tips of your hands. The app unfortunately does not offer the practice modules so desperately required that are available on the website. This makes the app more like a YouTube platform of the program and lacks a little of the entire learning experience  fix that, and you have a 5/5.",
"Nice educational app that teaches people things they didn't know before hand or needed more information on. Nice ui and theme, although it would be nice to be able to make the videos moved to the SD card, but I wouldnt take a star off for that ***note to editors, on ""chemistry"" page, the page doesn't scroll down enough. extend the limit ***",
"Sadly, do I have extreme problems with the search option. I have to tap in the search line several times (up to 20 times) in order for the app to recognize the tap. The problem gets even worse after I entered the search subject and tap the search button. This glitch is that bad that sometimes it won't search it at all! As soon as this problem is solved I will rate the app 5 stars.",
"I like Khan Academy so much because it helps me a lot. But in Android version I cannot see the subtitle for the videos (I'm not an English native speaker so sometimes I need subtitles). I know it provides the transcripts, but I don't like it because I can't see the video AND the transcript at the same time. Please make the subs appear below the video, just like the website version.",
"i want to get way ahead of all the students in my school, I would love to see support for tracking each lesson you learn, just so i can learn the whole app without confusing myself on having to do sompthing i already did.",
"This app has helped me exel in math. A region that I have had alot of trouble with in the past. But thanks to this application, I went from a 65% average in math to an 80% average. It may not be the best average to have, but its a great improvement.",
The videos are well explained and taught out. The guy even explains it better than some of my teachers in my school. And the fact it's free shocks me. Normally in this standard of teaching shouldn't be but it is! I'm not saying education shouldn't be free but since we are in a generation where we do pay a lot for our education it's just nuts. People millions for tutoring and there's just this app where you can use it anytime and anywhere. (Even though that sounds kind of gimmicky.) Just get the app!,
"I really enjoy khan academy, but the app is really bad. I am signed in with my account, but I can't get to practice or even see what I have recently done. If you need in on your mobile device, just go to the website.",
Great work: I am a nursing student.  I wanted to get prepare for my nursing practice license exam.  But I couldn't find any suitable course for me.  But I found all the study materials in KHAN Academy.  The library is quite rich & understandable. And everything is FREE.  Thanks to Khan Academy.,
This game is wonderful. Here you can learn more then things even if you have classes or even it's vacation. This made me more genius.,
"I love using Khan Academy on the PC, but the mobile app only has the videos, no practice. That's really disappointing to me, if they'd make it have more of the features of the website, I'd give a much higher rating.",
Mr. Salman Khan is doing an excellent job by making the materials free to access. Certainly the best things in life doesn't come with a price tag. They are priceless.,
I don't like that it's just videos I wish they could regularly test me on math questions.,
Khan Academy on a computer you can actually learn something but this. It's just showing you stupid videos not helpful,
I'm in algebra 2 and I had an F all year until I got this app.It has saved me on some very important tests,
The app closes down when I start to watch the videos. So I don't get to learn anything basically.,
"The app is really great and easily accessible but please add the math missions too, and hopefully someday science missions too 😃",
But this app lacks the new offline feature which can be much helpful to the poor students who cannot afford to stay under WiFi range for much time.... The new offline feature should be added,
Thanks for the free knowledge. You guys have helped millions of people. Just thanks for changing the way I think about life.,
Huehue this sucks,
Khan academy is the place you can learn many things specially maths and in a very good manner without being shy of the tag that you don't know this simple  thing so proud of you sal and of all khan academy family ......thank you so much,
The ui is okay but the size of the app is a bit on the bigger side - You guys should really reduce the size of the app.  Other than that this app has no big  problems . You guys should really add some more content like programming and stuff like that . Keep up the good work and I hope that you guys will reduce the size of the app in the next update.,
I have been learning from academy using my laptop and now I tried the app to keep learning. I find the app is seamless and provides birds eye of the topics with easy navigation. I like it every much.,
This has helped me beyond belief. Much thanks to Kahn and his team :),
"I love Khan Academy, and I give a thousand thanks to Mr. Khan for the creation. I downloaded the app because it's difficult to see everything when I use my mobile browser. However, there are no exercises! I'm deleting the app because I don't learn much just watching videos. Boo.",
It's great to see that videos run in even low internet speed.It would be great if courses like computer programming and cs are included in the app.,
My daughter has learn so many things that she is getting good  grades.,
I found this app on grade 8 because I though that I was to good at math and science. So now I'm doing much higher levels of math to support my acual need,
"1 There should be an option of video quality for downloading.                                                  2 There should be option to batch download tutorials.                                                              However, as you know, it's a great app.",
I always waited for an official app by the khan academy for android.....looks like the waits over. I just wanted to say that it would be nice if in the informational pages the reading text size would be adjustable.,
"Found this app after seeking help in science and math, no other app or site can offer this. Using this has increased my understanding and preparing me for my university course. Well done.",
I really love this app. It's the greatest app I've ever had and I'm really grateful that you put this app for free I would have never had studied with without this app because all of the apps that I've ever had was to pay money and thank you for making this a free app and it's really helpful in my life it makes me study and thank you very much for doing this I love this app and love the company thank you very much have a nice day.!!!!!!!!!!!,
"I have just started with a course for fun, and the presentation is awesome. I wish there was a simple way to download the complete course at once for offline viewing. Thank you",
There's need to be more options in the tablet version. I can barely read without having headaches because of the small font used in this app.,
Khan Academy enables you to begin your journey into mastering any subject material.  It is literally the best free learning tool in existence.,
"Thanks khan :D this app was really helpful when i want to learn something. But there was no sub in the video, it just transcript which separated from the video :(. I hope when i'm watching there'll be subtitle in there",
"(Pls fix it, i really like the app but when i press the back button in the top left of the screen  it often wont work) and when i press the back button in my device it automatically go home...  Pls fix it",
"Thank you so much. I am an straight A student, but my weakest subject in math is fractions and thanks to this app, I am more confident about it! Thank you so much for the app. The videos aren't confusing and I understand math much better! 🙌",
"This help me to understand mah learning desire...yup not from english background so its bit hard to understand because of my language language problem...but but but...its totally useful...language is not much matter...hats off your work...i wish more nd more data, information,videos u upload so we can learn through it!....thanx a Lot",
"Could be improved with the ability to organize offline videos with folders. Further improvement could be achieved by adding a task manager, timeline or the ability to create a syllabus to offer greater structure and direction for a more personalized learning experience.",
"It is such a good place to go to study and is available for students to use. Great app just used it, good for studying gateway material",
This review is only about the app not khan academy.  Khan academy is great but the videos aren't playing well. They stream in HD only doesn't work on slow connection.,
It 's good application for theme based studies and it make lot of changes in my life my attitude towards physics and mathematics becomes more deeper,
Thought it would be like the website where there is questions it asks you.,
The app makes it even easier to connect and learn. The breadth of knowledge is mind boggling.,
This app help me tutor myself in school and gives me hope of going through high school more easier.,
If there was -10000000000 stars I would have given you that. Only shows videos when I search. Fix this and I will give you 5 stars,
Reaaaaaallllllllly helps me inprove my grades i went up in math alot!,
"Great app. It's very big help to all peoples, specially for students they can learn anything at anytime for free. Keep It Up Khan Sahab and Stay Blessed",
The videos need high speed internet connection and they are no available pdf files I mean this app isn't useful to you if you don't have high speed internet connection,
I am using this app from 2 weeks and I found it really very helpful. Video lessons are good and even sound quality is excellent. Clear voice. Before downloading it I had downloaded many education apps but I found this the most helpful. Till now I am satisfied.,
Very useful in your studies and real life problems,
Amazing work done by Khan Academy. Really interesting educational app ever made. Thank you,
"There are no exercises! There were exercises before, but now I can only watch videos. Please bring back the exercises.",
"Using it to help me study for my mcat along with my biochemistry course. I especially love that you can predownload and store videos without using up all your data, very useful! 👍",
I use my login and it says invalid password,
This is cool. One comment : your videos are extremely helpful but they are super long! Please make them shorter and straight to the point otherwise flawless,
This app had opened my mind to think more indepth about the world I live in and see it all from an angle I would never have imagined. 👌,
"I'm looking for some micro controller and arduino tutorials, also a lot of material isn't available in the app, whether they are available at your website... So, do use some cloud storage and provide me with some statistics and elctronics related topics, thank you so much.",
I am suprised! This really helped me! Now I can focus for my exam!,
But website is better than app. I can't find any problems to solve like on the website.,
Using this app to study for my placement test in college and I'm learning things I forgot all over again,
I really needed this to understand linear algebra. College is weird lol.,
I've recommended this to sereval people.  A great way to pass time for all ages.,
I am learning so much in my spare time instead of watching YouTube. I recommend this to everyone.,
This app is what I have been looking for. I advise anyone with a smart phone to take advantage of this free app!!!,
It would be perfect if you'd put in exercises and more options for settings like offline video quality and subtitles. Otherwise L&R!,
"after update diesnot play any video ,, i am frustated after update",
I love this a lot but please make it so that the info is in word form because videos don't always load. Make it so that you can read the information without wi-fi.,
"There were a few apps that tied me to the ipad. This was one of them. Now that it's done right on android, I'm free!",
Sal Khan is a genius and helps those that are math illiterate to understand math!,
"I have never been able to excel so far in math and physics till i gazed upon this app, really helped me in my studies in transition to university",
Love this app!! Only issue is I can't share on fb and can't store on my device. Can you tell me how I can share some of the videos?,
I really respect what you are doing Mr kham and I am a big fan of your work.,
This is a great website and great app. Thanks for making it free. I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge!,
"This is the best app of knowledge,i would like to improve it more. Thanks",
The best app to learn and understand concepts and practice problems,
Covers almost everything under 10+2 syllabus. And that too for free. Worth it. Thank you Khan!,
"I love this app,,,very easy to conceptulize things.",
This is the best studying app I have ever encountered,
I would give it 5 stars if it had the practice mode and mastery challenges like the computer,
This app helped me increase my knowledge and succeed at furthering my education. Thank you,
"Can't believe it's taken me this long to find this app, it's so great",
This is the real reason I'm acing all my classes!,
This app is very useful for those who are thirsty for knowledge.,
Couldn't download videos. Please fix it.,
"Great UI, great content which makes it easy to learn. :)",
"As the title says, also please keep it free",
Videos exercises and text.. love it. Great study helper,
"I will giving 5, if they add subtitles on the fullscreen video",
"This app helped me a lot on tests, and helped me understand math better!",
Just download it and you'll understand why.,
Very helpful for students who wants to know more about this world,

"Intuitive app, easy to use.",
Great app ever! Thnx for this y'all :) I love Science I DO I DO I DO plus it's free make it super ultra mega great!1!!!!1,

Amezing,
The app is great overall but the quiz feature is missing. I really want the quiz feature.,
"I can only hear the audio. After i try to download it, it crashed.",
My teacher is hard to learn from but is not strict at all so I just use a chrome book laptop and headphones to learn instead. Best instructions in in the world. Could not be any better. I'm so overjoyed that it's free!,
The variable speed adjustments are what I've been waiting for!,
This app must have Chromecast support. It would be a 5 star app with it.,
A pleasure to learn and reacquaint myself with all subjects.,
Excellent resource for learning,
A must have app....,
Easy to learn,
"It happened that I came across the Khan Academy app at the time I was busy with both my Linear Algebra and Differential Equations modules. Almost everything was covered and I really appreciate the privilege to save those videos for offline viewing. I will take Ordinary Differential Equations and Advanced Calculus next term, my journey looks prosperous,  thanks, Team Khan Academy for such a ground breaking and philanthropy project.",
I love this app BUT IT HAS NO QUIZ FEATURE ON MOBLE 😭 seriously this app wOULD BE better if u guYS but a QUIZ feature on moble......PLEASE ALL IM ASKING IS FOR A PRATICE BUTTON LIKE WEBSITE ...i thought it was going to have the same features as website. ....but i guess not cuz it has no PRATICE BUTTON. ..however besides that its a great app just update soon with a practice button plzzzz,
"It would be better if you could do the math quizzes on the app, but it's great to have a kid watch the video on the phone while doing the quiz.",
"This use to be a good apps for learning etc. But then suddenly it's downloading 430 mb for something I don't know, wasting G my bandwidth and not asking for my permission first!!!  Even an update should've ask first whether I want to update or not! I'm uninstalling it right now. Too disappointing!!!",
Don't download more than 10 videos at a time it will crash. Reinstall was the only fix,
"A great app, helps me when I'm stuck on a subject in school. Also, to bring some ‘not necessary subjects’ into my homeschooling curriculum!",
"I have been using Khan Academy for several months now. I plan on going back to college here in about a year, and this has been a great service to getting back up to speed on both mathematics and science. This is a great app complimenting the main website.",
Plz help. But cant give less than 3 stars.,
Generally I don't like to write review but after  2 -3 year I am writing this due to your efforts for the students to study better and it is helping me as well as my friends to study well .THANK YOU SO MUCH .....☺And always help students in the same way .Superb APP as well as standard contents as well as downloading feature available..😁,
Loved all the content and lessons.  The download options let's me learn anywhere I go..  I wish the list options allow to make folders so it is organised more easily.,
"It would be great to have little review quizzes here and there, to test ones progress",
Things are made easy and interesting. Videos are way too use full. Thank you,
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HELPS  US TO LEARN SOME THING NEW,
"The app is rudimentary, but the real website is awesome... Especially sal Khan's efforts to provide education for free, that is something that really blessed people can do... Bravo sal Khan...",
Its easy to use and you can take much benefit from it (y) really liked it.,
"It's great that Khan Academy has an app for andriods now. However, it would be great if the app had interactive exercises like the computer version. I personally find it helpful when learning subjects like math and chemistry.",
Khan Academy is the only reason I am passing my calc 2 class right now :),
There aren't any botananical or horticultural courses to choose from. How about some material for the aspiring plant scientist?,
"Always followed your videos on YouTube but now i can follow you any time using tab this is great !! Please try to add more medicinal videos like microbiology, toxicology, etc",
The best part of the app is that it contains a huge amount of topics and no ads. Very grateful...,
I love the way it helps us learn. You'll definitely become smarter after this.,
It is the best learning app and it is absolutely free! !! Other learning app take some money but this is absolutely free useful for all classes and also for college students,
I have learned so much from this app and it keeps me informed. Thank you!,
Organic chemistry couldn't be more easy to learn,
Allows you to learn without having to spend hours researching.,
App is so AWESOME.... I feel like tat I can learn anything.....best thing is tat its free..... for me its best app for educational purpose,
"Could you guys add the ability to download a set of videos for a topic, rather than only allowing for videos to be downloaded one at a time? That would really make it easier for people that want a whole set of videos for the topic. Thanks for your time.",
"I'm currently an economics student, really helpfull",
"I would be better if I can also do exercises like ,I do in website",
Very simplified which makes it easy  to grasp new techniques.,
I'm finally understanding math and actually love doing it now! Miraculous!,
I dont find much ncert syllabus so not helping much please fix it or else will have to delete account and uninstall it,
Excellent apps you can find anything that you need in Khan Academy.,
It helped me study thoroughly,
Awesome to study many unknown subjects by video,
Doesn't teach you enoagh,
Perfect app for learning different things..,
But sir how I can change language help me please.,
Great app indeed!👍,
The best thing out there.,
I just love this app.Its dam helpful😊,
It helps me out a lot when it comes to topics I did not fully grasp when it was being explained by instructors,
Thank u khan,
God bless you for your efforts khan academy 😊,
One word Great.....quality content and a simple yet good app. Really loving it..,
I LOVE THIS APP,
Good to have an unbiased faculty always in pocket!!!!,
I should be able to monitor my child's progress,
Its everything i wanted download it.,
Thankyou,
I love it a useful app for learner.,
It's better than byju's learning app,
It helps my kids learn,
Thanks alot for a wonderful resource... 😊,
This is an awsm app for study !,
can't believe it's free,
A must have app for anyone.,
It's very good,
Please add the all the parts of the subjects which are only in the website not in the app...... Please👍👍👍👍,
Please answer me that is this content free for lifelong... Or should we have  to pay after 5 or 6 months.!!! The hand writing written on digital board might need a little optimization!!,
Great stuff. Keeps me sharp. Good work :),
Very helpful!,
"Amazing, Interesting!",
Boooo,
Very good app,
Always love it.,
Useful & informative,
Good to learn.,
How does a coach view their students and stats on the app?,
Nice app,
Superb app,
Its nice,
Great app,
Owsome,
Super,
"Need to brush up on something or want to learn something new, this is a great place to start especially since its free.  My only suggestion is add practice problems that are solvable by the user.  Maybe do ""problems of the day"" for certain categories and implement a forum for access to help or debates amongst the users.",
"After looking over the app briefly, I do like it, but it's not a complete alternative to the website. What I find lacking is a progress tracker, so I can see what categories I have already completed through mastery exams. However, this looks great for on-the-go studying, and seems very helpful to pick up a video that is sorely needed.",
This service has allowed me to prepare for the CHSPE like nothing else. There is finally hope for my early acceptance to college. I love the teachers. I love how easy it is to save and play lessons. The only problem I have with the app is it's sort of choppy. (Khan itself is totally worthy of a 5-star rating),
"I love learning, and going ahead in class, so this is an incredible way to extend my learning and increase my love of math, science, history and everything else.  Really recommended for anyone.  Also great for preparing for an upcoming test or just for fun.  Even if you don't like math or what ever, it will introduce a new way to look at math, or any subject you don't like.  BTW the computer version of this includes coding and test prep so step right in and get started.",
You would think with technology playing such a huge part of this service that which makes it would be here. But no. Nothing on learning to code in this or that. NOTHING. In a way I'm not surprised. Just disappointed. All this talk about people should be able to learn this or learn that. I guess he meant only if it's certain things.,
"The discourses given in this app,  however numerous, are given with the an insurmountable amount of condescension.  I appreciate the minimal and therefore arbitrary explanations,  indicted in the most condescending tones.  However,  given the entitlement of 'academy', I had expected thorough courses with delineating subject criteria.  The impunity of this app is only meted by the target market, who cannot peel open a textbook and perhaps the intended age-range. I applaud the voluntary effort placed into it",
"I LOVE Khan Academy, and even more so, I love that it's completely free. My only problem with the app is that you can't really practice the skills you learn within the app like you can on the website. That's just me nitpicking though :)",
"There is a wealth of amazing content, I've been listening to the finance section for hours and still have plenty to go. The only thing I feel is lacking is  some equations at the end that solidify the ideas discussed in previous videos. On the user experience side, I really want an easy way to mass download and remove videos. Since I use it on the subway I need to download videos beforehand while on WiFi and having to do 5 or 6 pressed per video is really annoying.",
"I started using the website a few years ago, and I absolutely loved it. It actually helped me pass my GED test, because Sal's videos are so much easier to understand than the textbooks they gave me. So, naturally, I was very excited when I saw that there was an app! But then I was a bit disappointed. The videos are there, but none of the exercises are. Half of the fun and effectiveness of the website comes from the exercises. Are there any plans to add them?",
"The team behind and Mr Khan has done an amazing job, by providing this medium to learn and to expand our horizon of knowledge. They have huge catalog for all ages. But it lacks an essential functions to control quality of videos, it would be better if the team would incorporate the easy changing of video quality, maybe by using Youtube APIs. It would be great as I and I am sure several othrs do wish to watch in HQ as it consumes data and for others might not load... Please work to provide this feature.",
"This is just the video portion of Kahn Academy. I use the iPad app and the website and they have many, many, many, more features. It actually frustates me because I thought it would at least include the testing portion of the classes. I do have to say that it runs very smoothly and works the way it was designed.",
Some videos are playing but other are not. Very less cources available in app as compare to website.  I love the website but app is such a disappointment.,
"This ap is good but just had the videos and the reading.  If you actually want to do the work yourself, you will need to log in on their website.  It would be awesome if you could do the same thru the ap that you can online though.",
"Khan Academy is awesome. It has brought a revolution in the field of learning and education. I love it, this app is almost perfect. Please add an option to change the video quality and to save videos to the micro sd.",
Thanks Khan but the app is lacking. I want my kids to use TABLETS tondo the questions and exercises. Thanks.,
"The app is great! The concept of free education for anyone that can access it, is even better. Khan is the best teacher you'll ever get the honour of experiencing. Would let him have my children any day.",
"Thanks for clearing my doubts for my exams, and regular study. I don't even have to go to extra classes, _Thanks Khan Academy_.",
perfect app for my kids to learn. Thank you Khan Academy,
"It is not that good. You cannot even do real work, all you do is watch videos",
"So this app can be helpful, but ive noticed that all of the videos aren't on the app. I have the app so I don't have to lug if pc everywhere, but i guess i have to until all of the videos online are in the app. Still good for what it does have tho",
"I'm so disappointed!  I had heard such good-no-great things about it.  Well my first three searches, no matter how many ways I restated the question, all got no, zero results.  I asked what is nuclear power, radioactivity, and what is a dimension.  Maybe not simple, but I think the're all reasonable requests..  Those of you/us that were hoping for college classes in an app, well I suppose we'll have to keep on waiting.....",
i really like the app but i would like a written only portion of the subjects and tests to see our progress. other than that its great.,
"I love how I can brush up on anything from math to arts,  but I wish there were language options as well",
"Missed out on learning math properly, bad teachers can't wait to learn more.",
It got explanation to all my academic problems.....i am blessed to come across it,
App opens fine but upon trying to view any video lesson it closes immediately.,
I'm trying to learn chemistry and various materials engineering principles in order to gain financial independence through the manufacturing of highly pure narcotics.  This could never be possible without Khan Academy.,
Never seen such a handy app before. Here You could find anything you ever gonna need. Truely awesome,
Kind of sucks that you have to use a computer for the math problems,
Helps me alot in math but could you put sience into grades.,
"Only watched a couple of the the videos. An glanced at the app, cause I already know this going to get addictive very fast. Which in this case is a good thing. Being addicted to learning is never a bad thing.",
I just got this app yesterday and already it's been useful for a lot of things especially if your a type of person that likes to read and learn new things here and there. . 😊,
I have a lg phone I tried to do the practice but it had no button that says practice fix it & i will give it five star,
The quality and quantity of work put forth by all the amazing folk at Khan Academy deserves a whole lot of praise. Thank you and keep up the good work.,
There are no math exercises alongside the videos . please add  features for the same,
When I added a video for downloading and clicked on download button it progressed for 10 sec and then stopped. It also stops downloading video when I put it in background . I have also uninstalled and reinstalled it but this problem still persist. I have also updated it but no good for me. Please solve it .,
Suggestion:You could add some more videos about coding and some complex particle physics/ quantum mechanics.,
"This app is realy perfect I Like it , It Helps Me in Learning More About Maths & Science ❤",
"If you need a refresher course, or you just don't know and your child needs help this is a fast, simple and easy way to get what your looking for.",
"Definitely one of the top educational app if not the best in my opinion. It's so nice that you can call me ""a Khan academy addict"". Thanks a lot!",
"Despite having all good stuff and amazing knowledge, they are all for free. Thanks alot! Anyone who wanna learn ANYTHING, just download the app, i am so thankful for u Khan academy, its schools for free !",
Thank you so much for providing a free learning app that has helped me study up for the COMPASS exam. And this app will continue to be useful for years to come. Learning never goes out of style. Thank you so much for making this app.,
Tons of information on a bunch of different topics. Good to kill some time and gain some knowledge! Hoping it will help my trivia game. And it's free. Can't beat that.,
App crashes every time I load a subject.,
"Love it. But I would like more articles and subjects added, then 5 stars all the way.",
"I REALLY TRULY APPRECIATE THIS VERY USEFUL, UNIQUE AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT APP. THANKS.",
"KhanAcademy help me to understand many topics like math, calculus, computing, statistics and many others. The best part, it's totally free... I love it!",
Consumed 4 MB of my data without me even using the app.,
It is only articles and videos and does not have the math problems that are online. I like online better than this app.,
"Been using Khan Academy for years now. Glad to see there is an App now. Only critique is that it would be nice to have the exercises, but I realize that is probably challenging to program for mobile.",
I have a lot of trouble with math and now I can finally learn on my own without the pressure of rude teachers who barley teach us,
Any student who don't have this app in his/ her mobile or tablet is idiot.,
This app is way better than I imagined. I can get an explanation for any subject from math to biology.,
This application is the best education I have seen every! Easy and smooth information to catch. I recommend for everyone. It helps me a lot because the simple and valuable way they use to teach.,
"Khan Academy's educational materials are high quality and thought-provoking.  In regard to this app, I was hoping for an Interactive UI but, instead, found only a table of contents to their video assets.",
"It sadly only has the videos. Not like the website where its, videos AND practices. it would be great if i could practice too, not just watch videos.",
Great NFP organization that made a great application for anyone who has the ability to get their hands on it.,
"Thanks to the very logical layout of the subjects and lessons - and the scrolling transcript for each one - you can study anywhere, with or without the sound up.  This app makes the Khan Academy better than ever!",
"Excellent app, Kudos to Sal and team, could be really helpful if they made available the PDFs associated with each lectures which we get to see in PC,. Because those give the complete picture. Thanks Khan Academy.",
I have loved Khan Academy even before I knew of this app. Well worth the download. Keep it up.,
Doesn't seen to have an option for saving downloads to th SD card. Why do I want to waste my precious space on learning;? The PDF is not fillform apparently. Killing trees is what tests are all about I guess.,
"Best school app I have ever found . Used it back in 2011 on computer.  Now on app, still amazing",
"I am using Khan academy website from last few years. Everytime I visit, I am filled with so many ideas. I am not sure why lessons don't have questions around it. Nevertheless I am able to achieve my goals. Thanks Sal Khan.",
This has helped me get caught back up and refreshed for going back to school after ten years! I tell everybody about it.,
Great cape chemistry unit 1 and 2 app. Had alot to help alot,
"Simply amazing! It's pretty awesome how high quality their content is and it's all free with no ads! I wish they had more on automotive topics, though.",
"Best education app I have ever seen,good job developers.",
"That being said, this is probably the most important app on a student's phone. Salman explains everything very well",
Do sent even let me  solve the actual problem,
Can the courses be grouped by grades? I don't see this when using ipad /android khan app.,
"What the title says, i want something to allow me to learn data structures and program architecture. This app doesn't even explain the basics.",
hey it doesnt show anything for 9 class,
My 3rd grader has a hard time retaining information and sometimes just grasping the formulas. This has helped her so many times to figure out her homework. Thank you!!,
This application was referred to me by my Primary Doctor.  I Love Learning Holy practices of Our Lord God Almighty Maker of The Heavens and The Earth !!!,
"The best educational app out there. If you want to learn, get it!",
I do this at school and we have to go up 5 percent each week so this helps each week,
I am deaf so I need CC for full understanding. Thank you.,
Learn absolutely anything whenever you have time.,
This a great app that anyone can use! I like it alot!,
No Javascript programing in it the only reason I use this is to learn js,
The best educational video tutorials on the internet! Thank you for the time and effort this surely takes. You have helped me understand concepts I couldn't quite grasp with a textbook alone. The app is also very well written. Thank you again.,
My sister even used it and she is in college she won't have graduated high school unless she used this app,
"Really impressed by this apps amount of content,  and the quality of the lessons.  I'll be using it regularly.",
This app has so much content only I would like a little bit more content,
"I'm a physics 12 student with a teacher that thinks we should ""know this stuff"" so he doesn't teach us. This has literally saved my grade!",
"Amazing! Great learning app filled with information on every topic, for everyone! So helpful and educational!",
Ideal for anyone trying to sneak into random STEM questions,
"It keeps my brain consistent, I love it!",
Salmon Khan and team are going to change world!,
Audio plays but video remains frozen on screen when playing videos. Nexus 6P,
Suitable for young kids nowadays since this generation learn things better visually,
Pls try this especially for 11 &12 class students,
Need to be able to practice problems using a scratch pad for 5 stars.,
Go for it you regret it love it,
Very good app ! Extremely helpful when you gotta learn something.,
Thank you for offering a positive way to learning new things.,
I use this in my class room my students love it and my daughter is improving alot I recommend it,
it's the best app/site ive ever seen and its helped me so much,
It was useful to me. Thanx for this app.highlight was that transcript which helped me to understand the video .   :),
Free. And loaded with correct information. Nothing beats it. Period.,
It's easy to watch & rewatch Sal's instructions at faster speeds.,
"Awesome for learning -Literally- about anything you want, when YOU want. My wife and I use it and encourage the kids to do so as well. YOU WILL LOVE IT !                                                                *Good way to keep kids interested in learning during school holidays/days off. I trade some game/leisure/ TV time with the  kids, for Khan Acadamy time.*       Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.     R.G.A.",
"Free education. Now there's a concept. Well designed, intuitive interface, excellent subject material, and free. 5 stars. Amazing app.",
It is really helpful in your studies.  There are even avatars . You could be one of them . Etc,
This app is a gift to mankind. Use it well. I certainly will. Thank you devs for this.,
"How is this a free resource?! It's far superior to my textbooks. This was a lifesaver for Advanced Pharm, and I plan to continue using Khan throughout my graduate studies! If only this was around while I was in nursing school....",
Man this app rocks.I got very good marks in my exams,
"Good for people who lost knowledge due to injury or drugs etc, or plain can't afford to go back to school!",
So my sister is in 2nd grade and she hardly knows math so when I seen this app I went this is boring and i t taught her everything now even 7th grade I am in 5th and I can't even do that thanks your the beste,
It made me feel so much smarter when it comes to my math skills!,
If I could I would give it 10 stars! Great content and design!,
U can improve your learning and just like a private teacher ...,
"I have been following Khan Academy since before they had a app... I love it !!!! It's very educational, they do a great job at explaining everything",
But don't have full lessons just one example in every video...,
LOVE THIS it help me with a lot of things I struggle with things in class,
This app helps dumb brain!,
Just needs Chromecast support.,
Very use full materials and vids. Perfect virtual learning,
"this would be perfect with chromecast support, still pretty amazing.",
In the palm of our hands,
Lov this im on in daily . thanks alot,
So easy to understand. This app is great!,
By far the best app for learning and keeping your lessons organised.,
It helps me with everything every time,
Worst,
It includes math literacy and more...,
This app has made significant improvement in the latest version.,
I could not find the 6th to 8th standards maths chapters !! Is something wrong with my device or the chapters have been removed ? Please help.,
But I like robomate more than this,
It helps me lots of time,
Love the app but I would love to see more computing related sets,
Thank you for helping man kind,

This app is everything you need to study from early age to competitive exam. Thank you salman Khan for creating such a wonderful app!!,
Very nice morsels of info without the fat!  But I'm really going to need this app to include support for chromecast STAT!,
This really works for me and it does help me a lot in solving quiz,
I think this app is going to be a good one but it you are going to make us  read highlighters,
I'm used to using the computer one but now... I'm in love! Its like where have you been all my life sort of thing.  But why is it videos only????? In want real practice.,
The best education website or app that can help on any device,
"I love it, it easy to use and it takes less time",
It helps u improve in any field u like,
A very useful app.Better than BYJU's paid app,
Half a gig in background data download... Unacceptable.,
I can learn everything.. Surely with you Khan Academy..Superb. Keep up the good work devs ☺☺☺,
Guaranteed to help you.,
Only video and no tests? No thanks! Why even bother making the app if it's not 100% functional?,
Mostly great though,
I thought something and came out something,
It helps you alote + it's free,
Really good content and nice app to have on phone for kids.,
I love it! This is a great learning tool.,

Good resource for schools.,
I can't believe this app is free. Great job :),
"No tests, No typed lessons and no comments",
Superb ... Loved them,
I just cant believe this is free!! Why??? This app is so good that I dont mind paying $10 for this!,
I recommend this for anyone.,
"Perfect, stimulating, smooth interface",
After 24 apps...this one won!,

"I can't begin to accurately describe how this has positively affected my ability to grasp math and other subjects in a way that is tailored to my style.  From conversations within modules, videos for lessons that I can watch over & over (and I do) any time to a easy to use format. I donate yearly to Kahn Academy & believe deeply in their mission.  Thanks to everyone who males this possible.",
"There nothing to be said about the videos as they are obviously really good. However, I wish the app was better and would give me more control over things. Like setting the quality of the video, book marking entire playlists/series that I am watching, landscape and portraits modes, etc",
"The app would be a lot more useful if it allowed for drawing functionality. On Note 5 for example, added functionality for split screen access would allow us to use a note_taking app alongside. As far as internal functionality goes , we could benefit from a ""scratchpad"" , similar to the one available via site.",
"DO NOT USE THIS APP IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR STATS!!! The app itself works well, but it regularly forgets you've already watched a movie and misses daily activity. 50 days into my 100 days of activity challenge it turns out it missed all activity of a day and now I have to start all over again. :-(",
"You can watch videos, and I think it's supposed to record your progress to your account. But there are no exercises, and the exercises are the best thing about Kahn academy. So if you don't care about tracking your video-watching stats, you might as well uninstall the app and just watch them on YouTube. It's about 60mb, which is a pretty big app to lug around in your storage, considering that it mainly just plays videos that you can easily steam elsewhere.",
"There was no way in the app to delete videos after i downloaded it.  Clicking the ""X"" button on the top riht corner DID NOT delete it.  I had to go to settings and clear app data.  Please add a way to delete videos completly.",
If you want to learn some basics this is good app for you it's really helping me for competitive exam purpose but the sound is really less in it have to change it,
I was in integrated math 1for two years. I thought I would never pass that class but then I found khan and it helped me a lot.,
"So good for revision, but could do with having the option of choosing a British syllabus, e.g. GCSE, to allow people like me to focus on specific exams and details, rather than just American ones. Thanks",
"Support them, they are teaching the world, the most poverty societies around the world for free.",
"It's great effort. However, it works on WiFi devices except my Android TV box. Please help / update.",
"please update more topics on grammar , and downloading showing error again and again , please correct it thank u.",
"I joined for the Excercises so that I could complete them on the Go and while traveling, brilliant app, but please add the excersises, should'nt be to hard since you do them from a mobile browser",
Couldn't be thankful enough for this initiative! But could you please consider the request? Really need it to decide whether there is a real need to update on my already overloaded entry-level tablet :D,
"Downloaded app an hour ago, only stopped to write this comment on how interesting and easy to follow it is.",
Long time lover and supporter of KA. Really happy to see you guys on Android. Keep up the great work.,
This is one of a kind that sharing it to the least fortunate people who cannot afford for tutorial.,
"Great app, although it needs to remember what videos you've completed. About half the time when a video is watched to the end it only gets marked as a partial play.",
"Sal Khan makes learning easy, my kids and I love the app and the website.",
"Downloading is showing  error again and again, otherwise a very gud app please fix this",
Only on computer. Would like to practice math on my note 4.,
This gives the best tutorials so that I successfully get Excellence in Exams. Probably the best app for Primary and Secondary Schools around the world!!!,
"Press sure I'd have Cs/Ds in math & science classes if it weren't for KA. Very helpful and incisive resources, and nice mobile app, too",
I like the app on my phone but I wish I could take these lessons on the TV. Please consider developing the app for Android TV use! Or at least enable casting.,
The Khan academy app needs the mission path so we know what's next to learn. We also need the lessons because videos just teach concepts and we need to practice. Updating this with lessons and mission paths would be great!,
thank you very much for this app . i coudnt imagine that someone is out there to help people to guide their study for free . KEEP IT UP!!,
"Easy to use and comprehensive, I have found it very useful. Thank you so much for the app!",
"This helps me and my son, the coding on here is fabulous ✌",
"It's nice and all, a lot of educational videos, but I just wish they test you on what you learned.",
Would be nice to have feature of auto play. (Make it an option please),
this is really helpful and I'm watching videos so that I'll be in advance once I get to the next grade :),
Its not letting me sign in to my profile,
We can learn any thing with this.           This is just amazing,
This app is Not working in my samsung galaxy grand.  But ur website is awesome. :),
I do it in my classroom and on my tablet. I'm trying to skip a grade and Khan Academy is helping.,
demy I am going to donate 1000 dollars keep it up,
I'm a kinesiology major and this has everything I need for all my exercise science classes,
"I have yet to explore, but so far, this app is the best app in the entire world. It covers so much! I am excited to learn... Wow, so amazing and inspiring.",
"It's great to have the videos, but what good are they if I can't check my understanding? You guys should add the exercise portion like you have on your website.",
It has more subjects than I first believed. Too bad it doesn't list them all.,
Well I had tons of troble with math intil khan we do it about 1-2 hours at school it helps alot if u have little kids have them start with early math it will put them far ahead,
I just  love it. Is real. Stay at your house studying everything in the world... I mean everything.,
Best study app ever. The videos are very useful.,
I love the app it just keeps crashing,
They are using great people and the work they do is amazing.,
This is such a great way to keep your learning experience with you.,
I first tryed this and it said please wait this is going to take a minute but it took 48hours,
It has all the basics in it.  A must have app for academics.,
Why there is no mastery practice,
It's the best way to learn. All done at my speed. Thank you!,
keep up the good work guys 👍,
"This app is only good for watching videos,  but no where can you find any tests exercises practices not even articles, what's worse is watching any videos has no affect on your scores at all.",
"Wow, this is such an useful app that nobody can rate it under five.",
Helps a lot with homework especially when I'm stuck ☺,
Just wished if you could add GATE preparation and GRE preparation materials.,
"I love this app, it is unbelievably easy to use and very helpful! Although, I think you could improve it, when you go to the webpage on the computer, you can do testing, I'd like to be able to do testing on my phone.",
This app show and teaches you all kinds of stuff.,
Well designed app with pleasant learning experience and plenty of information.,
Our macro teacher even requires us to finish the macro course on Khan.,
Simply perfect. Thanks for the great work thanks alott from all beneficiary,
"It has everything that I need for my school,science,math,social studies, all the topics that I need for school,is in this app,thank you  :)",
I have searched many apps but this app is the best,
this has gotten me through my freshman year!!!,
This app is very useful to every Student's and Mentors!!!,
"Kids, you don't have to go to school if you have this!!!",
I can't but give 5 stars,
App for iOS has exercises. This one doesn't.,
The best app to learn math ..,
Keep adding more. I love this.,
You can really almost learn anything,

"Every video tells me ""couldn't load video"" :(",
Love it.,
Well ... this particularhelped me ace my exams .... thats worth a 5 Stars 😇😇😇😇😇,
"There isn't a single activity, like the app :(",
You need password,
It's really a great teacher.,

No actual activities. Just a ton of videos. 40mb app by the way,
I'm addicted.,
Thanks Mr.Khan,
Its really interesting.,
Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Simply Awesome !!! 👏👏👏,
Please add more topics in computing section,
Khan Academy  really helped me with A.V.I.D,
Thumbs up..khan,
No Days Without Learning,

But how to attempt skills?,
Stopped opening on the S5?,
Can anyone say how to download videos from it?????? Everything else is fine.....:),

Great app,
Where the math exercises at?,
Very helpful,
Very useful,
Its good,
nice app,
Super helpful,
Loved it,
Helpfull,
Superb,
Excellent,
Nice,
Awesomeeeeeee!!!!!,
"U have learned math on this site better than I have in all my years of school combined. In saying that, the app itself is essentially a demo version of the website as there are no exercises. The exercises provide half of the learning experience and with that missing, I only bother using Khan academy on pc.  When exercises are added I will rate the 5 stars this site deserves",
Though I have already graduated back in 2007 after being out of school since 1988.  I am happy to say that Khan Academy has helped me update my learning experience and has introduced me to the Asian Arts. I plan to take on every course possible and learn as much as I can because knowledge is the key. Thank you Khan Academy for introducing me to today's world of thinking when it comes to education.,
"I feel that I am extremely privileged to have found this wonderful resource, because a number of years ago I experienced a severe medical issue, and this on-line site provides for me a fantastic opportunity to regain skills lost to my medical issue; Thank you, Khan Academey!",
"I've been using the PC version of Khan Academy for about two years, and I love it! However, the exercises are pretty much the best feature on the site, and I am disappointed that the exercises were not included in the app. I would definitely give this app five stars if it had exercises.",
"I love khan Academy and have been waiting for an Android app for a very long time, and the app is great. thanks for adding the 2x playback speed option.",
"Biggest annoyance is videos seem to cut off several seconds before the end, typically midsentence. Direct support for chromecast would be very useful.",
Best app for learning new subjects or reviewing what you learned in grade school. The only cons is the app does not stay in landscape mode when going to the next video.  It would be nice to practice math problems access through the app.,
When I opened the app I found it very interesting but when I tapped to play any video the app crashes in a second and takes back to my home screen. Please fix this I genuinely wants to learn things from this app,
"Very educational and helpful! I enjoy using this for school. 😀☺ I recommend this app for people who are struggling in school or even if not, because practice and a different point of view is great!👌👌A better understanding for all..",
"On the full khan academy website there are more topics, like there are three more topics in computer science and about 9 more subtopics with full videos but they aren't in the app. Otherwise great app, I use it all the time with my multivariable calculus and newtonian physics classes.",
Little  mini videos  explaining many subjects. My main focus  right now is learning  math.,
"As a teacher, I often refer my  students here when they want extra help but are not in school that day or are going to miss days. Video lessons are easy to understand and learn from.",
Its very amazing but the internal memory of many devices are limited please add an option to store on sd card for devices with 4.4+ to store on temporary sd card folder thanx........,
Its a good app. But what it definitely lacks is exercises. I have been usin pc version of this app and what's great about it is the broad range of exercises. So Please add it..,
I'm a poor guy. I can't have hundreds of dollars to offer professors so I use Khan academy instead.,
Apps like this should be more readily available it pays off big time for the advancement of our society. I like it.  A lot!,
Thanks for the creator of this App. It helps me understand the subject that me and my daughter are doing homework on. The explanation of a subject is broken down to its simplistic form.,
"Won't let me sign in. Clicking the sign in link takes me to a settings page with nowhere to log in. If this is fixed, I'll try the app again.",
Really useful for all. Especially for those who cannot understand things at schools or colleges,
Cant open the app.. crashes every single time,
I'm Loving It Beacause Its Gave me Soo Much Knowledge That I Have To Gain... Amazing App Keep It Dev be Blessed,
One of the most beneficial apps I've ever had on my phone...,
When I don't understand something I come here.                                            Amazing,
"I have been using Khan academy from more than 4 years way before it came as application and it is awesome,SAL is one of the best teachers MASiHA of MATHS. videos on Economics and finance are way too good excellent work SAL good  application interface....really Loved it... :D",
I love this app. But The downside is that there is no subtitles in the videos. Please add subtitles in a mobile version. It could be difficult for international students to learn subjects on Khan with mobile app.,
Would be 5 stars but after a while have to reinstall it. Overall love the app!,
"It has most precise & perfect piece of Information with suitable support of transcipt,audio,boards.All this for free.Cheers to the team for doing such a wonderful job & with perfection",
"I v been waiting for the android app for ever and it is finally here, great app and service keep up the good work",
"This app is straightforward and it teaches very well, steps and explanation. Very rare even in schools",
"I spent hours on khanacademy on my computer, now I can't go to my progress on the app even though I'm signed in the same... oh I can see my ""badges"" which is useless.",
"The content is the solid, basic subject knowledge you need. The variable speed on the video player takes this app to 5-star level.",
I like it helps me learn from all subjects but can you actually answer problems because I don't know how please reply,
It is good please add ICSE and ISC too .It is excluded by most of the people. Please look into this.,
A Great Approach By Salman Khan...I Learnt many New Things From This App,
Such a smooth and simple UI. And I found that streaming speed is faster than on other apps on same bandwidth. Hats off to Sal and team :),
I love this app so much I'm in 5th grade and I always need help with my math homework so in school we use it 24/7😊😊,
"If every student in this world use this app for learning, nobody can ever fail regardless of what exam it is!                                       But, please include 9th to 12th grade",
"Very useful sources of studying. But if u have practice questions (as many topics as possible) we can try to answer, I will upgrade you to 5*",
Khan Academy has a wide coverage of academic content. My 8 year old son loves it. Keep it going!,
On glad to see this app is doing so well. It's been so long I've wanted this app,
I'm  having trouble with videos they aren't playing.,
Just what I needed to help me pass the math class I'm taking for the second time in high school,
So much information and Knowledge. Thank you,
I just downloaded it and saw one video and learned so much . I might bump it up to five stars .,
No need to go to school.. Get yoursekf educated at home:) .. Please add subtitles on the main screen that will be more helful..,
I'd like to see access to practice skills as well as the video content.,
This really helped me with my math !! I used to get a score of 60/100 and now i get a score of 90/100 !! It really helped me out,
It would be nice if there was an option to download videos on sd card instead of phone memory.,
I wonder if there's a DVD set just like this I would definitely pay for my son to have this at home on the big screen. Finally all in one math. Science and more! I just love it,
"Great app. The only thing missing, for me, is Chromecast support.",
The app keeps crashing when I open it on my PC. I wonder how many devices you can enable?,
I recommend this to everyone who has difficulty in learning in their subject areas. Try it!!!,
Stimulates to get interested in your subject. There should be a feature of watching videos in lower resolutions.,
This is a big help to anyone who wants to learn specially to all students considering the fact that it is for FREE!,
Great virtual school. Great explanations,
Helped me raise my sat score by more than 200 points.,
This is a good schooling app. Please put custom sat practice on app please.,
I have used the app for my entry exams and throughout nursing school!! And I recommend it to all of my friends.,
AWESOME...... This word is not enough how helpful you are to me. There is no single day in my life without this app.. You are not only teaching me. You are helping millions of students.. THANKYOU SO MUCH.,
This app allows one to get a world class education for free.,
Learning made so easy for busy people and its FREE too.,
Superb initiative by Khan academy nd a best app dat supports it's initiative,
"good, but I wish they had the practice exercises like they do on the browser",
"Although the application is good, I can't download videos file.",
"A must have for students, especially on the SAT. works great",
Great. If only you could do the exercises too,
A must-have for every student!,
This app is very helpful! Very happy,
Intuitive app to compliment a revolutionary learning environment,
I thought you could actually do exercises,
Learned more from this website than from my math class,
Maybe this app could add questions into the sections like the website.,
I loved this app so much I study on it every day   thank you so much khan academy,
It helps you when you need to learn something new,
Thank u khan acd for this great work please keep it going my brother loves this app and he learned lots of things through your app thank u again,

It's simply awesome,
Helps in magnificent ways. I definetly recommend it for everyone.,
But can't do practice here.,
I'm from Malaysia and i just love it 😍,
I really loved them thanks a lot,
Try to Incorporate all facilities available in pc,
I use this for school and its very reliable,
Its very educative,
Well described and easy to understand.,
Exceptional supplemental resource! I use it frequently,

"It's a good app, I like the avatars, and it helps a lot in school.🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱✌",
I could not even do any actual math it was just videos,
Such a great app for a great endeavor!,
Let us do tests and read articles,
It doesn't let me go on my mission!!!!!! The rest is amazing!,
Explaining how this app works is really not enough! Great job!!!! Love it 💚💚💚,
Beast of e-learning,
Awesome!,
Where are the problems?! How come its available for apple?!,
Thanks Khan sir,
You can learn anything,
Just awesomeee..... No words.  Hats off to all who made it. I would have given it 10 stars...,
Why isn't there a way to get to teacher recommendations?,
Why do I view this software as a 72Mb link to YouTube?,
Life-saver,
It's a keeper,
Learning is made easy,
Good for test,

Great app,

Nice,
Awesome,
Happy with it,
Love it,
Thanks for this App👍,
Nic app,
very ñice,
This app is a great app for students in backward countries like India who don't have access to good education because of lack of good colleges and very high  fees for private coaching institutions which are not affordable to average income families..All it requires is a good Computing device and an internet connection...This app should change the way how students take education....,
"Nice app, or should I say nice videos. The app doesn't take advantage of the infinite possibilities offered by programming for education. I found this pretty sad to have only video. Also wish I could comment, as I found minor errors in history class. Great overall",
"...the app crashes when trying to look at my list of contents downloaded. I can't change download settings like in the past before crashing again. Afraid to reinstall again...I've done that but all my videos were erased as well. I use Khan Academy on my Asus Zen 6 and Samsung Mega to learn offline and save costs on my data plan. All were  courses downloaded at my library WIFI. Currently this app is on limited functionality, so giving 3 stars for usability with a mean of 4 stars.",
"Your videos have helped me tremendously. I do wish your app also contained the questions that you have on the website. Sometimes I'm only using the app and need to test what I just learned. Overall, I really like your concept... especially being free for all!",
"There is always the ever present danger of constantly evolving knowledge that needs to be updated and refreshed. But as far as the content goes its solid. The price is amazing, and the rewards are almost boundless in terms of knowledge growth and personal gain.",
"The app is undoubtedly a great one. I downloaded it two days ago, and enjoyed its content ever since. However, today, it keeps showing a stop running message, and though I have restarted my phone, the problem is not solved. I have HTC one m8, running lollipop ..",
It helped me improve so much in nath because when my teacher talks my mind just shuts down and I dont rember the lesson and I fail...but this amazing app gave me such a better understanding of math :3,
"While the website is great, I'm hugely disappointed with the app. It's basically just a browser for their videos. Given that their major claim to fame is their math coursework, it seems odd that they don't allow you to actually practice math problems...",
Hey..  I wish you would read it.  The teachers at khan Academy  are really awesome.  I was afraid of coding but pamela and Sophia  are so good i love to code now.. ! Thanks,
Videos are very much awesome . Covers every topic of every book for 11th and 12th class . Anyone who hasn't studied anything the whole year can study the whole syllabus easily .,
"Its great to see an app so good and intuitive to be free and accessible to all. I love this app , keep up the good work and thanks a lot.",
Really has helped with my college work i was never good at maths but with the learning on this app i understand a lot more ty :),
"Unfortunately after the latest update I have not once been able to launch it without it crashing to the home screen. Will rate 5 stars once fixed, because otherwise it's a great app.",
Downloaded this app expressly to do math problems on my breaks at work and come to find out that it doesn't offer math problems nor tracking of your progress.,
"I like this app because I am able to watch my MCAT material. Unfortunately, I am unable to do any of the practice problems.",
Yeah. Right. Good luck tryin it wont let you leave it on the best Wi-Fi videos lag and buffer,
I have less time to prepare for my exams mean while I am checking videos for better understanding I gone through YouTube some are available and some not this app helped me lot thanks you so much.............,
This app is a VERY GOOD and HELPFUL app! A must have app right here! I am very far behind on Math and trying to learn and catch up on it again! I am looking forward to more videos on all kinds of math from low grades to highest grades! Good job and keep it up guys!,
I always got low grade in math but with this app I got higher grades,
"Awesome, save for two points.  I would like the ability to Cast the app to Chromecast, and for the app to be compatible with Android TV so I can watch on my Sony Bravia X850C 4K Ultra HD with Android TV.  Thanks!",
"Great app, easy use. Learning every day great subjects. Thank you Khan Academy.",
"If it weren't for Khan's YouTube video's I would have never made it through calculus 1. Still use your video's everyday, everywhere I go! I promised myself long ago that after I graduate I will donate to the site and to the idea of free education for others. Thanks.",
"But the app don't allow to do also the exercises, only can see videos.",
"Really love Khan Academy, app is superbly written☺. Just want sal to add creating folder inside lists so that different subjects can be organized easily.",
This is re3 the best app. N its free awesome. Keep it up. I love to learn from it n its lectures r great help.i m prepare ing for ias n this is great help,
It helps for when I don't have access to my PC and there aren't any bugs that I notice.,
I'm so amazed to find an app like this. It's just useful to learn new things in a lot more easier way!,
Please add an option to save video to sd card because there are many mobiles which are low on storage.,
Its great but im just wondering why i cant see the computer PROGRAMMING section with this app,
i find my self loading the main website to use modules and practice on my phone and do a review with videos before also on my phone. would be nice if you guys implemented the modules from main site into the app.,
Salman Khan ...is one of the most influential people in my life...his work is just amazing...And this app is just great,
On the website you can do practice problems but you can't on here,
I love its structure and the way it coaches the topics. I recommend this app for every high school and collage student. Thanks a lot for making it.,
This app let's everyone review or learn new things for free,
I can't access my teachers recommended assignments but other than that it's fine,
I love khan academy!!! The app would have been better if we had the questions for practice as well because it is the only way we get to know if we have understood the concept.I would appreciate if we get the questions in the next update.,
No need for books as these teaching aid videos excel in all areas and guess what? They don't cost a bean.,
"Great app, super helpful! It would be awesome if they made it Chromecast compatible!",
It helped me understand a lot of confusing subjects.,
"The most intuitive, simple, concise, and educative apps you can do yourself the favour of downloading",
"I can't actually do any work on the app. It just lets me watch videos, and I learn best by actually trying the problems, so...",
"I've  struggled with math my whole  Life, and  never really understood algebra. This has helped me so much!!!! I can't thank you enough!! I am finally understanding  algebra  after  years of struggling with. THANK YOU SAL",
Unlike the website there are barely math exercises to do. All there is are videos. Please upgrade it.,
First I used to be 7 rank but now I am in 3rd rank thanks to Khan academy plzz download this app ur knowledge will be increased really .,
I have been using Khan Academy for about 2 years now and I love it!!!  I am in 5th grade and do advanced classes and we do 9th grade work so if I don't understand the homework I go to Khan and do the lesson!  Thanks Khan!!!,
But where is practice section where you ask questions and mastery challenges? ?? Please give an update to the app so mastery challenge is available on the go,
"Extensive, expansive and informative.",
"I love Technology section in this app. I DAMN LOVE THIS APP. I WILL GIVE 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ FOR THIS APP. SUPER , ELAGANT USER INTERFERECE. KEEP IT UP. I love the videos about Softwares,tech and computers. KHAN ACADEMY IS GREAT. I CANT EXPRESS IN WORDS ABOUT THIS APP. THIS APP IS ONE OF THE BEST APP. ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡. I REALLY LOVE THIS APP. KEEP ON AND UPLOAD MANY VIDEOS ABOUT COMPUTERS, TECH, SOFTWARES. 😘😍. I told my dudes n buddies to download this Damn great app. THANK YOU.",
really good work and all and I've been using khan Academy in my desktop for a while but when I tried the app it keeps freezing as soon as I try to play a video!! any solution??,
You don't even do work on the app,
"Well done overall so far, but please add Chromecast support!",
Khan Academy has helped me to go through school subjects and has made me better at maths and physics,
It provides excellent material for students. Thank you Sir!,
I can study everything with Khan academic.,
Best app for learning  . It is easy to use and helps you  to learns things easily .,
"It would of been a perfect app, if they were exercises/worksheets to do.",
Love it but wish you could do lessons with this app.,
So much to learn and free! Its helping me a lot with school.,
Omg I love how u write ur own answer! Best educational app ever!,
Very useful for everyone who want to improve their skills and knowledge.,
Plz add more topics of A level.,
Its a nice app...I suggest all to download it..it will help u in ur studies a lot.,
Absolutely love this! Great for refreshing on topics and learning new ones!,
The voice of Khan suddenly gets thick in the middle of the video. Please fix this,
Would be better if it showed fewer or merged notifications while downloading videos.,
A very  helpful guide for the motivated Teacher.,
KHAN ACADEMY WAS BEST IS BEST AND WILL BE BEST,
My videos arent downloadong even under fast internet :(,
It is the best educational app I have ever used in my life.,
"Very educational, lots of options for learning, easy to follow the instructors",
Really Very nice and very effected apps for Teachers Parents and Students i like this one very Heartly Congrats to Devlopers,
It will rate only when u can use subtitlee in video while watching,
"Great app! Used to learn on my computer.. Now it's in my pocket. And the best part, It's for free!",
It's only video's the website is better,
"When I've watched all videos pertaining to biology I like to read the articles that sum all the videos up. This app does not do that.  However, it's great to have the videos right at my finger tips on the bus or when I don't have my laptop. :)",
What else do you need a best refresher for all that we learnt in the past,
Its nice to have sections explained but why are there no actual problems to solve?  Its all instructions with no practical exercises?,
This is a true service to humanity ! Thank you :),
The video isn't streaming along with the audio. Fix it asap. Helpful app btw.,
I wish practice section to be in khan academy app,
The best app to learn anything,
This is  a wonderful app by which we can anwhere,
The best I've seen,
Online classes for students and it is very useful,
Loved it!,
Get a lot of use out of it!,
Best one very helpful but need indian history,
Realy good I recommend,
It helped me in improving in maths,
University student must have app,
It's great!! But the games... I don't think that the games are available in the app,
Very helpful for studies.,
What an app. Thanks for the amazing contribution to mankind,
Awesome for my history exam.,
Very very excellent,
Love it so much,
"I'm so happy it's here! Now, I can study anywhere!",
"Este o aplicație foarte buna ,necesita îmbunatățiri periodice.",
The app needs Improvement.... Even though the Website is in its peak of glory ..... You need to add the practice skills etc to the android as well...... I'm expecting an update soon,
I really love this app...I dont have any complaints! Its amazing,
Not all topics r given...,
"It's great that all of the videos are on here, but are there plans to add exercises eventually?",
Very very helpful for my exams and solving doubts👏👏👏👏👑📚💹🎉🎆 love it,
"Previously i used to mug up my ICSE text books for exams without understanding the concepts...but as i got ""khan academy"".it helped me a lot..now i can tell any answer of any subject without looking into the next because i know the""CONCEPT"" clearly..",
Bringing the best in me...,
Who needs school when you've got khan academy,
I loved this app its very useful with my JEE studies....... It's free and amazing. You can also see the subtitles or transcripts there.. Just loved it ... Thank you... .,

Awsme n vry helful,
Love it!!!,
"Should have rated it 5 if it had the coding lesson,would you please add it.",
"I'm deaf, I need captions, it shows on the website but no option for it exists when viewing videos in the app.",
Great!!!!!!,
"Guys, this app is gold",
Please create a desktop app to sync videos with. On board memory doesn't suffice. Create an option to save videos to a memory card,
great & right,
Good for students,
Promotive,
Best,
Loved it.,

Free Education,

Loved  it,

Awesome,
Amazing,
Best,
Kahn academy,
Wowwww,
I downloaded the app so that I could continue lesrning what ive been doing on  my mac with more ease unfortunately try as i might i can't get any of my actual progress to show up in the app. The only thing that shows are my points and badges. If this can be rectified I'll stary using the apo and change my rating.,
"Everything works perfectly with one drawback. Unlike the computer site, which allows you to test your knowledge of what you've learned,  there is no master level quizzing of the material. I think that would be an excellent addition to this app. This along with the ability to view and select areas of progress in the subjects would make this a 5 star app.",
"Some videos are not able to download for offline mode, even if i watch video for few seconds it is updating the status as completed ,even in this case also i'm not able to down load the video ,may be because it is considering i have already completed it. For adding video in offline video i have to open video and select the down load option, it is pain full for down loading the entire chapter/course more over some videos are not downloading.",
"Nice app, a few gripes:   -  It's hard to add an entire course to your ""list"" so it downloads offline.  - No easy way to have it save offline videos to my SD card rather than local on my phone.  - Linear Algebra videos appear to be out of order!",
I love it alot it is easy to use and it helps with everything i need for college and breaks it down so you understand it and not get lost.... keep up the good work 😊,
"I haven't tried it yet, but its right up my street. Thank you",
"No bs, no sign up, no free trial, etc. Gives you what you need when you need it. I was able to pass a test I was clueless about by watching one of the videos five minutes beforehand.",
"Well, I would like to thank Mr. Khan and Company for delivering such a awesome lectures. Very helpful Application. Thanks Again.",
"But you can't do questions or passages, arguably the more effective learning tools.",
I'm a medical student and the addition of the playback speed option in the latest update makes this (hands down) the most useful app around!,
"Very good, lectures are very good but please u need to include some kind of tag or wishlist to the topics so we could just mark out topic we want to study instead of searching allover again",
I don't get it because I wanted to do my usual computer programming but it said it was locked please make it like it is on the computer then you'll get a five star review,
"The most lovable fact about Khan Academy is that its completely free,, no matter where you access it from.",
I like khan but I hate having the app crash over and over and over...   No instrumentation to report the bug back to the developer and no way to report bugs...   Stinky.,
"I truly appreciate all you people do! I have been getting so much needed help from the website on my laptop and I'm thankful there is also an app for when I'm on the go! beautifully put together + organized.. thank you so much.. whoever makes all this possible.. you are helping me to learn and not feel stupid.. thank you, thank you.. you are angels.",
The video is not load on my phone. It discusting.,
because of this i passed my entrance exam and the company sponsored me for my cadetship program . thanks a lot :),
Khan academy is helping my students understand and revise the mathematical ideas they learn and should know through great videos.,
"Definitely my ""go to"" place if I missed a lecture or just don't understand the material.",
"With the option to download videos I've started using it nearly every day.  My one comment would be, from the home screen, offer an option to hide categories, or order them starting with what has been viewed.",
I'm not able to play the videos anymore whether they are saved or not !,
Bt it sucks... Fix the crashing problem and downloading problem,
There is error in playing videos on jelly bean platform,
Want to clear or understand concepts of pcm… u should must install this app in your smartphones,
"1. Include subtitles in video such that the user is able to read them horizontal or vertically.                                         2. Make the math practices in the web version available on the app,so that users are also able to practice their skills on the go.",
"I love khan academy and everything they're trying to do for us, but I really do wish there was practice available on this. That's the best way I learn, that's for sure,  and I can't help feeling like this is only half an app without it.",
Please add more chapters of class 11...  i wil surely give it 5 star,
I do not have anything to say loveee youuuuu reaally great app in the store that i have never see,
"I was studying for my ASVAB, going for the Navy.... and there is no need to read books! Watch a video and you will learn in a snap EVERYTHING you need to know!",
"Big Thanks to the teacher giving those tutorials....app is awesome.Learned alot, a good guide",
It's cool I guess,
I went though the app.. It is really cool and helpfull for learning new thing...,
It helps really confused kids with math and other subjects,
Very detailed information.  Easy to use.  Great step by step explations! Love to use this  information to help me learn and review,
Done this with my school.  Great education app 10/10 great for homework help.,
It s an awesome app and I suggest all students to try this.,
If there were 10stars id gladly give it! One day if i have money ill definitely sponsor these guys! These videos are amazing! YOU WILL NEVER GO WRONG WITH THIS APP!!,
I learn so much from this app. I go on this everyday now! 👍,
That's the best knowledgeable application I ever seen.,
Thank you so much for double speed. Just need a way to do passages and questions,
"The content provided is worth paying for, and guess what it's all free",
Very nice app for aducation boys& girls and  good for all person life,
"Explains everything very well with great examples and easy to find videos, very organized",
I've been waiting for a mobile version and now it's here,
A great app for self-study.,
It's here if you want it.,
Will not be bad for my two girls though we have not tried yet.,
The layout is amazing. Makes me happy just how well everything is organized,
Good amount of content to help mostly any student,
I owe my academic success to khan academy,
It's a very good app and very useful one.Congrats!,
"Thank you, so much! This app is a boon. No no, scratch that out you are a boon!! I am giving my A level exams this year and I bet, I am gonna pass with flying colours! Salman Sir, I totally love you!! You are the best teacher, I have ever come across! This app is great! You are great!!",
It's  awesome I never loved  math more,
There should be an option to control the playback quality.,
Amazing for learning maths and economics. Very helpful.,
It's good I take this sometimes instead of doing it in class,
It should also allow us to take test,
All The Learning in your pocket for free!,
"Vast amount of knowledge, presented easily",
This is awesome and user friendly.,
I love it so much for the teaching!,
I really love it developers ....pls... update the app so that it can support the full features as the website...thank u.....you guys are doing a great job,
It's very easy to understand,
Thank you guys. Nice work,
I mostly use it for math...LOVE IT!,
"I mean,  we're all here for the exercise I think...  Please add! :)  then you get a 5!",
please add a tutorial button or at least tell me where it is and please tell me of there is a challenge in the App or add one of there Isn't.,
Thanks for the wonderful Free help.,
Its so much useful.must download it,
All of Life should be like this.,
Why didn't i found this gem earlier?? Five starred because of offline videos made easy,
One of the best out there!,
The videos are not working at all !!,
#Loved_it. #Great_work.,
Thank you !! This app  help me so much ... ❤,

Well is the best one. It possesses all what you need.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,
Computer science is a bit weak,

Very helpful app.,
"is it possible for me to download ""khan academy"" to my this windows 10 laptop?",
Actually seems very helpful,

Great at any age,
Excellent app for learning,

Not playing video s,
Needs to add a subtitle option,
Awesome,
Install it,
Awesome app,
Best,
Amazinnnnng,
It has helped me a lot in college chemistry. I also recommend socrataria I additional To this app. Great combination to have.,
My secret weapon and best friend in my school adventure.  Loved it do much I donated a little money to support the platform.  We need this,
I like it. It does do it's job. The videos are helpful in many ways.  But I notice that there are no quizzes to show what you learned. As well as to prep you for the real thing. That is OK I guess.,
I will write too many things for this app but in one line its incredible app...,
I thought this app was really good for studying. I am currently taking Biology 2 and macroeconomics and this app has a lot of videos that will definatley help me to review and study for quizes or exams. I would recommend this to any high school or college student.,
This p has a really good use it gives so much information and really nice work to accomplish so it is. Great like that.,
"Well designed, very functional. If it had Chromecast support I'd give it 5 stars.",
I downloaded some videos for use offline. Storage space was running out so I move some of the videos to external card. When I move back the videos to the khanacademy download folder the app doesn't show the videos as been download and auto deletes the videos. Please fix.,
I love it For Me And My Kids Thank You Sooo Much Mr Khan😍,
I tried to sign in with my school gmail and password but it doesnt work,
This is a gret app and it will help you more than you think. Very funny guy,
"In a future update, will we be able to view/open articles? I have to go to the website on my phone's browser to view the articles as well.",
Its very useful in Learning topics easy and very efficiently....,
"Excellent work by the pioneer,thank you!",
Thank you so much i love it,
It works really good its really helpful,
Best educational app ever created on this planet,
This is a good and informative app.,
Mu naey Jeuf frum be it;be Jeuf an dis iz be maff Wich iz be like the worst subgeuck erver,
Amazing!,
Best learning,
Can you please add JavaScript?,
Luv this app,
Good,
Unreal...,
"I love Khan Academy so much, it helped me pass my finals and get a better ACT score! I was excited to find this app because the computers at work won't let me use KA, but I'm disappointed that there isn't any interactive content. I'd love to be able to practice during down time at work. Would be 5 stars with interactive content.",
It surprised me how great this app is it has material design and the App just looks and works great. Thanks for taking your time and making a great app considering most companies that have companion apps and they almost always suck but not this one great job Khan academy Dev's.,
"I have loved Khan Academy for a long time and haven't been able to find ANYTHING else that can explain anything simpler yet still be so comprehensive. When I saw that they now had an official app I audibly shouted ""yessssss!"" If you haven't heard of Khan Academy you won't be disappointed. This is someone who enjoys making a difference in the lives of others...",
"It just has videos. You don't learn from watching, you learn from doing. They need to add quizzes. This app definitely has the potential to be one of the most useful android apps.",
On Samsung galaxy grand quattro . Please help How to fix this problem. The app closes automatically,
"I'm using a galaxy s5, I watch 2 videos and then when I try to watch a 3rd video it crashes and boots me out.  I go back in and watch 2 videos and then the same thing happens.",
"Love this, biology vids hv some fascinating insights and the chemistry choked full of brill explanations. Just a shame there arn't more apps like this for students and general study alike 😀",
It has a wide variety of subjects. It is really a knowledge hub. Thanks Sal Khan for helping us to learn what we really need. I hope to see a lot of subjects in future for all kinds of students.,
"I like all the stuff it allows you to learn, but it should be more hands on. I think there should be activities or games to play to help us understand it better.",
Khan Academy is simply the best. I was able to revise 10 years of school in 6 months before going back to college for Calculus classes.,
"Everything is good , but there's more room to improve like computer programming and online tests are unavailable in Android app unlike desktop site.Fix these and it'll get 5 stars.",
"Lots of comments about video quality. The video quality is fine on my Kyocera, which admittedly the Kyocera is utterly horrible at compatibility.",
It's great for teaching. But it doesn't let you practice on here. That would be my only complaint,
"I think it is the best studying website, we can learn any difficult problems easier",
This is best app to acquire knowledge. The way all the lectures has been explained is just awesome which makes it easier to understand and learn. Thank you Salman Khan and the whole team of Khan Academy :) .,
"it's really helpful for us.it helps me to realize some critical ideas & theories,which my teachers were failed.it's simply amazing.",
"These lessons are the best! Now, I am encouraged that I can learn anything. Thanks to Sal, I think I may be one step closer to my dreams😃😃",
Thank you khan for help me thank you so much.i can easily find any answer about anything of science.,
"Class, books and internet never quite made sense. Saved my chemistry exams. Cheers",
It would be a great app if it had questions that pertained to what they were teaching you in order to see if you understand the concept not all people can learn without practice in my opinion it wasn't worth the download.,
Video data management problem  When I seek forward the video for 10s it again starts buffering. Although it has already cached that video,
Being able to follow coach recommendations and problem sets are a MUST. Interactivity is what makes Kahn a useful tool. Would rate higher with the interactive update.,
Been watching the Khan videos on YouTube in the past to get through math courses in college. Now using the app to refresh on math and electrical lessons for an apprenticeship at a electric utility company. Highly recommended!,
Khan academy gives very good explanation on each and every topic. As making it absolutely free Sal is doing a great job. I have really learnt a lot from it. Thanks! App also works fine.,
i was failing my geometry class and thxs to khan academy i could learn in easier way and pass my class,
Very knowledgeable for all. App has very basic and also detailed knowledge of important fields in the form of videos that i think one should know.i  Recommend it for every one,
"You designed the app very efficiently guys. But there is something missing, there are no computer programming lessons like the ones I see on your website. Please add some java, python and stuff like that, it would be very helpful.",
"My children use this on their phones and laptops. They are home schooled and seem to excel with the help Khan Academy. Thank you, guys!!!",
Would've rated five stars but what's the point of only the videos and no problems to test what I learned. I wanted to get ahead in math at home but I can't because I can't master or even practice stuff.,
I couldnt go to biology class instead i went home and studed their and i even learned more on khan than what the other students learned!!!!,
"With Kahn academy, I can learn ANYWHERE at ANY time! It's really easy to get through, has every subject that I am learning, and everything makes sense when they explain it.",
"Would love to see the comments for videos though, they are usually extremely informative.",
Everything is fine with this app but there is no provision to write tests like in the website. Please see that we can write tests in the app itself.,
The app doesn't sync the videos I've watched on the website and Mark them as watched in the app. EDIT: This has been fixed!,
I started KA in fourth grade and it has helped me get ahead in school. Because of it I'm in advanced math now. Its very easy to understand and very helpful. I love it!!!,
It is the treasure of knowledge. A good attempt by a Pakistani to teach the world. Thank u sir,
This is the most helpful educational app I have ever used. Thanks for making such app. Loved it!!,
Free education to the whole world. It is a noble act that the Khan Academy has accomplished.,
It will be great if you add the exercises too.,
You can also get general knowledge videos on NSeDUCATION Channel YouTube.,
Helpful now I didn't have to use my slow computer,
Everybody should have in their phone for continuous learning in life,
"Love the app, with all the material design.",
This app is very useful but it would be great if it has maths for high classes in India and some more courses,
I can't see the videos  I mean it gets stuck.. Audio keeps running...,
This is by far the best app i have ever downloaded!!! Very helpful!,
its very useful.i love it & learning from it,
The app doesn't have my progress on webpage. I have to search again and find where i was.,
Best Educational App In The World,
Awesome app and very good features,
It helps me a lot 😊,
Please allow playing videos in the background,
PS : Allow the option to choose video quality..,
Because he expliaend what he do,
There is just learning and NO practise......WHY? No quiz....no Qs....,
Thankx for Giving us All we Want..........   :-),
Great app....I loved it,
A wealth of information!,
This helps with my programming,
How to find offline list ?,
Not good,
Awesome,
.,
Good,
Just perfect,
Awesome,
Super,

"I love this program so much! I've been using for almost two years now and I've had nothing but great things to say. I'm glad Android finally has the app, but you really should put the activities on here instead of just the videos. Keep on doing great!",
I've used it for myself and reccommended for friends and family.  This should be the first app on a kids smart phone,
"I expect a lot better from Khan Academy. While the interface is great, the lack of exercises is a big problem. I hope that this will change in the future.",
"I love this app, I only wish you'd bring more full courses to Android and tablets, like on iPad.",
"It's very useful app ,I loved it a lot now I am perfect in all subjects in this app what I liked most is 1. It will not buffer at all 2. We can see offline",
"As the official app from Khan Academy, it's missing the parts that makes it great: quiz, and customized practice afterwards.",
Best source for help on school topics that many students struggle on,
Great layout. Amazing videos. Would be better if some more videos are added. Nevertheless loving the app!,
Easy to use simple app yet contains thousands of science and arts lectures.  على الرغم من بساطة وسهولة استعمال هذا التطبيق  فهو يحتوي على آلاف المحاضرات العلمية النافعة,
Best ed center in the world. Sal should get an Nobel prize for this :),
Thank you Mr.  Salman Khan.  You are real super hero. we proud of you.,
One of my most favorite apps on my smartphone.,
Awesome free video lessons for almost every subject/topic,
its free and provides good content what else do you want,
Great mobile companion for fans of the website.,
Education at it's best.,
Do not download this app if you want to search anything about computer of 1st year it will not provide information about it,
Very good app for learning.,
very useful app with all the correct information.,
Yup its a nice app i agree but no indian slybuss i found it a bit strange or so dissatisfied 😒 khan academy!!!!!!!,
This is the most intuitive app I have ever seen in my life it defines what is learning!!!,
This is nice I use at school,
"Using since 4 years,best everrrr teaching!! Keep it up Sal! 👍",
Very useful for SAT,
The ultimate learning site!,
Very nice app.,
Great!,
Love the app and the website too very efficient.....,
Great app!,
You know what I like more than this app? Knowledge,
Awesome app.love it,
You can just navigate your profile and watch videos. If you want to practice you have to use your PC browser.,
Thank you for this app,
Aswome,
"The functionality offered in app is very basic. Most of the features  of website are not available  in app,like excercise and comments in the videos.  Also we are unable to set the speed of video as pace of some videos in which sal explained the stuff,is very slow. If these functionality  can be incorporated,that would improve  the app experience  a lot. Also I have 7 inch tablet,when I opened the app in the tablet, some  links are not functional.  I think that fix may also be required.",
"First I was using this app for maths and science. It is very good for maths and science, specially for maths.I try to find videos related to Social science but I didn't get exactly what I want.Thank I found the ROBOMATE+ in which I get the videos of all subject related to particular class for CBSE and ICSE also..I don't say that lab academy isn't good it's good for maths and science but for other subjects I prefer ROBOMATE+.. It's very good for course related topics. Good work done by Sal. I'm very from Sal",
Love the app. All the information that is available has truly helped me review alot of material that I needed a little refreshment on and it has also allowed me learn other subjects that I have not studied as much. Yet there is one thing that I believe would make this app the best available. That would be if it was chromecast compatable. Definite 5 star,
I just found out about this app and really the whole concept. I guess I'm a bit behind. The app works wonderfully snd I use it to help teach my younger soldiers something different. Preparing them for a life outside of the Army can be difficult with so many different areas of focus. This puts it all in one place. Thanks. Great app!!!!!,
One of the great apps I have ever used. Thank you and keep it up. Hope that you guys include some new categories,
"I love using this app, it's cool, but it's used almost 100 MB of background data.  So even though I hadn't even opened the app, it still accessed my data network and used ~100 megabytes.. .  NOT COOL Khan Academy.  Address/fix this issue for 4 stars; until then, I'm uninstalling.  Additionally, Chromecast capabilities and practice quizzes would make this a 5-star app.",
"Whenever I seek back even a second or two, the whole video loads again, hogging up my bandwidth..And living in india, that's a problem.  I'd really appreciate it if it would not load again every time I seek back a few seconds.",
"I never knew that khan academy has a mobile version already, glad to see this... Saves my effort in opening my laptop and studying through the web",
"Khan academy is a great place for learning, main things it is totally free. But one things disappointed me that there is fewer course on web developing, please upgrade that section",
I always have to do this in math class snow it makes time fly by and you can have fun with this app only if you like it and smart.♥♥♥,
"Downloaded so I can learn when I'm away from my course materials. Unfortunately, no matter what I do the videos won't play.",
I love khan academy but this app has only videos no practice quizzes. It's the practice quizzes I love khan academy for so much and this app is not giving me access to them.,
As good as it can be. Simply the best over all other education projects. Definitely worth investing time and money as well. Keep it up guys. You are doing brilliant job.,
I absolutely love this app.  So easy to use and more importantly understand.  My grandchildren will benefit from this greatly.  Thank you. 😊,
"I am impressed by the content, delivery style and the diversity of this app!! A must recommendation for all those geeks, nerds and students out there!!",
"As an EMT, learning all I can about healthcare beyond the basics are truly helping me build the foundation for medical school. To top that, Khan academy helped me graduate high school, seriously, thank you.",
Very good learning app and very interesting. I don't understand the 391 people who rated 1star though.,
This is supposed to be the best educational app .It contains all necessary contents with brief explanations this is great work of Khan academy,
"Not visible in Tablet, please fix, cant search, look at my downloads, or profile etc",
Please fix it I need to do my homework and  I  will  give  you more  people to like you. So add the  questions please😊😊😊😊,
Couldn't download some videos to offline. When the download reaches at 50% or 69% it ceases.,
"Love the website but hope there will be more functions added to the app like all the practice quizzes after each section, as well as the  mastering topics section with questions. It'd also be great if a question/answer comment section is added like on the site.",
Very useful app one of the best ones you can find but i would give app 4 star for the simple fact that it doesn't provide exercises or quizzes to prove that we really have learned.,
Kahn  needs a pat on the back for this service I have learned so much from this app. The lectures are very professionally done and the people really believe in what there doing.,
Some sentences can't be viewed properly coz the texts get cut horizontally!!!!,
"This app is just simply great,all the education for free,thanks sal.It would be great if you would just add foundation Jee course for classes 9,10.....",
There's no way you could get a better app with free and quality education,
I've went to websites and apps but they don't really help but this one does and they explain it very step,
"Very good app. Got help understanding many concepts in the syllabus, preparing for the board exams",
Thank you for developing this app. It helps alot.,
"this app, salman khan and everyone else working with him is just amazing. love khan academy! khan academian for life. \m/",
I was very excited to learn on khan acadamy BUT it is very complicated you will never understand it for a heads up,
This app is great! Anytime I need a refresher on something that I did 25 years ago to help my daughter with her homework I go to Khan. Thank you for creating this app! Love it!,
Really excellent app for the students who really want their own smartphone to be their teachers. Really nice. In fact best.,
Amazing. This is really helping me brush up on subjects I need. I would and *will* surely recommend this invaluable service to everyone I know. Keep up the fantastic work❤❤👍👍👍👍,
You learn almost every thing for free,
Gave 4 star because i cant do mission challenge in the mobile app. Wish they had that option,
"I swear one day I'll take the time to study and investigate everything there is to learn...about how to use this overloaded, nigh-unusable app. Probably the day I want to send myself over the edge...",
"Keep up the good work Sal Khan, I congratulate you!",
Loved it! Helped bump my grades from bad ones (not telling) to high B's and A's,
This is one of the best free apps I have downloaded in awhile. Thanks Khan Academy!!,
"Awsome app , loved the video lectures , very easy to understand and its all in one place .    :)superb",
could not find a better app for young learners,
I have been a medical professional for over 25 years and in that time have certainly forgotten much of the details of what I initially learned in school with Khan I have been able to revitalize my career and my outlook on patient care through confidence in the knowledge I possess,
I love khan academy I just can't find quizzes for me to take like you can on the website!,
Was everything I needed to brush up on college material I forgot,
But I want to know how to change the language of the caption in the app. Thanks.,
I can't believe it has arrived!! I'm so happy. I love learning and Khan is the best! Thank you so much for this. Thank you for us Android users.,
I have used for my children's studies and it is just wonderful.,
This is the best app in the world... I don't think anyone else app is near it... Bill Gets also like this...,
No quizzes like what the site has is a real deal killer.,
This is the best educational app till now.,
Sal! You're da best!,
Loving the videos but can't answer questions to get badges kind of infuriating,
This by far the most educational app ever. Thank you very much,
Just get it.  It's free!,
Please add section where we can directly open the last section we are learning and subject.,
eg: 1.2x speed that will rly make the app btr! thx! great app btw,
The best pictorial representation for beginners,
Khan Academy is aware of every subject,
Helps me a lot in learning something new and ahead,
Nothing special about application but Content is GREAT!,
"I love how there is Math andnScience, but programming...LOVE!",
You provide videos in Urdu on YouTube but in this app all the videos  in English so I need some videos in Urdu,
"It's great, but you can't do anything on it. What I mean, is that you can't do any problems yourself, for practice. Other than that, everything else is great!",
It sucks,
Knowledge is everything and this app let you have it.,
You guys are doing a great job.. keep on educating us..,
I can learn my fav. subjects easily.THAnks to the app.,
I'm taking computer programing class and it is fun and it's teaching somthing:),
Well rounded app! With a bunch of awesome topics!,
Finally! A mobile version,
Please add Google/Chromecast support,
Thank you Khan Academy Helpful videos and amazing app.,
Oh my gosh thank you so much,
Nice application.. Keep improving it please,
The best there ever could be,
The best videos for education,
Thank you thank you  =D,
This is what society is about!  Sharing and learning.,
Not bad helps me with school.,

"Big thaaaanks, Sal!",
I loved this app and it helps with school,

BEST APP FOR LEARNERS,
Homeschooling enthusiast,
Studying is so east in khan Academy,
Continuous process. Thanks.,
This guy is the Goat.,
Why I can't move the app to my external memory? I don't have enough internal memory to download the videos,
Very good app and useful.,
Pls add storage location for offline videos,
الله يجازيه الخير اللي قام بهذا العمل,
Great,
Best app ever......thank a ton..!!,

Had been using Khan academy for so many years on my PC but the only feature I miss in the android version is the dashboard and the exercises,
No Organic chemistry??????,
Hhh,
"Possibly THE BEST app for students of almost any level or grade. An overwhelming assortment of videos and documents on almost every topic in math, biology, chemistry, physics and more. A user friendly interface that's easy to use and a wealth of resources to help the most inquisitive minds. 5 stars!! :D",
I wish you could put the challenges and test on the app. You could use the challenges only on a computer,
"Application crashes,  when I select any sub-sub unit of any subject and come on videos section. Application hangs on same screen and crashes. I have Samsung GT-I8262 and encountered this error in fine network.",
"Great learning tool, however the app layout is poor. The app also has no exercises, just videos. I'll just stick to the website",
"Love the offline access feature, however the informative articles are missing. I'd love it if I'd be able to access these outside of the website.",
Khan Academy is great but the App is not comparable to the Website. If there'd only be the dashboard it'd be a lot better already.,
This really helps me advance and study to my classes. I never found a successful way to study out of school grounds until I found Khan Academy,
Auto started I guess. didn't notice till it drained almost 20% of my battery. WHY THE HELL DOES THE APP NEED TO KEEP SENDING DATA THREW OUT  THE DAY WHEN IM NOT USING IT.,
"It was great before this new update. Now once I select a video from a subtopic, it doesn't play the video and it freeezes. It would be better if you add the challenges and questions after each lesson",
This app is perfect for any time you need to learn on your own. I found it the night before my final in College Algebra and it helped me a lot!,
"Would give this a 5/5, but I can't read the articles, work additional exercises, and take quizzes like I can on a CPU browser! Pleaaaase fix and I promise I will donate $10 monthly :) starting now until Dec 2016.",
I love how it goes you tutorials on how to do the subject and the new scratch paper update is awesome I'm totally giving five stars,
"Can you make the list of syllabus beside the video, just like the webpage, then it would be much easier to find the videos. Thanks.",
Keep It Up Khan. You Are Just Awesome.,
This is a great app it only needs cast support so I can see it on a bigger screen then it is a five star app,
"I really love the interface, and the fact that it has such a wide variety of subjects for all ages. No ads, and free too!! I really, really appreciate this, it's helping me with my math.",
"Its really good but please do add an somewhere for recommended videos which interest us, rater than just teach ! Like the video about Golden Ratio.. i want to watch more of those.   Awesome job by the way !!!!! Love the app way too much and trading it for nothing in its segment ! Cause nothing comes near...",
Make all A in your course work with this app. So amazing !,
The best help!!Thanks Sal for all the effort you put in the vids,
Good for every subject for college students and high school students,
"Nothing like learning with only a pen, a paper, and a video.",
Lots of video tutorials and all load very easily... The app was more than expected...,
A very good step for spreading education,
its avery awesome study app in the world for me!!!!,
"The app is great, but really needs Chromecast support! Is the app open source?",
It only deserves Five Stars!!!,
doesn't load interactive games and video size needn't be this big,
I was looking for this app since 2012. :),
It is the best way to learn.,
LOVE IT the hour of code was awsome,
Are added.... POW... 5 stars !!!,
"When i try to download videos of small size too using wifi of optimum speed,cannot download it, why?",
It is really fun for my children.,
Best e-learning app,
It is best coaching institution for all,
To learn total basic,
Unable to get some topics on app....which are available on web..,
😊😀😊👍👍👍,
I love it ! Great app!,
Made it easier for me to study...👍,
Exceptional....,
It says I have to sign in. How to sign up?,
The best!,
Great job.. very  useful app.,
Great app for students.,
Great work bro....,
Best app ever,
The best,
Is there programming?,
One of the best,
was given 5 star but now only 1 star. very poor guys. its disgusting every time I open a video it says couldn't load the video. Now I have to switch to YouTube again :'( it is my fav destination for learning and always will be. I hope you all will fix this soon.,
"if i want to work on a certain problem, i would usually use the search tool. the problem is, that i will now find individual videos. after having watched them, there is no way for me to watch the next video in the sequence, since the ""back button"" doesnt take me to the topic, but back to search. so now i have to find the video in the menu anyway, which makes the search option kinda useless. it would be nice if there was a ""watch next video"" button.",
"The Internet has made so much knowledge available to us, and that too for free. Still we insane people spend our time on futile Facebook and Twitter. Earlier people were thirsty for knowledge but they had limited resources and now we have unlimited resources yet not thirst.",
"Good content if a little narrow. The app works well, but does show some signs of being shunted over from the web, eg course materials which tell you to respond in the comments section, despite that feature not being available in the app (sadly). It's also a shame there's no way to mark an item as unread if you've opened it but not read it.",
I don't know how to tell how much i just loved this app and how much thankful i m for this app and this concept of free education. In India people have made education a business. It's like monopoly of salt( the most necessary thing) it's a life changing thing being done. Simply in love with this :),
"I was wandering for explanations for limits. When I came across this institute, I was amazed to understand every topic in it. Thank you.",
"TOTALLY USELESS AS IS! The app is useful on the apple platform, where you can practice the skills.  On the Android where you can only watch the explanation , its pretty useless for learning. Update the androids app with the same functionality and I will reinstall AND give 5 stars.",
I was so excited when I came across this app. I couldn't wait to delve into it and relearn what I've lost over the years and learn new things but everytime I touch on something I'm interested it force closes me out. Kinda broken hearted...,
"Absolutely spot on. Just introduce a night mode in the app. Where everything goes dark and dull, for the night owls.",
"I love Khan Academy and want to love this app, but the little interactive modules within the app to not display on my device, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.",
"It's important for us to have knowledge about diseases or others information that has includes in this apps.This apps is absolutely brilliant,I personally like it very much,very helpful to me as a science student.",
"I love what Salman khan has done. The appvis beautiful,  elegant and extremely reliable. It has everything what a student could hope to get for, that too,  in a mobile phone,  which is the best described for its potential of causing distraction.",
This is a powerful learning tool. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to the absence of a video speed modifier and the lack of a practice problems option. I eagerly await these improvements and will gladly change review.,
Very very essential app for students to continue their study. Students can't live without it. They can't fulfill their study without it. I hope it's success. Thanks to khan academy.,
I find this app confusing because when I'm on the website it shows all the stuff that I added or was recommended. With the app I can't see what me teacher recommended for me. And it is really hard trying to remember what the names of lessons are so it is hard to find what I'm looking for.,
Videos take a lot of space.It would be better with lower quality video.Expecting the option to practice exercises inside the app itself,
"Its an excellent initiative by khan academy. Even the web design is awesome, but it lacks subjects related to India say Indian economy, polity or say Indian curriculum. Hope it would be added too.",
Not a bad resource but it doesn't have anything on Esperanto. I give 4 starts for now for the great videos and range of subjects.,
This app this so awesome ... So we will learn to very good . but small u r not include in apps Hindi language...,
"I just love you guys. I LOVE YOU! One suggestion, please allow us to download entire sections. It's really hard to go through each video separately just to push the + button.",
We need comment box for question ❓ and answers conversation,
So wonderful for needy people who don't have money well prepared presentation keep it up,
"I love it. As a college student who sometimes needs brushing up on simple math, this is great review that is extremely easy to understand.",
It is obviously really effective in learning stuff anywhere and anytime...and it could be better if they provided practise options like the one on the web ....and mastery challenges 😃,
"Literally has everything you can think of including test prep such as the MCAT. It's amazing, very useful, and it's free. Highly recommend.",
"I love Khan Academy and was so excited when I found this app! However, it's only the videos! I need the practice problems. Until they get the practice problems, this app does nothing for me. I hope there will be an update soon!",
It's better if you add 240p 360p 480p options like in YouTube. As in India the bandwidths are low for most of the people and buffering takes more time. So if you can add this option users can fell comfortable.,
"It does got all the fundamental we need, nice app to get knowledge, don't hesitate just go for it",
"Great app, east to follow and understand even for a slow coach like me. Great stuff✋😎",
"I Like the Khan Academy app however, I would love it if I could do the exercises. Please add them ASAP I will edit my review and give 5 stars Thanks.",
Just installed few days back and it's not running already. I downloaded so many videos now the app won't run :( after removing the videos from the download folder it sometimes runs sometimes doesn't.,
"When I play a video of any subject, it only shows black screen playing.",
I love this app ! Its fun and the lessons are easy to follow. However i would love it if they gave test after each lesson. So we can tell if were learning anything or not :),
I Would like to be able to store courses off online on to my SD card instead of phone memory.,
"I am thankful for KahnAcademy and their great devotion to helping people who want to learn. Thank you very much, KahnAcademy.",
App crashes a lil too frequently but hands down the most productive app on Android.,
I was tired of playing videos from YouTube playlists Thanks a lot for the app.,
This app presents several topics of study in an eloquent manner and very understandable way.It's a very useful  app for learning,
In this you can add features like jotting down something from the videos into pin notes which may be helpful. Also if exercises on each chapter are added it'll be great. Thanks Sal. KA,
Khan you are my inspiration.. Your videos helped me a lot to succeed in my collage ..  And Nice app :)),
It's wonderful for viewing the videos. Can't wait until testing functionality is available.,
Khan Academy has given my the special gift of not having an excuse to waste my time on hours of YouTube videos.,
"will be cool to have a share button for videos or have a friend listo to share with inside the app, also will be cool chromecast support.",
The only thing this app is missing are the exercises and the ability to play for Chromecast on the videos would be a nice feature!,
"Was working before update, now crashes when opening.",
"Khan Academy is great by itself. This app is good, but ability to download videos on a sd card is missing.",
I can watch videos but I can't do any actual problems or equations.,
I can't study aat offline mode,
Had a lot of bugs. Now it's completely fixed. Plz add the tests. It'll be the best thing ever!,
Great app I liked it very much. Very useful for studies.. Thank you,
Wondering why I didn't use this in my school days,
Really disappointed. It crashes as soon as I open it.,
This is a revolution. An intellectual revolution. Thank you Mr Khan for this.,
The videos are not running. Please tell me the issue and solve it quickly.,
"App is great. Except some bugs, which can be fixed ASAP",
"We can learn anything thanks for a brilliant app, helps a lot",
It's gonna be great if you put exercise for each subject :D,
Thank you an excellent app for learning or I should say the only real non profit app for learning,
It teaches us about all the subjects,
I would love information on drivers tests like class A licenses,
An amazing well structured app with tons of information that makes learning fun!,
So helpful ive been using this since 4th grade,
Great app and now I know haw to code and program,
Well but... I can not wtite here my answer to box,
I would like to see the challanges and skill tree with offline availability,
Hats off. for the makers !!the best app I had seen till now,
Awesome,
😤 why is there only video's instead of doing it are self's😒,
This application is laid out beautifully and is very useful.,
"This khan Academy helped me very much so far, thanks for who ever is teaching us these subjects :D !!!!",
"Easy to use, amazing well explained videos... All the information we need is here. Thank you!",
Needs more topics and subjects such as english etc.,
Needs video playback speed controls at least  to 2.5 or 3x,
This app is great for school revision!!,
Best online accedmy  then other,
"Can't find Web designing and development... ex.(html,css)",
Why doesn't the video load.Please fix the problem,
Love this app,
i like it very much.its a very good app .,
.,

Very good for tomorrow  labor,

Very very helpful aap,
Helps me a lot in learning,
"When I open a video lecture, it keeps buffering and the app closes unexpectedly. Please fix this.",

It have everything i may need but it wont let me play a single video nor login... It wont let me do anything...,
crashing continously,
Very great,
Best app ever,
So educational,
My teacher given us a class code in K.A and I can't find where to write it. Response ASAP. Thanks,
Great app for learning,
amazing app,
Just waiting for excersizes,

I love it,
Great app,
ultimate app,
Nice app,
Need more about electronics,
Great,
Cool,
Loved it,
Just Thank You !!!,
Thanks to sal,

"Loved the website. It helped me caught up with my division skills and helped me pass my compass test for Community College. And I highly suggest this app for parents and their kids. And the site is also just as good too if you don't own a phone or tablet. Or for those who struggle with math like I do and want to catch up with it. The guy even offers free videos with charts to understand multiplication, division, subtraction etc.",
"I use the exercise modules the majority of the time, so it's a bummer to find out that they're not featured. Also, it seems the videos aren't properly syncing watched progress across devices. Could we expect an update implementing them in the future? I hope... EDIT: New update crashes app everytime.",
"I have always love videos by Khan Academy. However, the apps does not have features similar to mobile view of the web such as the sequence of videos. whats next and next that I should watch. So my learning process is kinda a mess. I jump from the first video to the fourth not knowing I did it.",
"When I open any video from this app its video does not move forward while the audio moves forward,the line at bottom moves without any visual movement,please solve this problem as soon as possible.",
I love the app and all you do please Add English Study in all forms.,
Some people are better at learning through exercises than just videos. Please incorporate that soon on the app.,
Almost perfect for learning but videos don't load. Please help. Thanks.,
Absolutely amazing app and academic academy.  Knowledge is power!,
Good app. Can you add to the app learning new languages as a course...,
I thought you could continue with exercises on the app not only watch the videos.,
I need help in algebra nd it was there to help out,
Video doesn't play,
For exercises to be available,
A bit limited at the moment.,
The Best app Ever .....And 100times better than biju,
i love this app,
Cool,
"It would be nice if it included exercises, but I don't know that they would scale well to smartphone-screen sizes. As it stands this app is great for viewing the academy's video library. Personally, I download a bunch of videos on a particular topic to watch while commuting on the train or on my break at work in preparation to do the exercises on my computer when I get home. Great work guys, keep it up!",
"The new version of this app is beautifully organized. I like that the videos have a list below them of points in the video to jump to with brief captions. It is too bad that there are no practice activities in this app, but I understand they are problematic on mobile devices and would require a lot of redesigning time to work comfortably with the mobile platform. For now, if I really want to do the practices and challenges on mobile, I can use the khanacademy website. Great app for viewing the videos.",
"Fantastic app! Don't know when this came out, but I'm glad that finally there's an official app. I really like how they have all the subtitles below the videos, this way you can quickly skim through and skip the parts that you already know. Navigation could be improved, I'd appreciate if the start screen shows the index of the topic that I'm currently studying instead of a list of related videos. Swipe menu from the left would be good too.",
"Without Khan Academy, I wouldn't be able to study physics as I currently do; It helps me learn everything on my own, as a person who cannot understand too much from just reading. Great organization and now a good app.",
"I'm running Android 5.0. JavaScript sections don't show up at all, and some tutorial sections cannot be loaded at all. Shame, such a promising app. I'd give it a 5 if it weren't for these bugs that essentially render the app unusable.",
I love this app! Very excited for both me and my 6 year old to do this every day. Only question is there a way to have different accounts on one app? That way I can work on my gaps and my 6 year old can work on his stuff too. Please let me know if this is something we can do. Thank you,
But always it force close on my galaxy ace plus . I couldn't watch any of the video,
"Not a single video manages to play correctly. Useless, just like when I tried this app on another android device.",
I never knew there was an app for this. Everything is fine except for i cant organize my downloaded videos under respective titles/sections. Every videos comes in a single place. Please fix that.,
Great app! Cant view any articles and it would be great if you guys could put in playlists so we can group all the revelant subjects of our own (ie subjects and topics we are studying) into our own little playlist.,
"Study become handy. But why i cannot find ""Magnetic Flux and Faraday's law"" in the physics category anywhere through this app.",
"My eyes almost popped out when I discovered that you guys finally had an app. I remember that a few months ago, I was dying for there to be a Khanacademy app since I didn't have a lot of access with using a laptop. Man, I'm so happy.",
"I much prefer the computer version. I like the way I can treat my knowledge and track my progress, which I can't do in the app.",
"I love Khan Academy but if I'm connected to wifi or data, when I launch the app it will crash. Please please fix. Still crashes",
This app has helped me in all my studies and important concepts that I missed out on. Great app. I highly recommend life learners and school students to download this app.,
This is very useful for anyone trying to learn. Khan Academy is outstanding especially in terms of math lessons. My teacher recommended it to me and I have enjoyed it ever since. :),
"I like the app and the fact that all the videos are available on my phone, but there are no interactive lessons available. I know they may not scale well but a offering none is kind of a deal breaker.",
"Normally, I would have given this a 5 star review, but this version is drastically less useful, compared to the ios version. Now, I cannot practice lessons, only watch the videos 😡",
U can only watch the videos but how would you do the exercises on the phone except for a few ones. So I think it's awesome. Keep up the good work,
Has great videos but many times it just shows not responding. Pls fix this. Overall very good,
I like khan academy and its layout and idea of how education should be. But this is literally my last hope if I have any chance of passing my PAT I hope I learn fast!,
I love the app and Khanacademy but am really waiting for those exercise as they tell me when to take a look again at that video.,
"A lot of interesting topics but the video platform needs to improve by utilizing the sensors properly, and stuffs to practice should be added",
Wonderful & innovative. Khan academy help us to Learn easily & also we can teach our children by the concept we get here,
Amazing App ! But a minor problem is that it is not moving app data (downloaded for offline) to SD CARD. Phone is running low internal memory please resolve this issue.,
"This is the best website for education where everything is free to learn. The math are totally very-very good. Well, for physics you just upload a new video and that good... i love it. Thanks for everything...i rate khan academy 5 star.",
"It's a great tool for students           and adults alike, or if you are just into learning history, math, art, computer skill.",
Cool app however I mostly use you guys for practice questions and that's not part of the app. 😕,
I've given three stars only because I love Khan Academy. None of the videos are working.,
"""Superb app""; no need to see reviews .u can blindly install it without hesitation .such an wonderful app",
"Such a great man, thanx a lot for  keeping this app open for every one. Allah bless u.",
"It is a good app that helps a lot and is very interesting, but it woud be better if you could do the exercises on here and maybe add the canadian math on here not just u.s",
I am using this after...when my friend told me. This is really the best one as my friend has told me. Thank you friend.,
I can't believe this is free. Thank you for all your hard work on this service.,
Please help,
"I find it great that this is an app now, it makes khan academy much more portable.",
Only audio is coming when watching the video why this ? PLZ help out app is good but no of  no use for me ...only audio is cming ;(,
I love this and it it Good for children and teens,
"Useful for specific and general learning, be that brushing up on skills or learning from scratch.",
"It's been a couple of years since I found this website while browsing stuffs about Salman Khan (the actor).. and now I'm a bigger fan of Salman Khan (the educator). Thanks again,  Sal. Love from India.",
Well done. This is one of the best initiatives that serves the humanity...,
Finaly its for android now i have it on the go sweet. I do have one sugestion however i would like for you to add computer programing i.e html and java like in the official website if its not to much to ask,
I don't know why do we go to school when most of the stuff is is already here! God bless the creators!,
"Otherwise cool, could also add the minimal view like in the YouTube app!",
I love Khan Academy so much! Just hope the app can support Chromecast in near future!,
This has been a helpful app in so many ways.,
Great app and site. Teaches me everything.,
Needs exercises for a 5 star rating. Awesome for a free app though.,
Its good..but as I opened it it says unfortunately khan academy has stopped...: (,
"Would be perfect if it had Chromecast support. Otherwise, really great",
The web version is solid. Deserves a 5/5 regardleas,
You guys are doing excellent job...god bless Khan Academy,
I recommend for all the students of classes IX to XII. This will help you a lot!,
I've been waiting for this app! Finally here! Does this app support Chromecast? Doesn't appear to. Watching the videos on my tv would make the learning experience 10x better. Thanks Sal....you are changing the world.,
Great classes all for free,
That's is best app to get the knowledge of every subjects easy,
I would use my phone almost every day and I  would always forget to do my homework,
Awesome for doing my math work and studying,
I am a Muslim and I support Muslims and their work.,
"Would give it a five star rating except for the fact there are no exercises. Otherwise, it's really good.",
Just needs a way to speed up video playback,
Overall good app but definitely needs exercises plz add,
I use Khan Academy at home and school to help me improve in all subjects,
It will not let me sighn into google!!! Please fix this.,
"Amazing app for learners, even easy access is motivating to learn",
Its great but it would be perfect if it it had chromecast capabilities,
So much to learn. Thank you KA 😄,
Khan Academy is the best math and science educational tool ever!,
Loveeeeeee it,
I love  the  way  people  show  you  how  to  do  stuff  your  behind,
An an app I've waitied two years for this...thank you khan academy,
امتحانش کنید، عاشقش میشید. فقط زبانش انگلیسیه.,
"Its free, what else do you need",
A must have app for every student.,
Yaaay! A mobile app,
"One recommendation,  please add chromecast function to app",
I really liked the transcript below every video.,
Will be fun to see if it works.,
This app is the best learning app ever,
Please add quiz feature to this app... Why can't we browse the quiz ?? We really need it! 5 stars if you've updated it with this feature,
It's really the best app I had ever seen. But they should also include excersises in it.,
Thanks for all you do !,
I love this app. It's very helpful,
"I've loved this all for my kids, my class, and me.",
Please put Chromecast support on the app. It's desperately needs it,
Best education app ever😎,
Really a great app! Thank you!,
So happy to have it now on my phone I have had Khan academy for almost 4 years since 3 grade lol and it has helped me tremendously all hail to Khan,
I was so happy I twro up,
"you guys are great, thank you really!",
Wonderful app for understanding of any concepts,
Best app I have ever used,
Because its free,
I can not do anything but watch videos,
So all you have are videos wow real muture,
Simple and best application for learning.,
Best teaching now on android phone,
That is awesome application for learning,
A good app try it,
Easy to use. What a gift,
Yess I do this everyday in First period math.  NOW I CAN AT HOME,
Cannot use Google sign-in,
I have downloaded the app today and whrn i go to a topic it doesnt show me the video,
Thanks for the amazing help!!,
There are only video's,
Videos don't play,
Please ×1000^x where x &gt;=2 add support for chrome cast I beggggggg yoooouuuuu,
Werner's theory and its theory is missing,
🙅😾💩,
Great app!!,
No description about it !!!!!#,
I got this to do math not watch math!!!!! How can you only do math on iPads!!!! this is stupid!!!!,
No limits just progress,
I am 13year old girl and homeschooled,
None of the videos open .,
The best educational app,
Freaking love ut!? Best app ever!,
No option to download videos in different qualities?,
Perfect for everyone..,
Amazing job...,
Add exercises please!,
Best Educational App,
Very nice,
"I can't practice lessons and only can watch them, please change it back so we can practice online.",
The best,
Great stuff,
Loved it,
Good app,
Thank you!,
Where are the questions?,
Awesome,
Best,
Awesome,
"Seriously, this is something 👌👌👌",
,
"Okay everyone has been telling that the exercises are needed. I am totally for it.  Also in terms of the app, lot more needs to be done. 1. The video downloads can have option to reduce the quality to reduce the video size. A 2 minute video is 40 mb. This is HD quality. 2. While downloading, in the notification something funny is happening. The notifications keep shuffling. 3. Option to change storage location to SD card",
I want to do problems not just videos like come on what the point if that app don't have the problems to do like online it's point less to me,
This app and the website behind it are truly great-being able to watch educational videos at a whim on such a wide topical variety is a convenience of the 21st century.   What is inconvenient is the lack of dashboard and EXERCISES.  Both missing stars are for the exercises.,
"I waited a long time for this app, and it is absolutely amazing. If you use Khan Academy at all, you should definitely try this app.",
This is  a app that my school uses and it teaches us a lot more than in school. It also lets us practice skills in a rewarding way.,
"For their first attempt for an android app. It's great and polished. It would be even better if this had Google Cast integration for streaming video content to Chromecast, Android TV or some DLNA products.",
"Although the apps not perfect, but the aims of this app are wonderful. It really help me a lot in distant learning",
The videos help me understand more. It's very easy to follow. I love the keep video offline feature.,
"A good app to learn the basics of new things, Sal explains stuff in a really easy-to-understand manner. The app is really useful for learning.",
"I am in AP physics, and I don't always understand the teacher. But this app saves my life and it explains everything! It also helps me a lot in AP World and Pre-Calc H! I would definitely get this app",
An option to choose the quality of the video for viewing can be really helpful. So that the user will be able to adjust it according to his download limit and bandwidth.,
"Every  single download starts at 50% and then doesn't progress at all for the rest of the day. And I can't see any of the videos,  it just shows a black screen until I press back,  then it shows the pause/play buttons for like one second  before going back",
It crashed when I tried to open it multiple times :( please fix this. I already really love Sal's videos and it has helped me on numerous occasions.,
"I'm so happy i found this app. Its nice to go back to my elementary math to nclex. From now on, no more boring days for me. Thank you so much",
Best thing to happen to education since the printing press. Would love to have exercises available on the app; my students would be much more consistent in their efforts :),
"An absolute necessary for every students. Well planned,well executed. One suggestion only : please introduce a discussion mode so that students could ask questions to the lecturers & get specific reply.",
I Do Believe That Salman Have Done Something Revolutionary.. Proud to Be A Bangladeshi.. We Are Encouraged By Him Deeply; This Is Great Even In Android App.,
I'm getting straight A's in AP classes just because of this app and website. Thanks Sal.,
"It's a superb and fantastic app that gives lot of knowledge in various topics, in a planned way.  Hatsoff to you Mr Khan for your contribution to you society.",
This app won't let me sign in without constantly crashing. I really hope this problem is fixed because this is a great site for anyone who needs help with math.,
Samsung Galaxy Note5. Fully functional and very easy to use. The sections are very well structured and the content is extremely informative. Some additional content would be good but keep up the great work you guys! P.S. it would be wonderful to have a section dedicated to I.T./CompSci/Programming etc... just a thought. Thanks!,
"When I try to play a video, the screen freezes and the video display screen remains black and it returns to the home page! Please fix it!",
"Just like the website, although some things are harder to look at on a smaller screen, good menu design",
"Really glad to have this on android now, it's a great help and the videos explain everything so clearly",
1. The math exercises are not there  2. you can't ask questions like in the website.                                                        3. Some of the pictures in the articles don't show.                                               Would be great if u guys could solve these in the next update!,
"I have tried many educational apps. And so far it's the best. Interesting, nicely organized. And the best part, we get to learn in chunks, great job Sal.",
"one of the best app ,but it is disappointed to see that it has only 100 thousands download",
"Simple and easy to use, Definitely the best app I ever used. It's a MUST have app to me. Big thanks to Salman Khan for education people... برنامج بسيط و سهل الإستخدام، من أفضل البرامج التي إستخدمتها.",
This app just saved me from getting low grades in my Algebra class.,
"App is goos but you can only play videos, no skills exercises, can't keep track of my skill progress and do mastery challenge",
Guys! You are the best app developers in the world.BUT my only one requestis that please make available the option to change language in the app.,
If there was a option to download the set viseos as whole section or topic would be awesome. Also maybe even a dummied down version of answering questions too would be beneficial!! Thanks!,
Best app and site for children to learn. Its have to be broaden in economically poor countries.,
I just wanted to know if it's possible to do the activities about pixar in a box,
"I think that it is an amazingly created app, especially considering that Khan academy relies solely on donations. I think their next update should include exercises and big fixes. I think Sal stands for a great and important cause, and he deserves to be thanked for all his hard work along with everyone who helped make this so amazing! Keep at the hard work guys!!!!!",
The best app ever created. Very educational especially for math.,
"Works well, great interface, and the offline video storage is FANTASTIC (most important feature in my opinion).  Some other features I'd like to see, in order of most to least desired: variable playback speed, and exercises.  For anyone looking to speed up playback, you can search through your files (Android&gt;org.khanacademy.android&gt;Files&gt;Download) and play the video with another video player such as VLC.  In general, great work folks.",
It crashed when i tired to play videos multiple times. Fix this,
I love this so much. Its value me alot.,
Intellectually prepared material.No comparison with another. Really well done guys.,
It is good app but it doesn't allow  the mobile to save it on memory card.,
What a great app,
"If you want to learn anything,try this app.",
Contents are perfect but the app is young.Needs exercises like the web,
This is a great app. Would be better if the videos from the app would be castable to Chromecast.,
Love It! Best Educational Service Online So Far.,
This is very useful app I have ever seen,
I miss the option to change speed and to play in the YouTube app,
Super fast buffering of  videos even in 2G network. Enhancing good and clear concepts really worth it,
"The best in app store , just superb !",
It tells us about every topic very clearly!!,
Mathematics at it's best.,
Awesome ..really awesome,
I HAVE BEEN waiting for this app like FOREVER and it's finally here and it's GREAT!!! THANKS,
Just few problems while playing videos online..,
Videos still don't show up after the update,
This application is so beautiful that I can't change it,
Please add feature for increasing the speed of the video.,
Everytime i try opeaning a ny video it says cant load video,
Best For Learning,
Intestine and easy to use,
Wss,
Very good app it helps  alot🙌🙌👌✌,
"Thank u for providing this app for free,  it is really helpful, makes me better to understand the concepts of chemistry, and physics. ☺😊👍👌✌",
It's good for Help in study,
It really helped me with my math,
I really can almost learn everything FREE !!! And even offline !!!!!,
the best team i everseen.....   i love khan academy,
I can't seem to find the exercises for Math? When will you add them?,
Allow downloaded videos to be stored on SD card,
This is amazing!,
Fantastic!,
Amazing.....!!!!❤❤,
decent fun free,
Thanks to SALMAN KHAN,
Very helpful 👏👏👍👍,
I'll pass this semester!,
Just great.,
Superb..,
Best app for learning,
I just loved it,
Khan should be the president of the world,
Thank you sal,
It does,
Needs all Playlists,
Love it,
Thank you!,
Hate it,
awsome,
Is it possible to add this? So that I don't have to use a computer to check my kids progress. Thanks in advance!,
I need to do this for school. And I can't because it's only vide0(#｀-_ゝ-)::&gt;_&lt;::,
Dont get me wrong this is an awesome app but i think they should add exercises. I am very impressed and owe alot of gratitude to the developers as nothing costs money on here (liks other apps do) and they created this not for wealth but to become useful to children (and adults) worldwide. We are very lucky to have people like this in our universe. :),
"The app feels so crisp and quick, I can tell much work has been put into the performance of the app. As far as everyone complaining about the lack of exercises that's understandable, but adding that functionality while maintaining acceptable performance is very difficult I'd imagine. Give it some time folks",
I a senior citizen (69 yrs).  Its been a while since I been active on Khan.  I really love the program.  I wish I had this when I was in school.  I know that I would have done a lot better in school.  I have told all the children and adults about the program.   I even talked to the medical people that I come in contact.  They all have come back and thanked me.  They and their children learn a lot and enjoy the system.    Please keep improving the programs and adding others.  I hope you never charge for the use of the programs.  (Papa) Ben Deffendoll,
"Please don't listen to the many reviews stating that they wanted exercises in this app. In no way, shape, or form did Khan Academy promise this and then fell short. These users are giving low ratings based on their own expectations and nothing that was set by Khan Academy. As a video/lesson archive, this app works perfectly and that's why I gave it 5 stars.",
"I understand the lack of exercises for the most part, but it's a bit weird that there is only a video library, and the written articles are inaccessible(especially funny considering that the app's preview images show an article on acceleration). Going to a topic list in the app feels strange because only the videos are visible while the written articles are not. Additionally, I think the app should show the energy gained for watching the video, and it should also tell you how much energy you earned today.",
"I LOVE Khan Academy, but I think that the app has one major flaw: the lack of practice problems! It really undermines the relevance of the app, since I may as well just use my browser where I get the videos AND the practice problems. I think it also diminishes the focus on the value of practice, which I think should really be front & center. Otherwise, thank you for providing free education to everyone! :)",
"I love Khan l and their online site. The site allows you to not only learn from the very informative and well made videos, but practice those skills you learn as well. That is something the app is currently missing. It would be great if I could practice my skills on the go without the use of a browser to do so. I give 3 stars due to this issue.",
"This is a great app. Please add a lock button to lock the screen when a video is playing to prevent accidental touches etc. Also when I add a video to favorites I want to be able to quickly get to the next videos of the same list from it. Right now I have to constantly go look for exact spot where that video was (which section ) and continue from there...for the farther future, add the ability to complete exercises from the app, would be great on Notes devices etc...thanks.",
Today I loaded Khan Academy onto my Xperia Z Ultra. I started in on the computer courses and found that it has a problem displaying some of the items most probably the Java items I'm not sure why. I would hope that in the updates to follow they'll be able to fix this as the computer type courses are not usable from this device.  I should also be able to rotate the phone 90 degrees to better read and see the items in the courses.,
"No exercises, no good way to know what videos you've already watched, no way to continue where you left off on your profile. There are plenty of third party apps who already did everything here. The YouTube app even has all the features this does... the videos.",
I needed so much help right now and of course the app doesn't work. In every category none of the videos will load and I can't log in with me old account or Google plus. This isn't the first time khan has disappointed me I don't know why I thought things would be different this time. Thanks a lot Khan.,
"I love the layout of this app and the ease of finding all the videos, but the lack of practice questions is kind of disappointing. I'm currently using the CK12 app's exercises as a stop gap, but I'd rather use Khan Academy (no offense to their program, I find it very useful!)",
"I've been waiting for Khan Academy to land on the android platform ever since I started using its website, everything about Khan Academy is so intuitive and interesting, I wish I had known it sooner! Thank you guys so much for all that you do, I was over the moon when I tried the beta app (it worked excellently!) and I'm absolutely looking forward to how this app will grow in future updates. Keep it up! 💖",
I have always loved Khan Academy. But with my busy life I am with a device more often than a PC or laptop. So this is just awesomesauce. I signed in with my regular account in seconds. Video played fine with my Note 5. Gave a four instead of a five because I haven't dug into the app completely yet.,
"I'm glad they are making apps for Khan, but I'd love to be able to do the math work on the app and not just have videos. It'd be great for my kids as well as myself as we are always on the go.",
This is just a video library.  Not an application to allow your kids to use a tablet or phone to do their Kahn Academy work.  Lame.,
Please improve the responsiveness during offline downloading and please add the feature of automatic redownload along with till where it had previously progressed...,
Can't thank Khan academy enough for all these learning resources. Thank you for uploading so many useful resources online.,
"Not pleased with the fact of invasive permissions and absolutely no exercises. Seriously, what is the point? Uninstalling until exercises are included. Also,I see no reason why you need to know my account names, number I'm calling or ANY information such as that. I'm here too learn, not supply my personal data. Good day.",
I joined Khan Academy for the exercises. I'm quite disappointed that this app doesn't have them. Hopefully they will be added.,
"The app is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The response is quick and smooth whenever the user is interacting with it. 3/5 so far, can't wait for the future updates.",
I love khan. It helps me understand math and I use it a lot. I would love to be able to work on exercises on the app to continue mastering subjects on the go,
When I'm online I don't want to be watch school videos. Thanks to this app I can now download a lot of lessons to watch off line. Very good app. Fast and effective!!!! As for the activities that's a bummer hopefully you will put that in the next update,
"The scrolling text is great but it would be better if you could post questions and concerns in the videos like online. Also, the exercises would be great to have as well.",
I am great full for being able to explore the things that I want to learn at any Given time of my convenience. I can always do the exercises on my computer.,
"People complain that it's lacking exercise. I say, you shouldn't unless you're actually paying them.",
"The app is good but many videos don't play they just show Khan academy logo and voiceover but no video, also its just a video library, add some exercises that would be beneficial",
"The first thing I tried to look at was world history, but the video stops every few seconds catch up to itself. I gave up for now. I'll check back in a few days.",
"The general consensus of the commentary seems to be directed at the lack of exercises in the Application. Other than that, this is a very helpful Application and I would recommend it to my friends.",
"I really appreciate this app.  But unfortunately I can't play the video,  when I play the video,  suddenly it takes me back to the previous page. Please fix it soon",
"The videos are in YouTube anyway, disappointing. Awesomeness of KA comes from the practices and the gamified approach; the app doesn't use much profile info either (would've been nice to see customised suggestions on what to watch, at minimum).",
This is a great app to learn new things. The team of Khan academy is doing a great job. There is only one problem the app does not support landscape mode. It would be helpful if it does support landscape in the later versions.,
"The exercises I feel are the most helpful part of Khan Academy, and to see them missing is unfortunate. Still a good app though.",
I am taking college courses and I find the lack of courses available on the app for quick study on the go discouraging. Please add all subjects!,
I donate to Khan Academy and love their site. One of the best features are the exercises and those are missing from the app.,
The work the people are putting in at the Khan Academy is excellent. It is probably one of the reasons why I passed one of the toughest exams of tenth grade. I thank you all.,
"Add exercises please!!!!  I love Khan Academy, but the exercises are what's best about it. Please add them; it would make me and so many other people be able to really take advantage of this monumental opportunity to progress our learning like never before.",
"I love that you added crash course to the videos, and amazing app. Only complaint I have is that the videos replay from the beginning if you exit out of them, it would be convenient if you could start were you last left off.",
The videos break down the materials in an easy to comprehend way. I hope the app is just as good.,
Man I would have done so much better in school if I had this app when I was in school. Going on  35 i love to still watch videos of math that have ideal how to do.,
Which is why this app is such a disappointment. This app is just a video library. I can already watch informative videos on any topic through YouTube. Please add the skill practices which make Khan the wonderful program it is.,
I like that videos are under categories which are easy to choose from. The biggest disappointment is the lack of Chromecast support - hope this is coming soon.,
I wish the design was a little more material but you really can't complain for the amount of content you receive with this app.,
Bummer that it does not include the exercises... It is still pretty much useless for helping my kids. There were viewers already available that gave the video library.,
"The app is good but many features of the site are missing, which are an essential part to the Khan Academy experience. Hope they are updated soon in the app version.",
"Believe me guys i never give 5 stars any one apps but when i download it and then read it it's help me a lot plz must download it if want to become an officer's, Engineer, Doctors and scientists...... much more",
"I am in a graduate program, and am taking advanced Chemistry and Anatomy & Physiology. Khan Academy has proven useful multiple times, and I'm glad it's made its way to the app store!",
"I love that there is an official Khan Academy app now. Overall it works great, but I would like to see the option to control the playback speed of the videos like you can on the website.",
"It's a great service but like others have mentioned, exercises would be my primary use.",
"It keep kicking me out when i tried to access a video. It need to be checked again, please",
"I'm so happy Khan finally made an official app! It's lovely, near perfect, and works almost like the desktop site. I just have a few requests please add the ability to change the rate of video playback. Please add the ability to turn on and off subtitles. Please add the questions.",
A suggestion: please keep 5/10 sec back and forward options when video is playing. This will help user to understand the concept in better and easy way.,
"I agree with the others, KA should and practice questions/exercises to help the lock in the lessons learned in the videos.",
"This is a fabulous app, I really like it. I highly recommend it for school and college students in my home country Pakistan.",
It is a grate app I loved it and really helps me in my studies espicially math and physics couz when I dont undrestand andything this app help me to undrestand . Thanks .I hope everybody can yse this ..... :),
I like the website of khanacademy compare to an khanacademy app because there is no excercises to train your brain. But this app is helpful by the way. I'll just rate 3 stars but pls add exercises soon. Thank you and God bless! :),
I have been waiting for this a while now and it is a good app but it would be nice if there were review questions and written lessons instead of JUST videos.,
Some contents do not load properly especially interactive content. I couldn't complete the course on algorithms because of this. Please fix,
"Nice app! I love the offline availability, but sadly it is not easy to add multiple videos at once.",
"No ads,no popups to review about the app and clean ui.You cannot find an educational app better than this.",
"It's a beautiful app, the only things that it seems to be missing are: exercises, the ability to speed up the videos and the ability to comment! Solid work otherwise.",
"Just speechless, its great to see such good and organised teaching for free! Great work Khan Academy!!",
"For the people who say it lacks features like exercises, just wait. the app was released a few days ago you can't expect to work at its full potential yet",
"Very pleased with the app so far. Looks great, videos load quickly (and have an offline version), and I suspect the captions are very useful as well.   What I'd be interested in seeing in future versions - Exercises - More organisation for the offline videos (so navigation was easier) - The ability to bulk download videos (rather than individually).  Thanks for the development and the teaching, an excellent tool",
I just can not belive that there is finaly a khanacademey app for the android😍 i haven't tried it yet but i am sure it will be amazing...,
Would have been a lot better if one could actually select what storage to use for the downloads; phone memories aren't always liberating as external memory,
It's an awesome app for those who want to learn new things and want to become successful in studies.,
"app works great. I wish they would add the exercises, that's what I mainly use with KA",
"There's no exercises, only videos. It does not follow what you are doing on the site.",
"Misleading name, this should be called ""Khan Academy Video LIbrary"" because that really is all there is to this app, Khan Academy is more than just the videos, without skill practice or mastery challenges this app is pointless.",
"It's a shame, Khan Academy is one of the best websites in the world in my opinion, but I was hoping to do the exercises and unfortunately the app is only a video library.",
I want to stream videos to a chromecast device.,
Every time I try to open the app it crashes.. please fix this then I will rate 5 stars..,
I think for just starting up its a great app and I can't wait to see what come next.,
"I love Khan academy, been following them for a while. I'm so excited about this App!",
Thanks Khan Academy to bring it on Android platform.,
"Nothing is displayed in the video,it remains as black up to the end.please help me",
Just add the practice tests and this would be perfect!,
"This apps helps when when I'm struggling with something at school, amazing app keep it up.",
Thanks khan for providing all of America with the ability to learn. And although their aren't any practice section in the app it's a great start!!!!!,
"Not a video person,  I rather solve problems.  I would watch only when I learn a new subject.",
"Although a very well designed app and intuitive to use, the whole app is just a glorified video player with organised sections and updated material.  Without the math exercises and computer science coding facility, this app is no different to the pre-existing khan academy clone apps.  Please add the exercises and then I will give you have 4 stars. 5 if it allows me to practise coding",
"I like the Idea of khan.Mainly because I learn alot of new things!,thank you!",
This app is amazing! I'm going to use it for learning to high school exams! Developers - BIG THANK YOU!,
Your help really bring happiness to our life... You're one of the best organization I've ever seen  thanks you SAL Bro and your team ^^,
"You cant do any lesseons, only watch videos. This app is a waste of time and a piece of useless junk on devices!!",
"welcome to android! finally! The app could use some improvements which I have no doubt will come. I love what you guys do it is greatly appreciated, keep it up👍",
"Even there isn't any Programming course there... I think my expectation for this app is just too high, I think I just can do what I can do on the website, but nope... Hope you add more thing to this app... For the design, it's ok though...",
"I'm currently doing an MBA, having papers this week. And this app literally helped by leaps and bounds! You guys are the best. Thank you for your amazing efforts ♡",
Videos only. What a disappointment. Why even bother releasing an app,
I joined a while ago and love the ability to share lessons and practices with my students. I'm super excited to share this app with them!!,
"I have always had trouble with math, but now it's much easier for me to reference with this nifty tool!!! I also use with my little one, thank you so very much!!! It is much appreciated!!!",
Just videos not promblems on algebra im in 7th grade and i need help idont need videos i nedd work promblems,
Thank you all for being one of the main reasons for my A in statistics class!,
Wonderful UI and contents. But it would be better if there are exercises like web version has.,
As homebound teacher. ..so useful due to parents lack  computer access,
"This is honestly the most useful app on my phone.. i'm so glad they opened a mobile interface because it's incredibly easy to go through the video archives now! The only feedback i have is to be able to change the order of videos in ""my list"" - i like to treat this section as a ""to do list"" for videos to watch, and I want to be able to put videos in the order they are supposed to be watched in. Other than that it's a beautiful app, thank you so so much for creating it!",
"I wish video would remember where I stopped to continue watching, not restarting from beginning",
"As a family medicine physician, I am amazed with the resources available to today's students. After reviewing the O2 diffusion lecture and statistics probability lecture, I am now a fan. Great job!!!",
"Finally the official app, and it works great. Exercises will be welcome when available in the app, but this is a great first step.",
Most of the explanations are great and easy to understand.,
No exercises and doesn't sync with website account.,
Not really useful in comparison to training on the website,
The app is quite helpful and informative!! Add an option to transfer all downloaded vids to SD card storage!,
I.want to say that it's very good for lurning. But I want some kinds of engineering leason's in it add it please :-),
Outstanding effort !!! Couldn't be better!! Contains everything that a young mind inquires or is curious about.   ONE THING U GUYS CAN UPGRADE IS No. OF QUESTIONS !!  Thanks a lot !!,
"Amazing video tutorials, and the subjects are explained exceptionally well.",
Please add the exercises! Learning would be better if you do add them.,
finally on Android! tho there're still a few issues. Thank you!,
"I'm with all the other reviewers, love Khan Academy, was hoping for the exercises",
Been having to use the desktop for far too long! Amazing!,
"I haven't found HTML CSS in the app.  Will you pls add HTML ? I cannot access khan academy on my laptop,thought this app will have it but my badluck. Do add HTML pls",
This is definitely helpful for you,
And I hope it's just as good on my Android phone.,
Thanks Khan academy! I rly needed this app and I tried to find it on the app store before but I couldn't find it! Thank goodness I just read the email I got from u guys and came straight away!!!,
So excited that the app exists. Still waiting to have exercises added.,
this seems to just be a collection of videos.  already have access to that.,
Really good one. I was eagerly waiting on Android platform.,
I learn more from these 10 minute videos then I do from my teachers,
Its look awesome. Just wish i could actually do the exercises in the app.,
Thank you Khan academy for launching this app,
Would really like to see the comments under videos like what is shown on the website.,
"It is a good app, but it needs exercises on it.",
일단 별 만점 주고 봅니다.,
Because it make my study easy but some video are can't open,
Exactly how I hoped it would be. It would be great if there was an option to download videos to the SD card.,
Missing exercise but good one .Can do exercise online on website,
Title.,
Love it. Use it all the time to study for engineering math,
I would really appreciate exercises so I can test my knowledge as I learn,
Though bugs are in offline mode or downloading for offline viewing and yes no exercises,
I Just Loved It Great Education. Thanks Sal,
YES! I've been hoping for a Khan Academy app!  Let the learning continue!,
Really one of the very good educational app thanks,
Whoever have any Negative comments..Let them do Better for Free or keep Quiet..thanx Khanacademy!,
Don't install if you intended to get exercises.,
Great organization. Get your kids on working on these.,
Haven't used it yet but heard it's great. Is there something like this for learning languages?,
Love KA. Looking for more functionality to come in the app.,
Everything I know about math is due to this app.Thanks a Lot ..,
No problems only vidieos and doesnt put points on PLEASE FIX,
It's good and all but there are no exercises.,
Subtitles are not shown on fullscreen mode and Also Other Language Support,
Thank you so much for this wonderful app! I love Khan Academy!! Keep up the good work~!,
Meh. Just the videos. Not the practice problems.,
U saved me from.my phy test thank uu!!,
I loved the interface its very simple and easy to use.,
"Good start,  but need to catch up with the iOS version",
Really loved it,
"Lacks exercises, disappoited",
This app is great!! It works perfect for us!,
Love this app just need some improvements,
Amazing app with a sea of knowledge.,
This was an amazing experience,
Can you guys add questions that we can answer lik on the computer.,
Would be cool to be able to cast to Chromecast natively,
Kinda important feature...,
as Bangladeshi I am feeling proud that Salman Khan (creator of this app) is bangladeshi✌✌✌✌✌,
Some great teachers in the app,
Would rate higher but still can't do exercises. Should be called khan academy viewer.,
"Looks great, works smoothly. Like it)",
One of the best apps i've seen! Great job!,
The videos and the exercises are really really helpful.,
Very fluid and user friendly,
Only sound and cursor moving on the screen for some videos,
I hope they add the exercise modules soon. It's the only reason I downloaded the app.,
The Khan Academy is brilliant.,
"I downloaded the app for the exercises, that's the only thing the app is missing.",
But not in urdu lecture please sir transaction in urdu lecture,
...But its about time this app existed!,
Cool app all solutions for any questions go for it .....,
"Just great, science in your pocket, everywhere you go...",
"User friendly, my son in 6th grade loves it...",
The best tutorials in the web!,
For right  education it is best....,
Where are the excercises? We waited years for this app and it is half done... Sad...,
Just loved it..its amazing for the students to learn thoroughly.. Great..,
Please add questions,
In the palm of my hand!,
Quick question. Where was this app when I needed it back in 2011?,
It is awesome!!!,
It needs the comment section and the exercises section.,
It would be great if u had exercises but the app is great overall,
Waited for a long time,
"Awesome, very insightful",
Good app to learn basic thing's👌👍👍👍,
Simply Amazing!,
Excellent!,
Amazing app!!,
Is amazing,
Good school,
I feel smarter already.,
We want exercises!!!,
Aren't there skill check tests in the app?,
There are no exercises which really help .I hope you will add them:-),
Please add excercises!,
But where are the exercises? KA without exercises is only half of it.,
Nice!!,
Great!!!!,
Please add exercises.,
Awesome!!!!!!,
Learn more,
Great,
Very helpful,
Please add Chromecast support,
You should add the exercises,
No point without exercises,
Can't load the videos!!!,
Videos doesent load,
I loved it,
Very nice,
Where are the activities?,
Good,
Nice,
Awesome,
Best,
"After years of wait, Android app is finally here. But, one thumbs down: The app doesn’t support exercises (yet)...",
انصحك الجميع بتجربته بجدية. برامج تعليمية للأطفال والكبار من اول ابتدائي حتى الجامعة. في الرياضيات الفلك الأحياء الجغرافيا التاريخ البرمجة والكثير. ماذا تنتظر حمله الآن.,
Need exercises,
"Add Engineering related videos branch-wise like Electrical,Mechanical,Electronics,Civil,Computer...and post videos of various courses. Also, exolain very basics related to each field. Thanks. I'm also Khan :-)",
"Thanks for bringing Khan Academy to Android.  The app has access to all the video courses and is very useful.  A notable omission is that none of the practice material are on the App, and will still need to go through the website.  I would like to see these migrated to Apps to be more touch friendly (we tried to use the website on a tablet and was not that great.  we ended up going back to the desktop).  Keep up the good work.  Only three stars for now, and waiting for improvements.",
This website is by far my fav! So much to learn and Khan Academy explains everything so clearly that you can start using it with whatever skill you have at a subject in question. The only thing I could find great to add is challenge problems for science subjects as they are done for math.  Thanks a lot to all the people involved!,
"I have been using other apps in order to download the videos, but now the things I review can be associated with my account. I can't wait to see any other functions that are added to the following updates. I do have one suggestion: make it so that to download  a videos it does  not have to open them, maybe just long select and download. Oh and multi select would be awesome too.",
"I can imagine the updates for this taking awhile so a roadmap of updates on the blog would be very useful for planning. Otherwise shows great promise, despite numerous bugs. Tracking of exercise completion is where the real magic happens though.",
"The offline support is enough to warrant this 5 star rating. Some improvements are needed (ability to increase speed of videos, ability to view articles). This is a very convenient way to keep on top of studying, especially on the go. It's also super economical and accessible because you can save videos for offline use at any time; hopefully there is support for moving offline content to SD cards in limited space devices. I have no SD slot, so I cannot test this feature. This is less useful for review because you can't speed up videos, but for new content it is great because you would not be using double speed",
"You guys have helped me so much during my college math courses. When I feel I'm lacking in a certain area I go to you guys to get a clear answer. App is quick, easy to use, clean interface. Keep up the great work!",
"It's nice but there are no annotations for mistakes that Sal makes in this app, unlike the regular website. For example in the video ""Calculus: Derivatives 2"" 4th minute it should show his mistake in the annotation but it doesn't.",
"I've heard great things about Khan Academy, so my rating is based on that. As I prepare to return to college next year, after an over twenty five year hiatus, I hope that Khan Academy will be a useful tool for conditioning my mind to learn again!",
"For example, when I click on Macroeconomics, I should be able to download every video instead of clicking every single one, add them to my list and download :( For poor students like me, wifi is not always available, please make it easier for us! I trust you.",
I would be totally lost in math if it wasn't for this site and now finally an dedicated android app :),
It stills videos still rotates whether or not the auto-rotate is on or off. I hate that.,
"A program that lets you pass college, pass anything, now, is on an app! The teachers are better than normal school teachers probably because all of them got a PhD. It lets you learn stuff that you dont understand and now you understand it. This is the best edu app in the world!!!! Love this.",
Khan academy is known for it's quality Content. Now im really happy to see android version of the same. I really appreciate the efforts to bring this app. I wish this app to become very successful.,
I love Khan Academy and I'm supper happy that there is now an app for it. I just have one request - it would be great if it was possible to add a whole section to the download list at a time without having to go into the individual videos first to click the add button. Thanks for creating this app! :),
"What a dream. Now I can see things in the right order rather than random on YouTube lol. Nice UI, by the way. Loved it.",
No place for GRE prep. And some where the quality of video is poor ...need more improvements,
After selecting video to watch the window shuts down and return to previous page.,
"Instead of getting help from teachers, this teacher teaches different subjects and most of the videos are less than 30 minutes. Offline download is great. Glad this app is free of charge so many young people would want help with their homework.",
"I am so glad to see that Khan Academy has come to the Android OS. I have been using this tool on the web, on iOS, and even on Windows 8.1. I was almost at the point of not thinking it would ever come to Android so this is something l have long expected. I hope that in the future this expands to allow exercises",
This app is amazing no problems with it at all I love Khans academy it even helps with my music!👍💯,
"I left iOS a long time ago, very refreshing to see khan academy on android officially",
Used it for maths practice exercises while my daughter's exam preparations. Got the desired results. Thankyou so much for helping people educate.,
"I really want to thank the creators of this app. It really helped raise my average in school, not to mention help me with external exams. Thank You!",
But the app is lacking behind the ipad version.   Why can't we have the practice material like the ipad version?   I hope it will come because the website does not work without bugs for practice material and the app just omits it.,
Great app however needs to let users attempt tests related to the topic commensurate to the website.,
I love it but it needs the option to practice like you can on the computer. Other wise its great!,
It's so good to see educated guys helping the whole world to get educated. Best luck.,
This app is great I used Khan academy for many years It practices my skills.,
Totally helps increase IQ and enlarge our knowledge. Wonderful app where we can learn with fun.,
The current all white color scheme makes it blinding to use at night.,
"Can you please update the computer science section a lot more, there's not a lot there.",
I ve been following khan academy videos for a while and it is nice to see a app for it  The interface is nice and organized but there are some bugs here and there like the video player it wont play videos when i m using the carrier network and it works perfectly when im on wifi,
Thanks a lot khan academy for making it possible.,
"Really exciting to see version 1.0 released! It's easy to navigate, and it seems fluid and quick. The videos load AND download quickly. Yes, they finally easy to download for offline viewing. After logging in to existing account it does not recommend/show subjects that are in progress. But I'm so happy to see this for Android it's still five stars.        Please add exercises soon!",
"Thank you so much Khan Academy! It seems like its been forever to come to Android, but you have surpassed all of our expectations!",
Been waiting for so long. Finally! Works like a charm. Has a feature for offline vids too. Love it!,
Pretty great but its missing quizes and the activities should at least appear on the list of videos so you know what you are missing on the phone and go to your computer.,
Very good work on the Interface and the quality of the videos and the low size....simply brilliant,
Finally official Khan academy Android app with offline feature.  Always loved quality education.  Cheers,
We envy your work Sal.,
"Absolutely brilliant app. Great in look and feel, invaluable in content. Worth the wait !!",
There's no easy way to view your list of downloaded videos on the tablet version of the app,
"Quizzes are missing, rest is awesome. I guess they will update soon.",
This app has it all. Keep up the majestic work.,
Knew itd be great and it was!                                   Ps: i havent actually opened the app yet. 😉😃😎,
I wonder what i would have done without khan acadamy,
Really perfect  app but I want English Subtitles For videos  (CC),
You guys cover almost every subject except English.,
"Great UI, great content awesome initiative. Thank you very much!!!",
keeps crashing while playing the videos  on minix x8,
A great way to spend free time and learn something new ;),
"Hi   There are few bugs... if we forward or rewind any video it stops working.... please fix these bugs... Thnx.  Best, Subhankar",
This is my prime source of learning. I recommend for all homeschoolers.,
Was about time to make a Android all looking forward to the interactive exercises.,
"In the world of emoticons, I am :D",
Waited for long time for Android ....,
Ive been using this for 2 years and it really helps and now thats for app im even happier thnx you Khan Academy,
This app  lets kids learn more about stuff for school,
Amazing app. The world needs more people like you Khan,
I have tried almost every studying app of play store but this is a best ever  learning app I have seen,
Simple user interface in addition to great features and the greatest one in fact is downloading videos for offline use,
I just want it to be able to make a whole course or topic or multiple videos offline just by selecting all the videos,
There is finally a khan academy app!! How I've waited on this day.,
"Its long time waiting, but now it finally comes, but one question does it have the pages or skill practices?",
I like how the transcript of the video scrolls along. Great stuff.,
"There are a lot of videos about many subjects, I just want more about computing",
"Who did this app, is a genius!",
Great app! Looking forward to exercises on mobile as well!,
Love the app easy to use and tons of knowledge to gain from a great app,
A great fan of Khan academy and their way if teaching its just brilliant,
STILL no coding!,
Thank you so much for giving this opportunity for android users.,
This is the best educational app. Keep it up.,
My kids love this app it really helps,
"I love Khan academy because I learned a lot from it...  and with this app, accessing to khan academy will be a lot more easier and convenient....",
Finally the Future arrives to Andrhoarders!,
Brush up on total learning.,
Needs Chromecast support,
Work of Genius. Thanks for the effort. Keep up the Good Work. #kudos,
Can't wait to see future versions. 😎,
Thank you so much!,
"Now, it is really helpful",
Helps with my nursing classes.,
Best learning app online.,
Thank You Khan Academy. This is the best app ever....,
Best in the World..... If you are a student you're gonna love it,
Thanks khan academy!! 😁😁,
Helped me in my studies,
I've been using for school recently but Mobile makes it 10/5,
"I've been waiting for this. Thank you, developers!",
Great app just needs the ability to do exercises !,
I have been waiting so long for this app. It's finally here!....... And it just keeps crashing! Hopefully this will get fixed soon.,
It doesn't support subtitle when videos are played in full screen.,
Thank you so much.,
IOS already have it. When it'll be coming to Android?,
Please upgrade any school in the world to Khan Academy .,
Looks great!,
Finally mobile learning!,
One word; Finally.,
Brilliant!,
perfect!,
Keep up the great work,
Time to start learning,
The app doesn't provide a way for me to see what course I enrolled in without actually entering the course tab.,
Where do I make the exercises like on the site?,
Seems to be good...,
Love it :*,
Very helpful,
Must have app,
Thanks,
Really waited for it,
Yay!,
"Kahn academy is truly amazing and I have used it not only to gain more 
knowledge of new subjects, but also as a review to subjects I am already 
learning . The only thing that us more of a downside for me personally is 
that there are no foreign language courses. This was the only reason I 
stopped using this app. Hopefully one day they will offer foreign language 
courses, if so I would definitely reinstall this.",
"Khan Academy helped me loads in preparing for my SAT'S,  they sent me emails and reminders and made an absolutely lazy person like me follow a schedule.  I absolutely love this app and I think everyone should use it cause its so super helpful &lt;3",
"Khan Academy on Android lacks many fundamental and necessary features that are present on the PC website version. For example, you can't look at the list of things you're currently studying, and the app as a whole feels like being trapped in a small box compared to the amazing PC version. But, that being said, it isn't terrible. And it is functional and fairly smooth.",
I loved it. I have learnt many great things and will be learning in future too.  I recommend everyone to just at least visit the site and try out a videos lecture in any of the subject you like and trust me there are many categories you would like and won't regret it a bit.  I'd love to make a donation as soon as i am capable of giving it.,
Wanted to study java and c++ but it is not their . Very bad.also enclude iit physics and chemistry.constraint relationship of pulled should be included.also join hand with databack app so that our internet get saved.,
"I would love to give five stars. I really would. The premise is excellent. The interface is great.  It has, unfortunately, used a large amount of background data that I do not have the facility to pay for. I have only ever opened the app whilst connected to a WiFi network, and have saved no videos. I don't know why it would need this much data to do nothing. Even so,  tell Sal he makes great videos.",
"This is a great app. It will be better if/when more courses and topics are added. One awesome feature you should implement is Chromecast support. I would much rather be able to watch these videos on my TV through Chromecast. Screen mirroring does work, however it's not seamless and you can't tell there is a short delay as with all screen mirroring.",
"This is certaintly the BEST math app I have ever used. It clearly explains all common core concepts in very good ways that makes it easy to get and understand. It always motivates you and helps you practice with quizzes and tests. You even have the option to try again if your not happy with your score. Plus, it's all FREE. That is amazing. Only thing is that some assingments that my teacher gives are weird because it may be completed, but it says it's not. This effects my grade when it does this",
"It is a pretty useful app but when I try to listen when I can't watch the video itself (such as driving) it would be nice to be able to close my screen without having the audio turn off. Sometimes I can't watch the whole thing but want to get that ""extra bit of studing"" in.",
"Well,if you really want to study,this app is the best.It provides you all information and study matter for all subjects absolutely free.I would recommend you not to spend money on those hard cost BYJU and EXTRAMARKS ,etc,just download it.I loved this app.Study matter from class kindergarten to 12th and even above.Not only school subjects,but also other subjects like astronomy,cosmology,architecture,etc with elaborate syllable... Loves this app.",
It's one of the best apps I have seen. Lazy people who don't usually read books and stuff should take help of this app to gain knowledge and expand their minds to be creative and find different methods to solve the variety of sums and equations. It's an awesome life changing app. Love it! ☺,
"I got this app so I could have some refresher courses before going to college. I think I comprehend more about math after one day than I ever had through all of high school. He explains why you are doing things and gives you tips, tricks, and alternate ways to get the same answer instead of telling you to memorize 60 formulas and pray you remember which jumble of numbers and letters solves which situation.",
For all the people out there that said that this game is boring need to understand that this is not a game. It is a serious learning tool that has really helped me connect gaps in my math skills. Without this I would not understand half the math we learned in the 5th grade. IV used it on a computer and I am exited about using the mobile app.,
"This is so much help,in school, and me as a student that needs improvement in math this has helped me a lot so thank you +khan academy you're the best. After a long time that I have been using khan academy I have been have been ready for AZmerit THANK YOU SO MUCH KHAN ACADEMY.",
"If I have my phone set in Spanish I don't have the choice to browse material in English, and/or I have to waddle through half translated material. Add the option of using full English please!  EDIT: Fixed now, 5 stars for both listening to feedback, addressing the problem  and taking the time to personally notify me. Great work!",
"I love Khan academy; however, the app has a few bugs. For starters, the app will crash for me whenever I try to download videos to watch offline and sometimes the videos and activities I have completed on the app won't appear on the computer and vice versa.",
"First off, I LOVE Khan Academy and everything they do. However, I fail to see the point of this app. I can go to the website to watch the videos, and the app has no exercises. So why would I use the app? I uninstalled, not because it's bad, but because for full functionality I still have to use the website, so there's no sense in having the app taking up space on my device. If they ever give you the ability to do exercises on the app, I will absolutely download it again.",
"Guys I recommend you all to please install this app. For me ,it helped me so much that I can't say you. My results say it. I received 100% in Maths and got 56/60 in IMO. That too without any tution or any external third party software. I trusted on Khan Academy and now I am a successful person. Hopefully you guys keep the good work. And I have a joke too. Guys the creator of this app is Salman Khan . But, since I am Indian, we have an actor named the same. Regards... Lol",
"This is such a great app, I'm a highschooler and I have used this app time and time again during the summer to get a head start on my classes. I highly recommend it to all who are urged to get and be ahead of the game. I also recommend the studying strategy, Mind Mapping, this strategically uses both sides of the brain for full creativity, understanding and memory. Tony Buzan introduced this method years ago and I am sad that i never heard of it until now, but its never to late so learn, learn, learn!",
"A blessing in presence. Literally. I learnt all of my calculus and organic chemistry  (as well as many physics chapters) with the help of Khan Academy. If this was not there, it would have been a major setback for me to catch up on my studies, after recovering from a health ailment. Thank you so much Sal and everyone associated with the Khan Academy !",
"Very hard formula and questions. Not easy questions are given . Brain drain 75% student . Hard mathematics. Not taking easy and convenient virtual / online lab. unwanted subjects are teaching which is 0 credit value or not in use. Too many head ace , irritating due to higher and hard syllabus load in bachelor degree ECE .",
"Well, one of the greatest educational application ever ever created. I would say it is a revolution in the field. I faced a lot of problems with my teacher's way of teaching and all stuff....but everything started going my way after I started using this application....thank you people for creating such a brilliant thing.... A salute 👌✌",
"This is a great app, but on some of the questions in algebra II adding and subtracting functions, the mathematics are way off. It is trying to tell me that 4•6 is 36 on question 4. And it is telling me that the correct answer that is on the ""show me the solution"" is incorrect on question 3.",
"The website version had always been helpful to me during high school. The thing I miss is when they offered a bunch of equations and problems you could work through on some galaxy map or something, that they had before the layout of the site had been changed. I usually learned through those problems rather than the instructional videos. This is still very helpful, but only when I'm around places that offer free WiFi and I'm not around my campus much unfortunately. Bring back those math problems etc. if you can please. I still think this is definitely great though :)",
"It doesn't have the same ability to let you practice what you're watching, which was the entire reason I downloaded it. If you're looking for something that has awesome educational videos, this is it. But if you're like me and learn with hands-on, skip it and go to the online site.",
"Great app, good content but there's no warning saying that it uses so much background data, which is not useful while abroad.. Used 100mb in 3 days. Luckily data rates are fairly low, but it's still a cost I don't want to pay for something I wasn't actively using during my time away!",
"This is the first time I'm writing a review, to keep short, khan academy is 
a life saviour, it offers great content, accessible by anyone, the lessons 
are explained in a clear and easy to understand way, I've been using it for 
years now and it changed my life for the better as I'm always ahead of my 
classes and always looking to learn more! keep up the good work!",
"When I first started this I was in advanced math (algebra), which means I skipped 8th grade math and went to 9th grade math. Skipping a grade of math meant I didn't know a lot of the material I needed for algebra and I was falling behind. So I got the app and in the website as well and it helped me soooo much! I'm really greatful.",
"Coming from a kid, this app was and still is really helpful. If you think 
this app is boring, first of all it is an educational app so don't call it 
boring just because it's not Fortnite, and second, why use it? I have been 
using Khan Academy for about 6 years now, and I learned more math, history, 
and coding from Khan Academy than from all of my teachers combined. I just 
want to say thank you to Sal and the Khan Academy Team for creating this 
amazing app.",
"Like most students we endure lectures in most of our classes, but what we really need are exercises that reinforce our concepts. Lecture style of teaching do not teach the material at the pace of all students. The mobile version only has the lecture video and not the exercises used to reinforce the knowledge.",
"I loved the app but I woke up one morning to a data usage notification that Kahn had used .65 GB of my data somehow- I assume updates or auto downloads. Annoying that it doesn't automatically have settings to limit data usage when not connected to WiFi. Didn't realize I had to change these myself, and now puts a burden on my phone usage for the next several weeks. 3 stars for good content, minus one star for no language classes, minus one star for data usage settings.",
"Khan Academy helped me through high school with maths and because of it I have a good understanding of maths. The videos are well made and every concept is extremely well explained. The app is awesome. Everything works well. There are so many reviews here saying it's""boring.""  They're all stupid.",
"I wouldn't have passed my math, physics and chemistry classes nearly as easily without Khan Academy. Allowed me to pursue a career in Geology whereas I was considering dropping out of school after years of frustration.",
"When i searched from a free online academy. Then i found my heart khan academy. Even when i turn 5th grade if its vacation, i can still learn new things.....😊 I suggest to download this app if you want to learn advance good job facilitators!",
"I really like the app. I intend to use it for along time. There are just too many things wrong with it to give it five stars.   I really want to see the content displayed neatly. For instance for the math problems the text and questions are cut off and I have to drag them back and forth on my phone. And the back button isn't all that effective. You need a well defined home screen where if you push the back button from anywhere you can get back to. Also, the lessons should progress automatically without having to back out and find where I was and click on the particular exercise manually.  I think if you made those changes(which could take a month out so) then this could be a much better app.",
"The best App and idea I've ever seen, I even have had the same idea if I start my own business. Thanks alot I appreciate your effort all of you and I wish if I could help you , maybe one day I'll join you.",
"I love the Khan Academy website, but the app is terrible because it doesn't link with your work in progress online, you can't continue on the app with a mission you left off on the website. The app needs to show all your current missions and needs to have that ability to resume them at any time, just like on the website.",
"""What you do with one side you've gotta do with the other side"" 😂 I'll never forget! I spent 7 months in my room for 10-13 hours a day on Khan Academy when I didn't work 3 days a week, preparing for an SAT I didn't take a over decade ago. In that time, I learned everything from fractions up to pre-Calculus on my own with KA, and I've never felt better! Now I'm on my way to a degree in CS thanks to the free knowledge KA offers. I am extremely thankful for this program, not only am I smarter but my depression has leveled down out of my way thanks to the beauty of mathematics. This is the best self teaching way to go!",
"Great!! I have been waiting for this,  for years in fact! I love the iPad version where you can do the exercise  modules,  however, the only thing I dont like is that the app doesnt allow to watch the video except in 720p. It's data-consuming. Overall app is amazing! Thank you so much Sal and KA team!",
"The Khan Academy is awesome. It taught me so much, but this app keeps on crashing when I try to watch the videos I downloaded. Even the updates couldn't fix it. My phone is damn fast, but I don't know why the app keeps on crashing. Please fix it. I'm missing Khan Academy terribly!",
"I have been wating for a long time for an app. I wanted it so I could use JS in the car. Finally an app, when it first came out last year. NO CODING. I though oh, its new. They will implement the coding lessons later. NOW. Huge update epic stuff.... guess what? NO CODING! I won't give this app 5 stars until I see some html and js up in there!",
"As others have said before me, the app would be better if you added the exercises to it. Do that and it gets full stars.",
"I do not have the app anymore, but I use the computer. This program is really good. It has a lot of information and sometimes it is pretty fast, but as long as you pay attention, take notes, and study, you should do just fine.",
"Greatest app ever ,Thai I've installed .I just love learning through it especially my favorite chemistry , I thank you people a tone cause this app help me so much in coming out of my chemistry fear. Thanks a lot again for a free app😀😀😀😀",
There is no reason an app such as this needs access to my accounts and identify info... remove those requirements and I will reinstall and give ☆☆☆☆☆.,
"I've been using the website with my daughter for several weeks now, and i was excited to hear that there was an app. The website doesn't fit on her tablet well, and it is hard for her to work her math problems on it. When we got it loaded, we were very disappointed to find out that it is just videos, and not even all the videos that are on the website! This doesn't solve ANY problems for us! I guess all these people who are giving it 5 stars have never been to the website.",
horrible it's unorganized  doesn't load very well. And it is better if you use the website (Which works on mobile ) This app is horrible  for education vthe site is better. THIS APP IS USELESS,
"It is very useful for people who don't go to any tutorial for studying and 
want to study anything in deeply either it is maths or physics or chemistry 
even biology or computer science or history or anything else. They also 
take tests and have many more things. It is very helpful",
"For some reason, all i get is audio, and just a first frame of the video. If i try to skip a part of the video, it just freezes, even if video is downloaded to phone :( really looking forward to fix :)",
This looked great to help me with school but I am no American and am only a kid so I don't have any idea what 5th grade or 6th grade is. And this app needs to be clearer in where things are and needs to cover more subjects,
"I thought by ""learn anything"" I thought I could learn classify different river fish species. I ended up learning about pollution by that annoying guy who does Crash Course.",
"An awesome app and very helpful. I just didn't understand math and had poor grades but then my sis told me about Khan Academy and I tried it out, in less than two weeks I was more advanced than the class and had WAY better grades. Definitely recommend to anyone for any subject!!!!!",
I only had this app for 20 seconds. The main reason I got it was because I wanted to learn GML script.,
This is tha best learning app ever..  And it's extremely useful too....  And what makes it better for me I love to use my phone so with this app I'm always on my phone but I'm learning this app helped me understand what my physics teacher was saying this is a really good app,
"Khan Academy is a phenomenal project, and I have learned a great deal of knowledge purely from the website/app. Add to that amount any knowledge that I gained as a direct result of being inspired, my interest aroused, and then compelled to learn more from other sources. Roughly 1/3 of my friends have used it or currently use Khan Academy. I will say that the app could add some features (*cough*multi-window support*cough*) but it's a solid app. It's got a stellar user interface! Just tap install already! C:",
"I wanted to so badly use this app as I've heard great reviews but, my email 
address keeps showing as invalid. I've tried to login a lot of times but I 
can't access into the application. I wish my problem could be solved, and 
if you can help please let me know.",
"I have one problem when I play any video in full screen , i see one white 
line on the top of the video please remove it. It hurts my eyes.",
"The keyboard layout is terrible. Navigation is confusing too. I love Kahn 
Academy, but the app really needs a change.",
I give it 5 star because it is the best app to learn anything online.and I can increase ur knowledge  without giving any extra cost.,
"The subject matter is vast and there is so much to learn! While it does freeze/crash if too many videos are downloaded at once (a product of device RAM), it is  truly a very cool app. My only regret is that not every single subject is present. That will probably change with time... And for the buttheads giving a 1 star rating I challenge you to explain your reasoning. Shame on you!",
I love this very very much. But pls pls pls make changes Give class 9 science and social science video. I request u. Pls reply me,
"I love this app it has helped me a lot with and it's been so educational. 
I'm very glad that I downloaded this app because it's very hard to find a 
good app or game that I can go whenever I feel the need to read something 
useful. So overall I recommend this app to people that don't mind a lot of 
reading and are looking for an educational app that's for all Ages!",
I salute Sal for putting such a sincere efforts to make education so easy for students it really helpful .Love from India ❤️,
"Variety of subjects and topics you can submerge yourself in. If your hungry to learn, this is the most brilliant app out there for it. The steps and videos it has you go through, are very informative and easy to understand. Knowledge is power, and power is control; Dictate your own future.",
"This is one of the best study apps I've ever seen. We can even get the 
knowledge which is far away from our course, and it's even good for those 
who are always in search of getting some new knowledge. 😃👍👍👌",
Two most basic features are missing because of which academy is incomplete on Android. 1. Lack of q/a zone and notifications for receiving answers. 2. No exercises. These two functionalities need URGENT ATTENTION and I hope academy is going to bring it soon.,
I would had never knew how to do trig if it wasn't because of this app. I passed a lot of math classes. My mental math is almost as like a human calculator,
A wonderful app. So many things to learn. I found the teaching here better than my teachers. Thank you so much.,
"Actually the best app ever made for education. What is the use of education if it never gets imparted to fellow human beings?  In this commercialized era of education ""Khan academy "" is providing free education to all, irrespective of the financial,  geographical condition. Salute to those who created this app and made many students feel happy like me.",
It is one of the best free study app I have ever witnessed so far. A must have for every IIT and AIPMT aspirant.,
"I loved it. Thank you so much, i know grades are not important, knowledge is..ty so much for providing me that. Love you khan academy.",
Khan Academy is one of the best options to learn something or just review a subject you haven't studied for a while.,
"Horrible window spacing makes using the app frustrating, many bugs in the interface. Khan Academy is fantastic, but whoever designed their mobile/app layout deserves to eat a gun.",
Khan Academy is so fun that I spend hours and get in trouble not for not doing it but for doing a lot. It's very fun and addictive. No other educational website has been fun like Khan Academy.,
"The app is buggy occasionally. Many people are saying it's boring; these people probably didn't realize that it was an educational app before downloading.   This app can be very helpful, especially as a supplement to classes you already have. It can also expand your knowledge in subjects you have no desire of taking a class for.",
"Great, Salman dada you did great . This charity done by you is the greatest 
thing ever which can be done by anyone by improving the education quality. 
Hands up to you",
"Cannot figure out how to do the practice questions for the math topics. As far as I can tell, it's only for passive information absorption, not interactive learning.",
I've used this app for over a year now and i can say it really helps..the app is a bit buggy and crashes when i play videos sometimes...but overall the functionality and the fact that the information is for free is enough to give it a 5 star!,
I really appreciate sal khan's aim to provide free education to everyone. His work is so noble that a unseen passage also came in our English exam,
Everytime I click on an article it says the article can't be opened at this time. I really want to take the art history class but so far I can't because the articles aren't working. It is seriously very annoying! UPDATE: developer reached out immediately with a solution and now it is working great! Thanks!,
If you add more illustrations that will make more understandable I bet this would  the best educational app  ever.the good thing is you didn't need internet to look for your homework. This app is really a big help as students.,
This is like the best ever app to learn everything for free. He teaches physics even. So I would give a 5 star.,
takes decades for it to just open on page. I don't know if it's the app or my phone but it is super slow. I can't even open a video without waiting 10 seconds.,
This is the best app I have ever used. I had to take calculus online without ever having a teacher for it. This app was my teacher and I am greatful for this product.,
Its a great initiave.But I hope the respective authorities take care of the fact that they must publish some vedios with animations.Because visualization is more than enough.Thanks,
It's pretty good for anyone looking to learn something new or to review. I use it for school all the time. The videos really help to explain confusing concepts.,
Great app for the first edition. Apparently you guys should have magically created the world's first perfect app. According to the nemrods who posted prior to my review.,
"Awesome it is perfect for people good way how to make games ,and code ect. So please get it if u want to learn about games",
I just wanted to know how to find the things your coach has a due date for. I mean on the computer version you have to do certain things assigned by your coach by a certain day and time but I can't find it on the app. Please help me.,
"I just love you,  everyone behind Khan Academy,  you all never broked my trust since the day i found Khan Academy.  It's been a long time trusting you guys.  Khan Academy is a must for everyone.  Thanks a lot especially Sal Khan.",
"Recent update flagged my antivirus with High background data usage. Uninstalled till this is addressed. No downloaded application should have background data usage flagging my antivirus, in my opinion. If devs address this issue, I will reinstall. Please reply to notify me for testing opportunity. Thanks, Kookie",
Much simpler to use than the website for me as I always have my smartphone. I can't wait for the exercises to be integrated.,
I'm rating for the site not the app but I'll fix that once I download and use it. I did much better on my SAT because I used Khan Academy to study.,
"There is no filipino on here. I personally needed help in filipino, which is supposed to be my native tongue but I cant speak it or fully understand.",
As summer break is beginning for me I'm using this tool to learn as much as I can before I go into my classes next year and I'll have a good concept of what I'm doing. I love this app and I think it's the best learning tool and app out there! And I love that it's free.,
It's a very good app. It brings to you full facilitated study of your class for free. Please download it and make it a success and free for all by donating from your side.,
I love khan academy.Because it gives me exercise for practice.I concern any subjected related information.It will help all teachers and students.give it 5 stars rating.,
The video hangs but the audio plays on. I downloaded the app for v1 which worked but due to lack of videos can't use it as well.,
"There should be more apps like these. I love Khan Academy because they are 
helping in keeping education free and changing the world for better.",
I didn't want to forget any thing about school so this was great to keep me on track 10 minutes a day and I think I'll be ready again for school,
IT'S TORTURE TO KIDS BRAIN. My son was up all night on this app all last week. No kid should dill with this much stress. It got so bad thay I had to take his phone at night,
Best app and website out there teaches you and stop's and makes you do examples to make sure you are on the right page. Thanks Khan academy,
"Great resource! My son struggles with math and we had wasted months on 
other math subscriptions when someone suggested we try Khan Academy.",
"I don't have a bad issue. I was just disappointed that I never could download the worksheets. I was only able to get the videos. Not interactive or responsive. But overall, I have to use the bookmark to get a better experience.",
I don't use the app because i don't actually use the mobile to much of the time love your wib site guys all my support and keep up the great work &lt;3,
I have tried meritnation app and some other ones but this is the best of the lot. Best feature is to download videos for offline watching.,
Khan academy  is the most leading nane in the field of education.  . I recommend to every student in any grade or class,
"Sir, Your app is good,but some problem is happening during the downloading. Is there any condition for downloading? I also close the 'download only by WiFi' option also. But download is not happening. What should I do? Please tell me some solution for this problem. Please write your answer under my opinion. I confirm that you definitely do it. Your app is really good. Please solve this problem only.",
"Khan Academy is great. However, this app only lets you watch videos. It does not have any of the practice problems and quizzes found on the website. The videos are useful, but as I'm using this to study for the GRE, the lack of practice problems is upsetting.",
First of all thanks a lot. My best wishes are with you. But app is not as great as website. If possible please try to pay attention. Thanks.,
"Wow! Loved it! Thankyou Sal Sir, you explain beautifully! There are two 
improvements that I want to suggest: 1. Improve picture zomming in 
articles. It's quite difficult to zoom pictures in articles. 2. Add a 
'Share' option for all articles and videos.",
"this thing helped me a lot, im almkst failong and suddenly my test got on 
the max. thanks khan,great teaching.",
Liked the Aztec sun video when first opening the app. Didn't find a good selection on computer science.,
Khan academy helps me lot in my busy life.. My son refer lectures wherever he has doubts. Great support thanks to Mr. Khan,
It's your greatness. In this present money society one who gave us a chance to learn more things in a free way. Hats off to you Mr.khan,
"I hated math through all my life, but now, I'm going to turn that dissapointed teachers' frown into a smile.",
"Example: It gives you a exercise with a SUPLEMENTARY angle, and it asks you what type of angle is it. And you put SUPLEMENTARY. And it says wrong.                                                       This thing does not work.",
The best App Ever FoR students BUt Will have been Muxh More gOod IF there would b an Option TO Read Too 😂😇,
Such an awesome app easy to learn all things even a poor student will understand very well and hat's off to khan academy,
"I bookmarked the economic section,  however the app constantly crashes whenever I try to open it..  So still have not finished downloading the rest of the bookmarks it is on auto download.  Unusable due to app crashing.",
Really a great app it is very helpful in studies and every thing is explained so well I really loved the app. I had a great time learning with khan academy👍👍👍👌👌👌😊,
"Dear Mr. Khan, I may not be able to donate to your noble institute now. But I will certainley in future. God bless you for your work.",
"I can't press it unless I try to several times and when I can't press it it opens the video instead. It is very annoying. Great app other than that, though. I use it all the time.",
I wasted quite some time downloading biology topic for offline but I still could not download it. FIX THIS PLEASE,
How can this app have used 883 mb in background data when I haven't used the app all month. Thanks for using all my data so I can't do anything else for the rest of the month. App deleted.,
"Khan Academy is one of the best things that I came across in life. Thank you so much. Sal Khan, you have indeed made us believe that we can learn anything...that too simply",
This app is practically useless if there are no exercises. I came here to practice on the go. Not watch videos.,
"I hope that this app will contain a more defined GCSE section as for some students in the UK, this is a concern. Despite all, I really enjoy the application.",
"Worth Praising: I have been following Khan Academy website since long (10 years). For your work, i haven't got the words to thank you for all your efforts.",
While I am reading or learning suddenly one ad comes and distracts me.,
"This is the app for everyone who wishes to learn maths, physics economics etc. Thanks Sal for for time and efforts to teach us in such a simple and lucid manner.",
This is the best app I have seen. I like this because it's completely free unlike other apps. And the topics are explained very good.,
It's the best education app for people who are interested in studying science technology etc and etc and everything you want is their in this app and the best thing about this app is it is fully free I love this app it's the best app in play store,
Yes its good practice but the videos aren't very thorough and I couldn't understand  much,
"I love the app, it is very helpful for getting grades up and preparing for 
a upcoming test. Great app compared to the childish game apps.",
Khan Academy has really helped me learn concepts very clearly. It has just changed my life.,
"This app is free! Not only that, they are complete in most educational branches and surely satisfy most people that download this app.",
"I'm a nerd and now that school's out me and my Samsung buddy Cortana can 
study and play Pokemon go",
I use this at school quite a bit. It's pretty nice. My teacher and I have fun going through it and picking harder work for me and testing things out I haven't done before and seeing what I get right.,
"Absolutely amazing... As a sixth grader struggling sometimes, the app is 
very helpful to use to help me in school. It's helped me succeed, hats off.",
"To be very Frank, I want to say that you guys are doing really well & I hope you will continue to help the needy ones as you are doing now. At last I want to give you a big Thank for helping me too..",
Helped me in school so much when I couldn't understand and the videos are just a plus to the whole experience. I highly recommend this.,
I still prefer site over the app. The reason is obvious that app is not optimised for coding e.g (Js drawing) like the site. I hope that you already know that the users want the app like site for learning coding..,
My friend had told me to join Khan Academy. At first I joined in my computer. Then I downloaded it in my tablet. It is very interesting and u learn so many new things.,
A gift to economically low funded and Technically challenged countries with little world support for their children's education would be a wonderful way to promote a once badmouthed and earnestly feared pioneering endeavor whom would appreciate such a gift accepted with the most enthusiasm and who have been truly desensitized (let's say about 4/5 yrs give or take) to the fear of positive or negative change!!!(Hint*Hint* GOOGLE) Much Love: SION!!!!! Thanks for the push out the nest%?%?%...Kalev!!!,
Loved the app right up until my Norton antivirus recognized it as a malware application.  Will reinstall when this is fixed by either Norton or Khan academy.,
Love it . This app helps me when I can't figure out my difficult work.,
"This app don't calculate points, there isn't enough practice, just videos galore. My kids and I can not learn that way. We cannot watch endless videos. Online there are goals and some play. This app is absolutely not worth the space on a device.",
This helped me so much especially with Maths. But the exercises are not practical as in the final we do the questions on paper and not on the software used by this app. But thank you,
I find it very much helpful for my children as they gain additional insights from this learning material. The concept becomes more vivid to them and therefore it clears all their doubts and thus creating  deeper understanding.,
It is very useful for students who don't have or don't want to spend huge sums of money to learn something. It is also useful for those who like to learn on the go. The explanation on every topic is very clear and well understandable.,
Students can't do much on this app. They can't see assignments and it's too confusing. I wish they could use the sort of the Desktop mode on it because its hard and confusing to get students what they need. :/,
"I am an IIT aspirant in 11th grade, and truly this app helps me to clear my fundamental concepts...thank you to the whole Khan academy team.",
I'm attempting to help my son with Algeria and need a refresher course this foot the bill,
I'm having the trouble of getting into it my parent don't care when I do it or if I do so normally I don't care when I don't but I need education just spice things up more make it not just about learning games creativity is great for the mind I usually just hook up my tablet so I can only do this for two hours it works most of the time to all those parents out there you should do that to if your kid loves the tablet so they learn all this stuff too,
"This app helped me prepare for 6th grade 3 years ago though the videos are boring it is only because you are learning a lot of useful information and to most people it is boring because of that to me it is totally fun when it comes to coding, math, and the Pixar stuff are really fun (and that's coming from a 9th grader).",
A lots of knowledge fields but my subject Psychology isn't there. Has few videos upon some psychological disorders but its too little from the field.,
Good app. I just wish I could do my SAT practice questions on the app because I can only do it if I'm on a computer or the internet in general.,
"It's amazing how it helps you understand better, it helps you understand 
more of what your learning if your having trouble in class, and it has 
awards when you finish and get enough points! The PERFECT learning app and 
experience.",
I think that this app turned my D into a A in math. Khan Teaches so I can understand. I love this app like EVERYONE should.,
"Khan Academy has been one of the best learning hubs for a long time. I used it years ago, and I'll continue to now. Just a great team of people working to educate people for free.",
It easy to use but i can't use it in off line. Better if this app can use everywhere without a wifi or date. In my opinion ☺,
"Opened up this stupid app and it shut my phone off and now it won't turn on. Do not download, this is a scam.",
I Think It is one of best app in the world.Brother I know you have a golden heart.I pray to god you will always successful in your life.your are best brother.,
"great app, now I can take it with me during school break after taking my lessons. I rely on this app, pls add more features.",
"It's an interesting app and have always wanted something like this and I found it which is Khan Academy, really learnt a lot.",
"Awesome App This app is one of my favorites. This is a great app for 
students and the most important part is its free. Because most students 
don't have money to spend on online courses. I just want to thanks Khan 
academy, and all the teachers who made studying easy and interesting for 
everyone. Thanks again",
In trigonometry I convert radians into degrees but answers sometime give nearest and sometimes does not give the answer. I think some answers where wrong. Any way it is great app.,
"I find it funny looking in the reviews. People say its an uninteresting ""game."" People, its not a game.",
This is the worst app I have ever seen with my testicles I mean it's just horrible plz don't try to make it better cuz its impossible I hate it,
It is amazing I have learnt a lot with this app. People who say is boring is because they are immature and don't care about learning. Thank you Khan for creating this app and all the others as well.,
"Video processing speed is slower sometimes but at the same time other apps 
are working fast. I'm sure of my internet speed. please work on it.",
They barely move. It's so slow loading time. I don't know if this is because of high quality video I am okay with bad quality as long as I can watch it.,
Helped me to learn many different things. I loved Pixar in a box the most .  Other topics are also interesting!,
"Awesome app,better than byju and extramarks.It provides everything for free and easy to understand videos and study materials.Loved this app,thank you khan academy for this app.",
"I live in Sudan , and because of the US embargo on us we can not access the site without using a VPN serve.",
"The app seems to download lots of data even in background, both on wifi and 4G. Not nice for the battery life. For the rest, great app.",
This app is amazing but for some reasons I like the site more. Would really appreciate if you added all the lessons available on the website plus other new lessons on programming.,
"If u want free education video , Khan's Academy is the best app . Thanks for providing freedom of information on all subjects .",
"The app and site are so influential; and Sal Khan is definitely one of my 
greatest inspirations and motivators. Thank you for making education free 
for all!",
This app is perfect for my grandson. One of his teachers makes him and the rest of class do this on the computer every school day.,
"Absolutely love this app. These lessons are very useful to making good decisions economically, future planning and so much more. Very helpful indeed.",
This is the best app. I would like khan academy to open it's centre in india also. Very well explained. Everything perfect.,
Helps me understand a lot of odd concepts and Sal and David really explain everything well. 😘😍✨,
This is a good revision app for many older students however I would recommend you making it suitable for ks2 as well.,
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT TILL NOW NO OTHER E-EDUCATIONAL APP PROVIDES EDUCATION IN A BETTER WAY.BUT THE BEST PART IS THAT ITS FREE OF COST...I LIKE THE MOTIVE OF SALMAN KHAN BEHIND THE FREE EDUCATION IS THAT TO PROVIDE FREE SECONDARY AND SENIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION LIVING IN REMOTE VILLAGES WHERE EDUCATION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE POOR.......THANKS A LOT TO KHAN ACADEMY,
Can't find grammar section in new version of app. Please fix the bug. I can't see grammar section in arts and humanities part,
I've been using khan academy since I was in 4th grade. Khan Acadrnt has helped me so much in math and has brought me to the top three in the class. I have been using it for 5 years now,

My school has problems and the teachers are getting lazy so this is a great help for me.. I owe great thanks to Khan Academy,

"Thank you Sal,for the amazing apps that makes the world education free, 
easy to use, extremely helpful and comes with a huge variety of 
subjects,thank you again",
I'm always anxious about my study time. This definitely is the app for on the go studying when you can't bust out a laptop or textbook.,
Khan Academy helps me a lot in grasping concepts. The approach they take makes it easy to understand and more difficult to forget. Keep up the good work guys!,
No words to pay my gratitude to Mr Khan for helping the students out with their studies in this manner. The best online site ever on Earth.,
"This has definitely helped me improve on my math! Easy to use with step by step videos for those of us who are ""interactive learners""",
"I practice on khanacademy for help. It helps a lot for studying for a test. The thing that I dont like is that on the app, you cant do the math problems which sucked. But the vids are great for understanding how to do a problem. Usually I stick with math for khanacademy.",
"I have been using Khan Academy for years and it's awesome. Plus my school helps every student there setup an account, which is great.",
"It's very good to understand concepts but I think it should also have some mock test for competitive exams,etc hope to see that in upcoming update ✌️",
Thank you Sal so much i cannot be more thankful. You are the real life teaching wizard.,
"I'm in 7th grade, and I used to hate math. Thanx to khan academy, my math has become really good, and amazing. I now get full marks in math",
Bad app class is not given and even not the whole syllabus. It should have to learn form Byju's or exam fear,

"Gives 9.99%irrelevent solutions on question asked by me. For me it is the 
worst app that I used ever",
love the app. It can be improved tho. Features that can change the video quality manually and changing video storage from device to Sd card are very useful to people with slow internet.,
I always search for the good app of learn and this app is the best choice for me. It can improve my learning skill very well and help me prepare for my country's admission.,
It teaches me and I used to allwase go to party's and text my friends but this tought me to allwase study,
"It's a great learning app where you can learn absolutely any amazing things such as Math, Science etc. The point is this is a really good app, especially for children and teens.",

to answer :-)",
Beautiful and convenient. Not always on my comp but now i can get instructions on my fear time or before a test for review.,
Really i have no words for your work. I am speachless. Just simply i want to say God bless you. ❤,
"""This app not only helps you improve at Math but also in many other categories including Science. I have been referring to problems and examples on here and have never had a better visual and contextual learning experience.""",
It's great except for the inability to install files.,
I'm obsessed with it. I remember the very beginning of Khan Academy and I had no idea it would turn into this. It's incredibly useful and never ending.,
Good show on easy mathematics and chemistry along with social work..great mind inspired a lot to many common minds,
ye app amazing hai .. lekin sir class 12 th ki physics Hindi me padha dijiye plzz sir hindi medium me b kaam kijiye 12th class ka poora course sbkuch english me hai .. hindi me nhi hai,
"Just perfect, thanks developers and Sal Khan",
Thank's for this app,
"Khan Academy is such a great tool for learning just about anything. If you havent tried it, you should give it a go! It might change your life",
I hate the fact that it requires the Google password to sign in. Please make it free. Khan Academy it would be worth it.,

"I forget a lot of things over the summer but Khan Academy really helps me remember back the school work, thanks, Kahan.",
This doesn't has a scratchpad to show your work. You're going to have to get a paper and pen in real life for this app :-(,
It's really an incredible app. Please add videos in hindi. From Indian teacher so we could enjoy more simply. Please also add the classroom videos of coaching centre,
To the best of my knowledge    KHAN ACADEMY has become a big platform for learners. It's a place to start a journey to the world of infomation & knowledge.,
"This app is so superb ,it covers all the topic being taught in my school,i wished it should be the app used all over the world,great app guys looking forward for more apps",
Teachers at khan academy really explain things very clearly. I can easily understand the concept. I always use it because it helps me very much. Loved it!,
"Most wonderful app. Thanks to the team for providing free education to 
students from all over the world. Seriously what you are doing is a matter 
of applause.",
I didn't try it but I am sure it's good because I saw there Chanel on YouTube,
"This does not have glitches haters! AND IT IS FOR A THING CALLED ""LEARNING"". AND MAKING APPS IS HARD SO S H U T  U P .",
Firstly when I installed this app I enjoyed every single both of it but when I continued to use it. It just stopped everytime I'm in it. I will rate it full 5 stars if you fix the problem soon. Thanks,
Everything is explained easily and any student can understand.  Love this app for solving half of my problems in my life...,
"I think this app is one of the coolest app on playstore. Khan's academy app literally teaches you everything and also from basics.  The only problem is, if your data is slow the video gets totally blur unabling you to see the video.  I think so this can be fixed? If the net is slow the app should at least show 144p.",
"Installed to do homework tasks I have set on the Web version only you can just watch videos on the app, not answer questions you've set, I'd like to be able to answer questions and do tasks on the app! :)",
Thanks for this enormous effort . Single act of goodness like yours is really having big impact on many people's lives,
Its great for kids who are in school and want more or less of a challenge..... it is great that you can choose from all grades,
"An excellent way to brush up on your math and science. I'm saving tons of money studying up to what I need before I take my placement test. I highly recommend this app, considering pre requisites don't account or transfer towards your main credits/career",
It's the best learning program and has helped me a lot. It also is good at explaining this through the videos and hints. I love it,
"Good app, I would use the app more often if you could do your mastery challenge. That is why I use the website more often.",
"Thank you so much for making this app devs. With almost endless lessons to 
choose from, I can finally rest easy knowing I can keep up with the Math 
teacher. Thanks so much. God Bless.",
It really helped us students to understand more everything with Math Khan Academy from MUST-BSEE ty. 🐦🐦🐦,
Such a great tool to use to learn a lot of main curriculums and also it's an interesting fields of exploring the student within oneself.,
I was promoted to advanced math class. My math grade went from a low C to a very high A.,
It literally teachs everything. Best learning app for those who are needy. Perfect app and no buffering in videos.,
No point if I want to become a soccer probably and if that doesn't happen then I just don't like it at ALL,
I have it in my ipad and its now available for android... anyine can use this even if you are dine with school,
"This app is really educative and fun like it helped me with my sat exams

happy people came together to make this educative app. It's just too 
perfect and good to be true since its free😍😍😘 God bless you Sal Khan and 
your group",
I loved this app but captions are not available so I prefer watching videos in YouTube.,
My daughter has been using this app and she's laerning at a rate I've never seen her learn before,
"It's good app and web also, easy to understand ... tnx but we need to know 
more ancient history plz provide that",
It's easy to use and very informative.I think it is the best educational  app I have ever used.It is really helpful and the key points explain everything easily.,
"I use this at school on my laptop. It is  very helpful. I use khan academy in school at least once or twice a week. Also when you click out of it, it saves your progress.",
This is an amazing app that I use everyday at school during my free hour (not in class cause I'll get in trouble) and it really helps me understand what I need to learn and how to do the problems that I don't know or regularly know in class,
"Very good for learning, the instructors have taught me a lot, yet I feel some subjects are more advanced for 9th grade, even if I've chosen that grade level.",
Good initiative by khan academy. I think its only Learning platform which teaches everything without any greed. This even doesnt contain Addds,
"This app is great for anybody who wants to learn, it does not matter what age you are it has different grade levels and different things to learn",
I hate khan acadimy on evrything on the computer and other the answer is all ways rong and.drivs me crazy and i put my anwet on the 42.25 on the computer it said it was wrong and i click on the hint and said it was 42.25 the same number i TIPE this site is a hack on the computer,
"It's OK only if you're just watching videos I personally wanted to code on this , as you do online but that just wasn't it , for this reason I have deleted this app.",
The best learning app I have ever used. This is really helpful for any subject plus the e mails from the owner is very useful,
This helps a lot since I need to learn computer programing for what I want to do when I grow up.,
"i appreciate ur work but can u provide all content in another language also 
like hindi because it will help other people that are not able to 
understand english.tq.",
I just love this . Now I face no problem learning new things before they appear in my syllabus,
Would be much more helpful if it provided the huge array of questions and practice the website offers.,
Best way to understand math and there's videos so it will help you understand mood you have no idea what to do.,
"This is great app to have even if you have gone to school and are done with this kind of stuff it's good for learners of all ages, including me.",
"I do appreciate what you have done and it's been a great help for me and I 
think for all users that needs such kind of the help.",
Ready to use and my daughters keep my phone with them now just to learn facts and trivia.. Thanks for this wonderful app,
I love education. So I recommend also can you add quizs at the end of every lesson. Also can you please make it able to offline.,
"Best education app provided,but its only for the us syllabus or other boards like c.b.s.e etc.if then how to get cbse plsss helpp",
"This is a great work, as many unprivileged people don't have access to costly studies, these free videos would do wonders for them.",
Trust me. It's Juz very cool n helps you ace in all aspects of a subject,
Not so good... It's just for advertising of his private tuitions,
"M very happy that you introduced indian syllabus for physics like m soooooo 
glad m just waiting for bio and chemistry tooo...",
"It is very essential especially when you really have got to learn that 
specific topic. I don't have any issues of it cause it's generally organize 
with every category either mathematics, chemistry, physics, bio or others. 
You could get addictive to learning just like I do :)",
"100% love your site, so can guarantee will love the app. I am studying year 12 and took forever to find a site that has tutorials. YOUR SITE IS A BLESSING",
"Great. Please keep adding more information. Also add cbse notes, ncert solutions, and reference book solutions like RDSharma, SChand, etc",
This is amazing I'm always having slot of trouble in math and this helped me ALOT thank you so much u r a life saver,
"I have been using KhanAcademy for about a year and it helpef me raise my science mark with 14%, making me pass. Thank you so much Salman Khan. Kudos",
It helps me get better at math... But I HATE how if you get ONE wrong you have to restart the 5 questions...    Overall really good,
My teacher found this app and thought it was great but it is not accurate he tells us ways to solve problems and then we get the answer wrong. I would rather listen to my teacher than an app.,
it really helped me in math. i was one of those peiple who couldnt easily understand math but now i can.,
It lacks some basic Iesson. App can't be installed in many phones.,
I use this great app to review my math skills in order to keep my brain sharp. It has all sorts of math tutoring that is quite beneficial.,
"Sir it is the best learning app I have ever download. It is even better than paid learning apps but one request sir, please add question sending facility",
Khan Academy is the best source for learning but this app lost one of the greatest feature the ability to read comments/write comments on videos. Many of the questions that were raised in my mind after watching the videos were usually answered in the comments section by fellow learners but this app doesn't has comments options,
I was thoroughly going through all the Chemistry videos. Self studying at home. Bt now the app is not working. My Mobile is HTC 820s. Please help😖,
"Thank you so much for this. The idea that we can learnt anything, anytime, 
anywhere at absolutely no charge is crazy.",
"Khan academy aims to give free quality education over world wide.so I 
definitely support this app and I tell about this to another student.",
It's really helpful and useful and educational I can learn anything I want to learn And I can download videos and whatch it any time besides it's very helpful so that I can understand clearly thanks to the teachers who explain the subject,
Thumbs up,
My old school used it and it helped everyone out in class it was amazing I'm hoping it will help more now too,
"I like it. But i have one request, can you please make it offline as in videos, topics, tests all offline. Please i will rate 5 stars. Thank you.",
"App is finicky. It stops working when I submit the answer to a problem. 
Concept is great though, because it lets me learn on the go and increase my 
understanding. I imagine they can fix this through software updates.",
"I am 48 and currently trying to get my GED , this has helped me with my math so much, I love it,thank u for finally getting me to understand fractions",
It always answers my question and it explains very well thank you :) (y) thumbs up,
"It would be great if it offered an English course as well, I know a lot of people who would be glad for this. Otherwise it's a good app, it's simple and easy to figure out.",
I thx for this app it is very use full and easy u should must try it is easy to load and have 21 mb,
"It helped me a lot in tutaring my son with his school work Becouse i can 
understand the contents very well.",

It's amazing it helps me lern all the things that they don't teach us in school,
"Helped refresh and clarify so many lessons. Takes the stress out of high school, I definitely recommend this to any student or parent helping their child.",
"Great app, but scrolling doesnt work on most of the pages, you try to scroll down but it brings you up again almost immediately. My phone is a SM-J701MT.",
Yeah it's awesome bt i haven't used it too much from this session I'll start using continuously in sha Allah...,
What i wanted in cbse pattern i did not got it.espicially in  mathematics  subject what i wanted is that the proper section of it but i was not able to find that and it was not there. 10th class section was not there,
"I downloaded this hoping to sharpen up while on the run, as I find the quizzes, with their hints, to be an excellent learning tool. Unfortunately, this app appears to only have the videos; the opposite of what I would desire of this app. If I wanna watch full instructional videos I'll wait til I get home. How bout adding quizzes???",
Although I m a paid user of a educational site but I find it very easy in khan academy. My best wishes are there for Sal and team members. Thank you for serving so many people around the world.,
I just can't imagine how hard it would be If Khan academy wasn't part of my scientific learning experience. Thank you for being part of it.,
I really like this app but I'm having some trouble seeing the complete list of answers because the page gets stuck. Please fix this issue. Thanks.,
"We use Khan academy all the time in math, in fact that's all we do in the class, but I downloaded it here on my mobile device to use it in my free time and I took one of the assigned quizzes and, it wouldn't go into the next question, it would still be ""checking"" even though it said I got it right",
This is a really great app and the content is great. can learn many things quickly and easily like hard subjects such as maths.,
"Hi Mr Khan its a wonderful app but there are some bugs, you guys should include a minimizing and maximizing screen play feature which is in the Youtube app.",
I'm hoping that this app will help shed some lights on the difficult things,
please separate a box only for the problem in hand (for math). its difficult to keep track of them in the transcript.,
Khan academy is really great. And easy to use. I'm surprised that its free. People should be grateful that it's free.  And stop acting like brats,
Wonderful content but horrible amateur app. Keeps force closing and statistics & probability is on the site but not provided in the app. Doesn't make sense at all.,
"Useful app for school, but It won't let me take the interactive quizzes at 
the end of lessons, and says I haven't watched / finished a video even when 
I have. It gets really glitchy for me as well.",
Best app ever. An app many should have on their phones to refresh on subjects when they are bored.,
I hope this will help me on the ACTs and SATs cause I have to pass those in order to get into Texas A&M.,
It was so helpful in school. I don't know why people are saying that it is boring.,
"BEST STUDY APP EVVERR. I think everyone should download it, doesn't matter 
what age you are. And if you can, please donate to Khan Academy, Help this 
organization to succeed and grow that we may continue learning by watching 
their videos and completing the practices. It's a free study app that will 
for sure exceed your expectations.",
When downloading videos for offline use it freezes my phone. I hardly can even turn off my phone.,
"It has similar things, but is no where near as good as the website",
Ok.. It's a good app but it would be much better if there would be some written lectures also instead of only tutorials  or video lectures.. But gr8 app👍,
It really helps me when I'm stuck on a certain subject. Or problem,
"Absolutely uproarious. Help is worth it when is free. And this is worth more than help. I wish I have a word to describe this solitude, but khan  .. God bless you!  And enrich you with more wisdom to impact the world with accessible education  We all grateful for the donators  May the Good God favor y'all",
I have never seen an app like this. This is so easy to use and also everything is on the go. Thank you Mr. Khan for your effort. May Allah bless you and your project.,
"As a long time android user, I'm really glad this is finally here! And the design work + polish is really impressive.",
"This is the best app I have ever seen. Instead of wasting time on your stupid games, try this out. The regret I have is that all the features in the website are not there in the app. I would like it more of the above is implemented.",
"Imagine , you can learn for free and you can learn while offline..... And you bashers of this app, I think your grades are lllllloooooowwwww",
"Love this, been on khan for almost 4 years, but it's sad how its only the video.",
I like it because it helps me with my math. And every other thing I am failing.,
"Assalaamualaikkum Salman Bro, I am developer i am using lot of apps in android since 2013 but this is my first review, keep it up your work. in shaa allah you and your team will ace very soon.",
This is the best math website. If you think it is one better you are out of your mind,
This app is really helpful and has little of everything. And if you have trouble with a subject it sure helps,
Lovely Offline mode facility... Its really cool to have this facility. Even when I don't have internet in my house I get to read the offline courses. Love this app. Helped me a lot,
"Great, for everyday use, it formatted detail are easier to comprehend, compared to many other sites, Using this site has rapidly increase my levels, in solving word math problems..",
"So something has been draining my battery lately, and just a minute ago I got a crash notification saying that Khan Academy had stopped running on my phone. I haven't opened the app in weeks. I'm not sure what kind of background processes it's using, but I can't say I'm a fan.",
It's a problem solver app for all the students  and they can perform more better using your boss app  . love it,
A PERFECT app for studying and learning. It literally made me addicted to studying and excites you once studying time is here! I really recommend this app and I guarantee you will loooove this app!💚💚💚,
"Best app for students of any level, helps in preparation of tests and the excellent thing is the availability of easy solutions of all questions.",
Very useful for my sons but would have loved it even more if there was a bit of help about icse board also.,
Was trying to solve math and chem problems I've never really understood. Sal saved me and my exam.,
This app is really good but sometimes you make some easy topics too complicated.,
It is the best app compare to to Byjus because it has offline mode  and all type of courses like history art and many more .thanks for this app,

Great app  But however there is no video on  'relation' in the maths section of both class 11th and 12th.You have directly  started teaching from functions concept,
"Amazing education revolution by technology . If I can suggest improvement 
then I will say there should be language translator if anybody doesn't 
aware or good in such language. Thanks for such services",
"It's really helpful to me, i review things i need to know, especially it's really an advantage for me because i'm still a high school student and i think that the lessons here was in advance so i'm thankful for that.",
There's a bug that needs to be fixed... When I get a new assignment it doesn't show up and I can't find it anywhere please fix,
"bug in the assignments. never showed my new assignments from my coaches and 
costed me graduation :/ thanks a lot",

but all the sites I checked out required some amount of payment. Khan 
Academy, on the other hand, is completely free and really useful. Keep up 
the good work Sal and team! Made life easier .",
A blessing for those who want to study something but don't have the books or teachers. I use this for maths in class XII and it is not disappointing in teaching the basic concepts at all. Does what it says. Great work Mr.Salman Khan 🔥 keep up the good work! I love this app and foundation.,
I was searching for such app that can help me to learn computer programing. Then I found this app that is helping me a lot so thanks Khan academy,
It's a great app for the ones who don't have much time to attend tuition regularly and I really like it.,
"You haters who says this is ""boring"" are completely stupid. ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BORING YOU HATERS JUST WANT FUN YOU ONLY JUST PLAY IN SCHOOL.",
"It's good but the keyboard is buggy.. When my daughter is attempting to write in the answer, the keyboard doesn't appear, making it impossible to continue on the phone...",
I dont know if it will help but by judging on all of the other reviews I really hope it puts me back on the straight a's so I can go to Yale law school,
"I needed to learn algebra ASAP and relearn what i forgot. This thing is helping me so much, from the scratchpad, to the videos, to the guides. 10/10 saving my life right now!",
I don't understand why people are saying it's boring it's an app to improve your academics if you don't like school maybe you should stop telling the creaters to get a life and obtain one yourself,
This helped me on every moment of my doubts. Hatsoff to the providers and developers. Csn anyone tell me how to donate them :),
Makes maths fun! I HATE maths but this makes it SUPER FUN😚XX,
Thanks for initiative taken by you because most of student need quality of education today's your academy full fill there needs.,
It is great app for learning. One thing which makes it more idle among several learning app that it is free of cost.,
The best ever app I have been using for studying. I would like to recommend this app to download. The contents in it is highly valued.,
"The app has problems sometimes, especially when actually signed into an 
account, but the content is good and khan is engaging as a speaker.",

this problem ,then I'll rate it five stars for sure as I have used this app 
before.",

Great app for those who want to get some advanced lessons..... Its great and free!!! But the only is this bug that make it really hard to answer questions .... It just lags and takes me almost a minute especially if your answer is long.,
"I first found Kahn Academy on my computer, my math teacher also recommended a little after I somewhat knew what it was.

I'm a returning to school adult and this app truly helped me navigate back into algebra and math classes.   Highly recommend it!,
"Well designed enough, but why isn't your entire resource library available on the app?  I might as well just go to your mobile site... At least it's got all of your content.  Uninstalled due to the waste of time and space.",
How can we learn if we don't start from the beginning. We would be lost.,

"I love Khan academy but the app is always crashing when I am taking a quiz. 
Please look forward that. Thanks",
I never seen this type of app it is amazing app,
It has helped me through my advanced biology problems as an undergraduate in microbiology,
"I like the app so much, it helps me alot",
"Good for learning but its really frustrating when your teacher starts 
assigning skills and the mastery challenge puts a 7 hour wait limit. Wish 
it was more efficient to master skills",
"Where do I ask my doubts? There is no place for typing in my doubts! Not below videos, not in the profile option .. nowhere!!",
Just download ...n u will engage n interest itself toward more n more of ur own fields,
"The website is perfect, but the app isn't. When I log in, there's no point, no change. Now I know people are saying it's amazing, and that was their experience. But mine wasn't",
"I have used Khan academy for years, in our homeschooling. Have the app on our Roku, also, and now my daughter can practice in the go with the app for mobile! All for free. Thanks Khan!",
Khan academy is a fantastic resource to support and improve learning of many subjects. Please support them on behalf of poor college students.,
It helps to learn everything.but it doesnot contain english language.please setup english language in this then i would give it 5 stars.,
"I have used Kahn multiple times, i have yet to encounter any issues, really helpful!",
Its a great help. It impacted my children's learning in a way that is outstanding.,
I love this app and it is very useful. I have one question though. Is is possible to access the dashboard like what you can do on the computer?,
Its supposed to be boring cz its an educational app not an entertainment. Stop being negative. Its the best they cant dance while explaining.😶,
"Everything is just almost perfect. I just wish more topics be included in 
the computer science branch. Thank you :)",
"I will not say many words but i will say this app is superb download it 
right now",
"User experience is not good, if we can't see our enrolled courses in this app then what is the meaning of making an account in it..",
"Thanks to Khan Academy, I'm doing well in math again",
Its very helpful because in social study's im failing but now I'm going to do better!,
Honestly this app is really good.I was having some problems with trigonometry and this made me understand it better,
Dirty app I did not like it it's a good app super very bad app don't download this is a very good app plz download it,
"The content is completely educational. And honestly, I learned so much here in senior high maths than in our class! In regards to the app, I wish we can download articles and quizzes. :---) KA by the way, is one of my friends now!",
Useless app when I play video it gets buffer and stops for sometime and then the app closes automatically,
I think this app has been helped me most in my studies it's a best app fir studing without internet,
It is a packet from where you can accomplish your all necessities and wishes and queries if you are having them in study.,
Great work by  Khan academy team!!  I  also hope that more knowledge of 11th 12 th std would be present in coming updates .  The app is fantastic.. I am  getting help from it,
I like it what I don't like is that you have to do 5 in a row u should just have to do a little class,
Love it need it for school and I couldn't find my computer so I just downloaded it,
"I like how you guys added quiz to test our abilitys it is a helpful addition to your application , thank you",
"First im just watching your tutorials on yt then i start learning from your 
websites and now i'm here. Thank you so much!",

It so easy to ise and you can learn anything. This app should have 5 stars,
"I have yet to use the app, but can we all just take a second to marvel at its existence. I've been waiting so long. *sniffles* I'll update my review once I have used the app, but to Khan Academy and developers: Thank you.",
A great learning and studying app. Im am in 6th grade learning 8th grade math thanks to the IB Program at my school!,

Khan academy app is very nice and many lectures are invited their student to install this nice all.I'm the example o,
It might seem boring but I get to get my phone out dusting class,
I'll be truthfull. This app has more than just a part of my grades. Thank you,
I will see it and if its bad i will change my review,
"I have learnt a lot from khan academy (and still learning) you don't need to pay hundreds of dollars for tuition. Khan academy is the app! Its completely free, no in app purchases, no ads! YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING! :)",
"Khan academy is obviously good but app needs developments such as changing 
video quality, test prep, etc",

The website help me more but having your own app it's completely awesome,
Wow due it's awesome app tyvm But can you add a option that we can low the speed of video,
Khan Academy is the best thing ever. The videos are easy to understand and it is a fantastic resource.,
This app is the best studying app for the SAT when your trying to pass it to enter senior year or college requirements.,
My GED BECAUSE OF THIS I WISH YOU WERE HERE IN 1994 all this education is important I am going to get my Ged then College Thank you Mr.Khan,
"I think this app is very supportive and easy to use this will help me in my 
examinations.😚",
It didn't start with the basics. It starts with introductions. You need to understand the students who learn from an app are not students who are professionally learning the subject,
It offers great knowledge in free. What else one wants to get. Millions regards.,
I've been using this app for the longest of time and it helped me in the most dramatic way. Definitely a recommendation,
"Its the only application based on to crack iit jee , neet and every 
competitive level exams.",
No learning is better than learning at your own pace... And khan academy does it well. Thank you team khan academy...,
"I wish to learn Ayurveda, its basics and applied aspects. Please make it available ASAP.",
For an app that I rarely use it uses more background data than all of the apps combined..,
It helped me learn many things that my dad can't teach me in home school and now I can learn more things on my own,
So borring it dose not give good thing in a fun way,
I love it it give u hint and also it help pull up grade.! My daughter  got 1f in math and got a .it alsome,
The most important thing is learning is free and I can study anything,
Would Be Great if we could do problems and work on this app like on the website,
Khan Academy helps me pass most of my tests and exams. There should be more organizations like Khan Academy because education should be free. Do you know how mankind achieved all the technology we have today? It's because mankind passed down their knowledge throughout billions of generations without forcing people to pay until modern history.,
But still it isn't as efficient as the desktop site. Too slow.,
Helped me to clear basic concepts.i wish i had an option to donate through my Google credits.,
This is a app for kids . It is essential for kids. But it has. A problem,
It helps you cover things you may not go over on class,
When ever I am not at school I can finish my work,
It's the best app really!!.I learned so many things from it which my teachers did not explained properly.it helped me a lot .I would like some new content in it and more practice questions,
I suck so much at math this literally helped me get Trig so easily,
verry bad app madarchodowa tohar mahatari chodo local app tohar bahine chodo tohar nani chodo tohar fuaa,
Thought it was free courses it's more to help you if your in high school or in a course and want extra help,
"I think you should add machine learning courses in computer science. By the 
way it's fantastic app.",
This help so much I can get to khan academy anywhere,
I got my concepts cleared by watching your videos. You are doing holy job Mr. Khan! Keep it up.,
Any free educational materials won't five star with education we can achieve more togetherness);,
Simply loved it.... App helps to learn new things and more stuff which absolutely free..,
New definition for studies is No longer far now.,
"Helps alot in mathematics and science and other subjects too..Everything is 
explained fantastically..Best app for students..",
"The best concept of all.Free education for all.Great work,please continue doing this great task.",
"Thank you Sal! You make maths so much fun and easy to learn, and thank you for keeping Khan Academy free! Just one request, please make more videos about proving stuff in geometry.",
It's great on the Web as well.. Freaking awesome  One question though Can we learn to code on the app,
Perfect app for an ardent learner. Have to learn many new things from this app. Awesome and authentic app,
Gets a detailed description of topics and uses an appropriate standard of language that is required...a complete multimedia package😇,
Best app for jee preparation but concepts are not exactly correct in some points but at all great app it's free,
Now I can get my khan academies done for my previous algebra class,
Please make it also for class 11 cbse (india)  humanities student,
Really great app to study on things i don't really get in school,
Awesome app. Lacks a Move to SD card option. Implement that and it gets 5 stars.,
THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME APP EVER FOR ALL AGES :-),
Everyone is saying its boring but since when is school suppose to be not boring!! It gets the work done and helps me better understand it! I would rather be bored and learn than be stupid and lazy!,
"Anyone saying it's boring obviously didn't expect to learn things. For those of you haters, if you ever see ""academy"" it will most likely be educational, not fun",
Is really good for learning and it will help you during your life so install is really good,
Now i understand fractions and im gettin confused in class so i just recap,
Awesome app which gives information about my best subjects which are PCM.,

You people are so annoying you made this app now I have to be doing 50 min in a week,
Khan Academy is the reason for my susscess as a student. If you desire to excel like me i strongly recommend this app,
"This app mad me fail the 8th grade . IT never helped me @ all. So thanks 
alot",
Lacks some subjects like js  programming which i was learning please impliment them in Mobile version too,
I cant sine in with my account will get 5 star if fix,
It helps me a lot when in having trouble with homework and also because my class uses it too,
It's not a normal application It's an amazing application for learning Which can teach us as well as time,
Jst loved the way they teach,
Actually as I had experienced it for 5 month its an great app. Everyone should install it an great app totally free,

I knew this web from my math teacher and I was falling in love with this kind of learning !!! Pray for my exam please 😇,
Man its awesome.. So much of virtue by this organization to students.. And all for free... Thumbs up keep up the good work,
It is best learing app it helped me to pass my tenth grade easly with great marks should use it.,

This is really cool! I can learn many subjects and do revision for my school. You guys should download it! It's the best education app ever!,
"This app bought me with its lots of contents, but was not what I expected. I wish there was a text based learning, because I don't have patience with videos. And when I select a test, it doesn't bring  up the keyboard. Also, I'm from Brazil and have no use for north-american history. Is there a way to remove modules from the main screen?",
"Teachers never teach now, just tell you to get on khan and sit in the back getting paid for grading amount of mastery grades instead of teaching",
This organization is the only one in the world which provides every course for free.I love to use this app,
Using Technology For Teaching Different Subjects With Various Ways . . .Excellent Work For Students.,

I love dis app helps in my study but offline mode should be there....,
Where are all the practice problems? Videos are ok and all BUT doing the problems and learning from them is so much better. The website has all of the practice problems so I was kind of expecting the app to have the same.,
