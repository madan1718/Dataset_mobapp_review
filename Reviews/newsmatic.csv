Review Text,Category
"This app is great...in the Apple Store. The Android version is a mess. Won't update, won't even load - keeps asking me to subscribe (after I already did), doesn't show a login option. It really is a great app on my iPad, but it either needs fixed on Android or completely pulled. Disappointed because my kids all have Android phones and we have only one iPad so they won't use the app as often for current events as I would like them to if it's not easily accessible.",
"Will not open. Crashes immediately on launch. I'm really disappointed because my son loves keeping up with the news this way. He had the subscription at school and it was a great conversation starter, but now I cannot open the app at all on my phone which is a very new model, and on my older model which I let my son use, he can open the app but there's no way to scroll through the stories. You just get a static half of a page.",
"I loved this app so much. It's been a lifeline for us in this pandemic. However, it's stopped working. The picture and the news no more match.. they are totally unsyncronized.",
The news is great! It's so interactive and interesting! I would definitely recommend that your child reads from this app!,
I didnt realize I had an active annual subscription. I wasn't sent a renewal notice and they refuse to provide a refund for this product I'm no longer using. So shady!,
"This is so awesome! I really recommend this not just for kids but everyone who's interested in the news in a simple way! Best of all, it's ad free! It's also really easy to use!",
Interesting collection daily reads for my 10 yo. Hope it continues what it is doing. more international and current affairs will be great!,
What's wrong with this app? It used to work well but now I cannot scroll down the page.. plz fix it..,
"Have loved this app for years, but it suddenly won't load on Pixel 2 running Android 10?",
I love your pictures and videos and words keep up with the good work. thanks.🚺😄,
It wont download on my phone and i was looking forward to this please fix it i gave it two stars because it could be a nice app inside thank you,
Awesome news app for kids! Very easy learning yet very informative!,
I am 10 and my mom and I agree that this is an awesome app. I totally recommend it to any kid who wants to stay informed!,
This app is 100% free 100% a jet and 100% on Apple Google Play store 🏪🏬,
Wonderful learning app for Current Events!,
Loved it for years but it work nomore on my Samsung phone...so so disappointed,
"I used this in 4th and 5th grade, it explains things in a way children understand.",
It is white allways never news is coming and waste of data,
kids learn a lot from current issues.,
Worthless app. Very tacky. Just avoid.,
I'm learning English with this apps.,
It was very nice loved it keep it up,
"Good for adult ,too",
Super cool game,
I can't wait to see this,
Gggggggg . Can you find the dot,
Going to try ......,
"Perfect for Elementary School aged students to engage with age appropriate news articles. Three reading levels available. Features allow the text to be read to them & definitions of words. There are short related videos, slide shows and facts. Also contains news related games &  puzzles and option to write to Russ the Editor or draw a picture.   Subscription price is extremely reasonable and the app is well loved by my children.  Home version available on iOS, Android & Amazon.",
I just learned a lot more from this ONE app! Its the best!!!!!!!,
makes you have more knowledge,
Great app for kids,
Great app,
cool,
"The app itself is okay  , but every time I load one of the games the app has a problem and closes",
"Tried to subscribe on Samsung Tab and can't due to a bug in this app.  Others have trouble too.  Seems nice, too bad it has such flaws...",
I have trouble getting in it always says news o matic and i click and click i am soo confused😩,
It is awesome for schools so kids can learn interesting things happening around ten world,
A problem ocurred.I cannot get in and its like...😞 get hack.Please fix it and I will put five stars.,
It took forever to load.,
"After putting in all details on app user registration page on a Samsung tablet, there's no OK or confirm button. Hence, user details never get saved",
It won't let me interact with it it says that news o matic has stopped,
It is thenonly resource my son uses for his current events homeworks.,
Awesome,
Why should  pay 9.99 for unlimited access  I'm nine my mom would pay me that. Why can't I just watch the daily new they don't pay me sad news o matic so so sad😭😞,
I like this app because I've seen this in the classroom in our school and I loved it. I also like knowing what's going on in the world.,
Haven't used it long but really like it so far compared to other kids' news options we've explored.,
Although th app is listed under free aps it works only for a trial period. How can one say its a free app. Though the content is good the fact that it deseaves us really can't be accepted.,
My third grader reads and tells me about the news everyday now. Such a good habit to start early.  Best $10 I have spent in a long time.,
Perfect app to kick off our homeschool day with interesting reading that often stimulates discussion! Just enough & easy to use. Love it!,
I can't talk to Russ or draw a picture. Fix for 5 stars,
I love this app because you should watch the world toilet day,
Will be a good app once I can do draw and ask russ! Fix this and I will give 5 stars!,
So in to it gives you information about mostly everything,
Splash screen shows for a minute or two on first use. Perhaps there should be a progress bar...?,
Great way to share news with my kids!,

Not cool it is stupider,
Love reading,
"My boys hate reading, News O Matic is one of the only things they will read. THANK YOU",
It's a great source for news for kids and adults!,
"It seems like its free but that's only a trial that's free if its not then don't say it please, but overall its a decent app I guess",
Omg i love this app. Kids deserve to see what is going on in the u.s  im 11 1/2 and this app is sooo usfull to me god bless America!!!!!♡,

"The constant pop-ups and redirects suggesting I subscribe are incredibly irritating because I am a subscriber and already logged in every time. I tried participating in a survey at the end of the article (I was looking for the comment section, no luck.) When I put the cursor in the text field the screen jumps up and down (best way I can describe it,) eliminating the ability to see the text as I type, then when I try to review it, I'm redirected to subscription ad again! Infuriating!",
"The app is horrible to use. Often links don't open the desired pages. You are then forced to look for them. But by far the worst thing is the constant refreshing of the main page, which turns white, tells you it is updating and waiting up to 30+ seconds or more before you can view another article. Sometimes the main page doesn't refresh completely, leaving you with a white page. Wouldn't be surprised that this doesn't happen on newer iOS devices!",
"Love the articles, obviously. For the app, it's easy to use and works consistently. My one criticism is that there appears to be a minor bug: When opening a link within the app, on the article that opens, the app sometimes does not have the three icons (bookmark/save, share, and ""..."" more) in the app header bar. Then there's no way to save for later or even get a URL so you can share the article.",
"I'm giving the NYT one star because even though I have contacted the developers (you never really talk to the developers but just a message taker) multiple times over a couple of years this problem still persists. If you open a photo or view a slideshow, the description obscures the bottom part of the photo. If it's a long description it obscures most of the photo. Once upon a time you could tap the photo and the description would drop down and disappear. I sure wish they would fix that.",
"I'm a long-time user, but the last several weeks the app has been behaving very strangely. The screen freezes when I try to scroll, I get half way through an article and suddenly the lower portion of the screen is blank, I try to refresh the screen and it hangs, etc.. I seem to be constantly closing and reopening the app to escape one problem or another.",
"This is one of the worst built apps from a professional company on the planet. Forget the news content. This app is slow, laggy, resets the positions in your article when you twist the screen or when it finishes loading an ad, and the widget has become completely nonfunctional. The top stories can take over a minute to load sometimes. Really just a poorly made application. The developers have no idea how to incorporate ads into content for performance. Lately it's gotten to the point where I give up and read news from elsewhere. Get new developers, NYT. You just lost a subscriber.",
"Great content, but I think I have to go back to using the mobile site. This app is very frustrating to use. The reason I'm editing my post and rating? I was enjoying the 2018 year in pictures when I left the app to do a search and was gone for maybe 30 seconds. When I returned, the page had to reload and sent me all the way to the top. The images also had to reload. Very frustrating.",
"Really am enamored with the articles and features that the NY Times presents... while I am reading these on my computer. Even though I am a paid subscriber (and have been for over a decade), I am continually frustrated by the app. Lately, it has been crashing frequently. I can no longer read Wirecutter because I cannot log in --- just see a white screen. Please fix this. A quality reading experience is what your subscribers expect and are paying for.",
"The low rating has nothing to do with the content, which I depend on. That's actually the point: The app has grown unworthy of the thing it delivers. First, it drains battery like crazy. This baffles me, since its main job - at least, the thing I want it to do - is to deliver text. Why should that be resource intensive? In this iteration, it doesn't even do that reliably, as articles chronically fail to load. I'm now reading the Times through another app. Not pretty, but at least it works",
"Two gripes: 1) For the last two months or so, have been getting at least 10 ""breaking news"" notifications a day, sometimes multiple notifications about the same thing with slightly different wording. Many of these notifications test the limit of what can reasonably be called ""breaking news."" I have all other notifications disabled. Please limit these notifications to actual breaking / new / important developments only. 2) Nighttime mode (white text on black background) is no longer available.",
"Notifications don't link you to the articles. It's so annoying. Good luck finding it. The searching function is terrible too. They should let you filter out the Reuters and AP articles. At least the coverage is great. I love the covid interactive material (graphs and maps). They don't work perfect within the app, but that's more understandable.... Unlike the notification linking issue.",
"Took away widgets - cancelling my subscription. I know there are other ways to use the app, but the widget was my way. I do not want email, I have more than enough podcasts and audio books already, and sometimes the alerts are just too much. Scrolling thru the widget wad casual and comfortable. I know it seems like a small change, but for me is a deal breaker.",
"Like many others, I find the notifications feature almost completely useless. About one time out of twenty, clicking on the notification actually brings me to the story mentioned in the notification - otherwise it sends me to the homepage for the app, and I have literally no way to guess where in the site that story might be buried. About two-thirds of the time, I can *eventually* find the story, after a lot of digging, but a significant portion of the notifications are just ""ghosts"" apparently - there may or may not be a story there, somewhere, but I can't find it. And notifications are one of the *primary* reasons I want the app - otherwise, I can access the main page and scroll through stories much more efficiently on my laptop. At a minimum, a notification ought to contain some sort of perma-link back to the story that triggered the notification, one that won't ""break"" simply because a newer story - even an unrelated one - doesn't disrupt the link. A consistently functional notification system would garner at least 4, probably 5 stars. As it is, 3 at best. ETA (March 24, 2020): Months later, and still no solution for this persistent and ongoing problem. NYT, I know you're swamped but your programmers shouldn't be. FIX this.",
"Feature set is lacking when it comes to actually browsing articles. The back button frequently takes me to the home page instead of the previous page I was on. This means I have to avoid clicking links or risk losing my place in the article. Since the front page loads so often, it eats my data. I can not use the app in this state. Reading the news is stressful enough without the app getting in the way.",
"About 75% of the time, clicking on a notification will only bring you to the homepage, not the specific story referenced in the notification. Very often that story is nowhere near the homepage, so you're left clumsily searching for it until you inevitably decide to just Google the event and read about it from a different source. If they could fix that, the app would be fine. Browsing stories looking for nothing in particular works well, but the notification system is absolutely broken.",
"The news reporting is excellent, but the app has a serious bug that appears related to the ads they embed in stories. You may be reading a story when a large swath of the screen is suddenly blacked out. You may or may not be able to scroll past the blackness, but it keeps coming back, and its boundaries jump up and down. When this happens, and it happens often, you pretty much can't finish reading the story. it is frustrating, consider that people are paying money to read the stories.",
"For most of 2018 the NYT app has crashed at least once a day. Lately the problem has gotten much worse with multiple crashes daily. Sending feedback has been a waste of time. Problem seems to be related to how the app handles ads. The app is otherwise quite good, but it's so aggravating having to reboot every time it crashes. Android on a Moto G5+.",
"Why remove the optional night mode? Literally makes no sense. If you're going to improve the feature, great, but don't remove the semi-working *optional* feature in the mean time. The app is blinding like the sun without it. I see in your patch notes we'll hear more soon, but it literally makes no sense to get rid of it in the meantime. Edit: maybe the night mode required manual work? And it was too much overhead? That would make sense, but honestly I'd take any night mode at this point.",
"Content is good, but the app is infuriating. If I tap on a push notif, it just opens the app. It doesn't link me directly to the article. Which means I have to search for the article manually if I want to read it. Really really annoying. To top it off, the search function is atrocious. It yields irrelevant articles. You have to type the exact words, which is difficult because the notifs are usually paraphrases of the headlines. 🤦",
"Terrible app design. Your place in an article isn't always kept if you switch to a different app or if you switch between landscape and portrait. The ads are distracting and frequent enough that you can have two video ads on screen at the same time, which is ridiculous considering the monthly subscription cost. The articles are worth it but you are better off using a browser.",
"The content is great but the app is in need of serious work. I can't get all the way through a story without the app glitching and sending me back to the front page with no apparent cause. As others have mentioned tapping the app notifications often fails to load the appropriate story and just dumps the user on the home page instead. Please fix this app, I want to keep reading these stories but it's becoming a real hassle.",
"The app is slow and a pain to use. Sometimes you click on an article, only to find that it's part of a list of headlines around a topic and you've been taken to the top of the list, only to scroll down back to the one you clicked on to start. I get multiple notifications for articles I've already read. Lately it just takes forever to load anything.",
"I think it's worth it for the arts and science information, alone. I don't read the news so much, but I do appreciate the slick interactive maps. It's very a visual experience, which for those who learn or are nourished in that way. As in most larger publications, there is some beautifully done writing and culture to consume. I love it, so far. The app has given me no trouble. Not at all.",
"It updates news only sporadically - sometimes up to 24 hours in arrears. Their tech staff solutions didn't work - in fact, they suggested I look at it on the web instead. Oddly, the puzzles section is always up-to-date. So for late-breaking news, I go to my apps for the Washington Post, Guardian, BBC News, Reuters, AP, etc, but hey, if I want to do the Crossword, the NYT is there for me",
"This is tough because of course NYT is the gold standard for news. No issue with the content. The problem is navigation. On Android at least, you open the app, pick an article, then start following links at the end to other articles. Now there is no way to navigate back home. Like, no home button, no sidebar, nothing in the vertical ellipsis menu. So either close the app and restart, or hit back back back back... Maybe the developers were trying to streamline for a clean look and went overboard?",
Frustrating notification experience. I'm close to dropping my New York times subscription and switching to The Washington Post. The issue with the notifications has been going on for quite some time and still hasn't been corrected. I will click on an interesting article notification but am then taken to the wrong article in the app. This drives me nuts!,
"Overall it's fine. But what the NYT app very desperately needs is a dark mode like every other major app, as well as the ability to select which breaking news articles deserve a notification. I'm receiving too many notifications of stories I wouldn't consider breaking news at all. If there were a way to choose which notifications we get based on font size of the headline, for instance, that would be perfect. I personally only want to be notified of the major headlines.",
Updated for Jan 2021: move towards live feed with mini articles on the website don't work very well on the app. Lots of jumping screens. Hard to identity what's new or old. Doesn't feel like the best way to convey news. Gimmicky. New issue is the removal of dark mode. Was a lab experiment but made the experience significantly better. Now it's gone. The Android app has continued to be a bad user experience. Prior issues were re: hiding sections and inability to curate personalized content,
"Usability issues plague this app, as others have documented. The main one that really shouldn't be so hard to fix and destroys the core reading experience: every time I scroll and the nav bar pops in or out, the offset of the whole article adjusts in the opposite direction. My guess is this is to avoid cutting off the end of the article. But as a result, most scrolling results in the entire article shifting randomly around. It is practically impossible to read anything like this.",
"The newest update to this app now has it refresh the entire content automatically, including all images and ads, every time you finish reading an article, which increases the data usage tremendously. Even when it is set to only refresh manually, it still does it, and there is no way to turn that off. I have a digital subscription, but I'm ditching the app and reading the news on my laptop or on my browser now. This app uses more data than all the other apps I have put together. Reading it in the browser loads faster and doesn't use nearly as much data. Please note that this is not a review of the New York Times content, which is always superb and well-written. Five stars for the writers and editors, just not for the app.",
"The app has always been unstable but over the past few months it has rapidly degraded to the point that it now just freezes and crashes after about 1 minute. Part of the problem seems to stem from nyt adding a bunch of graphics and other content for COVID that is preload caching on startup. Come on guys you can do better than this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling app and this did nothing to fix the issue. The ""COVID Risk in your area"" section seems like it might be the culprit",
"The rare app that actively gets worse with each version. It used to be you could swipe between sections while on the home page, and then swipe to the next/prior article when reading. Then they eliminated the ability to swipe between sections, and required to you manually scroll to the top of the home page and select a different section. Now they have eliminate the ability to swipe between articles, requiring you to return to the home page and manually select the next story. Why?",
"I've used this app for several years, especially since moving to an area where there is no delivery of the physical NYT to homes or stores. So it's invaluable to me and well worth the cost. The most recent update, however, is buggy. Some stories don't load, some take repeat attempts, and some are blank midway through. Please de-bug soon!!",
This app doesn't work well with my new Samsung tablet. I have been complaining to the nyt but they have not responded in a serious way. Clearing the cache has no effect but that is what they say to do. I can only read one or two articles when the ads and photos start blinking black and then whole blocks of black obscure the text.,
"Excellent, stable interface for reading articles. My one complaint is that there is no way to find text in an article. When reading a long article, I often want to find a reference I'd read earlier, and the only way to do so is to scroll through the whole article again--or to copy the share link to Chrome which has the find text feature. Recommend adding the find text feature to the app.",
"This app is really wonky. I tap on an article, and it takes me to a totally different one, often one I read earlier in the day. This happens about 3 out of 5 times. Usually I can find the one I want again, but not always. So crazy. Two weeks in a row I try to read articles from The Weekender and the links don't work. This week there is a brief error message saying it couldn't be opened for each article I tried.",
"Went from mediocre but functional (clunky could find what I needed) to complete trash with the most recent update. It's impossible to go straight back to stories I had been following and the ""for you"" recommendations are not as good as previously. 2 stars because I can still read articles. In this sense it is fulfilling the minimum requirement and not a total failure.",
"Great content but consistently terrible navigation experience. Articles jump around disorientingly as display ads load. Recently, navigating back to front page always takes you to the top, so you have to scroll way down to pick up where you were. Closing out of zoomed photos is only possible using back button, which is a cumbersome user experience. Save function appears in different places depending, I guess, on the kind of article? Overall, the fundamentals of the app are a kind of a mess.",
"Really disappointed that dark/night mode disappeared in the latest update. Too hard on my eyes without it. I also don't appreciate that my notifications don't bring me directly to the associated articles. The content is good but the app is slow and clunky, and the decent features keep changing or disappearing. Get it together, NYT app developers.",
"This app is incredibly buggy, even after the most recent update. Every fancy multimedia ""article"" ends up requiring a reboot and the intrusive ads often break the app (my phone is 1 yr old and not the problem). I just experienced a prime example of why I hate it: I hadn't opened the app all day but when I did, the Top Stories tab was entirely blank, even after repeated refreshing. I went to the Popular Stories tab instead, which was populated, and opened an article on heart disease. Halfway through reading it, one of the (constantly loading) video ads appeared to take over the entire screen, rendered it black, then froze the app completely. I am a paying NYT subscriber and as such expect better than this.",
"App is great when it works, but often has glitches. It seems like every time they fix one glitch (after 6 months of putting up with it), another glitch appears. Until recently fixed, I had problems where all pages would turn up with white text on black backgrounds. Now, the app struggles to refresh content and notifications only open to the main page instead of the article.",
This app has set the standard for digital versions of a newspaper for years. I have been using and subscribing to this app for at least eight years and been very happy. This last update ruined that. 1. The newsfeed widget is gone. 2. Searches from Google still try to open in the app but all I get is a blank screen. This is really disappointing NYT. It makes me question my subscription.,
"The Widget is what made this news app great. Replacing it with an excessive amount of notifications was not a improvement. I ended up having to turn notifications off because of the constant pings. Now I rarely use the NYT and have gone back to using the BBC app because they still have a great widget. It's a shame because I thought NYT had better content. Edit: The Guardian and Washington Post also have widgets. Not as good as BBC's and the old NYT one, but at least the have one!!!",
I love the Times but I am fed up with the number of times some site feature has caused frequent and persistent crashes with the app. This latest has been going on for a couple of weeks and makes it impossible to read the news with my tablet. It seems to involve location specific covid information embedded in the main page. I will give them a few more days to fix it or cancel my subscription.,
"I keep trying the app every year or so. It's just not as good as a browser. Getting back to the home page is sometimes multiple clicks. There are sections that are missing (eg, in the browser I can go to Sports, then go to ""Tennis"", or in the Well section I can go to ""Mind"" or ""Family"" - there's no way to do that in the app). It's just not up to par. Chrome will continue to be my nyt Reader for now.",
I like the interactive data visualizations. But there are some major issues. The app reverts back to the home screen automatically when the articles are updated in the background. This is very frustrating to deal with when I'm in the middle of reading an article and it forcefully exits to the home page. I have to search for the article again to complete reading it.,
"The app is frustrating sometimes. It's a pain to navigate. Those visuals that change as you scroll are wonky. There's no easy way to know how long an article is since there's no scrollbar. Articles go back to the top of the page if you make the mistake of letting your screen turn off for half a second. I turned on dark mode a few nights ago and now it's stuck that way; the alleged theme option didn't exist when I tried to switch back for daytime. At least there's the crossword, I guess.",
"So, the latest glitch (probably the result of another feature added with bad code or programming) seems to be whenever I return to the home page after reading an article it scrolls back to near the top and then ""updates"" which usually results in the app stopping, especially if the article contained a lot of graphics, images, or interactive features. Then when I contact them, I get the same boilerplate reply. Continually frustrating considering the amount of $ they charge for digital.",
"Good for news, but has some problems. Two things are really annoying. The first is that you can't search the pages! I skimmed a story, then wanted to find some specifics... No Searching on the pages! The other annoying thing is that, while you can scroll through the articles, there is no scroll bar to show your progress... You can't tell if you're near the end or the beginning of a story, so you can't budget your time. When it gets to be too long, I just bail from the app.",
"When a notification comes in for a new story, tapping on it will open the story. However, about 50% of the time, less than five seconds after opening the article you clicked on, the app will revert to the home page or some other story. Good luck trying to find what you actually wanted to read when that happens - it's rarely on the front page. Other than that very infuriating problem, it's okay.",
The content is good. The app experience is horrible. There is no easy access to app options. THERE IS NO DARK/NIGHT MODE! (And it is clearly known to the devs since they rolled it out for the crossword app) and every time you leave the app it jumps to the top of the feed. It makes for a very irksome experience. I may cancel my subscription.,
"Chat is broken and partly unintuitive UI (difficult to find things in the app). I recently had to chat in order to cancel my subscription, and the chat feature was completely broken. The keyboard covers up the conversation. If you click one of the response boxes, the keyboard disappears, and you can't get it back. It took me about 10 chat attempts to figure out a workaround (didn't click any boxes and just typed x + enter for a new line over and over until I could read the responses).",
"Really enjoy the balanced news, but a feature they have is quite annoying. When you exit an article, it takes you back to the first article at the top. Equivalent to being on page 20 of the paper, reading an article and have to start back at page 1. It's a race to press any article to stop the scroll to the top. It would be nice if we could turn off this ""feature"". My rating would be higher except for this feature.",
"Updated as usability is rapidly going down the drain. The three major faults I see are how stories are loaded (2 issues) and the lack of dark mode. The app loads ads in the middle of reading articles. It then jumps to the ads (that I've never clicked through intentionally) and you loose your position and have to find it again - annoying as hrll!. Many of the articles aren't downloaded until you click on them - doesn't work on the NY subway, duh! Get working on dark mode!",
"Any article with interactive content is unreadable. As I scroll, it randomly jumps around with no rhyme or reason. The recent article on Russian military failures was an extreme example - I tried valiantly for 5 minutes to read 3 paragraphs and eventually had to concede defeat: the app only skips to just before and just after them. I eventually gave up reading the article at all after 30 minutes of trying. It's giving me a headache. This is a huge problem I have seen for at least a year",
"I have over 300 apps on my tablet. This is by far the worst. Scrolling through articles is jumpy and unpredictable. Intrusive ads open in front of the text of articles as I am reading it. Page load times are incredibly long, ten or fifteen seconds is not uncommon, even though my internet connection is fast and strong. Grey bars flash in and out intruding on the articles. It often crashes five times while reading the paper once. The support team when contacted always blames the customer. They ignore what you say making everything my fault. If you read other reviews you will see I am not alone. This is a great newspaper, but the app is the worst.",
"The content on the app is valuable but the app itself has issues. I have the app on a Pixel 5 and an IPad pro and the issues are the same. The app is slow to load and slow to refresh. It almost never functions smoothly, most transitions are a step slow or briefly pop up loading animations. The layout could be better arranged and it doesn't offer a dark mode. Ultimately it still is worth the price of subscription. 9/28/23 : A dark theme that leaves the text black on white? What's the point?",
"This is the most frustrating app. You can't set up any shortcuts to topics, newsletters, or columnists you like. The search function is useless. I might as well get a physical newspaper, the app is hardly any easier to navigate or customize. If you send feedback in their ""app feedback"" function, they ignore what you say. They clearly employ talented people who make great techy interactive articles, maybe they should help bring this app into the 21st century. Needs a major overhaul.",
"There seems to be no way to narrow down from broad topics like Arts to more specific things like Fine Art. I end up having to rely on the save feature to hold on to articles after scrolling through posts about mostly movies and music. However, the link to Saved articles is burried more than 30 links down in the menu. IMOP this section is more important than the aggregated 'For You' and should have top level access. The search icon is also only on the sections tab which could also be top level.",
"The entire navigation and article delivery interface needs to be overhauled. The design patterns do not follow modern industry standards, and the experience does not feel even slightly personalized. This is the age of explainable AI and ML driven content consumption, I shouldn't have to dig through the recesses of the sections tab to get to the content I find interesting to me. The app should do that for me.",
"NYT has great reporting, but app's notifications have turned into a nightmare. I won't receive any notifications for days, then I'll randomly receive one. When I expand the notification, I am bombarded with all the notifications I should have received for the prior ten days or so. If I click on a notification to read an article, it doesn't open related article. Instead, it takes me to the latest news article. It's been like this for several weeks - I will be cancelling my subscription.",
I don't like the changes they made to the app. I thought the old version was more than fine. My least favorite change is I can no longer read articles in the horizontal position. Another major issue is with push notifications. Half of them don't lead to the article. A tip for users is to save the article and a lot of times it will actually save it. I do like that the app includes recently viewed.,
"If you like it, never upgrade! Every update makes it harder and harder to find the news you want. On the plus side, I spend less time reading the news now that I can't quickly jump to my favorite sections so I have time to do lots of other things. Also, considering that I pay $45 a month the ads are bloody annoying! I'm clearly paying you more for my eyeballs than the advertisers, so why are you showing their garbage to me? All that and now it crashes at least 1 time per article, sometimes 2!",
"Latest update a needless disaster. Some content reorganized seemingly for no other purpose than to make you learn the navigation button has moved from top to bottom or vice versa. Slower, buggyer, with not a single improvement over the last version, which was, itself, slow and buggy, but offered fairly straightforward look and route through the paper.",
"Content good. App very bad. No way to stop the app from refreshing after every action. So you stop reading an article and come back later, and it refreshes and sends you to the top of current news, which forces you to locate the article again and find where you left off. If I really care enough about the content, I go through a browser search and read the article outside the app. Pop up ads frequently displace content making it impossible to read. Wirecutter log on simply does not work in app.",
"App crashes constantly when reading articles, even right after clearing the cache (I'm using an updated Pixel 3, and have zero other issues on this phone). Often, you can't finish an article without it crashing multiple times, forcing you to re-find your article and your place in it each time. I don't know if this is caused by certain ads loading (it doesn't happen in every article, just most of them, and with a certain time delay), but the app is practically unusable as is.",
"Love getting alerts in my notifications. But tap any notification, even a brand new one, and it just opens the app to the ""top news"" page - which never seems to have the matching story. There's no search function. The only way to read the story is to remember the headline, type it into my browser, and ask Google to find it for me. All but useless, even though I love the NYT.",
"App bad, news good: I've had this app for many years and in the past couple months something has changed. The main page no longer refreshes on its own, articles sometimes just won't load, the comments section sometimes won't load, the main page sometimes freezes and I have to close and restart. It's annoying because the journalism is otherwise good!",
"It drives me NUTS that if my phone goes from portrait to landscape mode and then back to portrait mode, I LOSE MY SPOT IN THE ARTICLE!! This is insanely frustrating when reading a long article. There is no option in the app to lock to portrait mode so I may not renew at the end of my trial subscription, despite the wealth of fantastic content. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn't for that one INCREDIBLY irritating bug.",
"App is bogged down by feeds that make it difficult to reach full stories. You can't even reach today's edition of the paper through the app (customer support just directs you to go to the website on a browser, which defeats the purpose of having an app). They also removed side-swiping to get to the next article. Designed to be flashy and buzzy at the expense of just being able to just read the paper.",
"Doesn't work anymore. Sometime around late October this app basically stopped working for me. It loads slowly, always freezes, articles do not open. It has become useless to me. I'm none too happy about it either, as I used to read it all day, whenever I needed a break. I use the inferior mobile site now. I run one version behind the current version of Android. Pixel 2XL. Tried deleting the app, and sending feedback to the devs. My phone has several free GB available. Please fix the app!",
"The review is for the app experience. I enjoy the content, but there are so many issues with the app. The notifications don't match the content when you click on them. It just brings you to ""live news"", when my intent of clicking on the notification is to read about that exact article and not generally all updates about that storyline. Another huge miss is not having an easy option to search for content or authors. Needs major updates.",
"I used to love this app, but it seems really clunky all of a sudden. First my morning news briefing notifications stopped. Then all of a sudden, they came back. Except every morning, the notification is for the December 3rd briefing. I turned off the notification and turned it back on - nothing. Other notifications don't seem all that useful or even timely. I have often seen a news item before the notification shows on my phone.",
"All of your clever, artsy designs have made finding and reading the news almost unbearable. After clicking multiple 'headlines' hoping for the actual linear story, I'm stuck in hard to navigate, cutesy designs with captions flying over artwork and more links. Everything but the story in full form. It was a great story on Russia, but abandoned it because it continually kept flying back to the top of the story. Great journalism, overly engineered, unecessary design elements.",
"Generally great for knowing the news. If you aren's subscribed, it's still nice to let it update you with current important headlines. The big thing I don't like is how this app handles push notifications. If you press one, there's a good chance it won't actually take you to the article. Sometimes, you'll Instead be taken to the last article you read. It's then an annoying process to go back and find the article because the notification is gone and the article wasn't added to your recents.",
"Great app, great news. One bug that I've been seeing for a while: if there is more than one push notification from NYT, the text is repeated for each notification after I pull down to see the whole text. For example, if I have three push alerts from you, the preview of the text in each push is correct. If I pull the preview down to read the rest, the full text is replaced by one of the other push alerts. Hard to explain. Would be happy to send screenshots of what I mean.",
"News is fine but the app is awful. Reloads the cache while you're reading headlines. Oh did you wanna read that article? Now is moved, go find it. Also the ad positions ruin the legibility of certain articles. Yes, even if it's small, I don't want ads to track me throughout my reading. Also, why does side swiping, a motion that in any other reading app SENDS YOU TO THE NEXT PAGE, just put you in a new article? It's not intuitive and very annoying. Also I resent your native advertising.",
"The Android version of the app has many glitches, including the inability of some stories to load properly or at all. The text jumps around, which is frustrating to say the least. Please focus on making the Android version more stable. It is now almost four years since I wrote the original review and I thought it was time to try it again. I downloaded the app again about two weeks ago, and it still suffers from the same problems I experienced earlier, so today I uninstalled it once more.",
"dreadful. cumbersome and finicky. can't return to the same place when you click away to read an article, always returns to the top article. horizontal scroll is super sensitive and difficult to stop on the article you want. articles with fancy effects and graphics are not worth it, they are either unreadable or crash. simpler is better, NYT.",
"I've been using this app daily for almost 5 years while living in Manhattan and Queens and recently (the past 5-6 months) the app has gotten to be so unusable while riding the subway (and having spotty data connections) that it is not worth using unless my phone is in airplane mode and that means my Bluetooth gets interrupted. This needs to be fixed. What's the point of this app if you cannot read the news. What's the point of syncing the front page of stories if you're going to ignore the cache when you actually click on one. My workflow usually goes like this: board the train, pull out my phone, tap the daily brief notification, sit there forever while staring at a white screen until your network request that you shouldn't be making times out and the article finally loads from your cache (because it's actually available offline!). Please, for my sanity, load stories from the cache first and then update them in the background later. A former engineer of yours built a whole framework for fetching content from the internet with a layered local caching system, I recommend revisiting his approach.",
"The most frustrating app I have. I pay a NYT subscription. Stories show up in my notifications, but when I choose one, it just takes me to the default app home, not to the story I chose. Worse, I can't even search for the headline - there's no search option. So I scroll through every story - sometimes I find what I originally tapped on, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I forget what I was originally looking for. Its such a simple thing - PLEASE fix this. Take me directly to the story I tap on!",
"I should have read the reviews before I updated, which I did because certain sections weren't loading well. But the new format is horrible! The top scroll bar that had been customized to my interests is gone. I'm not sure why, since I could easily find other sections in the pull out on the left if I wanted to read them. Now, all the sections are accessed from a button on the bottom right and all jumbled together. For example, I never read sports, but have to scroll past it to get topics I want.",
"I have been a paying subscriber to The Times for over a decade but am seriously considering canceling my subscription because The Times is essentially unuseable on a cell phone or tablet. This was once a useable app. It is now more trouble than it is worth. It stops every minute or so, is slow to load and generally unstale. I repeatedly get errors from my Android phone that this app is slowing down my phone and I should allow the phone to put it to sleep to extend battery life.",
Update 7/8/20 - the app can't sustain itself for even 5 minutes. Can't even read 1 article before it stops working. Cancelling the subscription. _---------_ On a pixel and the app has started crashing very frequently. It occurs when I've been in the app for more than a few minutes. Might be because the auto refresh of news and scrolling can't be handled by the app.,
"The bar on the right that shows the position of the page relative to the length of the article is too lightly colored. It's invisible against the standard background and can only be seen when scrolling past something darker like a photo. This is not an issue when using a browser on the same phone. I've pointed this out via email, yet despite numerous updates no one cares to get these basics right.",
"A NYT digital subscription comes with good, clean presentation, high factual reporting, and occasional quality multimedia articles (of particular note was a 2019 article featuring maps and audio of those suffering in border crossings) that add up to a decent way to stay informed on US & world events. However, the paper does carry a substantial neoliberal bias, particularly in its op-eds, which I tend to avoid.",
"Great content, poorly executed software. The app suffers from recurring problems that the developers seem incapable of fixing - e.g., it doesn't display all of the text of some articles, and it crashes sometimes when refreshing. Plus new issues seem to crop up all the time... Yesterday, for instance, the swipe left/right feature to change sections stopped working. I wish there were a better way of reading NYT on a phone!",
"This app has (finally) become a decent, mature, functional app. The addition of a ""night mode"" or dark theme (as the rest of the world calls it) , even if only as an experimental Beta-feature, clinches it. It now functions very well indeed. And for the record, ALL ads are intrusive: 100% of them ', everywhere, all the time. (but let's work on keeping links live/updated)",
"Decent for reading the news. However notifications are inconsistent - I don't get the notification for The Morning every day, and if I have multiple notifications for different articles it will often click through to the wrong one. Also I want to have a permanent link to the Morning Briefing somewhere because I don't always get to it in the morning.",
"NYT, how many times do I need to say ""no, I don't want to read in the app""? I get my news from a variety of sources. Each one wants me to use their app. But NYT is the only one forcing me to cancel an intrusive popup with each article I look at. Is it really so hard to accept that a reader might prefer to use a single browser that they're comfortable with rather than a grab bag of conflicting apps bloating their phone's memory?",
"Reviewing this app to complain because I can't find anywhere else to say this. That the app automatically returns to the top of the page each time you return from a story is infinitely frustrating. Please go back to returning me to the place I left. As for the content, I have always appreciated what the NY Times offers and don't foresee ever not having a subscription. But please, please improve the functionally of the app!",
"I'm a paying NYT subscriber, and have been for years. Recently, they decided to insert a pop-up ad for this app on top of every single article on the NYT mobile web site, claiming ""the app is better."" Friends, the app is not better. The way I read the news is that I open a bunch of stories in separate tabs, and read them when I'm ready. The app only supports having one article open at a time. For me, the ONLY advantage that the app has over mobile web is that it doesn't harass me to use the app.",
"It's the Times, but the app let's it down The app isn't very stable: through multiple versions, articles fail to load and crashes are fairly common. Moreover, even though I pay for a digital subscription, the ads are becoming more and more intrusive, not to mention data hungry. All in all, a surprisingly weak effort from one of the world's great news organizations.",
In the last week the performance of this app has taken a nosedive. It either takes forever for article to load on my Samsung S8 or it only loads partially. There's nothing more frustrating than getting 3/4 through an article and have it suddenly cut off. I have tried updating my OS and reinstalling the app but nothing has helped. I will be canceling my subscription if this issue is not resolved soon.,
"Have been a user of this app for years...since before the pay wall. Several months ago, the app was changed and the malfunctions have increased. At this point, the menu dropdown is gone, I can't read opinion comments, and I can no longer swipe left to move to the next article. I am considering dropping my subscription since I read the NYT on my phone 99% of the time. FIX THE ISSUES...ROLL BACK TO AN OLDER VERSION OF THE APP!!",
"NOT A RATING OF CONTENT BUT RATHER APP They send notifications all the time, which I actually like. The problem is, their notifications DON'T TAKE YOU TO THE ARTICLE THEY ARE NOTIFYING YOU ABOUT. It is so extremely frustrating that it sends you to the home page of the app or a completely different article that has nothing to do with the notification they sent. The app as a whole is pretty intuitive except when it comes to locating Wirecutter. It is impossible.",
"I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
"I'd like to second the frustrations of the users posting the more recent reviews. This app has become very unreliable. I can no longer read most of the articles I've saved for later reading on my Android Tablet. I click on the article, and I get.....a blank page! However, on at least one article, I was able to get the comments to display. This blank article problem has happened on a good many articles recently. This was a good app to use once upon a time, but no more. By the way, NY Times......my Washington Post app works just fine.",
"The content of the NY Times is good but this app is poor. There are too many advertisements which consume too much mobile data. There are many bugs: sometimes I cannot scroll in an article, even on a good interrent connection images often fail to load, articles which appear on Google News cannot be found in the app, article links fail to load due to errors for no reason, etc. This app probably needs a complete rewrite.",
"My previous review described frustration with the cancellation of the Android widget. I have now uninstalled this app, because it is so much harder to use than NYT thru the browser. The app tries to control everything, funnels sharing through specific channels, and makes it difficult to share to a Facebook page. When I try to back up during sharing, or from anywhere, I am returned to the NYT homepage rather than the article I was just looking at. It's a navigation nightmare. We deserve better.",
"The app is constantly freezing. Often times when I click on an article, it just shows a blank page. In the cases when an article shows up, I'm rarely able to read the full article, as it'll freeze at some point while I'm scrolling. When it finally unfreezes, the rest of the article is blank. I pay for the content and I can't reach the content right now.",
"I can't open the app. I liked it when it was working. I haven't clicked for a while, but today when the News email came in, I clicked on a headline, and I got an error that says the ""App keeps closing."" I came here to see if there were updates, but there aren't. I'm a paid subscriber and I can't read articles from my Note 10 phone because emails open in the app and the app crashes after < 0.5 seconds. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I'm happy to update this review when this issue is fixed.",
"The new update has a big problem. If you scroll down a section, choose an article to read; when done go back to the scroll, it automatically jumps to the top of the page. It is frustrating, as if it were a print paper, you show an article to someone but before they hand it back they neatly fold it up, restack all the sections in order then hand it back to you. Why can't I just keep my place in the scroll!",
"Content is great! A combination of great reporting and fantastic multimedia delivery, with some extremely well done interactive graphs and visuals. 1 star off because links are often buggy. For example, links in older notifications often go to different, newer articles. Also, for about a week everytime I clicked the notification for the morning report it went to a morning report from the a week ago.",
"App was exceptional for the last couple years on my Pixel 2, content still is. The updated interface change that rolled out in Nov 2019 has slowed content loading to a crawl and I'm now considering canceling my subscription if it isn't resolved since my phone is where I access the news. Error notification helpful, but no follow-up and haven't heard about efforts to resolve. I have storage space, have cleared the cache, and am on fast internet connections.",
"Love the nyt, but terrible app. Shows the same headlines over and over, so I'm missing tons of content. And like everyone else is complaining about, the notifications don't always lead you to the article, and then it can be impossible to find it. So frustrating! I can't believe they haven't fixed these problems by now. I'm still a subscriber but I actually used another news app to scan the nyt headlines and access articles now.",
"This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like ""Download print issue"" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
"When the app gives you a notification on a news story and you click it, 9/10 times the app takes you to the main page. Effectively the notifications are useless. It's been this way for years. Even within the app itself, a main headline is not always a link to a story. It's rotten, poorly developed, and infuriating. Also no matter your political outlook, the NyTimes is increasingly ideology driven and fact averse.",
"The quality and integrity of reporting cannot be questioned. Jon Pareles on music is terrific. What must be questioned is the app's functionality. 99% of the notifications, when opened, take the user to the page where all the election-related headlines exist, regardless of actual topic. For a newspaper that dedicates so much and so many to digital, the Android app ought not to play second fiddle. NYT, please have your IT see what's going on. Thank you.",
"Notifications are broken. A preview for one story will show up in your notification, when you tap it to expand and see the whole headline, often it will change to a completely different headline. And if it doesn't do that and you tap it to open the story in the app, most of the time it will still take you to a completely different story, or the home screen of the app, in which case the story you wanted to read is often unfindable. Never been so frustrated by a news app. Get your s*** together!!!",
"I would rate this app much higher, but the notifications are useless. The App itself has a great layout, and is quick and responsive. However, if you click on a notification it will not send you to the story you received the notification for! It'll send you to the homepage. Really wonky and should be fixed.",
"Good, but could be better. If there was an option to have at silent notifications like the CNN app, I would like it better. I had to turn off all notifications because it was was going on at all hours of the night and morning. I use sleep podcasts at night so ""Do not disturb"" is not an option. I DO like the the reporting at NYTimes, but not enough to sacrifice sleep.",
"Terrible app! I have to dig for a search box. If I respond to an alert, I may see the newest stories, NOT the story I clicked. If I click an ad, then go back, I'm back at the home page, not the story I was reading. The lesson is: never, never click an ad!! Also, never accidentally hit the back button before you finish an article because a) there's no ""forward"" button, and b) you might never find your story again, even if you enter search terms YOU JUST READ IN THE ARTICLE. Gaaaah!",
This app doesn't really work well. It gives me article notifications. 9/10 times I click the notification and it dumps me on the main page instead of the article. I signed up for morning briefing notification and it doesn't show up. I don't want to have to dig through the main page to find it. The app itself looks great I just wish it worked better.,
"Great organization, but the notifications do not link to the referenced article. In fact, many of the notification topics can't even be found via search in the app (perhaps too soon to be indexed?). Please do what others do, like wapo, and provide a section of recently received notifications in the app. 6 month update: This is still not addressed. I left feedback in the app and they told me they were working on it months ago, yet still no progress.",
"Like many of the reviewers here, I also renewed my subscription through GooglePlay only to have the app refuse to recognize it. Contacted NYTimes customer support (which is also not great), didn't get a fix. Eventually they seemed to figure it out as I got access to all content back, but it took over a month. On the plus side, I learned that the Wall Street Journal is a less biased paper with a better app.",
"The app works well, and the notifications are generally non-intrusive and can be turned off. User experience is overall high quality; however, the lack of dark mode is an irredeemable issue. I'm keeping the app and subscription despite the lack of dark mode, but my retinas burn and suffer the consequences in the meantime. Also worth mentioning that your base subscription probably won't include the famous crossword, nor the other game offerings. Update: Dark mode is now here! I can see again!",
The most frustrating thing about this app are the alerts. Clicking one opens the associated article maybe 30% or the time even when being on WiFi 24/7. Or maybe it opens a page on a similar topic but you can't find the subject you click on without scrolling like a detective. Once you've clicked the alert it's gone so you have to rely upon your memory of what the title was and search is hard to use.,
"App constantly refreshes the screen, changing layout, image size, etc. Makes it impossible to view a report or to scroll through the page. If you see some article to read, you must instantly click on it or it disappears in the refresh shuffle, then you search, then it reappears if you are lucky in a different place, differet size, then whoosh, gone again. Rinse and repeat until frustration leads me to the website.",
"After having been a digital subscriber for a while, I've become disappointed by the algo-driven article selection and presentation. The top news feels is more akin to click bait than serious journalism. I much prefer the editorial control of the print edition but it's not available in the app. I've decided to discontinue the subscription and switch to the Washington Post.",
"Lots of breaking news articles pile up in my notifications. That's fine I guess, seeing as we're living in the end times, and it is happening in many terrible and newsworthy steps. But, when I click on one, I'd like to read THAT ONE. Instead it's a crapshoot what article will actually open up. It's only the correct one 10%-20% of the time. It seems often that it'll just go to whichever the most recent was. I'm paying money for this service. Fix it!",
"I'm a loyal Times reader and I understand the need to generate revenue, but the full-screen, full-color, video ads, often repeated three or four times in the same article, are wearing me out. The New York Times isn't Facebook. As a paid subscriber, I shouldn't have to be first a marketing target and only second a news consumer. Don't assume my loyalty to the Times has no limit. (Lowered my rating after a recent article included six large, color fashion ads. Next step is back to the website.)",
I have no problem with the layout or navigation. My problem is that the app uses up an incredible amount of battery on my tablet (Android) and even causes the tablet to keep restarting when the battery gets below 30%. It's the only app that does that. Have written to the NYT/android support but their only suggestion was to reinstall which didn't change anything. Very frustrating.,
"NY Times is essential. The news gets five stars. The app is flashy, but fails. The app needs qc and work. Fancy enough, but I find the app annoying, as if someone from NY Times didn't want me to read it. In particular, when I try to click on a particular article in the email message, I rarely get that article, I get something else.",
"Still almost a year and no fix. Thi is a rating of the app itself and not the publisher or content. I get a ton of notifications of articles. I don't mind, that's part of why I have the app and pay for a subscription. But when I click the notification, I expect to be taken directly to the article. Instead, the app just opens. If there were a search function I could take the extra step to search for the article. My final grievance is that my phone doesn't recognize the app as medium for NYT links",
"I've had this app from the beginning, but I like it less and have used it less for about a year now. A main reason is that it loads slow and is generally awkward for me, compared say to Google News. Just now, it also started playing audio of a press conference or recording when I opened a text story. I always hate automated video and sound -- I can open that if I want, just let me quietly read the story I asked for without unwanted sound I can’t immediately stop or worrying about slow wifi etc. Just do what I want, not what you want me to do.",
"Skip this app!!! I love the Times, but this is the worst app. I get notified of articles I want to read click the push the notification link and it sends me to the home page instead. If I finally find and try to open the article then the app tells me I am offline. I have to actually open the article in a browser if I want to read it. It's often not worth the bother. This app can't handle anything less than a 4G connection. It also offers no way to expand images or text for the vision impaired.",
"Its the NYTimes, so phenomal journalism and worth the download. That said, it's just an OK app, could use improvements in navigation (ability to read thru the paper and navigate like a traditional paper) and search (finding additional articles is tough at times, you only get what the algorithm thinks you want!). And finally...when can we have a dark mode!",
"NYTimes provides good news and opinions coverage. However they are not able to get a good handle on their app. The app has a lot of annoying bugs and doesn't work as intended half the time example, clicking on a notification does not load the intended article, lag in getting notifications, missing notifications to list a few.",
"The app loses track of where you are when scrolling through the headlines. If you open an article and then flip back to headlines it brings you right to the top, or goes blank and loads from a different place. In general it will frequently and randomly reload (probably the advertisements), go blank and skip around - up and down through the headlines.",
"Freezes up and then I get a pop-up asking if I want to wait or close the app. Sometimes it just crashes. No longer scrolls smoothly. Android 11, Pixel 3. I cleared the cache and rebooted my phone hoping for improvement. Didn't happen. This has been happening for about a month now. This app used to not be like this at all.",
"The ads are inconvenient: I am a paying subscriber and I don't want creepy ads. Today the video ad turned itself on without my tapping it, and turned off the music I was listening to in the background. The search function is terrible. Sometimes I cannot find a recent article to reread, even if I search with a key phrase I remember from the title.",
"Update Nov. 2019: This app continues to strongly disappoint. Video ads that autoplay (and, despite being silenced, automatically pause any music you're playing in another app) are just rude in a paid subscription, and they seem to be getting more frequent. Notifications are still unusable, and the most recent update makes it so even clicking on articles within the app sometimes doesn't work. This app clearly requires a total rewrite from the ground up. I'm likely to unsubscribe at this point.",
"Like others here, I am very disappointed that the widget I used to employ to put news headlines on my home screen seems to have disappeared in the latest version of the NYTimes app. Was this intentional? It appears that it was, as we are now encouraged to obtain our headlines as alerts instead. I don't want more alerts; I get too many damned alerts on my phone as it is. I want my widget back. Maybe this was just a mistake or some kind of bug. If so, please give some priority to fixing it.",
"What happened to the section scroll on top? This new version is so frustrating to navigate. I don't need an entire front page showing only one top story, and giving only 3 navigation buttons. Then, the Section button opens another drop-down list of sections. Put the sections back on top. It should be like the actual paper...allowing me to flip through section headlines quickly to see what I want to read.",
"Appreciate the content, but the performance of this app makes it almost unusable. Very high latency for any kind of UI interaction. Incremental rendering results in items moving around the screen for seconds after a refresh or article load. This leads to unintentional clicks. Even just moving back to a previous page takes seconds. Accessing sections is a two click flow, each click taking seconds to render. Appreciate new formats, but near-unusable at this performance.",
"Second rate app, horrible customer service. If you enter the app from one of their emails, there is no way to access a list of other adds. The app says you can download the articles but when offline, there is no access of all the stories. When calling customer service, all you hit is a brick wall. They could care less about receiving any feedback. I suggest getting news from elsewhere.",
"*update* I ended up uninstalling the app, and using APKMirror to download and reinstall version 8.0, which still has the widget and appears works fine. Newer is not necessarily better. Still no indication if/when widget will be back. ------- I've been using this app for years, and rely on the full screen widget to browse headlines. In the latest version, the widget suddenly disappeared. It's forced me to switch to WaPo for my news fix more often. Annoying.",
"I miss swiping from one article to the next, and I hate the front page constantly reloading. Especially since I have to go to it so many times now since you took away the ability to swipe through articles... Updating to say I finally cancelled my subscription after 6 years. I love the reporting but I hate the app. Specifically, I cannot stand the total refresh/send to top of the front page after reading every article.",
"It's a clean interface if you actually get to the right article. Whether from a push notification or clicking on a story from the front page, easily 3 out of 4 times it takes you to the wrong article, or just dumps you back on the front page. This problem seems to be in the last week or so. So whatever you updated, change it back!",
"The lead section of this app (top stories) seems to be updated only once per day, in the late afternoon. It is as current as yesterday's newspaper. It should either be dropped or kept current. The web version of the NYT, although dependent on a browser, is much better. Now the BBC app works as well as the NYT app, and is more useful even for US news. Disappointing.",
Can't use it at all because of the lack of a dark mode. Why would I even consider subscribing when I can't use the easiest way to view your content?! There's not even a way to force it into dark mode as I can with every other news app. My eyes burn after about a minutes worth of using it. Perhaps you should get with the times and provide a feature EVERYONE wants. Especially considering the unnecessary amount battery life drained by ensuring every pixel in my screen is on retina searing mode.,
"Last Update Broke Spelling Bee on Android. I used to be able to play the same puzzle on two different devices. Now, each device seems to be independent. Also, my results from the prior day aren't listed correctly. I don't see the entire set of words with checkmarks next to the words I used. Instead, all I see are the words that I used.",
"Yes, it works. However the layout is pretty chaotic. I don't see a real way the difference tabs help the layout either. There's no ""recently read function,"" or if there is I can't find it. And most importantly, there's no dark mode, which is crazy for an app all about reading. You would really think that would be top priority.",
"NY Times is a great paper and I planned to keep my subscription forever, but the most recent app update makes the app impossible to use in night mode, and there isn't a setting I can find to turn off night mode. The result is that I have turn the general brightness of my phone waaaay up to make the dark grey text stand out against the black background. This makes pictures, ads, and my navigation bar too bright to be able to look at the screen in low light conditions.",
I separate content from application. NYT content is great for me. The recent version of the app on my Samsung Android does not work well affecting access to content. An app has to work. I give the app 0 stars and will probably cancel my digital subscription. update: after a week working with customer service the answer is the problem is on my end. well...no. just cancelled my digital subscription. not easy to fo by the way.,
"Like many reviews here, article and image loading have serious, consistent problems. I think it's related to Google Play - tracking wake up path links, which I turn off on my rooted device. But I haven't experienced this level of consistent app failure as I've had over the past many months. Note to the developers; Stop focusing on tracking our data and instead focus on making a functional app.",
"This is a beautiful app, seriously. I don't know any other news app this beautiful. I love how opening it is like opening a newspaper to the front page, and how each section is along the top, and I love the font for the articles. The dark mode works perfectly for me so I can read without using much phone battery. There are kinks once in a while, and a quick email to the app team always gets a pleasant reply. Keep up the great work!",
"The latest updates make the app frustrating to use. As other users have noted, the app will scroll to the top of a section after exiting an article, meaning I have to repeatedly scroll back down to find my place if I want to read multiple articles in a section. The new lateral scrolling feature is difficult to use, and often leaves me struggling to scroll from one article to the next without skipping two articles at once or accidentally clicking on the wrong article. Please fix these issues!!",
"Top Stories don't load. Wrote to support and they said do a force stop, which works. But who wants to do that everytime they open an app? Out of the 56 apps I have on my phone this is the one that works the worst. Ironically, it's the one I pay the most for (via a digital NYT subscription). I'm giving it another week or two and then will cancel my subscription if no fix is released.",
"This app seriously sucks. Idk how you update an app and make it worse, but you did! I haven't been able to use the app in over a month. It keeps saying my device is offline, when it clearly isn't. I've tried force stopping, restarting my phone, and nothing works. What's worse is I still get notifications, but those got screwed up the last time I updated. Clicking any headline notification just links to the homepage, not the article I wanted. So, I've got a useless app now. Y'all need to fix it.",
"I agree with all of the other users who have been having recent issues with the app freezing, failing to load articles completely, or simply being unable reach any articles beyond the blurb on the front page. I loved this app for years, but it's a mess right now. Please fix it. Thanks. (Motorola Android user)",
"Very difficult to navigate after recent update. They used to have all sections at the top and easy to jump one to another, now they're hidden on another page all together and it's not intuitive. This update has made me use the app much less. The notifications are always a mess - getting duplicate notifications and not having them link to the correct article. I'll probably be discontinuing my subscription since this app was the main way I access the Times and this app has pretty much ruined it.",
"I really don't need to say anything, others have said it for me. Night mode gone and terrible navigation. Excellent content but for the time being I'll be using my computer and monitor to read the Times and avoiding this app until it is improved. This is a sorry state of affairs for such a great newspaper. P. S. Just downloaded the latest version today, still no dark mode.",
"I updated, naively thinking that the new overhaul would fix the ad-loading article freezing issue, and hoping that the ridiculous ""For You"" tab would be removed or made optional. Instead, the new app is an almost unusable disaster. What were these developers thinking??? Fortunately, I was able to revert to the previous version. Others aren't as lucky.",
"It drains your battery insanely. It's a news app, it shouldn't drain this much battery. Other than that it's okay. The app is mostly smooth but it does have stutter here and there. The dark mode feature is nice but it doesn't work consistently on all of the articles. Overall, for paid app that does something as simple as presenting text to read, this app is pretty mediocre",
"NYT used to be better than this. For quite a while now, the headline notifications that I press has been taking me to a complete different article on the app. I used to really enjoy the wide variety of reporting that was offered by NYT for decades but more and more I feel I am being steered to read articles curated by the editors. IF this is a bug in the app you need to fix it. Especially in times like these you need to be diligent in serving your readers without discrimination.",
"The newest version of the app took away all the navigation. There used to be a sidebar on the left you could swipe to get to different sections of the paper. That is no longer there. Now if you want to navigate you have to go back several pages to get to the front page to go to different sections or stories. The content, of course, is as good as ever but this app version is a waste of time.",
"Really buggy, not sure what the UX team and SWEs have been doing the past year with the other updates. Bugs: 1. Opening an article from the notification bar on android -> error of app unable to find article, takes me to the search bar. Not worth the time trying to recall and enter the article title to search for it and read it. 2. Opening the app via internet -> if I see an article linked in another website and click it, and then the default selection is to open the article in this app directly, same error of cannot find article, redirects me to search bar.",
"I want to love the app but there's two things ruining it. The first is way too many articles pushed as breaking news. More than any other news outlet. When everything is pushed as breaking to get app clicks, nothing seems to be breaking. It's the app who cried wolf. Second is that web based reading looks better than the app but we're pushed to use the app for browsing. Won't work.",
"I will regularly tap a headline notification only to be brought to one of the other headlines i had a notification for. Extremely, extremely annoying, especially when I'm saving articles for when i have a chance to read them and, when i finally have one, i might as well just write down the articles i ACTUALLY want to read interested of even trying to tap the notifications for them. In print form, if it says ""turn to page so-and-so"" for an article, I expect to find it when i go to that page.",
"I'm quitting solely because of the app and the customer service. I find myself redirected to a sign in page for every separate submenu in the settings. The last straw was when I looked into adding a subscription to the crossword puzzle. I got to a page that described the price and the cancellation process, which it said could only happen by contacting customer service. I'm not interested in that pain in the balls, so I back out without submitting. Then I get an email that I've subscribed to it!",
"App is very slow to load, with too many animations. It freezes frequently, crashing out to home page. Although I'm a paying subscriber I cannot post in the article comments. Despite NYT techs reassurance, reinstalling does nothing to solve these bugs. If the subscription cost more than $4 monthly I'd cancel, as that's all it's worth.",
"The quality of the app says nothing about the content and excellent reporting from the Times. Rather, this review is about the app only. Certain quirks in app are becoming more and more annoying. Things like refresh or ""Load more post"" buttons that won't go away, blocking the middle of an article. Switching apps and coming back can mean losing your place entirely. Swiping back results in a weird, no-man's-land interstitial. Things that just make very little sense and messes with reading.",
"Bizzare, frustrating bugs that make me want to smash my phone. When i try to expand the push notifications to read the full sentence, the notification changes to a completely differently story. And when i try to open an article from the notifications bar, it often doesnt load or takes me to the main page. Makes me use the app a whole lot less and im thisclose from unsubscribing.",
"The articles are as you'd expect but the app is deficient. Everybtime you switch from portrait to landscape or vice versa, the article refreshes and starts back at the top of the article. very frustrating particularly if youre reading a long article and have to find your olace over and over again.",
"badly implemented app. graphics often don't fit on mobile screens and are just cut off. some visualizations don't work and are just frustrating black squares. turning landscape to horizontal results in full page rerender for some reason, wasting time and loosing your place. slow in general. unwanted video and video ads in many places is frustrating for a paid subscription...",
"Too expensive. I can't claim to understand the economics of running a major news organization, but I do know that $15-25 per month is simply too much in today's digital media landscape. There are many far cheaper options for nearly the same content. While I love and appreciate the work the NY Times does and would like to support them financially, there needs to be a cheaper option. There is not a digital edition of any news media that I would pay this much for month over month. I simply don't see the value, especially as even with a paid subscription to the Times there are several other cheaper or free reliable sources of news that I would still follow, limiting the time I have to take advantage of this one.",
"Love the content but notifications are almost useless. Sometimes the notifications are blank, sometimes when I choose an article from a notofcation it takes me to the last article I read and not the one mentioned in the notification. Sometimes I will get the same article notification multiple times. They are more frustrating than useful at this point.",
"Paid subscriber here. Really irritated with a common problem that I have been having. The app will send a push notification to my phone with an article and when I click on it, it takes me to the app, maybe a front page of sorts, but not the article from the push notification. Really takes away from the app experience.",
"The app works for me, mostly.  But it eats up an inordinate amount of battery, sometimes to the point of draining it completely.  I'd decided to give up the NYT and was searching for another source of news, when I discovered that google news will happily serve up the articles that I've subscribed to, using a fraction of the power.",
"Terrible headline notification system. When I press a headline notification, it only very rarely takes me to the referenced article. This might be because the headlines are breaking and have no article, but the app doesn't distinguish between the two types of headlines which result in the user wasting time expecting to load into a full article and then not.",
"I wish there was a feature where one could view the layout of the daily print edition, similar to the WAPO app (instigator😉). I like seeing the way stories are prioritized, and seeing ""today's news"" and am sometimes frustrated when I realize I've clicked on something that was posted 36 hours ago, but is still presented like latest news, even if it is good writing and relevant information. I just like seeing something that resembles a traditional in the morning.",
"A for content, D- for functionality I can't follow up on each notification I u send, so it may be several hours B4 I lights out on a notification about an article that interests me. It's almost always long gone. I mentioned this at least a year ago and you responded, ""We're working on it."" How long does it take to apply a link? it's very frustrating. I can't find the news I want on your app. it's like, ""bait and switch!"" maybe time for me to switch subscription to Reuters or HuffingtonPos.",
"The new version of the app often fails to load articles, and is missing a scroll bar, making the article length a secret. I need the scroll bar to manage my time while reading. Now the only way to see how long an article is is to scroll to the bottom -- conveniently forcing me to see all the ads. This feels like a cynical attempt to increase ad clicks, and is insulting for a paid subscription. I really hope this is not the future of journalism.",
"Crossword has no way to access the title (which is often an important clue, esp. in harder one). Spelling be only reloads the new day if you close the app from the multitasking screen and restart. Though the design is clean, the incompleteness makes it a a poor replacement for the site. A bummer because I'd much prefer to use the app.",
"When the application works, its pretty good. Unfortunatly that isnt most of the time. The app constantly freezes when scrolling, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes requiring me to kill the app. Articles stop displaying mid way through, displaying an empty screen for the rest of the article. Reloading the article has no efffect. Restarting the application only works sometimes. The frustration is maddening - made even worse by the fsct that I am paying for this content. Please fix this mess!",
"The New York Times produces fantastic content, i just wish that i could use an app that let me read it! The ads onn this app cause crashes do often these days that I typically need to close and restart this app at least twice before I can scroll through an article. The reason I'm here, leaving a review is because the app just crashed on be so many times that i can't get through the article at all!",
"Pros: ~The ""Real-Rime"" update coverage is impressive, the reference links @ the end of each article and links to past articles about the story, or similar stories, is fascinating (if an invitation to life hours of time reading!) and the archives are vast and wide-ranging. Choice of font size and the quality of photos is well above average. And very affordable. Cons~Loading time can seem interminable, the alert system does NOT provide a direct link to the ""breaking news"" 3/4s of the time.",
"I've been reading the Times as long as i can remember.. The app is soo frustrating though. I'll get notifications for articles that sound incredibly interesting. Nine times out of ten, I'll tap the notification and be led to a completely different article. This is my only issue with the app. But in my opinion it is a serious flaw.",
"Searching for articles is difficult on this app. I have better luck searching Google. I don't like the changes they've made with all the updates on one page. Once they changed that it seems difficult to share the articles or at least there are extra steps. Also, when I click on notifications it takes me to the wrong article.",
"Good content but glitchy app. Clicking on a notification for a specific article always fails to load the article (and the entire front page). I have to be exit and reenter the app and find whatever article I wanted manually. Also, pages will spontaneously reload and take me to the top of the page, making me have to find my place again. This will happen at least twice for each article I read",
"Doesn't work on mobile data. Must be connected to WiFi or I just get a blank white screen with a banner across the bottom that I am offline and the app is unable to update stories. Have worked with app support for weeks with no success. They just suggest uninstalling and reinstalling, and even suggested I ""upgrade"" to a version of the app that was a version prior to my current version. I usually just use my browser instead.",
"Scrolling halts and jerks. It's unpleasant to read when the text jumps. I try to follow the text with my eyes as I scroll down to read but it will stop and jerk so badly I often can't track it. It's frustrating to have to search back through a paragraph to find the place I lost. This is a common problem in many apps, it seems like I'm expected to ignore it but I just can't get used to it.",
"Giant step backwards - In my older version, I was able to ""select - check"" sections of the NYT I had displayed across the top of my home page, much as what still appears on the NYT home page web version. I could ""check"" ~6 topics which would appear on my home screen app as ""quick select buttons. I could quickly go to that section and scan the stories I wished to delve into.The newer version has removed this feature and nadded topics to follow.  GIANT STEP BACKWARDS ! I get a mishmash. SLOW !!",
This review is not about NYT journalism. Only the app. There seems to have been a recent update where they implemented a automatically hiding menu bar at the bottom of the screen. This literally ruind the app. It is so incredibly sensitive that the text you are trying to read jumps all over the place if you dare try to scroll to a new section of the article. This is my first review of an app in my life but I just felt compelled to tell somebody that the app is almost completely unusable now.,
"The app's UI is very very bad. I've also been trying, unsuccessfully, to cancel my subscription for TWO DAYS. I have to contact my credit card company and tell them to block the next payment because there is literally no other way for me to stop the $15/mo from being deducted from my bank account. I would not recommend this app or subscribing to the NYT in general.",
"Mediocre app. Significantly worse than Washington Post. NYT should just swallow its pride and license WP software. Example: you get NYT notifications of breaking stories. You click on it to read the article, and it's not there. It shows you a related article from 12+ hours ago; it's not clear the new article has even been written yet, as it's nowhere to be found.",
"Updated review: Overall, I love the New York Times. Great reporting. I can tell that the Times takes great care to be unbiased in their reporting and clearly labels articles that are opinion. That being said, the app is buggy. As an example, I get notifications when a new article is published, but the notification reroutes me to the home page and not to the article itself. Then, the description in the notification won't always match the article title, so it's hard to find the original article.",
"An absolute disaster on Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. The app has always been exceptionally slow; other apps on the same device do not have this problem. The new ""improved"" interface being rolled out is absurd on my tablet. There are only 3 navigation options: Top Stories; a tab for chosing ""topics"" you want to follow; and then a tab listing all Sections of the publication. I can no longer select sections for direct navigation access. Useless!",
"Greatest U.S. newspaper going, BUT, if you plan to access on an Android device, even new tablets, FORGET IT. The app freezes, locks you out, dishes epic amounts of ads -- poorly formatted and that interfere with content. I tried for months to resolve via costomer service. NYT is excellent at responding to complaints, not so good at following up. Please read other negative reviews, you'll find there's a theme centered around the app. Again, best paper going - with an app that will drive you nuts.",
"The reporting is good, but the app is barely passable. Constantly refreshes when going back to the homepage, arbitrarily freezes on just about every article. It's obvious that they're using WebViews in the app, but clearly they need to improve their rendering performance or switch to a different data transfer /display format.",
"Reporting is good, but app sucks. In the notification bar, trying to expand a banner notification to get a expanded look at a headline will sometimes change the headline all together and show the expanded view of a headline from earlier in the day. It's very annoying when I don't have to read the whole article but still want to know what's going on. Either dont give me a snippet in the banner or fix this annoying bug. Also the app frequently loads stories in dark mode, making them hard to read.",
"*Update* ""It's getting worse. I resonate with everyone else. Besides the messed up night mode, why remove the feature to swipe between articles? This is 2019, I don't want to reach to the top of my phone to switch between tabs. Night mode works immediately and then ends up with white article cards the second time I open the app and onwards. They also make it unreasonably cumbersome to unsubscribe.",
The app crashes every few minutes and has become essentially useless. It now always returns to the top. It fails to keep my place. It's very annoying to need to navigate back every time I finish an article. This is really basic so bottom line you broke the ap. Time to fix it back to the way it was.,
"Nicely streamlined news app that gives a good rundown of news going on, but on my android phone it continually either crashes or exits my current article to a loading screen, and then the home page. Reading an article sometimes becomes a game of finding a reopening the article I was getting through... A great app that I wish it worked reliably on my phone!",
"A 5⭐ app has gone way downhill & become much more cumbersome and unhelpful. The benefit of digital reading is quickly accessing all the sections no matter where you were. That's been lost. So has swiping between stories. Constant page refreshes get in your way. The enjoyment of browsing or deep diving through links has been destroyed. I feel like I'm using a clunky 90s app. Was the UI changed to help advertisers because it's hurt subscribers. Please ""unfix"" & restore what worked so well.",
The app itself looks and feels very well constructed and natural. I have yet to select an article that hasn't loaded or been incomplete but it lacks even elementary features such as a search tool. If you cant add even the most simple of tools to allow your subscribers to find the articles they want to read then why have an app in the first place?,
I don't use it enough to even just justify having the app or paying for a subscription. But cancelling through the app was annoying. Not hard but annoying. It kept logging you out. The chat doesn't work. You don't have a keyboard to write. You can't see the texts. You have to call. That's just too much! That's absolutely pointless. How hard is it to make it a press of a button?,
"The newspaper is first rate but the software is buggy and doesn't automatically refresh like it is supposed to. Moreover, even if you set it to download all articles in the background, it won't. But possibly most annoying is the fact that they just removed the widget without even telling us. Bring it back!",
"Notifications of articles I'd like to read bring me to completely different articles on completely different topics, and it's a huge pain trying to find the ones literally named in the notification I click on. Poor user experience. No improvements in the time I've seen. Annoying to click on articles I ultimately have a huge pain finding to read.",
"The font in this app is too small for comfortable reading. There used to be a text size setting for the app, but it was recently taken away. I don't want to increase the text size of all my other apps - they're fine. It's only this app whose text is too small. This app needs a setting to adjust the font size.",
"Really like the Times content, so had put up with the increasingly intrusive ads. But after the latest update I can no longer see pictures once I click in past the headlines. Most significantly that means crosswords and puzzles do not work at all, aargh! Reinstalled, cleared cache, still doesn't work. NYT please fix this!",
"The news is good, but the app is hard to navigate and when you tap one of the apps constant notifications, it takes you to the top of the front page instead of to the article you were reading about. The front page overall is useless to navigate, and is impossible to use to find anything.",
"Free version is okay however after having for only a couple weeks, while clicking on notifications to read articles you are subject to a full-page subscription advertisement every single time you do so. Not normally a problem in most apps as they can be dismissed. Not so easy here. With this app the only way to dismiss the ad is to use the 'Back' button and once you do so, you lose the article you clicked the notification to read and are brought to the homepage and lose the article.",
"The past few updates (Late Dec/early Jan 2021) have made the app totally unusable. Navigation is a mess, the main news feed doesn't save your spot when exiting an article, ads don't load until mere seconds from scrolling by them (pushing content around as they appear), headline notifications don't bring you to the story you're notified about...I've had it. Switching to mobile web access until this disaster is fixed.",
"I used to love this app, have used it for years without issue however in the past few weeks it has become completely unusable For several weeks now, when I receive a news alert from the NYT, the received page is covered by an opaque black overlay that makes the articles text completely unreadable I've been waiting for you to fix what I had assumed was a temporary glitch, however if you do not do so soon, I will be sadly forced to cancel my subscription.",
"Paying this much for a subscription, I expect a dark mode at a minimum. Please get on the ball with a dark / night theme. WaPo has this figured out and it's a much better value (they even include crosswords in their subscription). Great journalism, but disappointing overall value. You're 5 minutes from cancellation. Update 12/28/21: Tapping notifications never takes me to the correct article. That, along with the key of dark mode makes me think the subscription is no longer worth it. Cancelled.",
"Super annoying that clicking a link in the app (for instance, an NY Times cooking recipe) forces me into my browser where they want me to log in again. What's the point of the app if you're just going to force me to log in again on Firefox! That's stupid. Also ridiculous that they still serve ads even if you're a paying subscriber.",
"The app is infuriating - deserves 0 stars. An ""update"" recently broke it so you couldn't swipe left/right to go between articles. Then, a few days later, it started working again (except in the ""Today"" section) on one tablet, but remained completely broken on another. I have it set to download articles in chosen sections twice a day, yet often it will hang for a loooong time before finally displaying an article in one of those sections. I'm about ready to cancel my subscription - they have made a not-so-good app into a truly crappy app.",
"Love NYT reporting and Opinion, but this app crashes constantly! Maybe especially in the morning? Freezes up, won't scroll, screen goes black. Tried adjusting all the settings. I do use a VPN and disable my location - as their editorial lage suggests we all do - so maybe this contributes to ads crashing the app? Don't know. Android user; this wasn't a problem on my old iPhone.",
"The billing system isn't very amendable, you have to be careful what date you start your subscription because you'll get constant emails telling you to update your payment info if the payment hits between deposits or you run low. And apparently they can't prorate or balance charge you to adjust the date. It sucks when it makes an overcharge. Or maybe🤔 I just need to budget better 😁",
"Updated 31JUL2020. Love the articles. Please fix the puzzles. 😭😭 Notifications do not work. Click on one and it takes you to a different article. Examine every article available, and the one they notified you about simply isn't available. None of the games with properly anymore. Vertex shuts down. Spelling Bee rockets off a string of letters you didn't even touch and has to be manually restarted. The crosswords don't refresh properly. The acrostic clues are truncated. Sad.",
"One of the most important new organizations in the U.S. today. Their widgets seem to have mysteriously vanished, which is a shame; I'm reduced to Google News and Flipboard to get headlines on my home screen. Nonetheless, I'd say the NYT is indispensable tool for being an informed American. They aren't perfect (and neither is their app) but they're pretty darn good.",
"The new bottom tabbed version of the app is terrible! I hate that all of the content is clumped together now. I miss the pivot sections because I liked to browse through the Magazine section, opinion section, and technology section independently. Now I have to click a SEPARATE sections button and search through some exhaustive list of sections to find the ones I really want!! Please revert back to the other layout or give me the option to choose the pivot layout. The new bottom tabs are garbage.",
"I am so frustrated with the notifications from this app. Every day I get a notification for an interesting, intriguing headline. I click on it and the app opens in THE MAIN PAGE not the story in the notification. I then have to hunt for the story in the notification and I only find it about 1 time out of 10. It's such a basic basic feature. Why can't you get it right ?!?!?",
"This app is so... I don't know. It works great some times and I love the work the Times does but this app just stops working sometimes. I have a slow internet and when my speeds go slightly lower than normal the app says I am "" offline"" and just gives up trying to connect or load anything. No idea why. The video plaer also doesn't work. It only loads full quality video but I usually watch things at 140 to 240 p just to get a smoth video. Also it doesn't rotate? Hope these get fixed.",
"Spelling Bee no longer syncs with other devices. Every time there's an update, Spelling bee stops syncing with the web version and my iPad. It happened with the May update (which later was righted), and now once again with this latest update. Uninstalling, reinstalling, logging in and out does no good. My progress is synced across all other devices, just not with the Android app. It's annoying. And yes, I clear the app cache and storage.",
"Installed the free version, prepared for less functionality than a paid subscription. Read one article. Unable to read anything after that because all I got was a pop-up telling me I had to pay for a subscription everytime I clicked on an article. Don't advertise that this has a free version when it doesn't. Uninstalled.",
"Good app overall. Well laid out and appealing in itself. One very annoying problem: when I receive a notification about a specific article, and it interests me, i expect to see that article when I touch the notification. Instead it just opens the front page, and no sign of that article i was interested in!",
"This app used to download most articles so I could read them when not in wifi and no data signal. Now it only downloads a few, so if I want to read on the subway for example I have to go thru and save articles in advance. Which means it's useless for my purposes. Plus its insistence on updating after every article is really irritating.",
"App is broken. I got the same daily briefing push notification for weeks. Reinstalled the app today to see if that would fix it, and the button to log in doesn't work. App is poorly designed. A year ago there were beautiful, useful panes that I would swipe between, as well as a swipe right to bring up the main menu. Now there's just 3 tabs: ""All"", ""Some"", and ""All, but somehow even more disorganized"".",
"I really expected better from an outlet as prestigious as the NYT when I recently signed up as a new subscriber. However, this app crashes constantly. I reopen it and can't even get an article open before it crashes again. I don't have problems with any other apps on my Motorola (Android 7.1.1) phone. Please fix this!",
"The app largely works at giving you a multimedia experience when reading the Times. However, it's still not quite as convenient as a browser, especially when trying to go backwards AND forwards through the articles you read. It is gradually getting better at it, though.",
"Still not fixed after a long time, so drop another star off. Had always been a great app, but now it is broken. App doesn't work right since Android Pie update on Galaxy. Articles often don't click load right from the homepage or preview widget. Everything on the homepage is unreadable gray on white now, or sometimes it is black background and unreadable. I wish I could share screen shots. It is bad. Hope you guys can and will fix everything soon so I will be able to increase the rating score.",
"The Times should immediately assemble a team of investigative reporters to investigate why it can't make a good app. The situation as it stands is disgusting. My Times apps on two different Android phones keep freezing up. Maybe the Washington Post can do better. Update: The app gets worse and worse, very much a pain to use, freezing up more all the time. Does this paper have any sense at all? Doesn't it know it depends on digital subscriptions?",
"Mostly user-friendly app with a few MAJOR flaws. It relentlessly updates at any navigation, or if going in/out of service (eg, subway), gobbling up ridiculous amounts of data for no reason at all; app background use restriction doesn't stop this. Updates can push stories out and search function is virtually unusable. Even searching for recent stories by headline keyword or words yield strange hits; I switch to Google to find stories but then can't read them in the app.",
"Such excellent content and such an incompetent app. Crashes/freezes are common on my Pixel 3 with 75 Mbs+ connection speed. Night mode, without which reading in the dark is nearly intolerable, has been removed. I pay $10 a month for an unreliable app missing a basic feature. Meanwhile dozens of other free news apps with inferior content provide 100% reliability and a night mode that works. Please fix this before you drive me and other loyal readers away.",
"Makes it easy to scroll through and read the top ""front-page"" news stories and search for specific items or subjects. Also, when you Google something and an NYT story comes up in your Google search results, if you open that story it will give you the option of opening it in the app, which makes it easier to read and bookmark the story. Then you can easily return to your bookmarked stories, even monthes or years later",
"NYT breaking news alerts come in way too often. It needs to be broken into different categories. For instance, if there were a ""Breaking News: Deaths and Obituaries"" toggle that would be wonderful.",
"Such a disappointing app from such a good news source. I spent too much time looking for news the I want.Some days I get on the paper and all I want to read is anything new. I can see an article's a 5-minute read but not when it was published. Basically, I want politics, world news, US news investigating reporting &games. I don't want to see any sports celebrities.I don't how the ""For You"" comes up with an algorithm that gives me only articles about things I really don't care about.",
"Notifications are a mess. Even when you try to limit to ""breaking news"", NYT feels the need to interrupt you with notifications about college administrator being fired, and $0.15 raises in subway fares, and sports news. Are you kidding me? Also, when they do notify you if a story that actually is important, when you click the notification, it takes you to the app, but often not the actual story!",
"Last update screwed up the app. It kicked me out of my account so I had to reenter my login details, and now everytime I link from an email newsletter to the app, I'm faced with a huge subscription ad rather than the article. Totally sucks! If this is the new experience, I will be unsubscribing because linking to the app from newsletters is 90% of how I use the app. Terrible update, which I hadn't installed it",
"The app is decent enough but in terms of content, there’s too much editorial creep for my taste. On the plus side, I get free access through the library and free is the right price.",
"Stop blowing up my phone. Between emails and actual notifications I get about 20 a day to my phone from this app, even after going into the app's settings and trying to turn off just the ""15 ways to make jello pudding"" fluff pieces. I've enjoyed my subscription but I've had to completely mute the notifications on this app for my sanity. Everything else with the app is great but apparently I can't get just 1-4 a day... it's all or nothing. Will probably not renew my subscription next year.",
"While I find the New York times to be entirely too filled with way too much liberal rhetoric and one-sided viewpoints, the all is well done and configurable. You can find reasonable science and health content and the data is peer reviewed. if we could do with our the soon and just present the news, it would be a lot better for all.",
"After the latest app update, it tells me i don't have a subscription. I'm sure my subscription is still valid, but tried to renew, just in case i was mistaken. But it won't let me renew either. Some weird error message pops up.",
"Update sept '23. They STILL refresh the entire timeline every time you return from reading an article or switching to another app. It's exasperating and frustrating. STOP IT FFS! See bbc - they have a button that says ""updates available - click here to refresh""",
I wish the 'Search' feature were a little more intuitive to find; you need to go into the 'Sections' tab to find it. I also sometimes have trouble opening push notifications on Android. Otherwise the app is very well made and seamless to use.,
"Something in a recent update has broken persistent logins for me. Now I have to login every time I open the app, which is beyond annoying. Been using this for years, mostly with no trouble. And then someone pushes an untested update. I truly wish there was an easy way to downgrade versions on Android.",
"I love the UI, and it works great for me (both on my current Razr+ and previous 5G Razr), but the subscription option has disappeared from my Google Subscriptions, so I can't make this month's payment. When I log into the website, it tells me I subscribed via Google Pay and to go there, so I guess I have to let it lapse, cancel out for at least 30 days, and then try again. That's really annoying and kinda disappointing – but they still my Crossword sub, and no problem taking that $5! 🙄",
"Love the NYT, but this version of the app is beyond horrible. The largest text size is still too small, making reading on my Android phone very uncomfortable. And I deeply dislike scrolling left to right within sections.",
"Use caution when subscribing through Google Play. The New York Times does not honor the subscription on other devices or in browsers - this will be app only. Both the New York Times and Google's customer service defer the problem to the other company, so no responsibility is taken and there is no recourse for the customer. I would recommend either purchasing your subscription directly through the New York Times, or choose a different publication to use on your smartphone.",
"I love the New York Times as it is gold standard of news coverage. Sadly, however, the same cannot be said of their billing. The due date of a ""monthly"" subscription is apparently subject to change, without notice, on a month to month basis. I finally grew weary of getting email spam that my payment was due less than 3 weeks from my last payment and charged again, then again two weeks later. Thanks but no thanks New York times. Onward to the Washington Post app! 💯",
"I enjoy reading the NY Times. While some of the articles are written with a biased viewpoint, every article is usually well researched and well written and offers me a side of the story. I can balance that opinion against other well run newspapers to better understand all views. It would be nice if we could learn the facts without the reporter's spin, but for journalism to survive, it needs readers. I am highly satisfied with my subscription, just wish there was no limit to sharing articles!",
"The NY Times provides global news stories other than the repeated ones a lot of news outlets gravitate too. It provides a well rounded view of topics to choose from which will interest every individual reader. It's virtually impossible not to find what interest you through this paper. The insight the paper provides of our world we live in is outstanding. In addition, it's more than just a newspaper. Take a look. It's very reasonably priced which in itself is a added bonus for the reader .",
"Even after removing and reinstalling, the app doesn't display pictures. I have settings to automatically download pictures but nothing appears until you click on article and then click on each individual picture. Kinda not worth the couple of bucks i pay every month.",
"App is reasonable, except for the gigantic ad space shown even with a subscription. They have a dark mode, but show inline ads that are bright white on every page - index, homepage, articles, everywhere. App is essentially unusable, and not worth the subscription price.",
"7/17/23 edit: the app is asking me to log in everytime, isn't loading articles properly, and not registering the save article button. These ads are getting intrusive. Often click on ads while scrolling through an article. I can understand the need for ads but it should take less space.",
"One of my main news sources is NYT. I also like to share important news on Facebook and elsewhere to inform friends and followers and give them useful, up-to-date talking points and research they can use in their own conversations, feeds, and activism. So.... having access to the NYT app—which is very user-friendly and built for social media—saves lots of time and headaches. Whoever designed this app was top of the line: never any glitches, saves my userID/PW and is professional and intuitive.",
"Pretty meh. If you're going to nag paying(!) customers to use your app it should offer something the website does not. But instead the app often doesn't refresh automatically (and now has refused to refresh at ALL for 3 days), and there's no tabs like a web browser for opening multiple things you might want to read at once.",
"I don't know why I have to enter my password every day for this app. There should be a way to save your password or make it easier to log in. It doesn't even save my email address so I have to enter that too. No check box to save account info. For a paid app, that seems pretty basic.",
"I have been a lifelong subscriber of the Times. The app specifically has some accessibility issues (with resolution) on mobile devices. The Times also takes positions sometimes that I don't agree with, for example against remote work. However, this is in my opinion the best news app out there.",
"As a person who is always suspicious of a free lunch I like that NYT online is a paid subscription. However, I wish I had access to all of the content with that subscription. I don't think the newspaper would have survived if they charged by section. It is also supported with ads so wouldn't it make more sense to levet all of the content to drive up subscriptions?",
I've been a subscriber ever since it became digital and the pathetic Kindle version before then and printed version before that. We also subscribe to four other digital newspapers plus our local newspaper's print edition. And we don't watch TV broadcast news. it's the least and most that we can do to support journalism.,
"Hello, The news is very informative. Thank you so much for bringing the subscription this low. Please include an option to follow the article writer. When I read an article by a writer, I will want to follow the person, which is not possible now without the option ""follow"" the rest of the features are getting better and better every time.",
"While it's nice to have All Access for a Very Good Intro Rate, I only read the columns of One Opinion Writer. So why does the NYT make it incredibly difficult to find his latest Column--unless I follow a specific Columnist's Email that cones to me?! Losing points for not figuring out my narrow use of this Great American Newspaper.",
"Works well enough but it's surprisingly awkward to find articles - the priority seems to have been to make the home page look as much like a broadsheet as possible, but just personally I'd prefer ease of finding articles quickly with the addition of a search bar.",
I just subscribed with the $1 a week promo for the first year and my App keeps asking me to subscribe. I love the NY Times but this is very annoying. I am a paying customer and shouldn't have to be subjected to the Times continuing to solicit me. This is why I subscribed!!!! It's annoying....,
"Been an India-based digital subscriber for several years but now finding it impossible to continue my subscription following some changes in recurring payment rules in my country. No India-based card apparently will work for NYT payment as NYT is non-compliant with local recurring payment rules. Strangely, NYT will rather cancel a subscription than allow Indians to make one-time payments to continue their subscription. Use a US card is all that NYT's helpline can offer!",
"I subscribed to the NY Times the very first time I heard some idiot who later was elected president call it ""fake news"" . That statement from the biggest liar ever to occupy the Whitehouse was proof that there is some great reporting going on there. Thank you for your outstanding journalism at the NY Times from Florida !",
"I love the Times and read it every day, but I keep being logged out recently, several times a day. No 1Password integration so it's annoying to log back in. Been a paying subscriber for decades but this is making me not want to read the news or at least uninstall the app.",
The app suffers from bugs every so often. The latest one - which rears its ugly head from time to time - is where the app constantly says I am offline and doesn't reload despite having both data and WiFi. Sometimes a force stop fixes it but often it doesn't and I have to clear the cache or data in the file storage.,
"This app is so slow and frustrating to use. What's the point of giving me notifications if tapping them just opens the app, not the specific article mentioned? Not to mention, it takes 5 minutes to update every time i go to the home screen. It's not rocket science, just implement good UX design. As it stands, the app is a disservice to NYT.",
"Unable to retreive updated Google Play payment. I keep being told by NYTimes that I need to update my payment method in Google Play store - and it just continues to say that after updating my payment info. All my other paid apps switched to the new payment method registered with Google Play, but not this app, not NYTimes. 1 star until this issue is resolved.",
"Daily headlines in my hand. I just love the convenience of having award-winning journalism - real journalism - In my pocket all day long. I appreciate the breaking news notifications and enjoy the access to games for a very decent price, and not one tree was harmed. 💚🌱",
"Popups to upgrade are not good! I'm just a news subscriber but the popups to upgrade my subscription really ruin the experience. I'll be canceling in the morning. Yo Sultzberger, fire the schlubs that think that messing with subscribers is a good idea.",
"Although I subscribed primarily for the puzzles, the other content, news & the app itself, are of exceptionally high quality. The chat feature in Help is manned by very friendly, professional staff also. Even unsubscribing was a pleasant experience.",
NYTimes app doesn't open up when using a link to an article. Instead it opens in a browser. This creates problems with login. Please fix this issue.,
Some sections are hard to find. E.g. Wirecutter and The weekend selection of stories which I can only access via the email sent. Perhaps the links are there but they are quite well hidden.,
"Having a hard time navigating, but especially with the podcast component in the app. Controls for the podcast... disappear, and/or the podcast will randomly stop playing.",
"Could not live without my NYTimes. Reality is still reality, thanks to the Times. Loyal reader since my parent's required it of me in the 8th grade. I'm 56, so it's a life long relationship. I know whatever happens in the world, NYTimes will (accurately!!!!!!) tell me about it. It has been a comfort in these troubling times. Thank you NYTimes! ❤️u!",
I only read the nyt because I have a free subscription. Nyt seems to want to punish me for reading their paper. Constant emails. Newsletters to my work email I can't unsubcribe from. And an app that signs me out constantly and shuffles around content.,
"This is the absolute best news source/app I have ever used. Not only is the coverage of current events excellent, but all of the other helpful information about everyday topics is also good. I also really enjoy the high-quality daily crosswords. 😁",
"Smartest thing I've read about what's really going on in the US in the Age of Trumpism. If we lock him up, we'll get someone even more destructively clever, like Hawley, unless we fix the fact that the US meritocracy has become anything but over the last century: it's now a caste system with largely pre-determined outcomes, determined by birth. David Brooks has gradually, over the last couple of decades, elevated himself into the most sublime American essayist of the 21st century.",
"This android app is worth 4+ stars. However, why, after many months, is NYT audio still not available for Android? And btw, the audio section of the existing android NYT app is awful!",
"I love The NYT, but I am not feeling them right now. I was forced to cancel my subscriptions because for weeks on end my Sunday paper did not come, and my subscription included the physical Sunday paper. The Times' customer service could care less. It makes me so, so sad.",
"Can't log in, asking me to subscribe again despite active subscription. App is broken for Google login, don't subscribe as it will not work. Every time I log in it logs me out straight away. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling.",
It was so helpful so please don't be too much strict when it becomes to your own policy just because on my location and too unmindsets peopled who didn't barely think trices just because they want it application but me I suggest to you just provoke those people who can used this kind of application about was provened without testified.,
"Recent updates sign me out, requiring me to sign in again and wiping my saved articles from access within the app. Also, please remove the annoying point popup within Tiles. It ruins the game. Thanks.",
usually after chrome upgrades it does not recognize my annual subscription which runs for a few more months. asks me to subscribe. spending way too much time on that issue,
"NYT games are the threads that bind my day together. From the anticipation of what new challenge the morning's Wordle brings (and my daily competition with my son), to the satisfaction of breaking the ""genius"" barrier in Spelling Bee (without giving in to the temptations of Google), the NYT games fill the quiet mo.ents of my day with a expectation, fascination, and even a little joy.",
"App keeps logging me out. To make it worse, it won't allow me to use a password manager to login. I will not be renewing my subscription unless this is resolved.",
Too Bloated. Why Ads if I paid for the subscription? Remove Ads. Simplify the app and reduce or eliminate data collection. Otherwise will not renew.,
Great news source... but have been waiting for the audio app for so long. Android paying subscribers deserve parity in service. Three months and counting.,
I'm a Midwestern conservative and I like the fact that the Times covers the news in more depth and much better than the fifteen second soundbite drivel of other news media outlets.,
It's a shame & a pity that issues of gender & race inclusion weren't in the space between Wenner's ears nor those of his editors & publishers. I haven't read Rolling Stone since my 20s; good that Wenner has retired to perhaps make room for more inclusive eyes in the editorial desk.,
The Times app is clear yet complex. Super easy to navigate. Offers me the information I need to be an informed citizen. love it!,
App worked great for over 5 years. Very happy. Then in April 2023 the app quit showing any text-- just photos. Called and/or emailed NYT 6 times. No one could help me fix the problem. Now I have to read the Times in my browswer which sucks because I'm not able to access all the benefits of my paid subscription. Horrible customer service.,
"The New York Times is an excellent news source, great writing, insightful editorials, interesting and diverse selection of special columns and it feeds my brain rather than my ego. Happy to be a contributing subscriber.",
It's never a good sign when an app that you have a paid subscription with prompts you for review mid-article. The NYT is dead.,
"Excellent news source that breaks down stories into digestible facts and provides up-to-the-minute updates. Graphs and other visual aids make NYT my go-to for staying connected to what is happening. I will say though, that this is American media and the capitalist western agenda is sewn directly into the coverage.",
"So cool to learn about this. Although the hyperbole about the plants ""racing"" to sunlight made it exciting, reporting Doug Tallemy's nonplussed reaction made the article relevant. Doug Tallemy has been the US intellectual leader of native planting for a long time and it is very refreshing/valuable to learn about frameworks for native planting that are more specific and even extreme.",
"I have subscribed twice to the NYT and both times whenever I try to read it or the various newsletters, it tells me that I need to subscribe to the New York Times. Frankly, it's not worth the hassle.",
I like NYTimes but adroid notifications suck. I've activated the notifications multiple times but this app never sends me notifications.,
"Clearly the Android app is not a priority like iOS. Basic features won't work (like saving articles) but if all you want to do is read without a web browser, it'll do.",
The NYT has robust writing with articles flooded with facts and sources. The variety of subjects satisfies many curiosities that I didn't know I had. I subtracted a star because the Times has few articles that I can listen to when my eyes grow tired.,
"I do like the app. Lately, though, it's been doing this weird thing when I open an article. After the article opens, the screen jumps to one of the ads that are spaced throughout the article. It's as if they are trying to direct your attention to the ad instead of the article. Even if I start scrolling through the article a bit before the ad load, the article will jump to the ad when I'm in the middle of reading an article and I lose my spot, so I have to find where I left of in my reading",
"The app is actually fine but I successfully cancelled my subscription months ago. I'm still being charged only now with no access. No one has ever replied to my enquires. So basically, only subscribe if you're into unfulfilling, life long commitments. Update months later. Still no response. Still being charged for articles a can't read.",
"Excellent online news. great writing. Broad range of subjects covered by top class writers, journalists and independent experts.",
"What a garbage source of information. ""Breaking news"" notification are about someone kissing or something even dumber. Not to mention the extreme bias",
"Extremely solid app and very customizable. Only niggling thing is it sometimes tells me that I've been offline for 14 hours or whatever, when I'm clearly online with access to the full internet.",
"Utterly biased and opionated media that clearly differentiates between the developed and the developing world. A prime example is the France riots where the coverage has been dramatically mellowed down and frankly is quite appalling . If this had happened in a country in the global south, these same nincompoops would have cried from the rooftops. These racist 'journalists' should go back to their respective schools ( if they attended one i.e) and re learn what journalism is all about!",
"The news is balanced, up-to-date, comprehensive, and it reads very like the UK's Guardian. The handling of subscriptions is poor: seemingly over-focused on getting you to subscribe, (when you're a subscriber anyway) and you have to pay extra for crosswords and recipes, which is a pity. When I've been in touch, the respose team was well-informed, attentive and helpful.",
"The content is fine, but boy oy boy do they love sending unsolicited email, even when you have opted out of all of their mailing lists. They also make it way too easy to accidentally sign up for more mailing lists when you just want to use the app; they put popups with accept buttons where you're likely to tap, so you enroll in another damn list. NYT, what do you gain from irritating your paying customers?",
"I have been reading the NYT since I was a child. It's my go-to for news, entertainment, politics and fun such as news quiz and mini crossword etc. Getting digital now that I live out of state. I read and sometimes listen every day. The breaking news alerts are invaluable, keeping me well informed at all times. Thank you NYT. You all that put it together are so important to my life.",
Be careful with this subscription. I no longer used the app and so cancelled my subscription 3 months ago. Only to find that last week my subscription auto renewed and that I had been charged for a month's subscription. I have since been sent around in circles between NYT and Google Pay both claiming that it's the responsibility of the other to issue the refund. Was a huge fan of NYT but sadly now think that they are shady.,
"Update, Over 3 years later and it still happens!! I click on a breaking news notification only to be brought toa completely different article.What is the point of notifying me about an article only to click the notification and not be brought to that article? Every single notification brings me to the home page and cant find the article it mentioned. This app absolutely sucks and needs alot of work. Turned off all notifications because this is horrible. Why am I paying for this?",
"Do not purchase a subscription via Google Play subscription services. Two months after I did so for an annual subscription my account suddenly wasn't subscribed anymore. The NYTimes support team claims they can't validate the subscription because the information is stored on Google servers, and so they can't help. Now I'm left trying to get Google to make my NYTimes subscription work. Don't offer in app purchases if you can't make them work correctly...",
"Using the app for about a week now. I was hoping that by subscribing I could avoid ads. I don't mind paying more for that kind of feature, I just don't want to see ads. The ads are also just weird; my coworker was wondering why I was looking at a man in a bathing suit. I wasn't, it was an ad that broke up a portion of the article I was reading... The article search function is terrible. I was trying to find an article I know I've read before, but it was bringing up OCR articles from the 1800's.",
"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY! I purchased an annual subscription for the NYT all access through Google Play but the subscription never went through to my NYT account. I contacted both Google Play and the NYT app support and each told me to contact the other and neither connected the subscription with the account. Now I'm out the price of an annual subscription, told I'm not eligible for a refund, and still don't have access to the NYT crossword or news. 🤷",
"A great spectrum of topics and long form, thoughtful news. Sure it may seem like a certain perspective, but it's always a thorough, comprehensive perspective I seek for my overall news input. Getting quotes in news stories from experts is particularly relevant.",
NYT please bring back the sharing option for IG Stories! Loved that feature allowing me to let my friends see news headlines that matter to them!,
"Lets you save stories but when you try to view them in the Saved section, they do not appear. The search function is the most unhelpful and antiquated one I've ever seen, never finds anything vaguely related to your search or even recent.",
"the app is very functional, and sometimes even better than the website itself. a good balance to keep info available while on the go.",
"NYT, could you add a ""sports"" notification on/off switch? Also, frequently the header photo doesn't load leaving a dark grey rectangle in its place",
"I really really hate that when I back out of an article, the app brings me to the top of the feed automatically rather than back to where I was in the feed when I accessed the article. I can't be the only person who hates that.",
I got the feeling this app doesn't work well on Android. I pay an expensive subscription and I get a substandard app. When they have articles with pictures overlapping text the app crashes most of the time. Google Pixel 6.,
"its an excellent application, gives you a very good experience navigating all the information the newspaper have!",
"What's not to love about The New York times? Opinions, advice, recipes, newsworthy articles and I really love the font they use.",
"This and so much more! Now scooping Dx from terminology in EMR, or diagnostic reports. Problem relevant or not, once branded, it never goes away and adds bias to care and risk of assumptive (inaccurate) care.",
"While there are those articles unopened for comments, most are. I enjoy writing something which hopefully adds to what others write. Many contributors are both passionate and well-reasoned. One might surmise it requires some investment to provide for public commenting. I wish more news outlets might make it available. Who knows if consolidation is a real reason? We do need more of it. And no, I do not want a bunch of trolls running the boards. NYT does screen troll-E stuff.",
"The app is wonky and night mode suddenly no longer existed but it came back. It's a work in progress and I don't use it for surgery, it's fine.",
"NY Tumes is still the best newspaper in the US, if not the world. It is comprehensive, informative-news we can trust to be well researched and true.The website is easy to navigate.",
"David Sibley describes how to draw birds in the simplest and most honest way. I teach art to third graders who will love this. Just get the outline right, and the rest is just like a coloring book!",
"The Times. NY Times. I visit site each day. I do miss the print edition, though. To me, nothing compares to the Sunday Times print edition. I'm aging myself here.",
"Reliable, trustworthy, & affordable. Irreplaceable. Having problems with app?... try uninstall then reinstall. Excellent Chat customer care. Browser versions on Tablet and IPad work and look great. Caution, habit forming.",
Seems like any time there is an update. Says I'm offline. When of course I'm online. Ads even with subscription. And I see I'm signed in yet check settings I have to reenter user name and password.,
"The standard had been gold, but the crown slipped a bit. Haven't forgotten the selling of the Iraq War and giving a platform to disgusting Tom Cotton, among other things. The best at what they do.",
Every time I try to log in it acts like it's logging me in but doesn't. I am a subscriber. I can get in through the browser on my pc but not on my phone. I might just cancel.,
"Still buggy. Ads make an article advance and u have to scroll back. Would be nice if major bugs are fixed, its in the update.",
"Stand by for an inbox of spam email you don't want. Signed up with NYT and within hours emails from american companies were appearing in my inbox. Pretty obvious who sold my details, I'm in Europe. Read what they give you. Menus etc not easy to find. Not impressed.",
"I enjoy the puzzles and stories recommended in the app. It's intuitive and reliable, unlike some news apps.",
"Wide-ranging but, unfortunately Op-Ed pieces are put forward as news. The general fall of journalism, but the Times should be above it.",
"Best source of objective reporting in the U. S. on current events. Excellent source of information, entertainment, and discussion in all areas of human endeavor. Easy format to navigate and search.",
"Generally positive, but the app keeps telling me that I'm offline and will not update with the latest news stories. I'm definitely offline!",
"I really enjoyed this, especially since good public transportation makes a city more livable. Sadly, my Boston needs to ramp up its systems.",
Should have read the reviews. Not impressed and uninstalling. Glitchy and hard to navigate and poorly presented. Will go back to the 4 games I play once daily for free via the website.,
print and digital article titles/headlines do not always agree so it's sometimes difficult to find articles of interest.,
"Connectivity issues continue to worsen for this app. It frequently can't connect, thinks it's offline, etc.",
"great! plus, they rework the UI from time to time. things like this do need constant tuning. and they are attentive to that",
"Good app, simple enough to navigate. Needs a night mode, and better text copy handling.",
"For lovers of language, this is a jewel! As one who is only VERY superficially acquainted with Manga, the explanations were quite clear. Not gonna make me a reader of the genre but I have 5 grandsons!",
"So appreciate & admire the majestic use of native plants! I'm also encouraged as a plant enjoying person, to be more creative with how to place & manage growth. I'm making notes from this article. Thank you!",

"Concise, focused and different ways to meditate. Simple and brief to longer and more intricate. excellent",
"I love the newsletters. I love the games. I love everything about the NYT, except their coverage of transgender issues historically, but they are getting better.",
Honestly expressing immense happiness about NYT for an excellent positive looking article on India reflecting the contribution of PM Modi. To my knowledge this is the first of its kind and a pleasant surprise since NYT does not seem to publish positive looking articles. Keep it up.,
came here for spelling bee but I really like the app. I used to get the physical paper and loved it but i couldn't read it fast enough.,
"Not always the most intuitive interface, but very stable and responsive.",
"Coverage seems to stick to the truth and allow the formation of informed opinion. This seems to have become unusual in modern times. 🤔 😳 Thanks, NYT",
"The news and articles in NYT are well written and show a dedication to professional writing. articles are current, relevant, and informative, without the many shallow topics that you find in other online news sources",
Wow. The nerve of charging android users full price for the same subscription but only releasing the audio app for IOS. Strongly considering cancelling my NYT subscription until this is rectified.,
Love it! Judging by the lack of lawsuits I'd say the reporting is excellent. And if you're looking for podcasts they're on Spotify.,
dark mode available only on the app to force more intrusive tracking behavior. No reason it couldn't be made available on their website.,
One of the only news sources I fully trust. I only gave 4 stars for the fact that I would love to have a few more free articles to share with my friends,
"NYT always interrupts your reading to have you login, open the article in the app, pick your nose, anything to interrupt you reading an article.",
"The app is OK, but it constantly kicks me out of the games. I have a games subscription. I will be playing Spelling Bee and it will randomly tell me I have to log in to continue. Then it won't let me play for a while until it decides to recognize me subscription again.",
It's wonderful to have the award-winning NYT journalism at my fingertips 24/7. I luv it!,
Terrible experience. Unable to organize content or follow topics or authors. Unusable. The website is somewhat better,
Newest version removes the option to update text size. They tell you to do it in your phone settings which of course does not adjust app text. Text in the articles far too small! Update - I contacted them again in April 2023 about this issue and got the same lame response about adjusting system settings. Ridiculous.,
"Not functional! I can change the setting and share an article, but I can't scroll to read them! I purchased a subscription because I was tired of being told I met my daily limit on articles of interest. However now that I have it, I can't read any article past the headline. Frustrating. NYT do better!",
"I ordered a NY Times digital subscription through Google Pay, associated with my Google email address. However, the NY Times didn't recognize me as a paid subscriber. Several MONTHS of going back and forth between the NY Times and Google resulted in no resolution, each pointing the finger at the other. I was denied a refund by both parties. Both are losing a customer.",
"this is the full content of the New York times at your fingertips, wherever and whenever you want it. The Times's reporting is top notch and puts issues into context, and the app also gives you access to special sections like style and travel and the games.",
"Everything fine but for the people working on the Numbers game Beta: the app freezes legitimately every time I open it. Sometimes I'll get to tap a few icons first but I have only been able to submit my result twice so far 😅 it's a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, if that's in any way helpful. I really love the apps extensive functions and the other games 😁",
"The app keeps complaining that it's offline. It got stuck on offline two days ago. I couldn't fix it so cleared cache. That made the unusable, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now, it doesn't have Games section at the bottom. I have to scroll through the today's paper to the bottom to play games. It still complains of being offline at random times. Downgrading my rating.",
"I have a brand new phone with the latest processor, and this app consistently still has a problem showing photos and ESPECIALLY videos. The ""videos"" will just be straight up black no matter what I do yet I will still hear the sound. Awful. Guessing they ignore Android development and just focus on iPhones 🙄",
"I start every day with NYTimes headlines and feel informed about world & US news. Human interest stories, helpful tips in several subject areas round out my knowledge of many things. I appreciate the dedication of the journalists who investigate what's what and who's who. There's so much that I gain - it's hard to describe! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Thank You!",
The app is buggy on Android since the iPhone users take priority. Listening to audio via the app causes the app to crash. They also advertise an audio app...for the iOS. I wonder if anyone who works at the NY Times doesn't use an iPhone...,
"Bug: An update from some time ago has broken share tool. No matter which push notification I try to share, it keeps defaulting to the link details of the first story, *even* if I cancel it from the list. Edit: After many months this bug is still around. Please help fix - thanks!",
"You can only change the font size by changing the overall font size for the whole phone from the accessibility settings. Very pope design. Plenty of other font instances are fine and don't need to be bigger. The one that's too small is the NYT article font, but that can't be changed like other news apps. Boo.",
Getting the same problem with NYT games as this. I am registered with my Google account and i click log in with Google and it doesn't log me in and keeps telling me I have to log in.,
Keeps logging me out and doesn't support my password manager so I have to look up and manually enter my credentials every time I open the app.,
Horrible. The app doesn't recognise my subscription through the Google play store even on the linked Google account. It even asks me to create new subscriptions every time. After 3 paid subscriptions I stopped. Feedback resulted in no answer. I paid 100$ for absolutely nothing.,
"Great for news snippets, just -1 star, as not much updates on the comics/ graphic novels/ graphic literature in the culture section.",
one of the greatest sources of current event information on the planet. And - Very well written. If you enjoy reading your info this is still for you!,
Best source of news there is. And the readers' commens are way more thoughtful than any other site.,
I have had the privilege of visiting the site during construction. It is spectacular. This article only begins to describe this marvelous building dedicated to the arts.,
"Great news source, pretty terrible app. I get it, it's not like Bloomberg, doesn't cost 40 bucks a month, so I won't be passing judgement, but it is the case.",
"Fantastic article, explaining the involvement, for better or worse, of all the major players in the attempt to overthrow our government.",
"Whether you're old school like me & get it in print or it's digital, The New York Times has all the news 📰 you need & more.",
The app is steady but its hard to find the right articles that are matching with my interests.,
Clearly the best and most comprehensive coverage of any newsgathering organization in the country. It is go-to source for news of the day.,
"Consistently leans to the left, objectivity of writing depends on author. Still good reporting with broad topics.",
I am thrilled to be in a place in my life where I can both afford the luxury of a subscription to the Times and the time to appreciate some of their amazing articles,
"While bias occasionally seeps through, the overall objectivity, breadth and depth is clear.",
This would be a 5 but the internal search really doesn't work at all. You basically have to leave and use Google to find any article.,
"Really concerning article on navy's blatant inability to retool fast enough and well enough to overcome modern and near-future, very scary, warfare capabilities of likely opponents.",
"Old guy in Denver, for most of my now seventy years. Was lucky to travel some. Worked at printing, for a business at 75 Park Place. Stayed in Hoboken and came across and exited at the Trade Center, recall the escalators going up and up forever.... Good Work, Carry On!!",
"Bought & billed for all access subscription $3.99 a month, received game subscription in app, NYT said contact Google, Google said contact app developer, cancelled subscription, forgot about $4.",
"Usually clear, concise and truthful - as far as the truth is known. This is THE 'paper of record"" in the United States.",
"Not as good as you want it to be for how much it costs. The app is clunky, their games are inconsistent and they've ruined wordl. If it was free I'd still be annoyed, but I'd play. But for $20 per year I get too angry to enjoy myself. It's 2023, try using a robot to proof your work.",
"Meritocracy purports to level the field, but as this article points out, it does not. At least not as it is practiced in this country. Ditto protection under the law, justice, constitutional democracy, etc.",
"I subscribe for the contents which I think is great, however the App has much to be desired. I can't find any shortcut or navigation and have to go through the screen to find what I am interested. The link to the Athletic is all the way near the bottom. Once into the site, it is total lack of functionality. Wish NTY would spend some budgets on programming.",
"Wake up People! Our future depends on having humans who explore, examine, evaluate and end up learning to contribute to our Greater Good!",
"The era of both sidesism in legacy media is in full force at the NYT. Democrats ""plot"" to convince the middle class that they are working for them despite passing the most consequential legislation in my life time. The GOP has actual plots to make life more difficult for everyone except the rich and actively plot to undermine our democracy. In an effort to be unbiased the NYT has become more biased by not accurately stating the difference between the parties.",
"I love reading from the vast collection of intelligent, well researched articles from journalists of every stripe anytime I've got a free moment. I couldn't recommend more highly than the NY Times",
"working well, lets me know about interesting news and articles I'd otherwise miss. Enjoying it.",
A balanced and extensive reporting along with excellent articles on almost any subject.,
I am interested in a us-centric worldview and the New York Times provides an excellent survey for the money.,
The venerable NT Times will keep you up to date on a variety of breaking news and keep you informed!,
"After last update the app randomly doesn't recognise my log in in Games, despite being log in status being correct in Settings",
"I am a fan of John le Carée's works, and consider him to be, so far, the best writer in the genre of international espionage and political intrigue.",
"This article and the likes need to be told over and over again as to be allowed for all to know the truths, the good and bad, those unfolding, our history, past and present.",
NYT is a fact based news source which also has some interesting editorial and helpful to life articles.,
Something not mentioned in this article is overpopulation and the lack of remediation by agriculture needed to use water much more efficiently!,
Love the NY Times. Outstanding writers and astute editors.,
"Great journalism, app works great, I subscribed yet nyt continues to bother me to upgrade my subscription which is very annoying. I considered just giving three stars because of this, but it's otherwise great and I know they do need money.",
"I don't like the app layout and you get lots of ads, even with a premium subscription. Also the news is very negative, statically NYT is more negatively biased than any other paper, so I prefer The Guardian.",
Yes! We finally have dark mode! ...but now the app keeps losing/ forgetting my login/ subscription.,
the app is a little clunky but useable. I like the NY Times as a news source,
$20 for a subscription to news is unbelievable. There are other news outlets with articles just as good or better then the New York Times. This company is being run into the ground with this money grabbing scheme. Unsubscribing today and I urge all others to do the same.,
"Recently, this app asks me to log in all the time. So tired of re-entering my username/password. Please fix it.",
"Informative. Time to listen to the experts and begin funding these smaller, faster drones.",
Great app from one of the most comprehensive and prestigious news organizations in the world.,
"Cannot put articles in landscape mode, incredibly annoying.",
"Great articles, I love my algorithm for my feed, and great puzzles!",
A staple of news for those that want to be informed and in-depth editorials.,
Great reporting but wish they had the same audible option as Washington Post.,
Very immersive and professionally presented interactive stories.,
easy to use with great content for a affordable price 👌,
Broken since 08/25/2023. App hangs up when opening and nothing loads. Galaxy S20+.,
"Horrible Android Experience. Print an article to .pdf, and you get pop-up text and graphics that makes the document unreadable. Only happens on mobile.",
"Without an independent press and an informed citizenry, we will not endure as a nation. The NY Times is the gold standard and my go-to source for news and information.",
"One of the consistently best sources of news, with the usual imperfections, in the country. Really needs the option that the Washington Post offers for many of its articles: audio.",
Leaves out many important stories. Very difficult to stop membership. Cost triples after intro deal.,
"Great app, so easy to use, makes it very easy to keep up with the news. Games section is fun too.",
"Great Topical News, Good Links to Research and Word Games",
"Access to a newspaper of record is essential for an informed citizen. As a matter of fact, the more the better, right? NYT has been and continues to be one of the best.",
"First of all, I'd like to make clear that I think the New York Times' coverage is phenomenal, and that it's an essential part of my news diet. That said, this app does little to enhance my reading experience. Deep links do not seem to work; when I click on a New York Times link from Facebook, it goes to a blank page within the New York Times app, and not the article I was looking for. Additionally, when I go into settings and set my preferences for NYTimes links to ""ask every time"" instead of ""open in this app,"" NYTimes links seem to still automatically trigger the app (although it seems like this might be an Android issue and not one specific to the app?). I'm a digital subscriber to the NYTimes and I'm running Android 10, if this helps.",
I have read and trusted the Times since I was 16. Always solid journalism.,
"I love the NYT and their coverage but the app isnt great. The layout is confusing and difficult to navigate. Also the most frustrating aspect of the app is that when it sends you a push notification for a story and you click on it, it takes you to the latest news update rather than the story in the push notification. Cancelled my subscription as a result. Shame",
"journalism aside, this app is clunky and works well only occasionally. I'm often clicking a story notification only to find a blank page, and sometimes my articles aren't saved when i bookmark them. it crashes constantly. It looks nice but needs some quality control! otherwise, the fonts are beautiful and easy to read, and there aren't a lot of ads.",
"The app has a good layout but the function is lacking. The ""for you"" section is often not updated, so you instead must search for each column, either through it's publishing section or using the unreliable search. The multimedia articles are glitchy and malfunction, making for an irritating reading experience. And if you leave off an article and reopen the app later to finish it, you'll find yourself kicked out of the article due to a reload. There's also not a clear way to save articles.",
"The app is difficult to navigate. Keep the games separate. Bring back the old sections tab, stop trying to innovate by adding more pictures. You're a news site, not reddit.",
"The New York Times is one of the most thorough, analytical, ethical, and accurate sources of news. I read it every day.",
The depth and scope of the New York Times are without parallel (The Atlantic and ProPublica are close),
Why is Audio not available on the NYT Android app?,
"I've been subscribed for several years. I really miss night mode, even with its limitations. Some time ago, not sure if it happened in June, the dark gray slide bar within articles was removed... It's incredible how such bad ideas are introduced into the app... It looks like the guys who develop it don't really use it... Maybe they read Breitbart.",
"As mentioned by many others, it's a known issue that the app lacks functionality with FB. Whenever I try to open a story, it takes me to a blank page and then the home page. I miss most the stories I'm interested in reading. I've called in twice to report this, been promised a call back from IT to resolve it, but I've heard from no one. After months of this, I plan to cancel my years-long subscription if this isnt resolved soon.",
What a long strange trip it's been. And what's great is that through the music it will always be alive and well!!!,
Complete and unbiased coverage of events from around the world. And I'm not American but this is still one of the best sources available.,
"Useless subscription. I have been paying for years, unable ever to open subscription. Had Games which I also pay for on my phone which was stolen. Can't even do that now. A giant ripoff.",
People who pay for NYT don't want to see food articles with recipes they don't have access to because they didn't pay even more!,
"I like the variety of games, the NYT Cooking, and all the current daily news.",
"Subscription went through on June 9, yet the app will not recognize my phone and continues to tell me to subscribe.",
"I love the New York Times. I used to be a subscriber, back when ""The Daily"" first launched and the price was below $10/month. IDK if the cost of living is causing the editors at NYT to disassociate from the rest of America, but $17/month is crazy. The value proposition is there, sure. The NYT is the best journalism in America. Yet, as a DINK, mechanical engineer making decent money, I find it absurd to be ""priced out"" of a news service. NYT please lower your subscription cost.",
Terrible app. Constantly logged out or it fails to recognise me. So frustrating - I pay for this!,
"This is a comment about the new version of the App and not the NY Times. 1. Notifications don't allow you to read the snippets because they magically change when you slightly expand them to whatever snippet is the preferred one. 2. It's a huge battery hog - which is a drag for those of us who like to read lots of different articles. As an example, a 15min session takes over 10% of my battery...",
Stop asking if I want your app! I read on a browser and I'm quite happy thank you. I am this close to canceling my sub if you don't stop pushing your app every time I open an article. Stop. I don't want this.,
"NYTimes, it's all you need wrapped up in one app on the palm of your hand.",
"Outstanding investigative journalism that our country, our future as an un-Trumped civilization, depends on",
"the app doesn't correctly understand whether I'm online or not, and frequently needs to be restarted.",
thoughtful and well-researched objective reporting.,
very well designed . easy to use. intelligent content. very pleased.,
"App is difficult to navigate, seems to be designed to be rigid and unresponsive. The reporting and stories are top notch though, which offsets the difficulties.",
"Excellent and Important information about Reading ? Without reading , there is no imagination, no empathy , no learning, no experience ,no exploration , no understanding ,no creativity, no communicating, As it is now , intelligence will decline , as the people of the world become their cell phones!",
"I have the app on my phone already, but whenever I click 'read this in the app' from a new story, it takes me to the play store to install the app again! Very annoying.",
Absolutely the top source for news and everything else imaginable. Scrupulous in research and in correcting themselves. Excellent!,
Every morning I read the NYTimes. I'm a paid subscriber. This app is consistently bug-free. Easy to read. I love that I can share 10 gift articles a month.,
"it's my daily go to. some of the best written articles. Let's not forget about the best games, Wordle, spelling bee, and crossword puzzles.",
"I wish they would fix the app. When you click on the notification, it takes you to any other story but the one you're trying to read.",
"I really on serious, fact-based journalism to understand our economy, political issues, and world events. Thank God for the NYT, their strong team and standards.",
"I am confident I am getting the facts from the Times. I studied journalism in college, and I know all good journalists ensure their articles are as accurate as possible.",
Outstanding accessibility to virtually all areas of The New York Times . Superb layout and organization.,
"Very Informative, incisive analysis, great visualization of data in combination with the related news. Daring reporting!",
"Over the last year I really enjoyed the app! The news coverage is amazing, well organised, etc. Unfortunately (for me as an international), though, the app is tailored to Americans as the main page mostly covers news about the USA. It, therefore, would be amazing if there would be an international alternative to it with the section 'world' as its starting page. Because under these circumstances, I think I will switch to another newspaper",
"The app sucks. I have subscribed to the basic service using the phone credit but still cannot access it. After opening some articles, I was notified that I had reached the amount of articles I could read and later reminded to subscribe again to enjoy the basic service. What?! To make the case worse, I cannot get refunded as well. I love the NYT, but its app is simply unreliable. I'm terribly discouraged from attempting another purchase. The same thing might happen again.",
All pictures do not load simultaneously on homepage. You read the text and have to wait for the images to load. This despite the fact that I am on a fast Internet connection. Another issue for me is the lack of a 'Night mode' like in the Washington Post app. That app is miles ahead of this one. You need to improve guys or I'll just stick with the Post. Thnx. Update after few weeks: The problem of content display on opening the app has deteriorated. Pictures and even text takes ages to load now!,
"Not sure if it's due to a recent update, but the app is utterly broken. Keeps asking to log in. Once logged in, it shows a screen saying ""You are now logged in as , then takes you to a new screen saying that due to recent password change, you'll need to log back in. There has been no password change. I'm able to log in on the website with the same credentials and remain logged in without issue. App has been uninstalled and then reinstalled, as well as cache and data cleared.",
"An enligtening article. As a senior citizen, I took the challenge to learn about at least one psychedelic rather than criticize.",
An extraordinary institution that I wish came closer to the center.,
"Very insightful take on the real tragedy when one leverages another's NIL in a seemingly subtle fashion. Forensic accounts will be kept busy attempting to cross reference contracts, terms, definitions, and historicals. But beyond the pure economics, what about an Oscar, paid speeches as an adoption expert, a foundation, prestige, and notoriety. Ill-gotten gains? At minimum mercenary leverage. And if Mike was pushed toward a lessor school and the movie affected his draft status? Tragic.",
"Great content, but browsing experience is sub-par. The main category browser is just a very long list with no subject/article highlights. At the same time, suggestions at the end of an article are extremely predictive and systemized, so arriving at new content is a bit of a task. Content and content layout is top quality, though, so worth the money.",
The app has been logging me out every few hours for the last week. Seems like some recent buggy update,
"So much appreciation for the hard work everyone at the Times puts in to getting it right. So important now, amazingly.",
App now has annoying auto play video ads. Why am I paying for this?,
starts easy and then gets more complicated. interesting facts.,
one of the best sources of information of the digital age.I really like it,
"NY Times application is very mobile friendly. It makes very easy to navigate between news and sections, and they have mastered the notifications. This application is my favorite application in my phone. About the news, I have not read a bias one until now. They always include different sources, and aspects of a topic, which makes every news to be on point and very informative.",
"I had a terrible experience with an in-app renewal of the subscription and I feel frankly defrauded by both Google and the New York Times. I was charged twice for overlapping subscriptions, the most expensive of which I cannot even accede to, and the least expensive of which after much trouble and effort I manage now to access at least (but only) on the android app. Google('s AI, for lack of a better option) and NYT both refuse to acknowledge my issue, much less resolve it.",
Good content. You get used to the presentation and navigation then they change it. This latest version won't hold your place after going to a sidebar. It refreshes the entire contents and takes you to the top again. I refuse to pay an extra subscription fee for puzzles. That is probably why the mini takes so long to load. It will become a fee paid item too.,
Developers have yet to enable dark mode for games.,
"Great reporting and writing. I also love the Daily podcast. BUT the NYT app drives me crazy. If you leave an article and try to come back to it after more than a few minutes, there is a good chance the app will have closed in the background and you lose your place. If you are trying to get through some of the longer form material, this is a nightmare. Please update the app to keep track of your progress so you can return to where you left off.",
"This latest update is horrible. What one could do with a swipe before is now done with menus and button pushing. Comments are no longer displayed as an icon and instead require extra taping to reach via a menu. The night or dark mode clearly hasn't been tested for esthetics. Come on, guys. I'll add that recent, previous updates aren't great, either. The front page reloads each time you return from an article, articles refresh if you leave the app (ex. to use the share function).",
"Been using the app for years, but I'll migrate to the mobile site for the time being. As it stands now, the app is bloated and performs poorly even on good hardware. Articles fail to load or reload at the top of the page for no reason, and ads are more numerous and disruptive of the reading experience than ever before.",
"Sadly I cannot give this app 5 stars. On android (version 9, s10), I get notifications from the app, but upon opening the application, no content launches. Instead, I'm greeted with a message stating ""Device is offline. [then some suggestions to reconnect]"". This message persists on different wifi networks and when I'm using data. Clean installation and device resets do not alleviate the issue. All other NYT apps work fine.",
A most excellent and cogent summary of what is about to unfold,
clear and relatively concise news stories. I love it.,
Timely reports on major issues. App is easy to navigate.,
Saved articles are hard to find. The search engine is not accurate at all.,
Great app that delivers the news without getting in the way of the news.,
Less baised (though not ideologically unbaised) and more in depth and thorough other outlets.,
App has gotten better but I still think the UI is a bit clunky.,
Need a way to search current issue and back issues to find the story I want to read.,
The NYT provides a wide variety of quality information and content about many subjects.,
Great newspaper in print excellent digital rendering of that standard in an app.,
one of the best resources for news that I know. Good in depth reporting too,
"Barbara Kingsolver's journey, and how it shaped her writing and perspective on the world at large. can't wait! to read Copperhead. Thanks Ezra!",
Informative and concise. No B.S. That's what I always look for in my missives.,
I just canceled my subscription after being ask to subscribe when I'm already paying sub. Ridiculous.,
I read the NYTimes daily with special appreciation for the access on my phone using the app👍,
"NYT provides dependable, accurate and timely reporting on the issues of the day.",
"well done, fellow guardians, keep fighting the what? Good 1! have a good day! relish in your very own intentions.. GOD SPEED!",
Most recent update forces me to log in everytime I open an article.,
"Great and reliable news, all the time!",
Great news on all subjects. It's worth the price we pay for the news we get.,
Indiana Jones was fabulous I n way only George Lucas and Steven Spielberg could deliver I Loved it!,
variety of well researched and balanced news,
"The gold standard of both print news _*and*_ website mass media...certainly of The U.S., if not the world.",
The app is good even though it requires a lot more scrolling than other news apps. I like the interface except for the fact that more than half of the news headlines have a white background even in night mode and that makes reading at night a pain. The articles and content aggregation is upto the mark as its NYT. I just wish that it was a little less rough around the edges and the experimental features like night mode are improved quickly.,
Well written and easy to understand articles,
Nice stretch. I'm going to adapt for bad knees by sitting. Thanks.,
"Love the content but they are putting more and more of it into the ""live stories,"" which I find to have a pretty lousy experience. Everytime I open one, it scrolls up and down like crazy as the page loads. I will start reading and be interupted three times as the sentence I'm reading is shifted off screen. I wish they would just use native experience as they had for so many years. Putting content in web views is a huge step backwards 😕😭",
"I thought this app world be better; world class and leading-edge. Unfortunately, not. The NYTimes app on a smartphone is limited and aggravating. Even on a tablet, I find it more arduous than it needs to me. The journalists, content, writing, and perspective I appreciate. The app could use some work to make it more attractive, increase intuitiveness, and ease navigation to what I want to, or think, I should read. Regardless, I am a digital subscriber to the NYTimes and appreciate their work.",
"Best journalism on the planet, bar none.",
Fantastic source of news and GREAT articles!!,
I love this newspaper and look forward to reading it every day!,
"Content is excellent. On the whole the app is OK but please, please learn from WaPo. They have excellent content AND an excellent app. It's easier to use and more convenient for me as a user so I generally choose that one as my primary source of that reason. I do appreciate that NYT finally introduced dark mode which is easier to my eyes. Great improvement.",
"great way to read, cache, save, share etc.",
"I moved from Google News to this app because of glitches in my NYT subscription. Turns out this app prompts me more frequently for my login. Further to this, after logging in, it notifies me that I once again have 3 free articles left - as if my logging in 2 seconds ago wasn't meaningful. I've done multiple app reinstalls, cache clearing, etc. This is most definitely a NYT technology issue - verified by two platforms. I can't keep paying for a service I don't get.",
A refreshing and enlightening change from the UK press!,
"Disappointing NYT has a fancy Audio app for Apple subscribers, but we lowly Android users have to make do with this substandard alternative. I'm paying just as much, but they are treated to special perks. ""All Access"" is a misnomer.",
About as objective as the most biased local newspaper in your country. With ability to use fancy words somehow got world famous. Best of luck to you if you think they are about good journalism.,
"Read is constantly interrupted with messages to get the app, even though I am aleady in the app. Must exit article & reentry to continue reading. Please fix this issue!",
Hope you guys have a widget so can easily see the news from home screen without click the app first. It is hard for the first time found the search feature,
Allows unimpeded choice of the most important articles in The New York Times. There are so many quality articles it is impossible normally to know where to go.,
This is a pay app and it keeps saying that your trial has ended when you have signed in or whatever it is on the website also this should not be a pay app because people like this one and everything and need it for stuff💜! And I'm 😔!😁,
"As of Friday April 14th at 1:30 p.m., the app won't update because it's telling me that my device is offline. This is absolutely not the case. All other apps on my phone are working fine.",
It's too rigid and lacks basic features like Back navigation and the search icon is hard to find.,
"Excellent journalism, rag sheet app. Also doesn't work on tablets (only portrait mode) after all this time.",
Altogether solidly good. Some functions and some content are not intuitively accessible.,
"Simply great writing and reporting on a variety of topics spanning politics, culture, health and wellness, and entertainment.NPR, my favorite way to consume news media.",
"Ugh... consistently, I'll get a notification about some story, click on the story, and the story In interested in is nowhere among what opened.",
"STOP WITH THE POPUPS PROMPTING ME TO USE YOUR APP. I installed this just to say I will never use your garbage app no matter how many times you prompt me, and I will cancel my subscription if this doesn't stop",
As a retiree the NYT keeps my brain cells healthy and sparks interesting conversations. I am grateful for all of the talent and dedication it takes to bring the world to me. Thank you,
"Greedy, want subscription fee which I paid like all my site's a pay, but NY Times wants subscribers to also few full page ads too. No thanks. Bought into $1 week sale, which after a year goes to $6, but you don't get ad free on their android app. Greedy. Fortunately viewing subscription with the right ad blockers work great. I went ahead canceled after two days, and use month longer. Then back to ad blocking browsers. Yet NY Times to cheap to pay for verification checkmark on Twitter",
"The app worked perfectly until the update 2 days ago. Now the pictures won't load, either in the news feed or when you read individual articles. If you click on a pic, it will show, but when you go back to the article, it still won't show. The interactive articles don't work either. Using a Samsung Galaxy 7",
"No night mode, terrible reading articles. Cluttered ""home page"". I prefer just content with headlines, simple summaries where I can expand to bigger articles. This is just clutter, trying to look like a classic newspaper but that doesn't work on a phone. And if I wanted a newspaper, I would have bought one.",
Fine reporting on what I choose to read. Sports report excellent also.,
"After seeing several articles that I can only describe as fake news/ propaganda, I decided I want to cancel my subscription. There are only two ways to do so, either make an international call or use the in app chat. The chat system simply doesn't work. The messages sent by the other person can't be seen because they're hidden behind the keyboard. After minimising the keyboard there is then no way to get it back again. Tldr they have made cancelling your subscription as difficult as possible",
"Quality journalism at its finest. As an Australian who maintains a keen interest in American current affairs, the New York Times is an absolute essential.",
Ads on paid account are a no for me. I'll go back to read it on Brave browser on mobile which embeds ad blockers.,
Came here for the podcasts but they are nowhere to be found. Please add a tab for audio/video.,
"Disappointed. Very hassle to cancel the subscription. There are 3 ways to unsubscribe yet none of the methods are done digitally. They should have posted it in the first place before subscribing to the NYT app about the laborious effort in order for you to cancel subscription. Nonetheless I appreciated the content, it's very informative, relevant and reliable. There are only times that the app crashes. But, overall, I don't think I would recommend this app to others. Very disappointing.",
I learn a lot of new information browsing the NYT app. It's nice to be able to semi keep up with current events.,
Easy to use. World-class content.,
"Difficult to cancel the subscription! Decided to try the subscription-based membership in belief that it would be as easy to cancel as literally every other subscription I have ever tried. Ended up not using the app enough for it to be worth paying for and decided to cancel my subscription. Turns out that I have to call or start a chat during (US) office hours, being in a very different time zone I have not yet managed to cancel my subscription. Very disappointed.",
I am an avid reader and find great coverage across viewpoints. Thank you for quality writing and keeping me informed.,
we are print subscribers and entitled to online access. For some reason we keep being denied online access.,
I'm taking away a star bc I can't paste a URL into the search for articles (which is also buried) and my browser keeps losing the login.,
"Definitely needs a ""listen to article"" feature and a scrolling bar to indicate how far an article extends.",
"This rating is purely for the app, and not reflective of the quality of journalism that the New York Times offers, which is top notch. No questions. The app has several annoying flaws, such as the irregular sending of notifications (sometimes, I will not get them for several days at a time) as well as the very high battery usage, even when the app is not in use (Android will routinely send me prompts informing me, that this app is draining my battery)",
"Normally I would rate this app more stars but there seems to be a severe problem with the notifications! If I receive them at all they all appear at once and when I want to read the different headlines they all become the same. Urgent headlines or morning updates don't show up at all or at once. Don't know if that's a problem specific with Android, but I would really appreciate it if that would be fixed!",
"The only thing I don't like about the app is that when I click on an article from my notifications, if the NYT app is already open it just takes me back to the article I was already reading instead of the new article. Then the notification disappears so I have to remember what it said so I can search for the article. However, I have an older Android phone so I'm not going to place all the blame on the app. Other than this one complaint I find the app very easy to use.",
some of the best parts of the day are reading The Times,
"I was pleased with how reading articles via the app was a better reading experience than the website on Android. However, as a paying digital subscriber, the inclusion of advertising in their in-app videos concerned me. An inquiry via email to customer service acknowledged that advertising to paid digital subscribers is standard practice. I wanted to cancel my subscription as a result, but discovered their website does not allow for easy cancellation and asks you to call them to cancel. I live in Australia so this is not only a tedious request, it is actually a challenge and not a free call. My email request to customer service to cancel has been ignored. This is reminiscent of trying to cancel service with Verizon or Comcast. What a shame, as I did enjoy the app experience and love the journalism.",
"The access is great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because every time I open the app it tries to get me to play games, and that's not what I want the app for.",
very informative and worth updates and coverage of USA and world,
"Excellent newspaper and reporting. Recent digital subscription price hikes, however, are excessively high.",
NYT won't recognize when you subscribe via Google play.,
"App is good, but NYT a little too biased toward giving right-wing sensationalism a megaphone, with poorer coverage of current US administration successes and R congress failures.",
"Update: with version 10.9.0 ability to adjust text size has been restored to the UI. However, maximum text size is smaller than previously obtainable before removing and then restoring this feature. ------------------------- Inability to adjust text size has not been restored with latest update. Reaching out to android@nytimes (address provided here for feedback and questions) does not receive a response...nor does it here. Sounds of silence on this issue.",
Ads? No thanks. I'm paying for a subscription. With paid subscription there should be No ads. Good bye NYT App.,
The only publication I trust in a great app.,
Fantastic article about a wonderful President and man.,
"The most basic possible app. The content is good but the app is just a container for the website. You get a 3 categories menu in the bottom... And that's it. The Sections category is a scrolling mess without rhyme or reason where the newspaper's sections are mixed with your saved articles, recent reads, deals etc.. I would at least expect from a reading app to save my reading position in the article and allow me fast access to articles I've been reading.",
Horrible. I have a nyt subscription for years now every time I try to read an article it cuts me off and goes to subscription.,
Absolute garbage. Links in articles take you out to a browser and there is no search feature.,
"Great content, horrific app. You can subscribe through the app, but don't expect to actually get any benefits. It won't sync subscription my NYTimes account, so it's only useful on the single device for a while. Google says it's paid, NYTimes says they don't see any charge. Fun way to spend money, if you enjoy gambling.",
"It continuously froze up my older Android phone when I tried to actually read stories instead of browsing headlines. When I only browsed headlines, it drained my battery in an hour, faster than any other app I used. On a new Pixel 3a, it stops loading the article when I am half way through reading it, despite being logged in. I am 10 months into a very expensive full year subscription, and have NEVER been able to take advantage of it.",
"Love the access to wonderful, thought provoking articles as well as cutting edge news.",
"Really like the app except for one thing. If you tap on a picture on an article it is difficult to escape back to the article. Your phone's Back button is disabled, you have to use an arrow in the top left of the screen, and you often have to tap that space five or a dozen times to return as it disappears and reappears as if taunting you.",
Sometimes logs me out and loses my game progress,
"I have never installed the app. I'm just FED UP with the website continuously asking me to install the app for better reading experience, every time i open an article. It's truly annoying and most of the times the article is blocked until unless i close and reopen chrome. Moreover even sometimes when you click on ""no thanks, I'll read here"", it still goes to Google store. A ""genius"", the person who thought this annoying feature would actually push people to download the app.",
Hard to Navigate and email Content to Editors.,
why cant this app display in dark theme properly? this is a consistent problem,
"Frustrating app. The notifications don't work. A quick tip: If I press on a notification, it's because I want to read that specific article. Not because I want to be taken to your home screen to try and find it myself. I get that it's probably to keep you in the app longer, but it's inconsiderate enough of my time that I'm just uninstalling.",
"The low rating is for the app itself, not the quality of the reporting. The crossword mini is almost alwaya broken. Meaning, the keyboard does not appear fully on the screen. Also, I would like an ability to hide parts from my feed. I don't care to see recipes, for example.",
"When I go to article in push notification it doesn't take me to the actual article, so I have to hunt it down every time. I've submitted feedback multiple times and it still hasn't gotten fixed over quite some time. It's not always easy to find the given article out of everything showing up in the search, making this an annoyance when I simply want to go straight to the article.",
"This app does not work well, even on a Google Pixel. Pages take a very long time to load, and more recently, don't load at all. This is on a standard LTE connection. The only reason I pay for the NYT is so that I can easily read the news on my phone. But what's the point in paying for a subscription when the app barely works?",
"5/18/2021 update: even worse than it was in 2019. This app has gotten progressively worse at its sole value prop: load news articles. The app consistently gets confused in between interruptions of service and/or at random: it then will not load offline content that has already been downloaded to my device. It's unclear if this is due to ad content preventing the app from 'finishing' a page load or if it's just a bug, but it's progressively gotten worse over the past few years. Fix your app.",
"Notifications are wonky lately. I keep getting the same ones over and over even after clearing them. One day, no matter which notification I clicked on to expand, it opened the same (different) story, over and over. Please fix this so I don't have to turn off notifications!",
"Simple, well-designed layout, but fails in the user experience. Scrolling through the ""Today"" feed of articles is a major chore because the app doesn't load the ads before the ad space enters your screen. Then, when the ad is loaded, any content around the ad is jostled about to fit around the now-known dimensions of the ad. Similarly, the ""Today"" feed goes entirely blank for a quick second every time I return to it, making me lose my place − even if I had only been away for 2min.",
An embedded dictionary will be a good feature.,
"Too frustrating to use longer than 10 minutes. The app continually reloaded stories while I was reading, and I am a paid subscriber. I could get nowhere on these articles because I always had to try to find my place again, and sometimes while scrolling down the article reloaded back to the top again. Too frustrating to use longer than 10 minutes.",
I love the content but the app is a bit buggy. Whenever you click an article in the notification window it shows the most recent one in your feed rather than scrolling to the article you've clicked on. Not an issue if you read the article right away but definitely an issue if you wait a few hours to read the article.,
Great content on an easy to read platform. A pretty well designed app. The search could be more accessible and I feel like the curation of the headlines could be better adjusted based on the reader's history. It can be a bit homogenous. Other than that I have no complaints.,
great read. historical and current. each of us can encourage a child or adult to read.,
"Fantastic essay on Shakespeare! He put all of my own thoughts, and feelings, into words.",
"When clicking on notifications, between 30-50% of the time, the article I want to see fails to load and I get the front page of the app. Then, when I go to hunt for the article I wanted to read, I cannot find it in my tabs. Other than that though, great app. Please make Night Mode a standard feature and make it AMOLED black, not grey.",
"The app is flawed and dysfunctional. The advantages, you have when you log in by computer, are gone while using it on the phone, which makes the entire stuff useless. Please, take it into consideration, and make necessary adjustments regarding the problems the application has got. Thanks in advance!",
"Very bad app. When I try to read a NYT article posted on FB, the app is not working, it shows only a blank screen. I have to go to the app and search the title of the article and so on. Very disappointed never thought a giant like NYTimes could offer such a low quality app. Do not install!",
This app used to work flawlessly but in the last 6 months it's become increasingly broken. Articles crash and reload seemingly randomly. I believe it's because the ads now have so many graphics and animations that it crashes the app. As a paying nyt subscriber and a 3 year old phone I should be able to read simple news articles.,
"I have a Galaxy 7 Edge and have been experiencing the same problems that many of the other commentators have noted. I also have found that the ap is very slow to refresh. Just 5 minutes ago, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I still cannot download the comments in the top stories column. Another issue--the ads interrupt the reading of an article by suddenly downloading and inserting themselves right between the lines! Unacceptable for something that I am paying for.",
"the app is doing pretty good job in helping me reading the articles I would in the print version. I cannot give it a five star because of (1) dark theme disappeared causing eye strain, (2) device screen does not rotate to horizontal, and (3) the search is pretty bad, totally irrelevant; much easier to google an article, then read it on the app, than to search in the app.",
I love the NY TIMES! Thank-you all for all your great work. 📰,
All the news! Great editorials.,
"The app used to be fine, but has become a buggy mess. It's not possible to get through an article without some sort of issue with scrolling, or getting kicked back to the main page during ""updating"". I will be trying to use the mobile site until the app is fixed. I'm very disappointed.",
"Something is wrong with deeplinks! When I tap on a link from a notification or from Facebook it almost never takes me to the article. Pretty frustrating, especially since the app also lacks search functionality so I just have to scroll around and hope I find the article I was looking for. Huge bummer because the app has lots of content I want to read :(",
"Relatively easy to move from story to story, but I frequently receive notifications for new stories where, if I click on the notification, I am not taken to the story but rather to a front page. It's almost as if news updates we're being pushed to notifications but we're not being pushed to the app itself.",
"great information, all the time!",
NYT combines so much for us all to absorb in our own fashion and leisure. Wonderful to receive such insight ...,
"It tutns out I just needed some Tech support, and I got it. This app is fine!",
"Love the app and I gladly pay to support journalism today. Notes: 1) I do feel like I get signed out a lot more than other apps. 2) Please open up the audio features in beta. Accessibility via screen readers is disabled due to subscriber content flags. And if Google can't read it to me, and the NYTimes audio feature is behind a beta-wall... I don't have many options besides toggling over to my Washington Post app. (I happily support both of you.)",
"A year later from my last review - STILL NO DARK THEME! Why doesn't this have a dark theme? WHERE IS THE DARK THEME? IT REALLY NEEDS A DARK THEME! It's also hard to find stories mentioned in the notifications. I like the New York Times, I love the content and the opinion pieces, but it's literally the ONLY app in my phone that doesn't have some kind of a night mode / dark theme and as such, it's glaringly hard to read. As a result, I barely use it, preferring the WaPo and news aggregator apps.",
Use everyday. I would really appreciate it if you could swipe between articles. Would be much more user friendly. UPDATED: I have since started using the WaPo app and it is far superior to the NYT app. The NYT app continues to suffer by forcing a content-reload every time you navigate back to the Home page. It still lacks the ability to swipe through articles - which the WaPo app has. This is a real disappointment to a long-time user. I have to reduce my rating from 4 to 3 stars because of these shortcomings. It makes using the app a much more cumbersome experience.,
"While the app was fun while I used it, I requested a cancelation of the monthly subscription via email in May 2022. Based on their response to my request, they do not cancel subscriptions via email. I didn't catch that, so I was charged monthly until I just noticed it today, April 2023. When I talked to a live person, they canceled and refunded the current charge but not the past 10 months. I haven't used app since the original request to cancel. Beware when canceling.",
"I'm truly sick of an app which fails and has to be restarted three or four times for each news article I attempt to read. This has been going on for months. Now it won't load articles at all. Instead, it just gives me a spinning circle after I tap an article's headline on NYT. Everything else on my Android device works properly so it's not a problem with the device or my Internet connection. Please fix this soon, or I may have to switch to Fox!",
"I signed up while they had a special. When the price doubled, I asked for it to change to digital-only because I really only do the puzzles so they charged me $81 for the month with incoming credits of $41 and $25 for the remaining 2 weeks of the cycle. I couldn't play the puzzles the next day. They refused to refund my $25 and charged me for 4 extra days of papers, so I paid $106 to not do the only thing I do...but if I sign up now I can cut that cost in half! Stay away--it isn't worth it.",
*SO* many adverts.... you could easily forget you're also paying for it,
"Note this is about the app not the news content. The app freezes and is slow even on a strong Wi-Fi. I get the newsletter by email. When I have the app, what I click in the newsletter opens in the app and is so frustrating because things get stuck in the app. So I end up uninstalling it. Opening the article in Chrome is so much better. Have installed then uninstalled the app a bunch of times now. Currently uninstalled.",
"The games frequently glitch (sometimes the loading circle never goes away or the crossword app doesn't work right). And there's no way to search, you can only view what's on the front page or have to go through Google or different sections. It also doesn't keep track of what you have already viewed correctly. Both on the front page and in ""recently viewed"". Eventually recently viewed just shows the same 5 articles but still let's you keep scrolling.",
"Update, one year later: I turn off ""auto play video,"" yet videos still auto play. Annoying.",
"Aside from the fact that it serves up news from two or three days ago and refuses to refresh, simply claiming to be ""updating with the latest news"" while doing no such thing, its refusing to update its software while at the Google Play Store, and its refusal to allow me to save any recipes in the Cooking section (despite the Wirecutter section working just fine), it's really great - not; in fact it's such a useless pile of junk to me right now on my Samsung tablet that I'm uninstalling it.",
"I prefer to read NYTimes on mobile web instead of the app... But almost every article shows a pop-up that says it's ""better with the app"", and there's no way to disable them, even for paid subscribers, and no way to even provide feedback other than here. Ugh.",
"Pos app. They Insist on logging me into my old phone and wrong email. I like to read both sides of the aisle but spent 3 hours with 2 customer service reps, the second one who hung up on me even though I was polite. WHY can they not appropriate technology trained people. I only use my tablet for very specific things and they FORCED it on that so wish me luck when I turn it on and I suggest you get the paper version because their technology sucks.",
"Bring back the section swipe function! Why in the world did you disable it? Absolutely fed up with the number and selection of ads embedded into each article. More specifically - the SAME ADS that appear every 3-4 paragraphs. This means that depending on the length of the piece, I am shown the same image 4-7-9-11 times!!! I may be interested in the topic, BUT this bombardment it torture. I've closed the app, turned off the ads, nothing fixes the problem. NYT, please fix this!!! ASAP!",
Great paper and application. Love it!,
"The recent update is a step back. Gone are the titles at the top of the main page allowing you to go to the topic of your choice. This was especially useful when you were able to select which topics were highlighted. Now, everything is together and you have to go to another screen to find the you want to...blah, blah, blah. It's a terrible update even though I still love the paper.",
"Unbelievable. This app crashes constantly and there is zero support for assistance. I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled and sent over 25 screenshots to Customer Service. I also told them to cancel my paid subscription. 3 days later I received a response asking me to convert the screenshots from png to jpeg. It takes up way too much storage space - especially since it doesn't work. A major disappointment.",
"Signed up with a deal through Play that was supposed to include the crossword. Some issue had me being charged even though I paid upfront for a year. After getting it handled through two chats and a phone call, I now don't have access to the crossword. Zero chance I'll resubscribe after dealing with this. I don't even care enough to go through contacting anyone to get it corrected. Couldn't be more disappointed with how all of this was handled",
"This app has become pointless because notifications barely function. Pressing a notification rarely even takes me to the respective story anymore. Usually it just takes me to the home page and the story is no where to be found, or has a radically different headline than the notification implied. If I get multiple NYT notifications, they'll all become bugged when I try to expand them and every notification shows the same story. If this isn't fixed soon, I'm going to unsubscribe.",
"Edit2: well call me a lier because I just got two notifications with the same problem, ughh. Edit: Fixed with latest update. Old: The text in the notification are cut off. All I see are incomplete sentences. Cut-off-notification messages doesn't make me want to click it and find out more, it makes me want to uninstall the app.",
"I love the newspaper and your in-depth coverage. Thank you. My biggest pet peeve and major irritation is the way the app constantly, constantly updates. I hate it. It would be so much better if you could allow the user the option to update when they are ready. There's nothing wrong with reading news that's a half hour old.",
A lot of content to look at. The push notification feature doesn't link to the article which is annoying. To their credit when I reported it they replied quickly that it was a known issue and will be fixed in upcoming release. The game Spelling Bee puzzle part only let me play a few times before they shut me out and told me I needed the puzzle app??,
I am disappointed the latest update removed the widget without any warning in the release notes. The FAQ inside the app still refers to the widgets being available. I do not want emails or notifications. The widget was unobtrusive and allowed me to decide what I wanted to read quickly and efficiently. I am going to cancel my digital subscription as the app is useless to me now.,
"What is infuriating about this app is that it will push a notification of a story that seems really interesting and when selected the story seen is something else altogether and the highlighted story is impossible to locate. And trying to search for it? Good luck finding the search, assuming you remember a keyword to use from the notification and you're lucky enough to find out how to search. Trained me to ignore story notifications.",
"SO MANY ADS!! literally every 3 paragraphs there's a giant half screen ad. REALLY annoying. I'd accept it in a free ap, but when I'm paying a monthly fee, I expect not to have every article loaded full of ads like it's Buzzfeed or something. also, I was excited for dark mode, but it doesn't work on ads, they're all on bright white backgrounds, so scrolling through articles you get blinded by an ad every 3 paragraphs...not cool",
"Unable to find the NYT newsletters I follow very easily on the (if at all) on the app, which is related to the fact that the search capabilities are not great. All in all, the UX is decent but could be improved very much so to better cater to the interests of the end user imo",
"The new feature in the mobile app is pathetic. Instead of reading from the top, the app now forces you to start at the top each time you close an article, no matter how far you may have advanced.. this technique is also deployed by ESPN and Abc news. While it can be overridden on a browser, the app limits options to zero. Espn and Abc probably implement this feature for ad revenue purposes. I don't quite see what benefits the NYTimes gets from this feature other than making people unhappy.",
The content is very good however you will expect better App from such a big news organisation. Few things which annoy me: * You click on the notification to open an article but after a second the App reload and your article is gone * Difficult access to saved for latter articles * In big multi story articles or one with some animations scrolling become hectic - the page jumps up and down randomly and it is very difficult to read.,
"It's buggy and unintuitive. The search function is buried in the ""Sections"" tab. Older notifications don't actually open the article on the notification - they open the app to the homepage. Sometimes a notification opens the last article viewed instead of the article on the notification. Using the notifications for anything is often useless.",
"The journalism from NYTimes is worth paying for. From the topics to the beautiful figures and photos, to their way of writing... it's immersive and transparent with clear data sources. Their own invasive ads, however, ruin the experience. The journalism here is quality over quantity, focusing on important or interesting topics from a unique perspective and going deep in the research. If only ads were less frequent, and wouldn't occupy so much space within an article; their self-sabotage is sad.",
Unable to stop news notifications: uninstalled this app.,
"This app (released in 2010) is buggier than most swamps. I am Alpha testing a game written by two young guys that has fewer serious bugs. Twice in last year when I have reported articles are not loading, the ""fix"" is an unin/reinstall. Then I start being annoyed by notifications, because I forgot I need to go back and redo setting. Just now, an article I was reading went black for 5-10 seconds and the app threw me back to the original home screen. Pathetic for an app that charges subscription $$$",
App doesn't function well. Anytime I click on a headline notification it takes me to the app but never the article I clicked on. Same story when I try to launch through Facebook. It then doesn't bring up the content I wanted to read when I search for it either. Oh and if you click on one headline notification about 15 more all happen at once.,
"I want to like this app more, but there are some persistent issues: -Invisible location marker on the right scroll bar, thereby making it difficult to prejudice how long articles are or how much remains. This is a nuisance. -No dark mode, as others note in these reviews. I realize the NYT is working on these issues, but it's frustrating to see in a newspaper of this stature. The Washington Post has figured out these issues.",
"I absolutely love the coverage. However, the app is a buggy mess right now. Articles only load halfway if they load at all, freezing occurs frequently, it murders my battery life, everything everyone else has said. This is absolutely not an acceptable state for an app to be in. For reference I'm running an LG G7 ThinQ on Verizon's latest version of Android. Please fix this!",
the app used to present the news in a very simple interface. The new version is much like the website home page. I find the screen display now way too busy for a tablet. articles are all over the place. The new version also crashes constantly. I've reinstalled it twice with no change.,
The app no longer has a share button in it. So I can't get web address of articles to email or save to Pocket. I am dyslexic & cannot read serif fonts at all. So this app is now rendering my subscription to the publication worthless as it is completely unusable. If I try to read an article from the web in any browser the app launches &redirects me to it. Links from other articles in any browser go to this app instead of remaining in the browser. So this app is as useful as a bluescreen of death.,
"Their app is annoying. If I'm reading an article from Google News, sometimes it will authenticate my subscription, most times it won't. I lose interest if I have to copy and paste an article URL from News to the app or the web. Cancellation is an option. I feel the monthly fee would be better spent on the Atlantic.",
"THE standard in news. Been reading this paper for years. The comments section also sets the bar high. Well moderated. Erudite posters. I would give it five stars if the app was more reliable. Sometimes good, sometimes not. Other reviewers cancel their subscriptions when the app fails. Seriously? Go read the paper via the mobile website for a while, then come back in a while if you choose. There is no better newspaper. (""paper"". Haha!)",
"After subscribing, whenever I opened the app and clicked on an article, a message popped up that I needed to subscribe. Couldn't read the articles. Tried to cancel through NYT, but they said I didn't have an account and I'd have to cancel through Google Play. Google Play said I had to cancel through NYT. Seriously? Finally was able to cancel, but this was way too complicated. I'll read The Wall Street Journal.",
"Update Sep 14, 2020 - They broke dark mode again. Last time, the issue was resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. This time, no such luck. Update Sep 1, 2020 - They broke dark mode last night. The letters are too dim to read. -- Original review: Near-constant freezes and crashes on my Galaxy Tab S3. Seems to be due to ads. The app has become almost unusable since the last update. I'm seriously considering canceling my subscription since I can't read any article in its entirety.",
Best coverage of world news and fascinating human interest stories. And the games!,
"The apple version is so much better than the Android. Rotating phone often sets it back to the top of the queue. Videos won't play consistently. Now the latest version won't let me play crosswords, as it cuts off the bottom row of letters on the keyboard. Frustrating.",
"Quality of news and reporting as usual is excellent. Prior to this update the app worked great. Now, when I return to the main page after reading an article it scrolls to the top and I have to find my place again AND there is no night mode. Fix the bug and bring back night mode!",
"Best source of news there is, imo.",
"This app logs me out everytime I close it (sometimes even while I'm using it). It's hard to navigate and honestly not worth having if you have a subscription and can just get the same content online without all the hassle. It seems like an easy enough thing to fix, and you would think a company of this size would have the means to just fix it",
"It was fine until this recent ""upgrade."" The top had the sections to scroll across. Now gone and replaced by section bar at bottom right. Not an improvement. Plus the app got slower and loads poorly. The notification never takes you to the story, just to the front page. Great newspaper, lousy app.",
"Props are due! NYT is clearly game for the challenge of integrating traditional newspaper strengths — good old shoe-leather reporting and consistently exceptional editorial work — with new media formats. Some experiments have worked better than others, but that's a small price to pay to chart a course where no one's been been before. The NYT app is slick, its navigation intuitive and some clever tech makes segues between, or combinations of, seemingly disparate elements seamless and natural.",
"In the last few weeks, the app performance has been consistently getting worse. Now I'm unable to finish reading a single article without the app freezing and crashing. Reading the NYT via app has been getting discouraging, first with the dark mode getting removed and now the constant technical issues.",
Callaway built unique performance Corvettes. I've had the pleasure of having driven. R.I.P. life well lived.,
I enjoy nytimes but taking away even the glitchy night mode and not replacing it makes no sense. I read it most commonly in the am and the lack of this feature makes the whole app feel quite dated. Also while the design is simplistic is hides a lot of good articles buried in it's sections and selectively filters out what they think is important,
"Click Bait Alert! It's a *terrible* app. It teases you all day long with notification headlines. But when you click on the notification, it throws you right into the general app, and not the story. This forces you do scroll down indefinitely, looking for that juicy story, but you'll rarely find it, because it would rather have you get hooked on their other stories, instead of the one it had you click for. #clickBait",
"Too many ads for a subscription app. There are so many, and they are all so distracting - movement, color changes, videos - it's impossible to Simply read the news without mistakenly clicking on an ad while trying to scroll only to find yourself launched into some hideous offer you have no interest in. I frequently consider discontinuing my subscription because of the ads. Finally, the read offline option is spotty at best because the app pauses, times out, and crashes if it can't DL ads and pho",
"The app used to be reasonably navigable with section headings across the top that you could scroll through. They've just eliminated that and now one is left clunkily going to a side menu to find the sections of the paper or having to scroll through a ""for you"" section. I just want all the news, not news customized for me. An ""upgrade"" asked for by no one. Totally disappointing.",
the Times is an essential read every day,
I find the NYT so informative on such a broad array of topics that I can enjoy every day. There's always something new to learn.,
I support the NY Times and am happy to invest in a digital paper but this app is simply awful on my device. It lags on load each time I open it and prompts a crash report. I'm not sure how such a simple app can consume so much memory as to cause this type of instability. Improve the QA and I'll keep subscribing.,
"Scrolling is broken. You're supposed to be able to to quickly scroll a page and stop the scroll with a quick tap. Try this in any other Android application. But in NY Times app, it's constantly clicking me into articles I don't want to read because it interprets the tap that I use to stop the scroll as a tap-to-click. Makes this app very annoying to use.",
I enjoy the well written articles and love the games!,
I love reading their articles each morning.,
"Terrible app. You've been taking away capabilities to the line where the app is utterly useless. No search function, I go to an opinion writer's page and before I can click on a piece an ad pops up in front that I can't close. Sometimes there's a share button, sometimes not. DO YOU NOT LIKE HAPPY READERS AND FREE PUBLICITY? Deleting this trash app. The website is better (and for journalism WaPo is better anyway tbh).",
"One of the most trusted news sources in the US that's been around for decades. Clean interface, easy to use, well-written articles, and appropriate ""breaking news"" notifications that can optionally be turned off. I had a problem with the Share button and after weeks of ignoring it, I finally emailed support. I got a reply the next day and it was fixed two days later. Well done. This is my favorite news app.",
"Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
"Very useful app and wonderfully presented content. However, the spelling bee sub-app is wonky. Too often it streams the last letter until I exit back to the hub or top stories and then come back in, when it happens again. Seems to be more often of late. Not too long ago I knew I was safe when the loader spinner got stuck. A visual nuisance but I would not have letter repeats for the duration of spelling bee. Just where is bug tracking? Latest install of Times app on up-to-date Android.",
"This new version is terrible. After I installed the update, it could no longer recognize that I was online. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I tried hard and soft resets of my tablet. Nothing changed. Each time I start the app, it gives me a message saying device offline, please connect to the internet. I've written numerous emails to the tech staff there. I have a Samsung nook tablet. If you have had this same problem with your device, please post your experience. Thanks.",
"The app nagged me to subscribe, even though I was logged in to my NYT account, which is still billing me for a subscription. Silly me trusted it and renewed my subscription though the app anyhow, and it charged me through Google Play. There doesn't seem to be a way to reverse that, though. The NYT customer care said they can't do anything because they can't find that charge, and they're refusing to help me sort this out. My advice: don't subscribe through the app; it'll rip you off.",
"Was working fine until shortly after the latest update on April 2. Since then, it's become buggy for me. Can access content on 4-5 stories; after that no story content, only reader comments. Cleared cache/data, uninstalled/reinstalled, checked permissions, data & wifi access. A world-class paper needs a commensurate app, or at least one that doesn't fail. Please fix!",
I'm a NY Times subscriber and used to love this app. But in my opinion both it and the NYT website have gotten progressively worse over the last 6 months. I'm particularly disappointed that they've recently eliminated the bookmark function that allowed saving an article for later reading without having to open it.,
"New update lacks night/dark mode. Also irritatingly jumps back to the very top of the main page when you finish an article, this requiring you to scroll all the way back down to where you left off. Update seems to have worsened the app--i found it easier to use and more versatile before.",
"worked great till 12/13/18 update; Top News does not load. Still love the tech and Sundays msg sections. Wish they would re-enable the text to speech, was great for the car. Nite mode is great. 6/5/22 - I was told over a month ago that the entire app would fully load when you sent it to the once a day. It's still not happening.",
The app's night mode was working really fine . Not sure what happened suddenly. I am now unable to have a good reading experience using the night mode. Now the white text against the black backdrop has now been replaced by a very washed out and an unclear dull greyish text. Is there a way to fix this problem,
Podcast fail in android auto! It does not remember your place in the podcast. There is no ability to get back to where you were except to listen to the entire thing again. No skip forward or backward except to go to the next or previous episode. Very poorly designed. Impossible to use.,
"In general, the NYT mobile app is consistent and good in both function and navigability. The cons: NYT via a desktop browser such as Chrome offers demarcated categories the mobile app doesn't, most notably the World section. Via desktop browser, sub-categories of World news are offered, i.e. Asia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, South America, etc. Whereas on the NYT mobile app, it's just World general and the end user can miss a lot of articles that aren't as readily apparent in the demarcations.",
"I tried to submit app feedback through the app but it wouldn't let me. So I guess my complaints will now be public which could have been avoided. Double notifications for the same article happen often. Even more often is two different articles I get notifications for will change when I open them. If I get a trump notice and a sports notice, clicking one will often lead to the other instead. Love the app and the nyt but for how much money you have, fix your consistent bugs.",
"Updated, hoping it would fix the random crashes- now the app doesnt function at all, just opens a blank black screen and hangs there. Reliably an awful app to have to read the NYTimes through before, it is now literally unusable. Good job guys. Edit: entirely uninstalling and reinstalling the app got it to work again.",
"This app kind of sucks. I get notifications for breaking news stories. When I tap on the notification to read the story it's no where to be found. I scroll down the entire list and can't find it anywhere. Then they limit how many articles you can read if you don't pay for a subscription. Sorry, not paying for this pos app. Unistalled this one. Bye bye NYT",
"Downloaded the app and compared to my girlfriend's UI... Completely different. Very confused about why we have different interfaces. Mine sucks- it's almost to the point of one of those over simplified newsboards. Couldn't find the search bar, sections aren't easily navigable (no side bar), poorly designed. Let me choose my interface!",
"The auto-refresh the app uses makes for a very frustrating experience! After reading an article, returning to the home page gives you time for another cup of coffee, but I can only drink so much. Please let the reader decide when to refresh content... We know how apps are supposed to work.",
"This app is actually a significant downgrade from the website experience. Notifications are amateur-hour. They notify you of an interesting story, but inexplicably do not actually take you to the article it notified you about. Super frustrating experience, makes me want to actually unsubscribe to spite them. Then, once you are in the app, you can't actually search for anything (be it the article that a notification just duped you into clicking, or something else you are interested in).",
"Worst unsubscription process ever. You have to either call them or chat to a bot. Then you get passed to an agent, and mine kept me waiting after responses. Took at least 10 minutes to cancel my subscription!! App content is great, what you can expect from NYT, but can't see why they have to make the opt-out process so complicated. Hoping people don't bother and just stay subscribed? Shouldn't the content do that though...",
App is slow and buggy. Articles take 45+ seconds to load (I have fiber internet). Content constantly jumps around as I try to read it because ads are loading late. Pressing back to exit an article shows a blank screen? No way to choose favorite topics. Will probably cancel my subscription because of all the usability issues.,
"I fully support U.S. aid to Ukraine. But why is Ukraine not also following U.S. intelligence and military advice, resulting in what this and many other articles detail about limited success in the war?",
quality and independence.,
"Love the app and the journalism is second to none but when I wanted to cancel the subscription (a seasonal thing for me) I could not do it online. I had to call a toll free number and speak to two people at the Times, the second of which was persistent. Twenty minutes later that sweet taste of loving the app and journalism style turned bitter. Now I have to look for a new ""go to"" app for my news come next Spring.",
I'd rather pay more to a small farm than to suport this or else stop eating pork!,
I love the variety and honesty in this publication! The ads are not a problem. The satisfaction is worth it,
"The app makes playing the games impossible. The mini crossword has a ""subscribe here"" banner across the whole bottom covering 2 rows of the keyboard. Worst part about that is that I already did subscribe. The Vertex game is also super buggy, I can't connect lines from top to bottom because it keeps thinking I'm refreshing the screen. At least it can play the tiles game cleanly.",
"I just subscribed to NYT and was so excited to see this on my phone, but its messing up my phone big time. Screen freezing, then black, then colored dots dancing on the screen. What? Where is quality control? Testing? Anything? Im uninstalling - at least the mobile app. This needs to be sorted.",
"As a paid service, it's lack-luster in a few key ways. For starters, if you're going to suggest an article in my notification bar, the application should open to the article you suggested when I click on the notification. Secondarily, the fact to opinion ratio of these articles prompts me to believe the New York Times is info-tainment profitting primarily from subjective takes on abstracted concepts rather than providing ""the news."" Lastly, we should have the ability to ""pin"" live updates.",
"Well worth the small fee. No bells and whistles, just straight forward great journalism. EDIT: (6 months into this) Bummed that my subscription went from $4/mth to $17/mth with no warning. 8 payed for subscription to support The Daily but I hardly listen anymore and $17/mth has no value for me. Edit 3/23/2023 I'm deleting the app and changing my review from 5 stars to 2. I'm a regular subscriber, but for some reason, every time I open the app, I'm prompted to pay for a subscription.",
"V. 9.1.3 for my fire 8 tablet, modded for Play Store, is an epic fail. Seems like the developers for nyt have no clue about how humans actually want to read a newspaper, or how to program an app. The section tabs at the upper left are now gone, and moved to the bottom, and these are less than useful, and require an extra step to access content. The ""For You"" feature at bottom of screen should actually named ""F#@% You"" for all its usefulness. Version 9.1.2 was much better, and easier to navigate",
"My sister's husband had FTD and recently passed away. He was 62. Your article compassionately shone a light on the hardships the family faces, especially the children. Thank you. I am unable to find the words to describe what her family endured. I'm in awe of my sister. As the caregiver and mother of 3 children, she deserves to be recognized as almost super human.",
"Great overall journalism, especially in a difficult time. Please continue to investigate and share your stories, perhaps written without the ting of sounding left leaning. We know where we stand political already. I'd prefer the facts only without the paper looking as of it's taking a side politically. Please continue to share information about technology, health, science and other topics. I love to know what's happening all of the world. The NYT is about the only paper that provides all this.",
"The app is great. I was exposed to the print version of the NYT since 1966. Of recent late 2016, some articles have been written that give me pause. I mean by this that they have an obvious slant which I do not agree is fair and balanced. It had a higher rating when I grew up. Not sure if it is editors or ownership, but this newspaper is not my trusted source for news. It is better than most.",
Introspective reaching into history which is our future. Only through the truth will we learn and move forward.,
"The new update has made the app almost unusable. It's constantly refreshing and fails to load articles. I'd also like to be shown a few videos, magazine articles and international news on the first page. The managers of the app should understand that app users don't want a replica of the print newspaper. I find far more recommendations for NYT videos on YouTube than the app.",
Ads when subscribed.. No thanks ill use a browser.,
"Sadly the app doesn't do justice to the content. Sometimes sluggish, often freezes. The removal of page swiping was a retrograde step. Impossible to subscribe to newsletters as too much of the sign up dialog box is off screen. An increasing number of distracting animated ads is ruining the reading experience.",
"Absolute garbage ""news"". After dealing with it for a week, 90% of the breaking news notifications that popped up on my phone were trash talk about President Trump. This is not only shameful for an organization of your stature, NYT, but a complete disregard for actual news that has a relevant effect on American's lives. Disappointing. On a side note, the app functionality and asthetics are great, which isn't that big of an accomplishment. Still probably more news worthy than what you publish.",
"Because of character limitations I'll just list the issues out. 1. Notifications come through email and app. No option for one it the other. 2. Notification links don't link to actual stories. Most link to a landing page, leaving you to find the article you're looking for (often under a different title) 3. Stories aren't sharable. Share links point to ""top level"" articles, so once the story you share is no longer the most recent, it is no longer the story that gets shared.",
"Excellent writing, news coverage, features and photography merged with use of dynamic online visual aids, such as interactive data charts and maps. Then bringing a story to life with exceptional photography from all over the world placed behind the storyline as it moves for greater effectiveness. I believe NYT has developed an unfolding multi-dimensional online creative experience way beyond newspaper print. Bravo!!",
"Reliable reporting with well-documented sources and links to corroborating stories. Fun word games, too!",
"I wanted to subscribe for 1 year, but all subscriptions automatically renew unless I remember to cancel. That is an obvious money grab in which the NY Times is gambling that I (and other subscribers) will forget to (and even how to) cancel automatic renewal. I also noticed that this app is generally rated poorly in relation to other news apps, but I do not sense any responsiveness by the NY Times to address the issues listed, such as challenging navigation between notifications and articles...",
"Even after I sign in it doesn't allow me to read the articles and tells me to sign in. Before I use up my free articles for the month, it sometimes opens them in the app and sometimes in it's own browser (not external browser exactly but like FB has when u click on a link). I am uninstalling and using chrome so I can have my paid unlimited access.",
"STOP NAGGING US TO GET YOUR APP. It is not better! I prefer the website. It's less buggy and lets me open multiple tabs. And I do not appreciate getting a pop-up on every single article I read telling me to download the app. I say no thanks, you should respect my choice. Trying to shove it down my throat leads to one star reviews.",
"I am having a lot of issues with the notifications and the crossword. I only get some push notifications and often it will be the same notification over and over again instead of whatever news story should actually be pushed. The crossword for the past 3 days has hidden the last row of my keyboard... So if a word has z, x, c, v, b, n, or, m I can't solve it. 😥",
"App is harder to navigate than the webpage. I'm deleting the app to make sure the web experience never opens an app instead of a webpage. Hard to go back, hard to find navigation pane, hard to read. Final straw was I once clicked a link in a Google search that opened this app while reading my phone at 11pm at night. I felt like my eyes were cramping and burning with the sudden bright white wall. It hurt.",
"Almost perfect. This app is incredibly well put together providing an unlimited amount news and information resources. It has everything from the latest updates from breaking news coverage, to weekly dinner recipes, to entertainment and sports news, to one of a kind podcast. The app is so well done, I'm left wondering, is the New York Times a tech company? The only thing missing at this point is a dark mode. Without it, It makes using this app in low light conditions before bed a non-starter.",
"Horrible new version. while the removal of the side swipe between sections was annoying (and with no apparent good reason), removing all favorite sections with one huge section list (in some random order) is incomprehensible. do any of the ui designers actually use the app on a daily basis and is there any usability review? btw: saved article feature is also very buggy in the last months with some articles unremovable and other articles shiwung as black empty pages where only data wipe fixes it",
"Forced to do an update because the previous version was no longer supported. Now my top stories are interrupted by an ugly ""election 2020"" box, and my headlines widget is gone. Was happy with it before, now just annoyed. UPDATE: Wrote support about hating the blue ""election update"" box, they replied that it can't be removed. Have changed from 2 to 1 star now. Update: worse with every releaae, now hangs often when loading and sometimes ""share"" and ""save"" buttons are missing (reload article restore",
App will not allow me to write in the comments section using my Lenovo tablet. I can read them alright but can't comment.,
"The app has had trouble on and off since I began using it several years ago. After a long stretch of good functionality, it now forces me to log in every time I tap a notification, despite the fact of my tapping ""keep me logged in.""",
"Using the app on a tablet, ""may not be optimized for your device"". OK, does that mean it should crash every time it loads an ad? Because it's no exaggeration that that is what the app does... I just tried to load an article on wireless charging; 6 crashes and counting for that page alone.",
"The widget. Where is it??? Bring it back! Quite frankly, it was the most relevant and useful part of the app. Otherwise, I can just sit down in front of a computer and go to the website for the news. And no, I do not want even more notifications. If this was a mistake, I definitely hope priority is being given to fixing it as it is clearly something many of us found very useful. If this was no mistake, then NYT's app developers need to get their priorities straight.",
"Good newspaper, kinda bad app design. I've had this app for a few years now and they still have yet to implement a dark reader mode, and the app doesn't seem to work well with phones that are set to automatically switch to night mode every night--my push notifications to NYTimes become blank and cannot be read.",
"Long time NYT digital subscriber, downloaded app just to leave one star review. Prefer to read NYT in RSS feed (still working) and browser, which NYT is trying hard to break. About six weeks ago clicking on most stories on mobile browser generated a pop-up to read in app which had to be selected ""no."" About two weeks ago login cookies started clearing more quickly, requiring me to login multiple times each day to read. This must stop!! Or I will unsubscribe. I don't want the news in your app!!",
"Read the other reviews about subscription problems -- they're all true. I renewed my subscription through Google Play, but the NYTimes app cannot find the charge. I'm now paying for a premium subscription that I can't use. Spent multiple calls with both Google Play support and NYTimes, and both refuse to help me sort this out and keep playing blaming the other service for data issues.",
"This app has very poor functionality. It doesn't retain your place in a story, or sometimes the story you were reading. If you rotate the screen, it jumps to the beginning of the story when it should keep your place. Navigation is missing, if you open a story from social media, there is no way to get to the home page or any page within the app except suggested story links at the bottom of the page. The top white banner overlays my phone's notifications bar. One of the worst apps on my phone.",
"A constant stream of the best reporting anywhere on the planet. Invaluable in a time where the free press, a bedrock American principle, is being assailed at every turn. I'm a very proud subscriber. The app is excellent. The games are great brain training as well.",
Professor Loeb is trying to push science beyond its capacity. I wish him well.,
"Love the content but the app has become unbearable. Herky jerky freezes while scrolling, losing your place when ads load, Android messages saying the app has stopped responding, plus when I go back to main page after finishing an article, it scrolls back to the top. If only I could downgrade to the version from a few months ago :(",
"Every update is worse than the one before it. I'm now unable to read any articles--when I tap a headline, I just get blank space, sometimes with a clocking wheel. App causes battery to run very hot. This is an excellent publication that I want to support, but the terrible app is really making me consider unsubscribing.",
"good interface, easy to read. App doesn't crash. But I wish they would do a better job separating NYT Cooking from the regular food category. It is not included in the regular subscription, so why link cooking articles inside a regular food and dining article? I read an article to the end and I was interested in the content, but it ended abruptly with a link to a NYT Cooking recipe (recipe wasn't disclosed in regular article)",
"App stopped functioning 7/23/20. What happened? Now when I open the app, I get a blank page with a loading wheel, then a popup that says ""Device is offline. Please check your Internet connection and try again."" So the app is completely useless for me. Any popups will occasionally take me to the correct article. Otherwise it just crashes. Why am I paying for a subscription?",
"what's not to love? Fair and reasonable writing, unbiased thought and opinion. Educated, researched, vetted, thoughtful , articulate and heartfelt writing. Simply, one of the last pillars of democracy.",
"The app is great if you want a new paper app. The New York Times totally SUCKS if you're trying to cancel your subscription!!! I've been trying for 6 months now, numerous emails, and they keep charging my PayPal account while sending me placating emails saying that they are ""looking into it""! Used to love 'em, now I despise them!!! Even if I thought that I might have renewed at a later date, they've ruined all chance of that! Uninstalled, now un-freaking-subscribe me and stop taking my money!",
Great app for news but I find that sometimes the reporting is biased towards America(ns).,
This app always asks me to subscribe even though I am signed in and subscribed to all access. There is no fix if you use Google pay to subscribe,
"Well made app, extremely dynamic, great citation, and even has some opinion pieces for you Americans that like that ✌️ Edit: is there a way to turn off the status bar cover up? Super irritating. Case: you have a few spare minutes to read because you're early for something so you start reading and then have to keep pulling down from the top to keep track of time. You get engrossed in the story and are then late because you don't have your clock at the top of the screen like other apps.",
"This is really a rating for the NYTs customer service. I ordered a subscription through Google Play. OMG!  Can't login to the NYTs. It keeps asking me to subscribe even though I have a subscription. They can't figure out why. After 4 attempts, emails and calls to customer service, I'm cancelling. Too bad because the journalism is outstanding. Just inept customer service.",
"Not the worst app in the world, but the way it jumps around with touch scrolling, reloads things randomly, and loads huge sections with multiple articles and feeds, failing to smoothly just navigate to the one you're trying to read, makes this a rather difficult app to deal with when all you want to do is read the news...",
"generally ok,some of the fancy graphics freeze on my old tablet. Good reporting usually.",
"This app is becoming unusable. Articles are failing to load. I reported it, sending screenshot of an article that was blank after the first 20% and they just said clear cache. That is not fixing the issues other than slightly improving for just the next session. I am a subscriber who can't see your content, how long do you think i will stick around???",
Font size adjustment doesn't work. This is a basic accessibility feature.,
"Great app & I feel the notifications are valuable. The thing that puts me off is that if a notification is interesting and clicked, you are taken to the website, then BOOM, silly signup screen over the top of the story and you cannot view or read the story unless you create and account. No use to me as the handy notifications are effectively click-bait that I can't read unless I hand over my personal details. I'll pass, thanks. Uninstall is best.",
A luminous piece of writing. A movie review as great art.,
"The app has worked very well for the past 2-3 years. Now it's getting to the point where I don't want to open it. Headline links won't work and app constantly updates when I return to home page, makes for clunky, annoying experience!",
"The content is great, but please provide a ""text only option"" for your glossy feature articles. I just gave up trying to read ""Putin's War"" as the page jumps to a new location every time I scroll,which makes it impossible to to read. These comments apply to most other glossy articles. Please, less gloss and more focus on the written content of the article.",
"The app is really quite slow, but worse though I have selected for articles to be downloaded for offline use (as I commute through areas with poor data coverage) the app stalls as if it is trying to communicate back to some server online. It really feels like some poorly utilised analytics software, set to block article loads till it logs back to base the user experience. UX 'story', app uninstalled.",
"I really do thank the NYT for being a source I can trust, and a source I can afford while I'm in college. The app works seamlessly. Maybe a few small issues. If I've gotten a few article notifications, sometimes the one I click on isn't the one that pops on my screen. Still, I love this paper and I love the app. Thanks for the truth",
"I like the New York Times and the app. A problem with the app is that NYT notifications on my Android phone don't open up the article in the app and it is hard to find said article. Very frustrating. NYT app said they fixed this problem, but it's still not working for me.",
"An incredibly unreliable paid app that gets worse every year. The top stories stopped updating regularly about six months ago, and I'm frequently met with a blank screen that won't refresh. Reading cached content on the subway is nearly impossible. Stories refresh and start at the beginning every stop as my phone comes in and out of service range. The two stars are solely for content. Clearly nobody at the Times uses the app.",
Please fix the notifications... there is no point in sending me push notifications for articles that when clicked just take me to the homepage. I either have to save them and then remember that I saved them or search in the app for the article that I wanted to read. Useless. And if I can't use the app I'm not going to pay for the subscription.,
"I had to reinstall the app to get past the paywall AFTER I paid for a subscription. The path to subscription from the app is poor UX. I have to go to my account settings which takes me to a browser (chrome in my case). Then when I try to purchase a subscription I get bounced back to the app, where I'm asked to login (again) and logging in via Google DOES NOT WORK here. There is some sort of authentication error for this particular flow. Very frustrating considering I'm trying to GIVE YOU $$$",
"This app is kind of crappy. It freezes frequently. Sometimes content won't load, even after repeated restarts. When I tried to cancel my subscription, the NYT agent took 20 mins locating my account, and when I asked to speak with a supervisor, he told me it wasn't NYT and that I should contact Google. I called Google and they had nothing on their end. Called NYT again, and finally the rep found my account. An hour of needless hassle.Save yourself the grief and don't get the app or subscription.",
"Around 80% of notifications say one thing and then a different headline once expanded in the notification bar. They also all appear at once. However breaking news alerts are chosen is a mystery to me. NYT Cooking should be in the same app, and account management should be more robust within the app. Loading could be smoother.",
"I keep getting the message ""The app has expired"" even after I have updated the app and the icon changes to a green color with the words ""Beta"" on it. I have to uninstall it completely and then reinstall. After that it works for a day or two and the story repeats",
"What the heck happened??? This was a really great app, one that I would use several times per day. I am a suscriber, but very recently, within the last week (April 22 on) this app has become terrible. The articles wont load, and I have tried everything including uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. Please someone fix whatever is going on. I need my news.",
"NOTE: Google Pixel 2s: if you see dark dark grey text on a black backdrop (as opposed to the usual white backdrop), uninstall and reinstall the app. Worked for me. Great app, works well, solid design. Don't like that I get ads but they're not too intrusive. Would prefer if they posted less garbage Tom Cotton OpEds lmao.",
I rate this app very low because of the non-existence of any audio to help visually impaired people. The Washington Post has an excellent app where many of the top news stories conclude audio. I've been waiting almost 2 years for New York Times to come up with something similar,
Android version app does not run well on Google Pixelbook. Stories display wih missing characters. Not sure who to contact - Google or NYT. Works fine on my Pixel phone. Reads fine using browser. Needs a fix. Not sure how long this has been going on but for several weeks - previously worked fine since I started with the Pixelbook a year or so ago.,
"Great reporting horribly delivered. The quality of the articles is great, but the delivery is an exercise in frustration-at least on the Android app. As others have mentioned clicking on a notification frequently takes the user to either the wrong article, or the main page. The search functionality is also broken.",
"The Android app crashes very frequently to the point of being useless. This problem has persisted for months now and despite my regular feedback on the app's performance (or lack thereof) the only response so far was to empty the app's cache and, if that doesn't work, uninstall the app entirely. Which I now have do regularly to be able to use the app at all. It's honestly hard for me to imagine how this app could possibly be any worse; any developments bringing the app closer to approaching mediocrity would have to be considered a success for their (paying) customers at this point.",
"I can't believe I actually pay the NYT to use this app. Make it work properly! I can't even open an article without having to relaunch on a regular basis. Haven't you figured out these simple actions by now. There have been bugs with the app and website for years. I'm ready to cancel my subscription. I also use the Washington Post app, and it works flawlessly, it can be done!",
"So many, so MANY ADDS in this app! Though I love the NYT, the content, the format, the length of the articles, and I am subscriber, this app makes it extremely difficult to read an article on the phone! They even push more than one visible add into one screen of text! I object and refuse reading a screen of text which can fit TWO adds! I want to read the news, the analysis, the reviews, the obituaries, NOT the adds! UNINSTALL! PS. I am not a serial complainer, this is my first 1 star review...",
"The app experience is nice. However, why does it use so much background data? 15 days into my monthly billing cycle it's used 400MB of background data! For any app and especially a news app this is ridiculous. This is a problem for me since I don't have an unlimited plan. For comparison the WSJ app has used 6MB of background data in the same timespan. I've turned off background data on the app for now so I hope it doesn't adversely affect the experience.",
"I have uninstalled this app & review is to warn others to find another news source. My apps update automatically which as many other reviews attest to, the May update was the death knell for The NYT. If, the breaking news push notification actually linked me with the corresponding article, I was suddenly greated with a new block of subscription options?????? After weeks of emails hoping to resolve this & getting nowhere, I moved on. Save yourself the aggravation; find a different app!",
"I like the New York Times but they need to do a better job with Google play subscriptions. I tried to cancel my subscription and I could not. When I went to manage subscriptions Google sent me to New York Times subscriptions which told me I need to cancel through Google play which I could not. I finally had to delete my credit card on Google play so I wouldn't keep on getting charged. Also, there are way too many adds and annoying pop-ups. I want to support good journalism and news papers but they need to get their act together.",
I can't even get to my paid for subscription via this app. All I ever get is a message to retry entry.,
"Stop ruining the mobile web for this trash. As a long time subscriber, this application and its entire team is causing me to reconsider my subscription ever since the mobile web experience has been ruined by frequent pop-ups pushing people to use the app. Well, it's incompatible with assistive technology for the visually impaired, huge for a glorified web page, laden with annoying ads, and reeks of spyware. If I could give negative stars, I would. Any positive review was written by a simpleton.",
"I open NYT when I wake up and when I go to bed. These times incline me to bookend my day with current events, but these are the times of day that the Stark white background is most jarring. I can turn down my screen brightness and apply my blue light filter and wear blue light glasses but I wish there was a night mode or an option to change the theme to paperback beige, newspaper gray, or an obsidian black. Readers are offered the ability to change fonts, and that would be the ideal location",
only newspaper that still gives the news as they are,
Best of the Lame Stream Media!,
Much more than the best news source.,
Obviously a true friendship- nice to see and hear about,
"I'm very impressed with the NYT, and nearly two years since acquiring the app ( first as a free six month trial run, then monthly ) I can truly say, I'm enjoying NYT, and hopefully, a little while longer, besides, it's worth it ( like the news should be...and the truth behind the headlines. 👍! Keep up with the great work ).😉!",
"Love the Times, hate the app.",
"Great app, with excellent usability and fantastic writing. I wish the Europe section could be set to home though. The widget has also disappeared for me in this latest update. It is one of the few well designed news widgets, but it's missing for me now. Is the feature being removed or is this a bug?",
"Still blocked by paywall. I subscribed to an intro rate in the browser, link to my Gmail account, it shows up under my subscriptions, but I'm still blocked by the paywall. Doing a great job of confirming my avoidance of news-related subscriptiona there, NYT.... Submitted a help request via the App, will update this if it is fixed. **Update 1/15/20** Support contacted me, said that they've been having other users see the same issues. Their suggestion didn't work, still blocked. Get a refund.",
it is how I keep up with all the madness in the world with sane writing and journalistic integrity.,
"The New York Times runs in tandem with me as well as the Washington Post as staples of truth in the cloud of what has become a dichotomy of pride stricken sycophantic sick behavior in America versus the justice that keeps corruption and lies in balance through checks in order, reason, logic and objectivity. Just as the judicial system we have in society and in government, facts are facts and I thank you for them. I learn more everyday from you ladies and gentlemen and I thank you for truth.",
"Now a WaPo reader for my news--that's how bad it is! This app and the website keep crashing on my phone. At best, I can view headlines. No links to articles work. Avoid like the plague! Hey NYT--I hear that digital subscriptions are now your #1 revenue source. Not for much longer if the digital products continue to seriously underperform.",
I love everything about The New York Times. Having it on its own app is just convenient.,
"Outstanding news organization, timely reporting of news, excellent feature and sports coverage",
"App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
1.99 and the paywall went down. I do a lot of social media and being able to read the NYT articles is important to be able to keep up with whats being talked about. I live on the West Coast so certain sections are useless to me but hey that's always been that way. Like having the paper right in front of me. And no trees were harmed. Win/win.,
"This is my favourite, most user-friendly newspaper app.",
Only way to make this article better would be include some reseller information.,
"Edit, Jan 2020: app worked well for a few weeks; now back to being unstable with unending load times and blank articles. Edit, Jan 2020: Why does it take forever to get the app back in order?! Even after six weeks, load times remain insanely long, app keeps crashing. JUST ROLL BACK TO LAST WORKING VERSION! Edit, Dec 2019: seconding other reviews; latest update makes app crash, presents 'empty' articles, does not allow to scroll saved articles. Content is great, but product completely unusable.",
The articles are great but seeing as the app seldom loads the articles and instead shows a blank page it's pretty useless. I've removed it as a first step in ending my use of ny times as I can't stand by a news organization that can't figure out how to actually get news to people in a reliable way.,
"I get newsletters all the time that I read from mobile apps, but emails don't open into the apps. They open into web browsers where I'm not logged into my times account.. I know so many apps who've solved this feature, so I'm rating NY Times poorly until it is resolved. It may seem trivial, but it ruins the app experience for me.",
Love having the paper at my fingertips. But when you lose that $4 rate and it goes to $17 sometimes you need to take a break. And on the app I hate the cancellation process. Tried the chat and it didn't work. Had to call and wait on hold for 10 minutes to speak with someone.,
"Used to be a great app, but recent updates have made it more frustrating to use. Scrolling now stutters because of frequent ads loading. App crashes regularly. Search function is very poor and doesn't find half of what you're searching for. No longer my go to app for news.",
"I would put 5 stars for content. However the app is so bad and useless, that it is a one star. If you are not connected to the internet, forget about reading the times offline. It just doesn't work. So forget about enjoying the times on your Android tablet or ipad in the train, plane or the park if wifi is unavailable. Thinking of stopping my subscription as it is a frustrating app",
I decided to subscribe so I would see no ads but the app is riddled with them. You see the same amount of ads whether you're a subscriber or not. I'm more than willing to pay a premium for an ad-free experience. I suppose I'll have to go back to the ad-supported Flipboard that doesn't show as much ads as the New York Times App.,
Numerous usability and excessive advertising issues over past few months as noted by other reviews. Now autorotation is stuck in portrait mode which is the deal breaker for me. This is what a paid subscription gets me on Android? iOS version works fine on my iPad but I do most of my NYT reading on my Android phone. Unacceptable!,
"Quality content, awful app. -Bookmark button doesnt show up on pages with comments... why!? -Speaking of comments, they fail to load probably 75% of the time. -iOS has a NYT cooking app, Android simply redirects to the NYT site; we deserve an app too! -Articles freeze while scrolling, requiring the user to exit and find the link again. -Articles in push notifications are often hard to find without a direct link. -Scrolling is wonky, sometimes speeding to the top or bottom of the page.",
"Recent updates have broken notifications: clicking on a mitigation does but always result in the selected article opening up. It depends on whether the app has been opened recently and has pulled an update. If the app has not updated recently, then a click on a notification will only open the app but not the selected article.",
NYT is good journalism. Worth the money if you have only 15-30 min a day to read the national news real quick.,
"Edit: Since the widgets disappeared several months ago, and the app has gotten buggy, I will be cancelling my subscription. After more than two months, the developers clearly have not listened to our requests and concerns, so I feel no need to keep paying for a product that I don't use, and is not user-friendly. The widget disappeared after my most recent update. That's what I largely use to review headlines and decide what I want to read. Beside that, the app is fine.",
App has been broken for months. Impossible to load articles from Facebook or push notifications. Considering cancelling subscription. No point paying for something you can't use. UPDATE: Nearly a year later and the push notifications are still entirely screwed up. Really pitiful from such a large media organization.,
"Update: version 9.29 was buggy, and sadly version 9.30 is no better. Pages never load properly. The last two weeks have been hell. Fix it! As others have said, app on phone frequently crashes, and website on phone is not much better. Desktop version is stable.",
"I use the app for notifications, but it should allow me to open the articles in chrome from the menu. I have to click share the article, copy the link, then delete out the subject of the email after I paste it in the browser. also, if there are multiple notifications on your phone it only opens the latest notification.",
"Subscribed with the all access pass in early November, since I use NYT cooking and Crossword I figured I may as well bundle it all. When I go to view my profile at nytimes[.]com, it states I have a basic subscription, even though it's linked with my Gmail account. Basically I paid 130$ to have a non-functioming NYTimes app and I no longer have access to the puzzle or cooking applications.",
"The app is fine. Nothing special. Good quality, as expected from a paid subscription. But I am getting sick of being nickled and dimed. Extra money for the crossword. Extra money for wirecutter. Extra for recipes. It just goes on. I paid already. I want to support journalism. But wringing more money by creating evermore fire walls is painful. Probably not renewing. I'll find a less greedy source. The NYT is not that special",
The news are rarely up to date. Articles available on the web often don't show up in the app. (Or it is possible their algorithm for choosing articles to show in the feed isn't working). A simple functionality to e.g. locate daily briefings would be good. Search function also appears off.,
"I recently bought a year digital subscription, partially because of articles shared on Facebook and wanting to support journalism. But this app is clumsy. I had hoped it would be more like a literal newspaper, but in digital format. Please add some kind of e-reader capability and PDF style digital copies of the print version!",
"Update: After the latest update the popups now take me to the correct story, updating to 5 stars. Not sure if the problem was adressed or my phone was just bugging out. This app has everything you'd expect from a scrolling news app. However when you show a popup for a story on my home screen, then I click on said popup as it piqued my interest, and it simply opens the app to the main page and not on the article I wanted to read....it makes me want to end my subscription.",
Usually can't read articles - clicking on an article displays blank page with loading icon forever. Clicking on an article notification almost always either opens the wrong story or shows no story at all (navigates to main page or shows previously viewed story). Scrolling frequently stutters or refuses to move. Restarting the app or my phone doesn't help. Neither does updating nor reinstalling. These issues force me to use the mobile website which is very frustrating.,
"Great but 1 nitpick. When you get a notification with a headline and you click/tap that specific headline, it doesn't bring you to that article, it takes you to the front page/top article/headline. So you try to scroll through to find your article of interest. Most of the time I don't end up finding it.",
"Good content, but the app has many problems. Not only does clicking on a notification NOT bring you to the article that the notification is concerning, but it even when you go through opening the app on its own and click on an article there, it doesn't always take you to the article you clicked on. This is especially common with newer articles. There shouldn't be such fundamental problems with such a basic app, especially when you're an outlet so large with the money to pay decent developers...",
in App videos do not play and images cannot be clicked on to magnify... fix needed!! Update 12/1/2019: The app is now glacially slow to load. Saving items takes a loooooooonnng time!!! Its almost like some server somewhere is grinding much too slowly... Big fix needed!!! Us paying readers need better service!!! Update 8/1/2020: only 2 lines of the keyboard show up in the crossword or mini crossword!!! This is unacceptable!!! I am reducing rating to one star now...,
"I have a subscription, but I still am not getting full access. Perhaps there are levels. The covid data is timely and factual. Articles I have already read do not leave my feed. The Today feed doesn't refresh every day. Still, it has good reporting in classical sense; so, I am willing to support the paper.",
Great articles but dismal interface especially with longer articles. Trying to read one is a frustrating experience as it jumps up and down by several paragraphs when there are background pictures. I often end up rereading the same content a few times trying to find where I was. 😡,
Unable to access place to enter password. Previous entry did not allow me to play a complete game of wordle.,
"Articles take forever to load, especially if they contain more ads. The ads also mess with scrolling and the page will jump backwards when an ad finally finishes loading. I'm already paying a monthly subscription - why are there so many ads? And if we have to have ads, why can't you make them a smoother part of the app? Honestly, this just makes me dislike both the advertising company and NY Times more.",
"Terrible. No way to turn off advertising, even for a paid subscriber. And the ads are tracked across my normal web browsing. Also, no way to set the home page to the international version. Guess this is more for a US audience right? I just signed up for a subscription, which I'll now cancel",
"I don't want to write a one-star review for this app because I want to support good journalism and I'm fine with paying for stuff that adds value to my life. Lately, however, this app has been unusable for me, and that's not hyperbole. If I can get an article to load, it's usually only half the page; content isn't refreshed to keep pace with the website; and app crashes are a near daily occurrence. NYT, please fix your app so I can go back to supporting your great work.",
"Felt like it was taking over my phone and my email. Don't have time to just be stuck in a ""newspaper"" all day when there are other things to read and other things to get done! Also felt like many of the articles have a very liberal slant, I always thought news was to be reported not tweaked and ""created in your own image"".",
"I'm from NY so I live having access to the NYT. However, I find the content to be nothing more than what I'd expect. I've never thought that there is something amazing included in the digital experience. I don't mind paying. I just wonder how much commitment the board have to their future.",
"I just appreciate the old fashioned reading of the paper. Still would prefer page over digital, but there are benefits for sure! (On time delivery for starters!) I also appreciate the new, limited article sharing I can do. Genius for marketing their subscription. Easy to find articles of interest also.",
"NYT please disable automatic video and audio playing. When I open the app to read an article, the last thing I want is a video automatically starting to play at full blast. PLEASE STOP WITH THE AUDIO AND VIDEO AUTO PLAY! Thank you!",
"Previous comments: excellent range of news and news analysis, balanced with a selection of stories about personal and social issues. Also, access to puzzles, entertainment, recipes, and literature. I find myself turning to my NY Times subscription on the app at least once each day.",
"Hard core NYT user that keeps getting frustrated that the app just doesn't reflect what the online version is showing. The app keeps placement of the ""Top Stories"" out of sequence in my opinion. Which makes me constantly have to go back to the online version to read the current top story. In other words if NYT thinks a story is worthy of being the ""top story"" front page of the online version it should simply reflect the same in the app. The same seems to happen in the other categories too.",
"Like the NY times alot especially the historical content,and the podcasts. It's easy setup an account. But not easy as to cancel, you have to make a long call, similar to cancelling a Sky Subscription. Which would put me off from using it ever again.",
"This is driving me mad! Since several days now, I am blocked from reading the Times by a pop-up that tells me to upload a new version of the app. If I use the provided link, it tells me I already have the app installed. So I uninstall, look for a (new?) version, and install this. After one or two sessions, the same thing happens again. I do NOT want to install a new version of the app for every time I read, so if this continues, I will have to abandon the Times. Please fix!!!!",
"As a paying subscriber, I expect much more from the Android app experience. For the last couple months at least, the home page does not refresh for hours and I'm unable to click into any stories on the home page. I gotta Google the headline then have my browser open the story for me - hugely inconvenient and honestly you're screwing up actual views of stories - which I assume is a very important metrics - by allowing this bug to persist.",
"The app is very easy to use, summarizes sections, and is almost as good if you are old fashioned and like this rustle a paper as you make your way through it. I can easily share news via text or social media. Also, it has Dark Mode, which is very easy on the eyes.",
"The NYT is the paper that you have been looking for. All the news that you need to know in one place with amazing journalist that seek for stories all over the world. Only one hick-up; the subscription is expensive. It has went up three times since I've been a subscriber. Is the journalism worth it? Yes! But for the readers, it is pressing our pockets. At this point, it is up to $18 a month.",
"some glitches on mobile, better on desktop, but the games are fantastically challenging and fun",
"This is a swindle. If you are an existing NYTimes subscriber and renew your subscription on Goole Play, you will not be able to use your subscription on a browser. I tried every possible support from Google Play, The New York Times and even the developer. No one could fix the problem and Google Play refused to refund my purchase. Beware!!",
App is not user friendly. It doesn't save your spot. The scrolling bar is invisible unless you pass over a picture. My saved articles disappeared for no reason. Recent articles and saved articles are buried in menu and not easily accessible. Recommendation system is average at best.,
"I never get the morning edition of the paper until morning is long past. Instead I am forced to read yesterday's nyt or else The Washington Post which does arrive early in the morning. the Android app does not fill my entire screen and leaves a big space on either side. Somehow, the Android tablet application has really deteriorated over the years that I have been reading the nyt.",
"Can't do crossword since bottom line of keyboard doesn't show. Have tried Uninstalling app and installing, also restarting phone. No finger swipes do anything except shrinking the puzzle. No effect on keyboard. That's my reason for low rating. News etc are excellent. Problem likely started with recent update.",
"In general, it gives good news. HOWEVER, you literally need a subscription to do literally anything. You can't even read more than the headline on articles without subscribing. It's super inaccessible for people (like me) who just want good and accurate news but can't afford to get a $7 a month subscription which then goes to $16 a month after a year. This is a really big company, so I'm honestly shocked they charge THAT MUCH for a subscription so you can actually read the news.",
"Was working great until recently, last few days I keep getting a message that I'm offline even when I'm not (and I have it set to work offline anyway, so that shouldn't even matter). Formatting is all weird and images won't upload. Haven't been able to access new content for several days. I'm on an Android phone.",
"When I click a notification, it opens the main page, not the article. When I open the app after a few days I'm bombarded with 10s of notifications all at once. Notifications are for inconsequential articles and very distracting. Fix the notifications plz!",
"The app used to work just fine. In the last month however, I can't say that it works much at all. It usually fails to load the article, and if it does manage to load it, it renders it on a black background with dark text. This usually happens when you open an article from a news alert notification. Also, the comments rarely load, and this has been true for months. The app is basically unusable right now. If they don't fix it soon, I will cancel my digital subscription. It's that bad.",
"Annoying Bug For some reason, if I try to open an article from earlier in the day on my notifications, it instead takes me to my most recent article in notifications. Please fix this, it can be somewhat frustrating to chase down an article after it goes off the virtual front page.",
"App has stopped working on Android 4.4 - App worked well until 26 Nov., 2019, then stopped updating anything except Top Stories. After reinstalling I now get an annoying splash screen; after pressing ""Log In"" I get a blank template of the app with no content at all. The NYT itself is great, but the app is dead.",
"The news coverage is great, however, the app sucks. It is constantly trying to get me to subscribe when I am already subscribed through Google Play Store. I have written the New York Times about the problem for several days. They sent me a message about how to fix it, but it didn't work. They are not responding to repeated emails to fix the problem. I still can't access many articles.",
Update 27 Mar '20 - funny 'tech' section no load 26 Mar. '20 - still buggy & filled w/loading problems. Can't trust will work when want to read. Clear NYT isn't focused nor wants to fix many long known problems. Jan. 2020 - App slow to load. Hangs. App refuses to open 1-in-5 articles. Have set to download artickes and still it doesn't. Will not refresh feed nor load 2/3rd of an article's pictures. Ads in app cause slowdowns in scrolling and crashes. Howcan a media company not get this right?!,
Edit Jan 2021: Continues to lock up daily on my new Pixel 4a just like it did on my new Pixel 3a and every other android device I've used it on. Original review: Locks up after a minute or two of reading. Every. Single. Time. I keep it installed for the notifications and simply read articles in Firefox. Would be great if it just worked though!,
"The June 29, 2021 update disabled any updating of the news. I can't find any settings that might have caused this, or that might cure it. It makes my NYT subscription worthless, so I will soon cancel it if nothing changes. I tried updating the app, but that didn't help.",
the app works well and the content is great,
"11/22/19 -Like others, I was forced 2 install this app, and can now get no news although I am paying for the NY Times. Not happy. 2/26/21 - the app started working during past year, but for past month has been repeatedly shutting down every time I open a news article and very often just as I read headlines. I am a very long term subscriber to New York times and very unhappy with this.",
"I don't like the updated version, where is the dark mode function?? It's unfortunately pretty much unusable for me in white... Also the navigation is very confusing, I miss the save button and easy access to saved articles and today's paper.. Hoping the next update will get better again.",
"Be warned before subscribing: The only way to cancel your subscription to the NYT is by physically calling up a real human person and complaining to them that you would like your account cancelled. The NYT would rather pay somebody a salary to sit at the other end of a phone than just putting a cancel button in the app, just so they can keep you paying them your few dollars per month for a little while longer due to the inconvenience of unsubscribing. Dirty, underhanded, customer-unfriendly.",
"Bought a subscription via the app through Google. Have never been able to access subscription. According to NYT there is no subscription, and there is nothing for them to access. Apparently Google/app developer doesn't always 'tell' NYT about new subscriptions. NYT says I have to contact Google. Google says to contact app developer. App developer says clear cookies, then to contact NYT. This has been going on for months. Ridiculous. If I could give negative 5 stars I would.",
"As an international (trial) subscriber I wish to view the international edition of NYT (INYT). There is no option inside the app to do this. Instead my entire home page feed is US specific articles. If I open my web browser and search INYT it will open today's edition inside the app, with the content I wish to read. However there is no way to navigate here within the app. The ""world"" section is no substitute - it is missing many of the articles. Terrible content discovery and user experience.",
"There is always a prompt dialog to open the news article in the browser. Every. Single. Time. Why am I even using the app if I want to open the article in the browser? As soon as I click on any news article, the prompt comes up asking if I want to open it in the browser. So irritating. BTW, I'm a paid subscriber.",
"I still trust the New York Times as a publication but the app is the worst. I've subscribed to the Times online and have been using the app for a very long time and it still has the same problems. I'm giving this app one star because every time I've written to the app developers in the last 2 years about this problem, I get the same response and still no change.",
Love the reporting...the app is terrible. It doesn't work well on my Samsung Note9. All my notifications come in at once. Usually 20-40 notifications at once. I can't click on articles individually from my notifications. I also can't seem to find a place to search names of articles. Please make it better. I am a paying subscriber.,
"Loving the app! I enjoy being able to get the news quickly or read when I like, or even play the games. All on the app. it works great now. There is one thing still giving me a little trouble and that is the sharing of articles. Today I couldn't find the sharing button very easily. Sometimes it doesn't go thru either so, not sure what I might be doing wrong. It could be they aren't a paid subscriber maybe? This was a Covid article though and I thought those were free to everyone. Still, love it!",
"The app has, on several occasions attempted to log me in online and on the app simultaneously. My account was through Google Play, but the interface between Play and the NY Times app is not functioning correctly. This meant the app would stick in an infuriating cycle of continuously trying to re-load the article.",
Looking forward to the audio feature for Android. Auto download audio would be awesome!,
"Fraudulent charges: cancelled my subscription October last year but just noticed that NYT is still charging my credit card EVERY MONTH since then. Apparently it's not enough to unsubscribe via Play Store, you have to manually contact customer service to stop the payment. The process of getting in touch with their customer support was long and difficult of course. Becareful when you subscribe and double check the terms.",
(IS): The 9.27.1 version fixed the problem with remembering your place. Back to 5 stars! (WAS): Great paper but the 9.27 version stumbled so it doesn't remember your place after reading each article. Looking forward to a quick fix for this annoying glitch.,
I am a NYT subscriber. When I click on news links in Facebook it takes me to a blank page in the app. When I click on news articles in Google it takes me to a blank page in the app. I can only really read the news if I go directly through the app. Great articles and reporting. Wish I could say the same about their IT department,
"This used to be my go to app for news, primarily because its headline widget was on the home screen of my tablet. For some reason the widget option was removed and I am really not happy about it! I have unintentionally stopped reading the Times because of this. The Washington Post's widget is now on my home screen, but I'm not as big a fan of their writing as I am of the Times'. Disappointed by the removal of the widget.",
"Great newspaper, but the app isn't particularly navigable as far as I can see. When you're reading an article, there's no link to the homepage or other departments. If you started at the homepage, you can go back to it. But if you opened the article from another app, the back button above the article minimizes the NYT app. When you bring NYT back, it's still on the article. If you want the homepage, you have to close and restart the app.",
"What happened to night mode? Why does it have to update with the latest news every time you finish an article? Why do half the headlines take you to the horrible ""live"" section? I've subscribed to this app for over a decade and it's been good for maybe six months of that time. WHY CAN'T YOU DEVELOP A SIMPLE AND STABLE APP?!?",
"Times reporting & writing is always excellent. But huge, sticky & frequent ads greatly detract from my reading experience. Moreover the screen frequently pops & jumps as the ads load degrading the experience even more. I for one would be willing to pay more for an ad free experience.",
"Subscribing via Google Pay is A SCAM! There are so many complaints and neither NYT or Google appears to care. They are accomplices, no doubt. I'm taking this to ECC.",
"Update 4/7/19:  Even worse now.  Unbelievable that the nations ""newspaper of record"" that publishes ""all the news that's fit to print"" and supposedly recognizes all news is going digital cannot (or apparently will not) get the basics of its app working.  Constant freezes--almost certainly involved with ad placement updates..  NYT subscriber for 50 years.....  Constantly freezes on Samsung Galaxy Tab A. Has gotten worse over last few years.",
"Since the app had been redesigned so that it automatically scrolls back to the top after completing an article, it's very annoying and inconvenient. I prefer that the page remains at the spot where the article is accessed.",
I think this app is beautifully designed. The app alone was so good that I had to subscribe to NYtimes. This is one of the apps which gives sufficient emphasis on user experience. Really cool visualization and clear layout and division of sections. Cheers to the development team. Cheers guys! It is a pleasure reading NYT through this app.,
"Good paper, lousy app. I can't believe it's gotten worse over the last year instead instead of better. The constant buffering as the ads try to load makes it very hard to scroll smoothly.So frustrating! And why is there no dark theme yet?? PLEASE can't the developers look at The Guardian's excellent app & use it as a template?",
"best source of news, period.",
The app has had some struggles recently but the removal of being able to swipe to navigate across sections with the latest update is a bad UX decision in my opinion. Now one needs to tap the section name which is just a poor approach for efficient navigation in an app. Please bring back swipe navigation.,
"Used to love this app, but since the February update, it is nothing but frustrating. Can't get through an article without it freezing, stopping, and kicking back to home page. Please correct these issues or revert to the former version.",
"reliable, facts and science based news",
"Used to work, as of June 2021 does not work at all for Android, won't hook up to network but still takes your subscription money. I'll change review and keep subscription if they fix it promptly. Otherwise, buyer beware. Used to be fine. Now a problem. Also can't seem to use certain password managers which is frustrating.",
"Drains the battery and overheats the phone at an astounding rate: about 25 or 30 pct usage in 45 minutes of reading. Several complaints to NYTimes app team have not resolved the issue. The Times was my main source of news, but I have had to switch to the Guardian as a result.",
"The app is so glitchy. News notifications-you click and it takes you to the main page, not the article. If I click on an article from Facebook, instead of taking me to the article, I get a blank page. While I like NYT's content, but they need to step it up with the app.",
"The widget is great - easy to scroll through headlines quickly and decide which articles I want to read. The app itself - I wish there was a setting to make images smaller in Top Stories, or something so I could see more than one headline without having to scroll. I feel like I spend more time scrolling than reading there. The other sections are better. -Update 8/25/19: and now the widget is gone. Why would you get rid of the widget, NYT? You don't want a presence on my home screen?",
I cannot subscribe via the app without the app crashing over and over. I called Customer Care who were unable to resolve the app issue. A benefit of subscribing is being able to download articles using my home WiFi and taking my reading on the go. Without subscribing you only get a few articles to read and download until you are cutoff and asked to subscribe.,
"The app is acceptable except for the notification issues. Every morning this week I'm getting ""The Morning. Make sense of the news, every day, with David Leonha.."" notification. The .. is literal, I can't expand the notification, so no options to dismiss forever, so it keeps coming back. Not to mention the headline-to-article-link confusion. Click one headline notification, get shown a different story. If I wanted bait-and-switch I'd get my news from politicians.",
Still the best News organization on the planet with a fantastic app to go with it. My only suggestion would be to have more options for offline viewing. I'd really like the option to download everything online including video even if that may take longer. Just a suggestion.,
"The app stopped working properly a few weeks ago. It now either doesn't display any content or refreshes every few seconds, making impossible to read articles. Technical support made several recommendations to fix it, but nothing worked.",
"Love the reading material and sorry to agree with all the other reviewers who complain about app stability. Since about a month ago, the app has been crashing and freezing every few minutes if not seconds. No other apps on my phone are exhibiting this behavior, so it has to be the NYT app itself and not the OS",
"Would love to give you five stars, because you're my favourite international news source. But I have two complaints. One – the mini crossword section is no longer accessible from the app. The section link shows up, but does nothing when clicked. Two – what made you remove the widget!? It was perhaps the app's most useful feature!",
"Somebody broke the app! Was there just an update? I've noticed over the past few days that not all articles will load, and the site is constantly refreshing. Lately it's been hit or miss whether an article would load, but the number of articles I can actually read had been diminishing every day, until today, when no articles will open. I've already deleted and reinstalled the app, to no avail.",
"The steeper the climb, the greater the rewards. GO LADIES 🏟️🥅⚽",
"Scrolling is often broken. It stops in the middle of an article as if you're at the bottom of the page. Scrolling up and then down again usually fixes it but for an app centred around text articles, this is a really bad experience.",
"I feel like cancelling my subscription due to this poor app. It frequently sends alerts and when I select the alert, it shows me a different story or tells me it can't find the story and tells me to search. Tonight, they send me an alert about delayed caucus results. The alert opens an article marked Live Update that is timestamped hours ago and has nothing about the delayed results. The app is probably designed by the same people who designed Iowa's.",
"Note all the recent negative reviews. I'll click a link and I'll see something I read previously. Sometimes I'll get a blank page. I tried canceling my trial subscription as it doubled in price to $16 a month but had to run a gauntlet of redirects (you have to cancel by phone) before I spoke to someone who of course said I could renew for a year at the trial rate. If things don't improve soon with this app, I will probably spend a half-hour to an hour trying to cancel my subscription again.",
"Long time NYT reader. Recent app releases have slowed content loading to a crawl. Taking minutes to load a normal story on a regular basis. NYT the news outlet is great. This app is not working anymore for all intents and purposes. If you want to compete against Facebook and Apple News as primary mobile news streams, you must fix this app.",
"I don't mind the ads on feed, but videos have 30seconds unskippable ads even for a 2 minute length video which ruins my video experience and force me to never want to open another video. The news are good quality though. Edit: The app is also buggy. It takes a while to register a click sometime.",
"Very easy navigating, never glitchy. Most articles are offered in more than one link. I do miss the old ""widget,"" which showed only headlines. 😪 Every section of the print newspaper is cross-referenced in a dedicated tab called, what else, ""sections."" And order up your own curated content in the tab section ""For You."" (Cooking, Wellness, Dance, whatever.) NYT responds to email requests, suggestions and complaints, too!",
"I love the Times and will continue to subscribe. But the ads are getting WAY too big and frequent for a service I'm already paying a lot for. I don't complain about free apps with ads, nor about paying for an ad-free app. But I think the NYT is going over the top.",
"I constantly get notifications for articles that I want to read, but just get taken to the main headlines of the app when I click them. When I use the search article function of the app, it's a 50/50 shot of whether I'll be able to find it or not. I love NYT, but the app makes it very hard to follow the news",
have used it before and is very impressive although it is the New York times with an excellent rep. app is only for the newspaper itself.... which is not a problem if your not doing critical thinking and need to see different newspapers to get your own thoughts on a story.....to see some other opinion even if partially biased. Very good work now especially.,
Edit: Almost a month after my original review I still can't get the articles to load. Dropped to 1 star. This app is a disappointment and the adds are disruptive. Original: Since the latest update the articles won't load. I enjoy reading your articles I do not want to give this app a bad review but this is not the first time an update has caused this issue. Many of your paying readers are unable to use the service and for some of us this is the only reliable source of news we can afford. Ty!,
"This apps has been around for many years and it still doesn't work right. The experience for offline reading is simply horrible. I wish NYTimes would invest a bit more on this app, as the app is putting me off reading this valuable source of news. The BBC app works perfectly offline and yet its content is free.",
"NYT sets the standard for journalistic excellence and interesting quality content. I read at least one thought provoking article every single day, with a good mix of topics and light hearded or serious options. The app is also very nice and we'll laid out, and the subscription coat is very reasonable. Full marks on every front.",
"Don't bother with the app. 90% of articles are unviewable unless you have a subscription (which is £50 a year). Newspapers are a public service so I don't really understand why they do this, especially when most of us don't mind adverts. I do enjoy their journalism, but the fact most articles are unviewable becomes tiresome, especially with the invasive popup asking you to subscribe after you begin reading.",
"Ya'll think you could design an app that actually pulls a story up from my notifications? Don't care to sift through other stories to find the story of interest to me from your notification. Otherwise I'll just turn notifications off, then eventually cancel because I don't use it. Your call... I know the loss of two bucks a month will devastate your economy...",
"I gladly pay a monthly NYT subscription fee, but have been locked out of the app for weeks. Every time I click an article I'm prompted to subscribe or create an account, but once I log in the paywall pops up and blocks me from viewing articles. I've un/reinstalled the app, changed my password, etc., but to no avail. Good journalism, awful app.",
"Good, but where's the widget? Most news apps have widgets that will give you the news headlines on your home screen without having to open the app. Furthermore, these apps are free. While the NYT is a free app, you have to subscribe to get unlimited articles. As a subscriber, I expect to be able to get what I can in a free app on a subscription-based app and more. They had a widget but removed it without explaining why. I'll stop my subscription unless they bring back the widget. It's stupid.",
"Great, except for the extremely annoying bug that notifications often open up the wrong article, or no article at all. I've been poking the support team about this for 9 months now, and there's been no progress. Please fix!!!",
"Borderline unusable. Disabling video autoplay does not work, this plus articles riddled with animated ads makes for a very distracted reading experience. Makes *very* heavy use of CPU, storage and battery. PLEASE provide an option for NON-video ads and content only. Worst app on my device.",
"WTH! Scroll/position bar was removed again. Recent update removed the scroll bar showing where you are in an article. Now impossible to see if article goes on and on (some do) v.s. almost read to the end. I now only read first few paragraphs, 'cause there's no way to tell how long it goes on. Bring back the scroll bar!",
"Excellent app. Negatives / changes I'm waiting for are: 1) home page constantly refreshes and you can lose your spot; and 2) right hand scroll indicator is gone, so it's impossible to know how long an article is and how far you are through it.",
"Wow, you updated the app and broke it. Slooooooow. Doesn't load half the graphics. Mini crossword doesn't work. Maybe you should stop charging subscription fee until you fix it..... Used to use it several times a day. Now it's just a source of frustration. When you're update takes you from five stars to two that tells you something isn't right.",
The new UI is terrible. It forces you to select sections to acces a new section. And always go through it to navigate between them. Please bring back the old favorites tab at the top. It was way easier to navigate in the app.,
"CONSTANTLY throws you out of the article you are reading, as it updates the site. Tried every possible setting to stop updating, to no avail. Also crashes frequently. Customer support is nonresponsive. In short, it sucks.",
"I have enjoyed the NYT for many, many years up until recently. Unfortunately, I will be unsubscribing because the app and website has become harder and harder to use with the accessibility software I require. As a blind person, I have no use for a subscription I cannot fully access. Farewell, NYTimes.",
"I really love The New York Times. I really like the app. I get annoyed over one tiny, stupid thing - the Wordle streak randomly resets to 0 even though I do it daily and have never not gotten it.",
"Hoping the low review will get some programmer's attention: the app constantly gives me notifications for stories that look interesting, but then when I click on the notification just takes me to the front page, where it is usually impossible to find the story that made me click the notification. Did nobody ever actually test clicking on notifications?",
"I like some aspects of the app. I don't like the constant scrambling updates. If I get interrupted in the middle of an article, the app boots me back to the lineup. I also dislike that I keep getting signed out of NYT browser pages but finding older articles on the app is a nightmare.",
"The app looks and navigates great, when it works at all. It constantly finds new ways to break, though, to the point I've nearly given up on it as a paying subscriber. Utterly inexcusable, most of all for a mainstream news organization as stable and well funded as NYT.",
"The latest update has problems! Revert to the previous version till you fix it, NYTimes. The games display with the.lower part of the.keyboard chopped off. Perhaps NYTimes is not aware that the current version of Android now does not allow for an.easy way to hide the action bar. Crappy update.",
"There is too much spam info and articles. NYT should not only adapt what it was a News Journal but it should explore new possibilities in a improving its digital platform. In my 10 months of subscription there was only one article that I considered amazing. I don't recommend this source; additionally, it's full of left democrat bias, which I don't find bad, but they should always contrast with the right perspective to make an balanced article.",
"Please bring back the top sections that you could scroll through. The new fromat is harder to access and more time consuming. Some notifications on android are buggy in that the first sentence appears for one article, but if you scroll down on it, another one pops up. Thanks!",
Great app and quality journalism!,
"App is a good start but has room for improvement. I love when scrolling thru is interactive with the the content; its a nice touch. Wishlist: (1) morning brief should be available at the top of the page in the morning hours, and similarly the evening brief in the evening hours. (2) i want to pick what news i get notifications for (ex: turn off stocks, sports). (3) ""for you"" tab should let me pick categories the first time/for set up, but then just show me articles from those selections.",
"Overall I've been enjoying this app, but after the most recent update I've been receiving excessive background data use warnings every day, even when the app is not open. The first day after the update it used 2.25 gb of data! And I only read one article and had the app in use for about 8 minutes.",
"The reporting is superb. The app itself however annoys me. In particular, stories embedded in longer threads, like elections or coronavirus, redirect and load poorly and slowly, need two ""back"" to return to the original link, and sometimes don't even load properly.",
"I am overall pleased with the app, using it for many years. About 6 months ago DARK MODE was removed ""to be updated. I have contacted the developers twice, who assured me an update was forthcoming. For some of us with visual issues, the dark mode is essential. The developer needs to make the option avaliable asap. Thanks",
"Putting news content aside, this is a very difficult subscription to manage. I paused it once successfully and when I tried to again I was told by customer service the option is always there - they don't know when or why it goes away. Due to this I cancelled my subscription of course but couldn't even get a refund (on the day it resumed that I contacted them bc of their own problems!).",
"A truly crummy app for a great publication. Regularly chokes up, truncating articles half way through, then cannot load articles at all. Several times a week needs to have all memory wiped out, then deluges notifications. Despite being a paid subscription, has distracting video ads that autoplay and suck data. Really, just get the newsprint and donate the paper to your local Humane society after you have read it. Much less frustrating.",
"Without fail, every time I click on the push notification for a new article, the app just takes me to the home screen. Never to the actual article from the notification, forcing me to dig through all of the stories myself. Terrible user experience, not convenient at all",
"As others have written recently, the app is slow to load, does not refresh to the latest content on its own (have to swipe down), reloads articles while reading them thus losing my place, and most of the time the comments are unavailable. And even when they are, the replies to comments are not threaded with the associated comments thus making it impossible to read conversations as a related series of posts. The app had this feature some years ago but it was removed with a major ""update"". Sigh...",
"Where did widgets go? Why get rid of a feature that was so useful? I was fine with occasional articles not loading and the app crashing, but removing widgets only serves to further distance us from regular browsing of the content. ** Just updated the app again, hoping they'd bring back the widget, but that was apparently optimistic. Also realized I haven't opened the app on my phone once since they removed the widget.",
"This app worked so wonderfully well but has recently become hot garbage. Notifications lead to the wrong stories and upon opening the app, I am bombarded by notifications that seem to have been withheld. Not to mention the ads. I only read on my phone so this is enough for me to cancel my subscription and give WaPo and their app a try",
"Reliable, trustworthy news based on facts. NYT will sometimes reference other reliable sources such as Reuters and The Washington Post. Not opinionated propaganda like Fox News. Newly, updated app has a long list of section titles, inclusive settings such as select font size, excellent book reviews, crossword and other puzzles. App is easy to navigate.",
"While I've been generally happy to get my NYT ones by app. It seems to have some bugs. Often when starting up, the current day doesn't come up. Today I'm looking at Top Stories section and enter n I tap on any to read more it bounces back to the original screen. Very annoying.",
"Did the last update break something? Was stuck on previous day's news with false notice that I was offline. Reinstalled app; it opened once with current news but now it won't open at all with repeated crash notices. UPDATE 06/04: bugs appear to be fixed. UPDATE 06/08: just like that, back to broken the same way it was, originally.",
I enjoy the content of the NYT and subscribe to their online only edition but may cancel because there are way too many distracting ads. It's almost one after each paragraph and some even autoplay video or animation. Will developers one more month to make changes or I'll be switching to another news outlet.,
"After the recent updates this app will often not load articles and, if it does, it takes a long time. I have had to ""Force Stop"" the app in the settings to try to get my phone back to regular speed(it worked). Not recommended. Good luck trying to cancel, their ""advocates"" will keep you waiting for a long time",
"I'm not sure what is happening with this app. No stories will load through push notifications or Facebook. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Cleared app cache and data, also cleared cache and data for Facebook and still not working. Very frustrating. And I am a digital subscriber!🤬",
"Paid Subscription still limited article views. Purchased a monthly sub from Google Play and when linking the account was hit with a pay wall. After 5 links, I was asked to 'subscribe' again. Cancelled the subscription now but still required to pay the first months cost. Unable to view any articles despite paying for it. The subscription integration needs to be fixed.",
"As noted elsewhere, for some ill-conceived reason, the font size adjustment has disappeared. Fonts everywhere else on my phone are larger, so when I use the phone's universal font setting to enlarge text, it simply makes nytimes text barely larger, and everything else huge. I have never seen such a stupid backwards move on basic app functionality. The Guardian, Financial Times and BBC News apps all offer a font adjustment option. Restore font size adjustment.",
"Half the time when clicking on an article, I am taken to a completely different article. This happens both in the app and from notifications. Please fix this. This is still happening even after a couple months. Seriously? You guys can't figure out how to program links?",
"It worked well for a couple of years. Now articles don't download. If they do, they stop letting me scroll down. If I can scroll, I'm only able to read a few paragraphs and after scrolling, the rest of the article is missing. I uninstalled/ reinstalled, but that didn't make a difference. Really disappointed.",
"I'd like a view of unconventional articles. Selection of deeper reported articles, off beat subjects, international but not Britain or US centric but more about view points from outside America that tell me about the world beyond our perspective on it. Recently NYT had a podcast about evictions that was new to me, that had emotional impact, and felt important. I want those articles to be collected and easier to find.",
They recently changed the app. The new version sucks for tablet users. You used to be able to have favorite sections that you swipe through. Now there is a tedious process to switch sections and you have no preferences. They destroyed the experience.,
"I purchased a subscription through Google play, after my free trial expired my card was charged for the subscription, however neither the app or NYTimes desktop site would recognize me as a subscriber... TWO hours spent on the phone with both Google and the Times only to have the 2 parties point fingers at each other. Long story short, subscription is canceled and NEITHER the Times or Google will give me a refund (will dispute CC charge). Not sure who to blame here, but, buyer BEWARE.",
"Taps on external links and notifications often open the app to an error page. When connectivity is lost, it dumps you out of the article you're reading. This app is impossibly bad for the high reputation the New York Times has. Edit: Lowering my rating to 1 star now. This app is atrocious and unfortunately, shows no sign of improvement. I'm uninstalling it in favor of the mobile web.",
They seem to want to simplify the app but in doing so broke many things. It chews through phone battery and push notifications no longer lead to articles. The recent update made it harder to find New York Times content. Not sure what they were thinking.,
The app is ok. There's a number of articles where NYTIMES will add special effects or animations. These articles will glitch often resulting in a poor scrolling experience. I've opted to reading the times on the mobile browser. The special-effects/animations seem to work seamlessly there.,
"It used to be a great app. In the past 6 months, articles linked from facebook and even my phone's notifications simply don't load. Great content, but it means nothing if the articles simply don't load. Please sort this out, it's been many months.",
"New app update and ads are real shite. Totally overbuilt for more ads, not more news! Totally brought down the speed compared to the old app and the ads now dance around on the screen as you scroll. I recommend using a browser instead. They are faster and they can collect way less personal data (better privacy).",
Nothing against the contents but unfortunately the app somehow manages not only to become super-slow itself but also make the whole OS unresponsive until I kill it. Also pretty much every time I open the app it fails to render any contents (I'll just see a white page with headers only) and I'd have to kill and restart the app.,
"Shoving all content except top news to a separate section of the app hides the poor navigation experience of this developer. Still unable to properly link to an article from notifications, plus who hides search in 'Sections' instead of 'Today' where the app opens? At least the app has cleared the hurdle from completely unusable to minimally usable; frustrating as the location that ends with double hockey sticks. So disappointing.. app experience is the worst of any newspaper.",
"Just 2 or 3 days ago, after Android OS update, the crossword puzzles become unusable. The last row of the keyboard is not showing, so I can't type in the answers. I suspect the same problem with the keyboard display in general. Can you please fix it. Thanks",
"I get alerts for interesting stories and click on them only to be brought to the full NYTimes instead of the specific story I was interested in. This leaves me basically sifting through the entire paper instead of linking directly to what brought me there in the first place. Very annoying, considering cancelling my subscription.",
"It's the Nation's Paper of Record. What more could I say? App functionality is very clean for me but we have a subscription, so unlimited +cooking+puzzles, etc.. On a guest login it gets frustrating when you find something amazing only to discover you are out of articles. But no matter, it still gets five stars.",
THEY FINALLY ADDED A DARK MODE!!! Sorry but still -1 stars for it taking soooooo long to invert black and white...,
"Okay app, but not dependable; all too frequently fails to load an article while popping up a message, ""Device is offline, blah, blah, blah"" when device is demonstrably online. After several complaints about this the NYT app have not fixed it. When it's working it works well.",
reading the Times is essential to living a good life ✨️ 😌,
"They just shifted into night mode and there is no way to turn it off without turning it off for my whole phone. It's super hard to read the news in white text. Their spelling bee game has been broken for over 4 months. My last email about it got a snippy response, but I pay extra for games",
"Great Content, Annoying Tech. As many have commented, NYTimes app is poorly engineered, with laggy ad loading and willy-nilly autorefreshing that hangs the app, hides articles you were about to click and even breaks internal links to wrong article or no article. Sections are arbitrary with many hidden corners not indexed. How much of my subscription dollars are used for such a weak product? BTW not a FREE app, subscription required, false advertising.",
"Great journalism, terrible app. There are FAR TOO MANY ads that freeze up the screen, cover content, and jump to the link when you try to swipe past them. It's so frustrating when trying to read an article. I uninstalled the app and read it on a browser with adblocker.",
They broke night mode and navigation is more broken than ever. Touch nav is jumpy and when you leave an article it takes you back to the top of the main page instead of back to where you were. Can't believe how much we pay for NYT to get such a poor app experience.,
"I love the NY Times but this app has been useless since my phone updated to Android 9. When I click on news alerts, 90% of the time I get ""Article not found"" so I'm going to turn off alerts (I also have WaPo which often has the same stories) Also, when my phone is in ""Night Mode"" stories that do load are dark gray text on black, so basically unreadable.",
"I am a futurist. My colleagues may laugh at me, but I believe that the New York Times brings knowledge to me that I could not not have dreamed of in my wildest flights of phantasy. While I still read articles in print for a reason, the digital copy of the piece on the Corona program just knocked the wind out of me... in a good way. Thank you for redefining learning, knowledge and curiosity for the digital age, @nytimes! No, wait, I meant: !!!",
"For LOVE of GOD if you send me a push notification teasing a specific article, clicking on it should bring me to THAT article. Not your front page. I keep getting notifications about interesting headlines, clicking on them, and then ending up at the apps homepage unable to find the article I wanted to read. This. Is. Infuriating.",
"The app notifications were bit much, annoying me to the point of reminding me I should cancel the subscription. Be warned before you subscribe - they force you to cancel by phone, text, or chat. Tried text first. Got several bot apologies about the wait time. Literally 18 hours later a rep responded. Abandoned that and switched to Chat-based cancel. That only took about five minutes, but I had to spend some energy saying ""YES I'M SURE PLEASE CANCEL NOW"" to a rep whose been trained to hard-sell me into staying active. Cancelling my cable TV was easier.",
"Content is great, of course, but there are so many glitches in the android version of the app. Recently and most vexingly, when expanding notifications they all show the same headline, making it impossible to choose that choice bit of news you just saw a reference to.",
"Content is excellent. Compared to other news apps though, this one is not user friendly. Bookmarking feature is horrible. Try to make it too high end and it misses the mark. Luckily most of the content feeds though to other sources.",
"If you enjoy receiving news articles daily that are aligned with your personal interests and views, then this is an amazing app! I love the fact I can download offline copies to my Drive to read later when I'm in transit, ect. The New York Times remains a timeless place to stay abreast of current events. I highly recommend it!",
"Paid for subscription, got confirmation of the payment. Logged in via Google. Subscription not recognized. Changed password, subscription still not recognized. Submitted assistance request. Awaiting response. This was the reason I unsubscribed a year ago (double billing for non accessible app) and thought Id try agin. Needs a certified user-focused UX team to redesign for easier subscription logging.",
"NYT really needs to advance into the 21st century by providing a ""dark mode"" option. They're struggling in readership so they should make the interface more friendly toward the readers. The content is great but the stark bright white pages are literally an eyesore.",
"Everything the other users are saying: notifications take you to the main page instead of the proper story, expanding notifications fills in text from a different story entirely, and clicking on any link from fb brings me to a blank white page. Pathetic that a professional service I pay for has an app which is continually this broken.",
"A good news app needs two things, in addition to being simply legible: a share button, and a search bar. On this app, the former is mostly unavailable, even though serious searches will reveal one occasionally. As for the latter? Ancient manuscripts reveal that a human sacrifice will reveal one, provided one has a PhD in computer sciences. Is the Newspaper of Record trying hard to ensure the hoi polloi can't use it?",
"The app is not very comfortable to use. When reading an article and changing the scrolling direction, the window scrolls to another place uncontrollably which is super annoying. When I go back to an unfinished article I have to scroll back and find the location where Ieft the last time, which can happen if the article is long.",
"This review is of the app itself. I pay for a prescription because the NYT are the best in the game for content. But this app is absolute garbage for actually making that content available. Push notifications are inconsistent but the worst is when I do get a notification and I tap on it to load the article, it simply doesn't. I have to clear cache and close all apps and then go to the app to try to find the article, and then sometimes can't. I shouldn't have to work that hard to read content I pay for and if it continues, my subscription will be cancelled and this app deleted. Honestly, NYT should be embarrassed by this app, and the other recent reviews appear to agree.",
"The new update has screwed up my single most used feature: the save for later tab. Now when I open the tab to look at saved articles, I get a never-ending loading wheel. At first I thought it was a poor data connection, but it's been days since the update, and I've never successfully loaded that page.",
"One of the top 3 newspapers in the USA, without doubt. if you like crosswords or other word puzzles; that subscription is a much better war to keep your mind sharp than looking at social media or any instagratify. The only dissatisfaction with the app is have to login into the nycom website to use it everybtime.",
"This app keeps billing me while asking to subscribe and closing off articles after reaching my monthly limit (as I pay there shouldn't be one actually). I would like to keep reading the paper, wrote to customer service but they are unable to help and say the problem is getting the app via Google playstore. I can't even cancel my subscription through the help desk. So I uninstalled the app and hope they will now stop withdrawing further monthly payments without me having to write any more on this.",
"Lack of a dark mode has been a long- time issue (patience is wearing thin at this point). Hence the 3-star rating. Layout & performance otherwise is fine. As an independent, I'd prefer more balanced reporting on, especially, issues that impact politics.",
"For a while, they had fixed whatever it is about the app that causes my battery to heat up, but the August 20 update screwed that up - hot battery is back. I can't do the crossword - the bottom row of my keypad is off the screen. What gives? The ads popping up everywhere - I know you need the revenue, but gees.",
"there are no simple certain answers. life is complex and often difficult. beware those who offer an easy way, a one way only.",
"App is generally excellent, though a recent update removed the ability to swipe left/right to switch sections (similar to swiping while in an article). Really, really miss this feature and not sure why it vanished - please bring it back! Edit: After a month with no response (to either this review or the android@nyt email), I'm docking another star. Still one of my favorite news sources but needing to use two hands to switch categories is a pain.",
"This app randomly refreshes articles and scrolls them to the top while you're reading. The mid-article ads load and reload while you're reading, causing the article to jump up and down which disrupts smooth reading. Overall unsatisfactory reading experience, despite the otherwise good reporting and articles.",
"Bait and switch notifications. Infuriating. It puts a pile of notifications up with snippets or headlines of stories, but if you tap on any of them it does NOT open the app to the story, it just opens to the main app feed and in many cases the story I was interested is nowhere to be found.",
"The NYT app keeps me up to date on everything, everywhere!",
"This is just a bug report: my Moto 5g UW's screen becomes unresponsive if I have one article open and any other article gets posted or edited. I then have to cycle the screen on and off a few times until touch inputs are accepted, then I can unlock my screen, and your app loses my place in the article and kicks me to the 'home' screen in your app. Not app related, but your reporting on the American West, particularly the intermountain west leaves much to be desired.",
No more night mode. Night mode was great for catching up on the news when I went to bed. Not happening anymore since they removed it and I don't need to sear my eyes with bright white everywhere when getting ready for bed. Put it back!,
"Negative: There's no search function & no word tagging system. This takes fun away from the reading experience! Seriously! Positive: App reopens the same article that was on before. Reading experience is good (Font/spacing, line space). Bookmarking/Recently viewed tabs are useful too.",
"Constantly asks me to log in, tells me I've run out of free articles for the month (even though I have a paid subscription), and tells me I need a subscription to read offline. I log back in, read half an article before it randomly revokes my access, lather, rinse, repeat. I'd hate to have to end my support for the quality journalism that is the NY Times, but new bugs with this app have really been testing my patience these past few months. The app used to work great. Please fix it!",
"Good app overall, but it's annoying that when a story appears in your notifications and you click it, it takes you to the homepage instead of that story. Then it's difficult, if not impossible to find that particular article.",
OFFLINE READING FEATURE IS USELESS. The app offline download entirely does not work. This is new York times and I'm a new Yorker despite refresh several and selecting download articles most articles do not work unless u have internet despite loading way before I get on train. The app has worked this way for several months. Very frustrating for something i pay monthly for,
"Good if you want to see real-time news only, or want to browse the 39 sections for an interesting article. The app doesn't have a search feature if you wanted to look up an article from yesterday or earlier. I appreciate that the app does have dark mode!",
"Use the app on my phone and love that version. On my Chromebook, the appearance of the home page is small and not sizable on my touchscreen. Hard to read. Don't like the Chrome version. News content, as always, is exceptional.",
Every update removes functionality that is useful. If you have installed the app and you like it: don't ever upgrade! Also soooo many animated ads. Not only are the ads annoying to look at they load after the article and then push content off the screen. I pay more for my subscription than advertisers do for their ad placement (NYT publishes their revenue numbers) so why am I getting a degraded quality product?,
"A good app overall, though there are too many intrusive ads for subscribers. Updates in the first part of 2019 caused many bad problems including daily app crashes/restarts and articles not loading when selected. Problems were eventually fixed in Q2 2019, but took a long time and a lot of complaining from the community. Hopefully they will be more responsive in the future.",
"The NYT is awesome but the app is absolutely not. 1. Finding stuff (again) is difficult 2. After removing inconsistent dark mode, the solution now is no dark mode at all!?? 3. I have the latest snapdragon with 12 TB ram, yet the maps and animated stories are buggy, if they work at all. 0 stars for app, 5 for nyt content...",
"Impossible to search for articles, and when you get notifications, expanding the notification will change the article you get when clicking thr notification. This makes it impossible to read full headlines of some articles, and has been more of a problem recently.",
"Latest: a 'crossword' ad for TUMI causes the focus to scroll to the ad when it appears, even if it's halfway through the articles. I then have to scroll back to where I was reading. The crossword in the ad is buggy also! App is sluggish and glitchy, redrawing/reloading content after finishing articles, or displaying a blank screen with a never-ending spinning cursor. Horizontal sliding lists of articles are virtually impossible to control, not to mention hiding content.",
"Similar issues to other customers; app botched up paid Subscription & still only able to view limited articles. There appears to be no way to fix the issue. Great idea, but their app designer is seriously dropping the ball. Somewhere. Uninstalling/Reinstalling. Maybe that will fix the problem 🤦🏼‍♀️ Edit update: uninstalling/reinstalling did Not fix it. It's still stuck saying my order is pending and will be available soon. 30 minutes later.",
"Awful! This update cannot go away fast enough. It doesn't open, crashes immediately. I've been contacting the customer care people for 4 weeks, get the same boilerplate response--update the app, your OS might be old, etc., when their own report shows the current update and OS. Why did they get rid of the nighttime mode? Ugh. I've been a subscriber for 11 years, guess they don't care!",
"App does not show notifications until I open it, then it floods the phone with scores of notifications all at once. When I click on a notification, it takes me to the home page instead of the article/notification that I clicked on. Android, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",
"I had the app for three years. Loved it. Then I had such trouble getting it to renew my subscription this year that I stopped trying and cancelled it entirely. In addition anyone who comments that cancelling the subscription, as an international customer is very difficult, is telling the truth. Non existent customer service.",
"NY Times coverage of news around the world is not only interesting and thought-provoking but arrives digitally on my phone. It is great to read good journalistic articles by investigative reporters. And I always search through the editorial/opinion articles, reading both those I agree with and those I don't, thinking about their viewpoints. And Tom Frieman's articles are always the first I read. Jefferson said a free press is vital to a democratic society. So true and needed today.",
"Two huge issues with the app: Latency got awful and developers have done little to fix it. I just stare at a white screen while the app is loading. In Oct 2019, they put a permanent ""news alert"" at the top of the app, which you cannot remove, for the 2020 elections. I can't believe they want us to live like that for a year. It even has a nagging reminder of how many unread 2020 election updates you have. NYT has decided to follow Facebook and try to force people to engage w meaningless content",
Recently this app has become unusable. The app loads so I see the headlines but articles fail to load. I get the loading symbol without the article actually loading. - even if I leave it for 5 minutes. I have had to go back to reading the NYT on a windows tablet. I am a paid subscriber.,
"There is simply no coverage of the country, and the world, that matches that of the Times. While I find many of the Top stories on SmartNews interesting, the online renderings of the Times and the Washington Post, provide me with the majority of the news (other than that in Tulsa and Oklahoma) I find both interesting and useful.",
"The app freezes, preventing the reader from scrolling through and reading the articles. This is frustrating beyond belief. As much as I enjoy the content when I can actually read an article, I'm cancelling. I cannot find Wordle in the Games Section. I thought it was purchased by The Times and should ne availanbe.",
"The bug was fixed for a few weeks but now it's back. I love the NY Times content, but the app needs attention. Latest update broke crosswords (half a keyboard), spelling bee (letter repeats endlessly & you have to quit the app to stop). Did you do any testing??",
"Feels very clunky compared to other news apps, The Guardian in particular. Loads slowly and awkwardly, takes you back to places you didnt want to be at and really difficult to navigate the live news sections. Oh and for God's sake get a night/dark mode set up!",
"Too slow and unreliable and glitchy. Inefficient: A far worse experience than a web browser, and there is no attempt at tabs or an equivalent. WaPo's app allows story to story navigation, yours does not. No way to copy/paste text from a story.",
"The New York Times app does not have a clear way to cancel a digital subscription. Despite having a manage subscription section, no conclusive cancellation option is available. I believe it is purposely designed to be difficult for the consumer, in order to trap them with a monthly subscription of approx $15. Calling NYT directly was also unsuccessful -- was told to call Google Play to cancel Be careful w/ this app. Google has been notified of these evasive and potentially unlawful methods",
"New York Times is an intelligent outlet of world affairs and national interests. It covers almost all sources of convenient truth: science, technology, literature and daily happenings. It's readable, comprehensible and enjoyable. I measured the fog index of the NYT, and have found that it is so, for its fog index of 10 is the best: it's not a text book and it's not a gossip magazine. New York Times is an excellent example of today's source of needed info.",
"I love the experienced journalism that I see in these news articles. My only gripe is that, as on the website too, there are ads even though I have a subscription (All Digital Access). That being said, that might be because the subscriptions are very affordable (at least for the first year) for me as I am a teenager paying for this myself. Anyways, I love the NYTimes, Games, and Cooking. Check 'em out! Not sponsored in any way.",
"Slow, laggy, buggy. Was good a year ago, since then is a pain to use on all phones I've tried. Focus on giving us articles, not podcasts and immersive media. Recently the main section disappears after loading! I uninstalled and now use a browser to read.",
"The misrepresentation of facts is too frequent The app, like the website, seems to want to direct everyone to the subscription page. I can't ever just open article links because it'll redirect to the subscription page to ensure I'm subscribed, then just redirect me to the main page. I guess I didn't want to read the article I was linked to. They also don't allow the viewing of coronavirus articles without an account. Hire some better web developers while you're hiring some better journalists.",
"I hold The NYT's journalistic standards, & record for accuracy in their reporting, in high regard. Esp. so, when it comes to reporters' determination to keep a neutral stance, concerning political commentary. With any high profile news source, there will be an occasional error, as it is an unavoidable part of journalism. It is in those times, that we learn who the true professionals of the industry are. Quickly acknowledging & correcting a mistake is a cornerstone in professional journalism. 5⭐",
"the NYT has great information and thoughtful pieces. the app makes it easy to view them and brings relevant articles to your attention. the only issue is that occasionally you will hit a notification and it will not bring you to the actual article you were interested in, instead just bringing you the home page",
"Please please fix your notifications. I get a long list of them and clicking on one in the middle doesn't actually take me to the article from the notification. It's incredibly irritating. Love the quality of journalism, just fix notifications.",
"I've had a Times subscription for about three years now and I'm so grateful for it. As for the app, well I'm still getting used to the new layout but once you think about it, things are logically arranged. The dark theme is a nice option, and I like being able to download all stories offline when I go off the grid.",
"You know what I love? Getting push notifications for a story, going to that story and exiting out, and then never being able to find that story again, ever. This app is FANTASTIC at dumb stuff like that. Also, half the time you click a push notification with an interesting headline, it takes you to some other story and you can't find any evidence the headline in question ever existed.",
"Great content but the app needs work. It's 2022, why is it still impossible to view video in landscape mode in Android? What happened to the Dark Mode option? There needs to be home button, pressing back takes you back through every page you visited, often forcing me to reload the app. Please address",
"This app is ok for reading the main stories and playing Wordle, but my ""For You"" section seems to have a buggy algorithm and fails to show me any personalized recommendations. It only shows me articles from the Food section, which I barely read. Also, the developers should make Saved Articles and the Search function easier to find.",
"Lies. Your push this app as free. Well, of course, who's software isn't free, to enable you to pay them. You immediately start pimping your subscription, and counting down very few ""free"" stories. Of course they're not free, because you're pushing ads through them too. There's nothing wrong with charging for a product. But don't prominently call it ""free"", then immediately hold your hand out. At least wait until the honeymoon is over.",
I really loved the app for access to a few headlines but If you show me the headline let me reaf the article! If I wanted full access I would not mind paying the subscription but that is not what I want so I gave the app 2 stars because almost everytime I clicked on a notification from them I was taken to a site to subscribe in order to access content 😒,
"Insightful reporting; always on the ""scenes"" that matter providing perspectives not found elsewhere. I don't have to agree with said perspectives and yet still have access to the crosswords and other games and quizzes that help keep me sharp at 73 . . . I think.",
Been using it for several years. Lately I've noticed that in some cases it won't let me read the end of an article because it insists on scrolling to the bottom of the screen where there is an Ad-Click advertisement. Very frustrating.,
"Tried to bill me twice. I paid for a subscription in Google Play and had subscribed since 2017 which was still active, but the app suddenly started asking me to register and pay, blocking access to articles. So I have cancelled my subscription and uninstalled the app. Time for a Washington Post subscription instead I think.",
I am really upset. I have been a digital NYT subscriber for years and used to love this app. But for the last month or so I have NOT been able to read any of the Comments secrions. I have reported the issue at least one week ago and there is still no resolution. How hard can it be to fix this? It's been working for years now all of a sudden doesn't any more? Please het thia fixed!,
"This is worst app. Everyday i had to reinstall after i read each article. I got help after numerous messages. 1-20-21 App still wont stay on, my phone is fine (every other news app). I still have the same problem. No one has fixed this although i let them know its not fixed and i have to uninstall/reinstall. Same 2-13-21. 2-19, App has worked ok for 3 dys. Then stopped. 3-22-21 problem ongoing reinstalling app after every artcl. Im done. The ap takes too long to reinstall. 4-2 nit openg no help",
I pay extra for the Games and the only ones that work are the Crosswords. The Tiles game only has about 5 games that they recycle through over and over. The Spelling Bee goes crazy sometimes and starts spewing out letters randomly. The Vertex won't allow me to connect the points. I do not recommend!,
"I often get alerts for a news article. Upon clicking the alert, the app opens but to a different article. I suspect it's taking me to the latest news as opposed the one I clicked on. Either way it's useless.",
"What a wonderful news app. Since years I have tried so many apps and none of them come close to how good this one is. Not CNN, not Google News, none of them are good. They all have the same limited variety of news, shallow and tedious. While your app is wonderfully fresh with a wide variety of topics and opinions. And the overall app design and functionality is super modern and nice. Thank you.",
Bad engineering meets good journalism. Crashes at least 5 times a day ! Very poorly built app. When you tap on the edit sections button it crashes. And then it crashes every now and then. Redefines bad engineering. Much worse experience than the previous app. This update has made the reading experience really poor.,
Frustrating...I paid for a digital subscription & kept getting notifications saying I was still unsubscribed despite having already been billed. It was only after I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app that I was able to access the articles I paid for. That is unacceptable for such a famous brand as the NYT... Tip: 1) invest in app developers who know what they're doing 2) make unsubscribing easier (you can't even do it in the app) 3) professionally respond to negative reviews!,
"This is an edit of an earlier 5* review I did in 12/2020. I have been happpy using the app on an Android 8 mobile since then until recently. I discovered that the app, now version 9.61.0 installed 5/3/22 has been using up far too much of the resources on my mobile. Apparently using 50% of battery even if the app is not in active use, and had accumulated about 850 MB of data. Clearing the data, stopping the app and switching over to a direct interface with Chrome eliminated the problem.",
"Every time you go back to the front page from an article, the app will try to reload content and you have to wait for it to load, this throw you off balance, making you have to retrack where you were on the front page No dark mode Can't see a list or delete which sections contribute to the 'for you' section I guess Apple users are more important than the Android plebs to the nyt",
I hate & like this app at the same time. One minute there seems to be all kinds of articles you want to read. But then the next I notice I don't use it forever. Sure enough as soon as I stop paying for it because it don't seem worth it articles will start popping up that you want to read and then you'll start using subscription again and then it's like they fall off map I don't know,
"Overall all, good app, but the push notifications don't work correctly. I'll get a notification for an article that looks interesting, and when I click on it, it opens something completely different.",
"The New York Times is far better than any news paper I've ever digitally subscribed to. Your monthly prices - which I have been receiving for nearly two years, are awesome - and your customer service staff always is always able to answer any questions that I may have in regards to questions that I may have about anything published, in regards to my daily digital subscription. Your news teams are ""on everything important"" in our world and no one else can compare to you!",
The content is great. A To bad you can't read it without a web browser. This is the absolute worst app I have. It crashes constantly. I mean every 3-4 minutes. It's awful. How can a major news source put this garbage out? Awful.,
1. I have a subscription through someone else that it stopped recognizing even when I'm logged in with the right email. AND 2. It now plays LOUD commercials upon opening the app and there's no way to stop it. I went even be using it as a free version anymore.,
"The app frequently freezes when I scroll past ads. The content and organization are getting is, but the s makes my reading experience very frustrating. I'm a long-term NYT subscriber and recent convert from IOS to Android, and this issue is new to me.",
"Does it's job allowing me to read NYT articles. But there are a few issues: - There are too many ""Breaking News"" notifications for NYC news. I don't care about NYC politics as I don't live there, so those notifications should be a separate category. - The ""For You"" section doesn't actually contain articles from any of the topics I selected to follow",
"It sends a lot of push notifications. I usually ignore them, but on occasion they seem worth reading, so I will click on it...and a completely unrelated post will load. Meanwhile, the notification is gone. So...yeah. Irritating.",
"The App is good, the news and stories are Fantastic. But when I wanted to terminate my subscription, I found: + App has No 'My account' option + NYT online, has No option to terminate and MUST call someone? Why make customers incur call charges? Why Design the whole experience so difficult? Is this the last experience the organization wants to leave with the customer? Do want the customer to miss something positive and to return back? Only online way to terminate easily is at PayPal end",
"Love the content, but recent updates made this app unusable. Crashes constantly, can't even read a single article before a crash. Often can't load articles, just get a blank screen. Breaking news alerts display wrong description when expanding notification. On Galaxy S8",
"Yikes this app sucks. No place to change settingings, the text on articles is often so pale I cannot read the article. Notifications are not working either. If you are subscribing to read news on the App - don't bother - the only piece of code the NYT made sure works is the constant ads in your face.",
"A well-implemented newspaper app. Articles well-presented, with relevant links afterward. Some articles include multimedia elements, which look good. I wish that it had the option for a Dark mode, as that is my preference",
"I wanted the free app, but shortly thereafter found I was being charged for NYT. I have been trying to cancel by calling NYT and Google play. Neither one seem to be able to help me cancel my subscription and I keep getting drained of money per month. I HATE THIS! How can I cancel once and for all? Directions are useless!",
"This is probably my most used app. I love the NYTimes. I'm trying to read on the way to work today, and most articles won't load. It looks like sections are now no longer updating while I'm at home unless I specifically update each one. I'm not so sure about these most recent changes. :(",
"Subscriptions are bugged. I paid for All Access through Google Play but can't access my subscription. Now both New York Times and Google customer service are giving me the run-around, and I'm out $200. Unacceptable. I found at least a few other users having this same issue on Google Play forums and see no resolution.",
"I don't know why the Times follows predatory business practices, but find it absolutely unacceptable. A (one click) subscription via app is possible, but canceling is only possible via chat (with an obscene waiting time) or a call, plus the chat bot asking for information that apparently was not important when starting the subscription.",
"They don't advertise it, but should you decide to cancel your account they will make you call and sit in hold. There is no way to cancel online. Even after holding, they 'encountered a system error' that prevented my subscription from being canceled. All obstacles to keep you paying.",
"I'm always finding in depth articles in the NY Times, that other news organizations never seem to print. Maybe because of staff reductions and other budgetary reasons, they can only print the most trending of issues. Keep up the good job, NY Times.",
"I cannot believe that such a great app does not have a night mode. I like to read during the night, but the white background is so bright. Also, if I'm paying a subscription, I better not see ads. I expect ads in the other news apps where I don't have a subscription, but it makes me wonder why I even pay a subscription if there's still going to be ads.",
"Why is the NYT android app is constantly locking up? Fine scrolling thru stories, but once you open one, more times than not it locks up, have to quit the app and start over. Only app on my phone that does this, never happens with any other, including WAPO. All app versions are current. HELP!",
"Love the range, depth and sometimes quirkiness of the stories. I go to standard features like Metropolitan Diary, Modern and Tiny love stories, and Sunday human interest with a smile...and the puzzles! Investigative features are always thorough....balanced and critical to keeping society and its institutions and power players on toe tips. The Times is essential to my day...and to my life!",
"Do NOT purchase through the Play store. Get it directly from NYtimes. Buying it 3rd party means NYtimes will not help you with any glitches you may have with the app. App loads and crashes and does not link to account so you still have ads. NYtimes say it's Googles fault and Google says it's NYtimes fault and on and on in circles you will go. NYTimes is amazing. 5 stars. The app, it is horrible and mainly the lack of accountability for an account when you pay $120 plus dollars. Sad.",
"The app is great except for 1 minor But very annoying bug . I use it on an Amazon fire 8. When I go to an article and read it and then return to the section.The app takes me to the top of the section. So if I'm down near the bottom of the section and read an article, when I finish, I have to scroll down to the area where I was again.The more articles I read, the more scrolling I have to do. LOL",
"Easy to navigate, almost no bugs. The one downside is that they make it /really/ difficult to cancel your subscription; you have to speak to a person during US business hours, which is highly inconvenient to some of us, especially in Australia!.",
"App suddenly keeps telling me that my device is offline, and can't upload new content. My Internet connection isn't an issue. Was working fine until 2 days ago. I am using an android. Update: happened again 1 month after the above review. Further update (5/22): app no longer working.",
"Navigation is miserable - because of the large ads and inserts in stories I constantly jump out of a story by mistake while scrolling. If advertisers are getting paid for my ""clicks"" they're overpaying. And it continues to get worse in this regard. This is the only app where I experience this.",
Print subscriber for 15 years. I read a lot of articles in the app but the last update made the articles difficult to read in the app. It has a poor choice of font. It needs a clean San serif font with a way to change font size. Changing the system font to max is still a smaller font in the app than could be set with the old version. WSJ app is has much more readable font and has a wide size range option. Please put font control back in the app.,
"I wrote a two-star review in 2021, but the app is much improved since then. It still jumps to the top of the ""Today"" section too often, but my other complaints are mostly fixed. It's speedy enough, stories load as you'd expect, and night mode works 95% of the time. I still don't like the back button on the bottom, but that's forgivable.",
"App notification does not bring you to article unless you immediately open the notification. Should any time have passed and another notification arrives it brings you elsewhere. Also, there is no search option for articles similar to what the Washington post app offers. Due to the above I do not utilize this subscription much and I like to support the times although it is frustrating to try to use what I am paying for.",
"While reading, stories disappear. The app requires that you find the article again, click on it, and search for where you left off. Then, it happens again before you finish the article. In addition, there are many ads.",
"same problems as reported in all other recent reviews. App was great but is completely broken as of a month ago: articles don't load, articles that do load are cut of half way through. app freezes and refuses to scroll, or only the add banner scrolls. if this is not fixed by the time my subscription rolls around I will have to cancel it - great articles are useless if you can't read them...",
"Great paper, but horrible app for Android. It crashes constantly, with no remedies or fixes offered. It just crashed 3 times reading one article. It seems to crash whenever moving over the too numerous ads. All of this with a paid subsription.",
"The app is quite good as far as design and interaction. I am getting that notification issue, though. Not unusable, and they seem to take me to the right article. Unfortunately, I keep going back to the NYT to see how it's doing, but there vast majority of the content is opinion articles that don't explain much beyond the author's/editor's opinions. Not angry, because most 'news' is that way today; just disappointed by how I used to be able to use them for school reports.",
"Hello, lately I haven't been able to open any articles off the main page of the app such as my daily briefings. The screen flashes and no matter how many times I press the link it won't open. It only happens when on the main page.",
I've put the app on hold since the Jan. 15 update; read on the web instead. App now returns to the top of the page every time I finish a story. It's aggravating to repeatedly scroll back to my place after each read or browse. Please fix!,
"Subscribed during a sale where it was $4 per month. Unfortunately the account didn't sync up right and whenever I logged in on the app or site my account info came up as a nonsubscriber. Tried to contact NYT, who told me to contact Google Play, who then told me to contact the developer, and developer never responded. The customer service has been non-existent.",
Latest widget update very irritating. It scrolls too quickly to read the headline. (Better if it didn't scroll at all - that's what the buttons are for). Also the text is unreadable if the background image is light-coloured.,
The screen goes empty while the app updates/refreshes itself after you read an article. So you read an article then wait several seconds on a blank screen while it says it's updating itself. It's f frustrating and unnecessary to watch blank screens waiting for an unnecessary update.,
"Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor. As the ethics and mores of that platform have become those of the paper, the paper itself has increasingly become a kind of performance space. Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions. —Bari Weiss | Also, still no dark mode. ☹️",
"The app updates keep breaking. The first ""enhancement"" that disabled swiping left and right to switch between sections was a clue that the design team doesn't know what it is doing. Now the app keeps scrolling to the top every few seconds. Pathetic.",
"It's OK, but consistently fails to load from NYT links _and_ even notifications properly into the app, instead opening them in an embedded browser and making you have to go back, at which point the page often stalls for 10+ seconds to load, and at which time I'm already annoyed and trying to leave.",
"The app misses the thrill of surprise discoveries reading the paper version, but has continued to improve. And as long as I am able, I will subscribe to one edition or the other, because of the fine work being done at the institution.",
"I'm changing my rating. The news is first rate, but app needs an update. It always goes backk to the top of the page after you read an article. You have to scroll all the way back to where you were every time, which is annoying.",
"Content is good, but there's no way to access stories from today's paper. This is the main reason I pay for the NYTimes. I want to learn about what is in the news, not just some list of articles curated for me or just what's most recent. I want to see exactly what was in today's paper, and there's no way for me to tell. The web address to view this says it doesn't work on smartphones. Um, it's 2021, how can it not work on smartphones? Wsj app does this perfectly",
"The user interface is great. Just wish the app didn't generate so much cache on its own in the background. When not clearing the cache for a week and not even opening the app, there is easily 0.5 GB waiting to be cleared.",
"I particularly enjoy how the New York Times has stepped up its reporting here in California. I used to think of the Times as East Coast centric, and of course it has significance there and throughout the country. Their California Report is comprehensive, sharing bits from local news agencies, and uncluttered by pop-up ads, unlike so many of my local papers.",
"Good reporting and good app. Their ""leftward"" bias has gotten a bit worse, which is to be expected perhaps. But in the past year there have been times when I know their reporting was misleading. If you're careful and treat their content with a grain of salt, it's worth reading. Good coverage of international events. The app is a bit slow and caching could be better though.",
"Mostly good, but here's a big gripe: When I click on a notification about a particular news item, it's hit or miss whether I actually get to the referenced article or just end up on some top level page. It can be very frustrating.",
It seems that other readers are having my same issue of subscribing via Google play only to have the app and customer service tell me that I need to subscribe. I shouldn't be paying for services for months that I can't access. Tried repeatedly to resolve. Have been a long time reader and will not be seeking to subscribe again.,
"Notifications are wonky for Android users and automatic theme switching isn't available, in late 2020. I want to read the NYT all day everyday but hate having to switch manually everytime to dark mode in hidden experimental setting. The #1 paper in the world needs to pay their app developers better.",
"Frustrating experience on Android, I've already updated via App Store but every time I open it says this version has expired. I cannot swipe right swipe left or do anything. Uninstalled and installed again with the latest version, the error still happened.",
"What happened nytimes? This used to be such an amazing app but now it is laggy, busted, and aggravating. Whenever and click into a news story everything is in dark mode. Click back and it crashes. Reopen the app and it works but forgot to refresh the front page. I don't even dare click a linked story that will take me into the app because it will say I'm offline and not work. I've tried submitting support tickets but they simply get closed. Why am I still subscribed?",
Times is easy to read. Editors have broken down big stories into summaries and sub stories with summaries. I can read as deeply into the details of a story as I like. The assorted newsletters provide segmentation into subject areas I select. Very nicely done.,
It would be a good app if the news came in less tan 21 hours after it happened. We are paying for it but are not receiving what we paid for. We paid for full up to date access but are getting very stale news on the app. Also we don't get that many notifications even though all are turned on.,
"10 days gone and yet no errors fixed! come on guys.. it's a paid subscription and I'm unable to login the app. 28th Feb- The latest version as on 28th Feb is failing to launch.. despite the update, the app shows errors and forces to further update the app which is not even available! please fix it. error message: this version has expired. please upgrade. (no upgrade to this available on play store )",
this app is a pile hot garbage. regularly freezes for several seconds and i get a 'not responding' error. articles i an reading will regularly reset to top of page if i switch apps for even a few seconds. not impressed. love your news though,
"NYT app includes an option to not autopay videos and has run several articles on how to stop this in browsers. Now they have have started overriding their option. They seem to think this will generate more ad money, I suppose. I will end a decades long subscription if it continues.",
I signed up for a subscription and this app still won't let me see more than 5 articles each month. the amount they charge for the full year subscription that I have is not worth five articles per month. you can read that many without a subscription. They will take your money and still deny you access. there is no sign-in or log-in page when they deny you access to what you paid for. This app is a ripoff. I plan to call the (if I ever find the time in my very busy schedule) to request a refund.,
May 2021 update is horrible. Unable to scale within app. Usable to access app to try to make changes to display. Previously worked fine. No display of actual paper layout. It forces going through its display articles. Very disappointing changes,
App can be easily hacked. In general the online NYT's subscription service is iffy. Reluctantly having to cancel online subscription. App really is bad news: articles no longer coming on emails; log in to continue to read is not working either. The quality of journalism available online via email and app also not at print level. Disappointed.,
"Great journalism shadowed by broken app. After installing the app twice to try and fix the issues, the For You tab on my app doesn't work! So I'm not able to see articles suited to my specific interest. It's really annoying to have 1 out of 3 tabs not work at all!",
"In spite of being a subscriber, there are ads within the articles. This is inappropriate for a service that is $8/mo. for the first 12 mo. then $12.95/mo. (I believe) after that. I'm also a subscriber to the Washington Post, not only is it cheaper, there are no ads in articles. The only reason I stay subscribed to the Times is that they have very high quality journalism, otherwise I would have cancelled it the day I subscribed.",
"When my phone opens ny times links that open with the new York times app, it asks me to login. This app is behaving like a regular web browser when opening articles from it's own website. Update: downgraded to one star. Now I when try to read any top stories, they won't open. Opening ads of course works fine.",
"Multiple versions of this app, including the latest, cause massive battery drain on my pixel 3. I love the ny times, but it's going to have to be the web version only on my phone for now, with the WSJ being the app of choice for breaking news notifications.",
Love the app when it is working correctly. Recently started double billing me AND blocking my access to stories ( sending up a screen telling me to subscribe). I have confirmed my subscription and emailed help through the app 3 times in a month with no response whatsoever.,
"This should be a five star review. But recent updates has made the app useless. Constant crashes, won't connect to network, constant errors. I have enjoyed this app for many years, but at the moment the subscription is a waste.",
"Even though I am a subscriber the app is annoying and hard to read with all the ads appearing on the screen. I do understand that good journalism needs money to operate, but two ads on the screen of the smartphone most of the time is just too much.",
"Lots and lots of notifications. Trying to open one to read an article usually causes my phone to hang with a black screen. When. It does work, it's fine, but it's just too frustrating to roll the dice every time.",
"this app is very frustrating. crashes frequently, sometimes requiring reinstall to read articles. i pay a subscription for the great content. i suffer with the app because i must. i have zero problems with the ms news app. so i wind up reading it more though i prefer the nyt content.",
"Has worked great for years. However with the recent few updates coupled with Android 10 I only receive notifications after I launch the app. Pretty absurd for a paid service. Tried wiping cache, restarting my phone, and reinstalling to no avail.",
"About a week ago the app just wouldn't open, no matter what. I contacted NYT 3 times and got no contact. Tried uninstall and reinstall, and was invited by the store to install a free month's trial. I paid in advance for this app , and I loved the NYT, but I need to do something to make these guys work with me forgive me my prorated subscription back.",
"app is buggy to say the least. I needed to change my subscription, then bugs just increased exponentially. I get they don't what you to pay less but geez louis. The only way to cancel is to talk to a rep, I choose the text one. 1.You can't see what you type 2.You can't scroll up or down at any point it just shows current messages 3.They transfer you like 3 times 4.Obviously a bot, why even bother to pretend ""Derry"" is real if he doesn't respond to any of my text except to ones w/keywords",
"Frequently gives notifications for interesting articles. But, when you tap on said notifications, all the app is capable of doing is bringing you to its home screen. It is never able to actually bring you to the article you tapped on. 50% useless...",
Why doesn't the app contain the feature to read the days paper as it appears in print? Its 2018 and I still have to go to the website on a desktop to get this feature. I may not be into buying a physical paper every morning but I still want to read it in that layout on my phone. All other major papers in the country provide this feature but the NYT doesn't...why is that?,
This is a terrible app with fancy graphics that don't work right and detract from reading the news stories. The graphics makes the text constantly jump to other locations while reading a story making it terribly frustrating to try to read through.,
"I tried to cancel a subscription to NYT on Jan 1st, a day after it autorenewed on Googleplay (I'd tried to cancel through the app before, Little did I know this can only be done through Googleplay) So I contact NYT, who point at Googleplay, and then Googleplay, who say a decision will come in 1 to 4 business days. 5 business days later, no contact. So I contact them again. They deny me a refund, steal $200 because of a miss-clicked button. Trillion dollar company BECAUSE of poor customer service",
"I subscribe to the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal as well, but still feel the need to maintain my NY Times subscription. I prefer the physical subscription option, but it has grown a little too expensive for me, so I appreciate the electronic options, especially during special offers that make it accessable to anyone. It remains the national newspaper of record.",
The application crashes a lot. The app needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled. On a Samsung tablet the installed fails to put an icon on the home screen. To open the Times app you need to go to the play store to open the app .,
"I like the NYT from a news point of view, but I also like to try different news organizations. So I switch between them. I won't be back with the NYT though because they make it such a pain to cancel. They say you can cancel at any time, but they allow you to sign up online, no problem. When it comes to canceling, they force you to talk to a person so that they can hustle you into remaining with them. It's not even an easy process, and it just feels kind of gross.",
"Love the games, but several links in games, such as the one to the community comments in Spelling Bee, don't work. I have to go to my browser to get there, which is a pain. Fix the link and I'll edit my review. Also can no longer have game and hints open in separate windows at the same time like I used to be able to do. Hate that change!",
"I really enjoy the reporting of the Times, however, like many others I left a poor review in August when the android widget was removed for seemingly no reason. Since then the widget hasn't returned and the app has generally declined in quality with constant freezes/crashes. Sadly I will be cancelling my subscription which I've had for years. Surely someone from the NYT must be reading through all these 1 star reviews and seeing a theme? Apparently not. Add the widget back and I'll resubscribe.",
"I love the New York Times because it's one of the best newspapers. But I have one problem with the app: Instead of sending me notifications when they're new, I get the latest 30 or 40 notifications all at once every 10 days or so. Do you guys know how to fix this? I'm using Android, the latest version of the app.",
"#1 At such a high price, the NYT Crossword should be included in the subscription for the newspaper. If I buy a hard copy of the paper I get the crossword. #2 It's EXTREMELY difficult to search for past articles. That is unexcusable and should be resolved immediately.",
"I pay for the subscription and I also allow notifications. When I see an article I like in notification I click on it but it doesnt take me to that article. It is really frustrating as I can never seem to find the article I got notified about. Instead it is usually just news on Trump. Please fix this, I am about to cancel my subscription over it.",
"The articles are well written, informative, and constructive, unlike 100% of free apps, including premium apps, too! It also has a number of addictive games, podcast, etc. Definitely the best and most reliant news source today, hands down! And if you haven't already, check out ""The Weekly,"" by the NYT. It's 30 minutes of informative, mind opening TV, about stories from around the world. The NYT is doing everything right! Subscriber for life right here! Worth every penny!",
"I want to give a negative rating for one of the worst apps in the world. (This rating isn't for the paper but the app.) Doesn't let you unsubscribe like any other normal app. I just found out I had two email accounts where I have been paying. Paying two times for the same service, I don't know why. And all I want to do is cancel my service. The app takes you to a virtual agent. Why does it hurt to just have a cancel subscription button? Just add a button to cancel service like Netflix. Jeez!",
"I enjoy the app as it does decent push updates. however, I have had trouble saving my preferences and sometimes have to sort through to find content I would like. The convenience of the mobile layout is great UX",
Horrible. Links do not open. Logins are never stable. FB links are slow and pathetic. The Washington Post is far superior in tech and overall performance and ease. Canceling this subscription after only one month of terrible results and tech assistance.,
"Stories, often longer than one would expect from a publication designed to entertain (for circulation and advertising returns), usually contain extraordinary detail gleaned over hundreds of hours of investigative journalism by teams of highly competent writers and editors. This is news reporting at its best. And the app manages this material well.",
"As a recovered leftest I find it essential to get to the current mindset as quickly and easily as possible. It's a great looking, smooth running app. Quick and easy to find the well written pieces that ridicule traditional values and scorn patriotism. Worth the 4 bucks a month to get to the heart of the manufactured hysteria.",
"Say what you will about the perceived political bias of the content, but the application itself is great. Solid interface, and lots of seamless links to outside applications - in a recent article, it had an Instagram AR (augmented reality) component.",
"Great newspaper, decent app UI, but the push notifications are absolute garbage. They don't take you the story that it mentions and sometimes when you expand the notification, it turns into another story altogether. Awful.",
"They removed the widget that was working fine and distinguished this app from other news apps. Recent updates have also been buggy, in that when I try to open an article from notifications, sometimes the app opens showing the article I was previously reading.",
"Poor navigation interface. Difficult to go back to the start page. Hitting back will navigate to previous article and eventually just to cause the application to exit. Very annoying, often have to restart the app to deal with this.",
"Nov19 Android Facebook Load Solution: For those who's Facebook articles won't load with the app running in the background, simply uninstall the app and login into your account via the NYT Facebook landing page. DO NOT reinstall the app - it's useless. Articles on Facebook are posted in the order they are published. I was just about to give up my subscription, but then found this work around. Review is for the App, and not their exceptional content and reporting.",
Disappointed. No ability to mark articles read so I don't have to scroll through them again and again. No way to indicate preferences for content - especially filter out content I have no interest in. Search capability is limited. Overall a poorly designed app from a prestigious publication.,
"My biggest complaint is that it sends me alerts but when I click on them, it takes me to the last article I read in the app, not the article the alert was about. And no obvious, good way to find the article. I've taken to reading the title of the alert and then using Google to find the article.",
"No darkmode. Even in the lowest screen brightness setting, the app is screen brightness is not sutable for night time reading. Bad Notifications The notification are filled with great articles, but if tap the notification, the article does not load. The user is taken to the main page and none of the articles are nowhere to be found 😭 Font size Unable to decrease or increase fonts Communication No direct link to the the author Twitter handle",
"App is readable and decently organized. Has the features most people want (text size, save article, etc). It does suck to have to scroll thru three ads in a short article when you're paying for the subscription though. Seems kind of abusive.",
"Good content, threadbare app. Really needs a night mode or dark mode. Pretty basic for a news app in 2021 really. Use it less because it lacks this basic feature. Update. A year later and zero progress on implementing a dark mode. Just shockingly frustrating!",
"While overall the app is great, a bug with notifications keeps the experience from being satisfactory. On expanding a notification to read the whole thing, the text changes to a different headline. I'm on Android P, Samsung S10.",
"The content is excellent, the notifications are broken. They look fine at first, but when I expand them, or click through, if there's more than one they all change to the same article.",
"The app gives notifications of news stories of interest. However, clicking the notification only brings you to the front page, not to the story. So then you have to navigate to the search page to try to find the story.",
This app has two problems. One is it doesn't have auto scroll so repetitive stress injuries to the thumb will ensue. Secondly the app won't retain a download of the paper so it constantly seeks to refresh content resulting in a whiteout.,
"The app itself is just about fine. The problem I've is the payment model; the impossibility of canceling the subscription. I realised I am not making sufficient use of my susbcription and decided to cancel, but the NYT has made cancellation almost impossible. Neither on the app nor on Google Play there's a single click option bh which you can cancel the unreasonably expensive subscription. I'd appreciate if the NYT can show some benevolence and assist in cancelling the subscription.",
"I had a very bad experience of purchasing NYT subscription on Google Play. The NYT app showed me a discounted offer of INR 1750/Yearly but when I made payment it deducted 5200/- for yearly subscription. I had chat with NYT app to resolve this issue and get refund but they put the onus on Google Play team saying payment is deducted by them so only thye can issue a refund. So, I contacted Google Play to refund the amount they said it has to be done by NYT app team. Both blamed each other.",
"Great reporting, clean layout, good app functionality. However I wish NYT wouldn't double dip: even though you've paid the subscription fee it still shows ads in the app. If you've paid to subscribe you shouldn't have to see ads.",
"The app seems to continually update the content, making hard to read through. As for the content, its quality is in the toilet. Even the hard news articles seem to be opinion pieces. And the style of writing is that of pretentious literature instead of the ""who, what, where, how, and why"" of a newspaper.",
"This rating is for the NYT experience, and not for the app. As mentioned by the reviewer below, NYT has an issue with the discounted subscriptions from India. I called their 800 number and after 30 minutes of hold I am told they have an issue with India subscriptions and the workaround was to get a gift subscription, where I would be paying US rates. Waited a few more days. No fix yet. Looks like NYT does not want digital subscribers from India. Uninstalled the app.",
"Overall I never have any issues with the app and access to the stories. However, recently it appears that occasionally the app will use excessive mobile data rather than the wifi. Trying to troubleshoot to validate this.",
"I've been a nyt reader for 40 years. I even sent my kid to the ""school of the nyt"" over the summer. Great paper, amazing content. Horrible app. Crashes constantly on Samsung tablet. Stories fail to load from ""top story"" menu. Reporting a problem does nothing. Hard to fathom how a great paper can be so technology inept.",
"app is horrid to use. locks up tablet for minutes when starting. have to restart app (android says app has stopped responding) or worse restart tablet. considering canceling my subscription. ps articles have many many many ads injected, another pleasant surprise from the people at nytimes. find another way to read news.",
I like to flick through articles and select ones to save for later.. it's happened twice now. I bookmark the articles and they just don't appear in the saved for later section. Definitely a bug. Hope it gets fixed.,
"I've been a NYT subscriber on the Kindle for more than a decade, but now forced onto the app, which is a big step down. For the same price, the Kindle edition was ad-free. The Kindle edition also had basic functionality like ""how far through the article am I?"" and ""goto next article"". The app is much much worse than the Kindle edition.",
Pretty good app BUT the notif behavior is mildly infuriating. Most notifs show an interesting headline is like to read. But invariably I click on that headline to be taken to the app home page instead of the relevant article. I also get a LOT of notifs and frequently they stack meaning I can't click one anyway. Would love some sort of notif inbox where I can actually find any of the articles in the notifs.,
"Awesome looking and slick app! The problem is that all notifications about European news don't link to the news itself but to the main page. What's more, oftentimes I don't receive any notifications unless I open the app directly and then all of them storm in like they've been held up behind a dam.",
Keeps forgetting my subscription info. And I don't know why they removed their headlines widget from Android. Also not a fan of the new 3 tab interface. Like the dark mode though. Only some of the images from each article load even on a fast internet connection.,
"Many stories do not load, just an endless in progress indicator. This app isn't free-- you have to be a subscriber -- so you are sometimes not receiving the product you paid for. Besides it is really frustrating to expext to read a story and it isn't provided.",
"The NY Times coverage is both broad & deep. It is the standard by which I judge all other news sources. As a news junkie I subscribe to multiple online news reports & listen to a variety of podcasts & radio & TV sources. But when I don't have time to indulge my news habit for hours I rely on NY Times for accurate & incisive news. I read it online when I'm in a hurry. I sit with the tactile joy of real paper & linger over a 2nd cup when I can, before jumping into another crazy day.",
The content is usually boring and just kind of meh so I when I had to get a new credit card I decided to cancel my subscription. For some reason you have to chat with customer support to cancel which immediately told me they were going to somehow take advantage (should be a simple button push to cancel). The customer support person I was chatting with told me that they couldn't cancel my subscription because my last payment hadn't gone through. So basically they wanted me to pay them to cancel?,
"Riddled with bugs. Error messages loading links from external apps or notification drawer, back button navigation sometimes exits the app, video links missing from app but present in web browser.... decided I'm better off just using the web browser and uninstalled this app. Samsung Galaxy S9+",
"I use this app both on my Win10 PC and my Android cell phone. For about a month I have had issues with one or both devices not recognizing that I have a bona fide account. I get a message ""do you want to open an account"". But I already have one!",
"It's 2022 and there is no night mode. The whole point of this app is reading, but they sure don't offer much in formating and making it easier on the the eyes. A 3rd party news aggregate app, like Pocket, has more features while not being subscription supported.",
I was trying to login with my email (not with Google or Facebook) account (I already have a free account with NYT) after installing the app. After three perfect try (I mean with no spelling mistake or no lower case | upper case mess up) when I found out that the NYT app still going nowhere other than just requesting to log me in I figured that I had had enough.,
It is extremely laggy and seems to want to refresh constantly despite most of the content being multiple days old and primarily opinion. Not much news at all and a surplus of photos at best tangentially relevant to the content. It also is too parochial for most of America.,
"The journalism is good, but their billing department is terrible. TWICE they have told me they cannot charge $1 to two different paying methods that work perfectly well for everyone else. Therefore TWICE they canceled my subscription. Their attitude is that it's my problem to find a solution, and trying to contact them is painful and takes an enormous amount of time. Every medium keeps asking for money to support journalism, but one of the biggest is incapable of having a proper billing dept.",
"The content is great, with excellent investigative reporting. but the app malfunctions in many ways.. and often. It is common and frustrating to click on a link and the story never opens. the app also sends notifications for routine feature stories of no urgency.",
I see no way to revert to dark text on a light background. The description of how to get rid of dark mode does not match the menu I see. Times roman fonts are too thick to be easily readable in dark mode. Maybe time for a (gasp) font update so the app works in the 21st century?,
"From a usability standpoint, it would make more sense to swap the placements of the search and setting icons. As it is now (search on left, settings on right), it's not intuitive.",
This app stinks. When i click on a notification to take me to an article all the text and background are the same color and i cant read it. If i go back to the home screen of the app it works fine but now I've lost my article. I will not be renewing my subscription.,
"It work, but it's notifications don't. When you get a notification, if you click on the link, it opens the homepage, not the article. This needs fixed as even my Washington Post app notifications at least do that correctly.",
It's frankly bewildering that this is the best the New York Times can do. No search function and the Most Popular articles have remained the same since I installed the app. Refreshing has no effect. Get it together.,
"BRING BACK THE WIDGET! I love the NYtimes and many of its sections and their app works great. It's clean and smooth which is what you look for. However, they recently removed the widget. PLEASE BRING BACK THE WIDGET!!",
"Bring Back the Widget! The good news is that NY Times app support replied to my email about the missing widget within 2 hours - on a Saturday! The bad news is they confirmed the widget was removed in the latest version of the app. Minus 1 star for removing the widget, plus half a star for the nice, quick reply from app support!",
"Buggy, Bad Support, and Bad Customer Service, but Great News! Purchasing a subscription through Google Play is an issue when a subscription through their website. Neither NYT or Google Play would refund money. Ads shown inside the app are annoying. Once I become a Beta tester I had no way of removing myself and their Android support is unresponsive.",
"After years of being a reliable app and welcomed source of news, the latest update crashes before main page opens, impossible to read most news. Please fix, remember ""Keep it simple"" the latest bells and whistles don't impress me.",
"A barely functional webview of the NYT website. The only advantage is notifications, but half the time notifications just take you to a blank page and you need to restart the app for them to work again. Articles often refresh halfway through reading them.",
The app is a battery drain for Galaxy S7: 8% in 20 minutes is really impressive these days; the phone also got noticeably hotter. Cleaning the app data and trying again did not help. I am also not happy with how the app is tracking me. After deleting the app data I found out it still kept state even though I was not logged in.,
"Great content in portable format, but TERRIBLE (non) functionality, especially for navigating and reading comments and trying to add them -- constantly freezes up, jumps to different point in comment thread and loses comments you're trying to add. Via Android. NYT fails to get technology--again....",
Great publication. BUT now (3-27-22) tring to review Covid news while drilling down the page jumps around sending me to the bottom. Even if I quickly tap on (e.g. case map) an item it scrolls all the way down again. I was in portrait orientation on my Samsung Tab S6.,
"This app is constantly shutting down on me. I have done everything recommended to fix it to no avail. I enjoy the NY Times but am close to cancelling my subscription. It does it, too, when I open from a browser.",
One of the worst apps and customer support services I've ever used. The NYT is a great newspaper but they haven't adapted to the digital age. Don't waste your time with their app or with a digital subscription. The Washington Post is also a great newspaper and their app is much better.,
"fantastic app functionality! Very clean view, ads rarely are in the way of what I'm reading. The text fills out the screen nicely when an article is opened; really allows for a pleasant mobile reading experience that is hard to come by.",
"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I purchased the all access pass from google and the app does not work - I can not access my account. All I can access is a free trial to the cooking application. When I reach out to NYT they tell me I do not have an account and that they can not cancel and offer me a refund. When I reach out to google they can not offer me a refund. Both companies have failed at customer service and simple app development for NYT is not good when it comes to Android phones. Very disappointed and out $175. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Waste of money, time and energy for absolutely nothing in return.",
"Update (10/3/2019) in the latest update some articles won't load even with good internet connectivity. In addition to occasional bugs, I don't like inline ads. Usually it shows the same ad over and over again for weeks. Why do I have to see them if I pay for the subscription?",
"Refresh will drive you mad. If you're 3/4 finished with a long read, app's autorefresh will take you back to the main page every time. Then you have to scroll scroll scroll to find your place. Especially frustrating when using a recipe. Also fails to load main page about 30% of the time.",
"As described by so many others, the issue isn't the content so much as the app. It is terrible. Just with the basics, it is slow to scroll, flickers a lot, and I can't recall the last time I used it when it didn't crash and restart.",
"I stopped getting push notifications, so I had to re-install. Hopefully that works. Also, the search is awful. It doesn't correspond to headlines at all. I have to use a Google search to find an article rather than the app.",
The journalism is great but if I turn off notifications I should not still be getting alert tones and push notifications on my phone. I have turned it off 3 times now and then I get another alert and go back in and see that the notifications are enabled again. What is the deal on that?,
"I'm a reader in London (that's England) and I find here exceptional, balanced, educational and stimulating journalism. I dont agree with all of it of course, but if you take offence or it makes you think, its surely doing its job very well indeed. Please keep it up NYT! To be cherished.",
"Amazing app, as an app developer myself, I notice little technological details. Love how the tabs are navigable via the drawer menu. I'll be using that app pattern for my own work. Love the bookmarks, history and the daily briefings. Amazing news source!",
"Dear New York Times android department, I like your newspaper. I enjoy reading your articles. However, when a notification for an article crosses my mobile screen, and I click on said notification, I expect to be linked to the article in question. What I don't expect, is to be linked to the front page of your online newspaper, where I then have to dig through to find the article I am interested in. First world problem? Yep. But also, easily correctable with a little effort from your team ~",
"Pretty expensive. Some good native digital content, which is enjoyable. Unfortunately articles can automatically refresh multiple times. In those cases, I must scroll down to wherever I last was.",
Always excellent and trustworthy news. I am always impressed by the high level of the articles they share. I have my favorite columnists like Gail Collins and Paul Krugman. And I am totally addicted to the crossword puzzle. We subscribed because we wanted quality news and we have been consistently getting it.,
"Since I installed it I've started to have problems opening some articles, going back to the previous one, etc. It was easier to navigate through NYT articles with my regular browser so not worth having it.",
App is ok but problems with Android integration. I receive a morning email briefing from NYT which links to NYT articles. I used to be able to click the article link and have the article open in the NYT app. That automatic function to open the link in the app no longer works. The link will only open NYT in a browser. I checked the NYT app settings and the app is set to open applicable links but this is no longer working.,
Having a lot of issues lately. Articles freeze often and in middle of article screen is blank forcing me to close out and re-open app. It happens a lot! Now comments won't load on any article at all. This needs to be fixed!,
I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A which is very nice and works great with all apps except this one. Whenever I get to an advertisement in an article the screen goes black and I have to exit the app. I going to be cancelling my NYT subscription because I can't read the paper on my tablet...,
"The notifications are useless. I get a notification of a specific headline but when I activate it, I am taken to the home page of the New York Times, never to the story. And nine times out of ten, the story I am looking for is not on the home page. Very, very annoying.",
"One of the best news services, however it's from the USA so they refuse to use the metric system, which makes reading anything including measurements annoying. Also, the notifications don't like being messed with, turn them off and you may never get them to turn back on.",
"Used to really enjoy this app but when I try to read articles, it takes me to a broken page. None of the games work. And if I want to read an article, I have to type in the title of the article on Google & then * HOPE * that that link works. I'm gonna end my subscription because what's the point in having something I can't read.",
"I've finally uninstalled this app. The ads make it impossible to do the mini crossword and the Bee. I can do both on the website. If your app is so broken that it can't do what your website can, there's no reason to install it.",
"I love this publication and app. the newsletters, the round ups at start of and end of day. its good to have a vetted reliable source of news on my phone. well worth the subscription fee, which is almost always on sale if you look",
"Mobile news done right, layout and functionality across devices is always on point, and updated regularly. You also get the occasional little embellishment when a story lends itself to a nice visual effect or bit of additional functionality. Bit upset the widget went but apart from that superb.",
"There is no way to see today's paper. The articles are often interesting but are clearly targeted at what they think are my interests. The 'today' section includes articles repeated from several days ago. I would like to see an option to view today's print edition. In a NEWS app, I want to see the (relatively) unbiased news of the day, not human interest stories targeted at me.",
"This app is very buggy. It often will say I am offline when I am not (all my other apps work just fine). Impossible to update without logging out. It never stays logged in, and frequently asks me to subscribe when I'm already subscribed. About to switch to another publication.",
"Only works partially. If I launch app from my home screen, it seems to work. But when I click a NYT link from Facebook, the app tries to open but then sits there with nothing but a blank screen. So I have to kill the app and just open NYT from the home screen and try to search manually for the article I was trying to link to open from within the Facebook app.",
"Edit - this issue has been fixed. I've used this app for years, but the last few months NO articles will load when I try to open them from Facebook or the push notifications. I just get a white screen. Why am I paying money for content I can't read??! I have an Android phone and already uninstalled and reinstalled the app to try to fix the issue and it did not work.",
"App has serious loading issues, contacted customer support was informed to uninstall and reinstall the app which done and then the problem of slow loading of the app resumed. It has been a long standing issue that needs to be resolved. i have other news app on my phone this is the only app that has this pronlem poor.",
"It is very sluggish and almost always has to reload data in between articles. I absolutely love the New York Times paper but compared to other newspaper apps, I find this app very, very frustrating.",
"Love the content, but the app behavior has gotten horrible. Freezes up regularly, then get a system popup telling me the app is not responding. Seems to happen when it's trying to load content. Pixel 4 with ads blocked.",
"I used to read the NY Times but now I'm a digital only subscriber. I like getting notified on my phone of important stories that I may have others missed. They cover long term corruption, in-depth international stories and have the best writers. I plan to subscribe for the rest of my life. Even if I didn't read it or couldn't. I'd still subscribe just to support their work.",
"The New York Times is my go to for news outside my country (I am Canadian). On Saturday, they even have a ""Canadian Letter"" feature that is always a good read. I have a digital subscription, I think it is worth it for the depth & breadth of journalism they provide. Plus, the News Quiz every week is fun.",
"Had problems awhile ago with the app not loading articles. It's working well now. Just a side note, lookout has recently started notifying me that it's blocking malicious links when I open the nytimes app - it's not causing any problems but I'm not sure what that's about.",
"The sideways navigation for related articles has a new bug; poor sensitivity for swiping. It either doesn't move at all, or it swipes over by 2-4 articles, rather than sequential. It used to have much better sensitivity.",
Like NYT; hate the app. Fails to load half the times. Doesn't refresh fast enough. Most if the notifications don't load the actual articles when clicked upon. I am going to look for alternatives to consume this content.,
"I may not always agree with some of the opinion pages, but overall this is still the best paper in town. The electronic version is very interactive and innovative. I love to go back to the articles I save and i also love that I get good recommendations on what may interest me.",
"Somewhat frustrating as articles can sometimes be shared, sometimes not. Hard to set up personal news feeds, so I end up navigating uselessly. Having said that, the content is undeniably exceptional.",
"What have you done to the app? For the past few days, when I hit the back button to return to the main page after reading a story, it scrolls all the way to the top #1 story instead of returning me to my previous place. I uninstalled and reinstalled and the same thing is happening. Beyond annoying. Please fix.",
"The Times usually gets the stories to me before any of the other news apps I have (BBC, NewsVoice, and a couple others.) I have read a couple opinion pieces that I strongly disagree with, but nobody is perfect, I guess. Anyways, if you like your news delivered quickly, with easily verifiable sources (so no Lugenpresse, oops I mean Fake News here), check this out, for your health.",
"Could be better UI. Not sure why it needs to run all the time. Anyway, paying for my subscription through Google Play is seamless, and makes accessing NYTimes on PC, in-app, or mobile browser incredibly easy.",
Purchased another 1-year All-Access pass through Google Play this time and it hasn't worked for 3 months. I've submitted multiple requests to NYT and Google about both just point the blame at the other. Looks like others have experienced the same issue to no avail.,
"Where did the widget for the home screen go? That was my only access point to the NYTimes. I can't be bothered to open the app and scroll through all the news. That's really annoying and if the widget won't come back, I'm really thinking about cancelling my subscription...",
"I pay for a digital subscription, and read the NYT daily. I rely on the app for when I am on the go. The current version of the app makes it almost impossible to use. More often than not, I can't open the actual article. This is terribly disappointing.",
"love the articles, of course. but the app is trash. every single time I open it, I have to close it at least once and try again because no content loads. this problem didnt exist on my old phone, but it does on my new one. it's so irritating",
"Too many ads by far! The app is mediocre to begin with. I only tolerated it for the content, but the ads every few sentences are ruining that too! Probably won't continue my subscription because of this app. WaPo is a good comparator (for app design).",
"I keep get many error messages ""NYTimes app keeps shutting down"" 8 even when I haven't used it in weeks. Love the NYT, so I've been patient, and will look for solution when time allows.",
"Easy to use- even ""pleasing"" somehow. The articles you've already looked at appear greyed out, which is helpful. The app makes it all easier on the eyes somehow, I don't know. Like good sneakers, it just feels good, cushier, in the app. Easy to find my way around. I am good to go.",
"Great app, were it not for the ads that crop up inline, slow everything and drain the battery. Naively I thought that paying a subscription would spare me that, now I find it more comfortable to log in a browser and enjoy reading great content with the ads locked out.",
"Stupid app, first of all does not refresh after an offline holiday of 6 days. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, now does not allow me to login. All these issues for a paid subscriber. Slow to load, suddenly stops working on WiFi, only mibile data works. Will cancel my subscription.",
"You would think that, having disabled notifications for the Tokyo Olympics in settings, I would stop getting notifications about the Tokyo Olympics. Instead I'm constantly getting notifications about the Tokyo Olympics. Apparently the only way to stop getting nuisance notifications about this thing I don't care about, is to disable notifications entirely, thereby rendering the app useless.",
"Content is great but the app itself is janky and frequently freezes then crashes halfway through reading an article forcing me to reload the app, find the article again and scroll back to where I was. Running on unmodified Pixel 4a so it is not due to hardware limitations",
"A great newspaper. Even if you don't align with their political bias which is decidedly liberal, there is plenty of high quality reporting and analysis covering international news, arts, science and technology. They have some nice addictive games like the Spell Bee and the crossword for an additional subscription.",
"After you read an article, instead of the app letting you go back to where you were on the main page, it takes you back to the top. Why?? Please restore to the more user-friendly design! And the link for the custom coronavirus tracker has stopped working.",
Great App. Read a lot. Only minor improvement I might recommend is making a heirarchy for the sections or something to make searching for a particular section easier. The list is just a little long. Maybe alphabetical?,
Absolutely unusabel. I try to click on stories and it immediately goes back to the home page. I also had to log in 6 times and restart a ton of others to even get it to load correctly. So sick of this. Cancelling.,
Really enjoyable app layout. Top notch news content. Would like if there's an option to download podcasts in app. Also would prefer if a more obvious design distinction would be made between opinion articles and factual news reports.,
"I like getting NYT headlines, live comments on breaking stories, videos and recipes. I do wish that when I expand the nyt video To full screen, it would rotate to view it horizontally. It will only show in regular vertical orientation.",
Great coverage but app doesn't eliminate advertising. Really annoying that the video ads will cause the screen to not scroll correctly either. Paid app with advertising. I guess it's like the actual paper in that regard. Wish I knew in advance.,
"So, I have a NYTimes subscription and I get several news letters from the publication, the problem is that the links in the newsletters don't go to the app but to the browser version of the NYT so I have to log in every time to read an article or search for it manually in the app - annoying and time consuming",
"The best reading to educate and inform! it offers a variety of viewpoints that reflect our diverse cultures and people. It's like exploring rooms of ""time"" with windows into the past, looking for answers , healing & hope, printed on pages, recorded in digital forms.",
Should be 0 stars. Paying print subscriber for decades. Switched to digital after leaving NY area as price here prohibitive. App crashes or fails to load every day. Used to be good. Care more for increased graphics than functionality. Can't use graphics if they never load,
"Great content, mostly, but the writing in the articles (not the headlines, just the body) has recently become very faint and more difficult to read. No idea why this happened or how to fix it. Please fix or let me know how to fix.",
Suddenly the app has stopped functioning. Often articles will take 2 minutes to load or not load at all. Other times only half the article will load. I have cleared the cache uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail. Very frustrating.,
"beautiful app, I love the minimal style. also works seamlessly with no bugs and runs smoothly, updating fast. maybe navigation to the different sections could be made more intuitive, e.g. brought to the main page",
I have subscribed for 3 years. Now I read an article and the app tells me I've reached my limit of free articles and takes me to a screen to subscribe with no option to log into my account. Everything is Google play store shows my subscription is active. I'm this close to getting out of NYTimes altogether.,
"I find the NYT struggling with it's mission of journalism for the truth. Their editors and publisher keep falling on this illusion that objectivity equates to all opposing sides being equal and worth of storyline time, even if they are lies. This type of journalism is nothing but gaslighting and is one of the current vehicles for a distorted culture and mental health issues in this country accelerated by the trump era.",
"Really enjoying the app so far. I get a lot of notifications, but it's all from categories I have decided to get news from, and it's really easy to just swipe them off if they're in the way, but also simple enough to pique my interest often and keep me engaged in current topics.",
"Overall, a good app. However, please have the app open the correct story when I click on a notification on my phone. It seems to just take me to a random article and I have to the search for the actual article I wanted.",
"I'll be reading an article, and the app randomly goes back to the main page, almost like it refreshes. It's incredibly annoying. UPDATE: The same issue is happening much more frequently.",
"It's very tough to use this app with out the option for Dark Mode. All my apps are generally set with a color tone of dark, but the NYT doesnt this option. Given that most of the background of NYT is app its extra painful and blinding that they do not have Dark Mode.",
"The app is ok but Android notifications don't work well. When there are two notifications fired for 2 different articles, they end up getting updated somehow so that the most recent gets duplicated and I can't see the older one.",
"I really like the UI. When you open the app it's just articles, it felt like I was reading a physical paper. Subscription is very reasonably priced and it's easy to pause or cancel if you need.",
"I have attempted to cancel NYT, several months. I cannot access my account, since I never was informed of my account number, or password. (The monthly $4.00 charge is now being offered for $1.00.) I have contacted NYT to cancel...they cannot find my account via three email addresses I frequently use; to no avail. They say they will track my monthly charges via my bank account, yet they are not following through, it seems. Canceling anything should not be so difficult. Is this a Google issue, or a NYT issue? Please cancel my lost account!",
"A recent update changed the accessibility settings such that I now have to use the largest global system font settings, which makes all apps have huge text except NYT, which has barely readably small text. If I reduce the system font size so that other apps look reasonable, this app is unreadably small.",
"Amazing reporting interrupted by pervasive, more-than-one-screen ads. If you turn off autoplay, the ads still do. In bad reception, I spend more time loading a video ad than I would to read the article.",
"Slow. When I click on a story, Takes forever to load and show the story; Seldom get past headlines. Should find ways to separate video & hi-resolution images upload from text. My phone Snapdragon 818. Works fine on WaPo",
"I feel lost in this app after recent updates. I can't find the news quiz, can't find my account settings or profile, and the search functionality seems broken - it's showing me content from 2021, even if I click ""newest"".",
"When I tap on notifications about stories, the app shows a black background with black letters with no way that I can find to change it. Very annoying. If you click on the app, it does work correctly.",
"Does not work on my Android 10 device. The apps opens but nothing loads and I get an error message that reads: ""Device is offline. Please check your internet connection and try again."" My device is connected to the internet. Well, for the mean time I'll be using the Washing Post, I guess (mwahaha).",
"'For You' section is frozen. It used to work great, now the For You section is a week old. I uninstalled and reinstalled but the problem persists. The For You section reports on events that are 1.5 weeks old. Even though it says ""you're all caught up"" it never refreshes/reloads to new, news :(",
"Excellent news app and wider package. But a paid app that is this expensive should not contain ads. Articles are often broken up by ads every few paragraphs, including ads for NYT offerings that are already paid for (??) This is like Facebook advertising sofas after you buy a sofa. And this ""meet our subscriber"" ad thing was interesting at first, but now it only ever shows that Questlove guy. Do I really need to see him popping up 3 times in one article?",
"On the Android app, there is no longer a scroll bar to the right of the article. It used to be there. You cannot tell the length of the article or your position within it. At least this is the situation on my Samsung S10e. The scroll bar feature is available for iPhone app users.",
"Nice clean UI, easy to navigate, buggy notifications. Sometimes I get duplicate notifications, but when I click on one of the duplicates it takes me to another page. Usually one of the notifications will lead me to the original article.",
"Loaded the app to play Wordle, but to me there was no logical, direct way of getting to the game, and trying to navigate around is counter-intuitive. It's easier for me to go to their website through my browser and play that way",
"Excellent journalism but really awful app. It's slow, buggy, fails to load and crashes often. Notifications stop working randomly. It's unable to open NYT links from Google. Please make it better!",
"Garbage. Absolute garbage. The writing is great, which is what we're here for, right? But they try to make articles multimedia, or just fancy, which simply means that they don't scroll smoothly, or sometimes at all. They need to stop gilding the lily and just let us read!",
"DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR PAENT INFO, CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE. Bought a subscription by simply signing up, then tried to cancel... Only option is waiting on phone a chat to cancel. The chat messenger that comes up was broken on the app bc they place ads over the text box so you can't use it. I had to uninstall the app, then log into the website on my browser. Then they kept me on and refused to cancel while they tried to upsell me. Took over 30m!!!! What a waste of time!",
The android version has many glitches. Constantly reloads pages while in the middle of reading articles or watching clips. Very distracting. Please fix this!! The design of the app is great however.,
News is great. App is horrible. Google reads my news to me while I drive. NY Times does not allow it. Open in browser opens app. Annoying. Please fix. Please allow read aloud. Otherwise I'll get my news elsewhere.,
"Keep getting message device is offline but it isn't. All other apps working fine. Logged off, cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled - still doesn't work. Nov 2, 2022 I needed to update my credit card to provide a new expiry date Did the update but message came back saying ""invalid"". Contacted support via chat andcthey were useless. Thus card works fine everywhere else - Costco CANADA Mastercard.",
"The app looks beautiful, but it's pretty simplistic. Also, I am extremely disappointed that I can no longer change the font size for the app. Still three stars, but it's hard to understand how such a savvy company as NY Times has such a clunky app. Maybe they need to invest in some better designers and developers? Does anyone else feel this way? I pay a lot of money for this subscription.",
"WHY IS THERE STILL NO DARK MODE?!?! it's 2022. NYTimes customer service thinks it's still only called ""night mode"" and won't implement it. Also - there aren't many features to make the app easier for users. There's a ""save for later"" function that's poorly implemented and it's difficult to browse articles effectively. I'd expand on these in a user survey but pretty sure the team managing this app doesn't know what those are.",
"I have recently uninstalled the app due to the amount of huge ads that take up the entire screen. Why am I fed ads on my subscription in the app but not in the browser? I've created a shortcut instead, with the only downside being is no dark mode on browser version.",
"Articles with text that floats over images as you scroll are impossible to read. They're janky, bounce around and scroll past what I was reading. I skip them now. Also I get a blank screen when I hit back from a live news page.",
"I love the Times for the article details & background. Their graphics are unparalleled. But this app keeps resetting to the front page, if I set the phone down a min or I'm 20 min into my sudoku. I hate that. Same on my old phone too.",
"Very slow to load images. Freezes constantly mid-article to try to load ads, often several times per article, sometimes to the point of a full crash. Absolutely drinks battery.",
"The app is fine. What is unacceptable is using tense to suggest that the Black Lives Matter movement is in the past, when it is very much still going on and deserves to be treated as a current and urgent issue. Reporting on the movement as having passed implies that enough has been done, and that the world can move ahead in the news cycle. Enough has not been done. A lynching and another unjust killing of black men of color have both taken place in the past week. You must do better, NYT.",
"Stupid, compulsory purchase even though you can get there articles on the net for free. I think they should bite the bullet, make it free to read, and have a premium version that gives you settings, removes ads, change the theme, join the club or whatever and channel in readers that way.",
How is this app so poorly designed? I'm constantly reopening an article and the it resets from the middle to the beginning of the article. Picking up the same article you were reading 2 hours ago in the same place seems like a pretty basic function.,
"Only issues are 1: is that the notifications sometimes bring you to the wrong article or just to the home page. 2: Lack of dark mode. I'm no app developer, but this can't be a difficult fix in 2022; my eyes hurt. Usually very strong journalism, so 5 stars for that - but the app is lacking some basic features.",
The worst interface for customer care ever. This is clearly on purpose. It is not enough to espouse liberal causes and pay lip service when you're own service is incredibly fraudulent. Why is there no option to cancel subscription on the app? Must be a simple addition right??? Why do I have to wait 15 mins on a call with customer care to only hear 'thank you for your patience you are second in line'? The chat option on the app has no text input!! How am I supposed to type???,
"Excellent but not for night time. Great app, not too much notifications and I especially like the Start you day routine. But please add night mode option as some articles I save to read for later in the day. Thank you for implementing the dark theme option (Update).",
"Good app. Decent features to flow headlines and read more. Ad heavy with ocassionllal load lagging even as a digital subscriber, random bad contrast between ads and topic. Ad loading during reading losses text position. Actively developed and bugs getting fixed Getting back to home screen in one click not always possible. Seems to mostly remember where I left off on reading. Better than most other news and social media apps.",
"Cant sort by date. Why can i only see 'top stories' or 'for you'? Who picks what a top story is? I just wanna see the articles in the order they're published. That's a very simple request yet this app does not have that option. I checked all over the settings and nothing. That's absurd, i hope someone can prove me wrong and show me how to sort stories by date. Thanks",
The content is top notch but if I try to read one of the rich media articles it jumps around randomly making it impossible to read and causing extreme frustration. It's worse than not having the app at all.,
"WHY IS THERE NO SEARCH FUNCTION? So many times, there's an article that I remember, or see referenced (in a non-clickable form, looking at you Instagram) on social media. I'd LOVE to be able to find & read it in the app, so I don't have to remember my account PW in yet another browser. Nope. NYT wants to ""curate"" a stream of articles FOR you, but don't you even think about wandering off on your own.",
The app is good. It's not actually about the App. It's regarding subscription and the app's inability to sync my subscription which I did through browser from NYT website. Everytime I'm opening to read an article the app is asking me to subscribe first. It's irritating. Address it.,
"I love the New York Times, but why can't you see comments on the app version of the publication? I talked with the chat folks and they suggested that I try several steps, including logging off and signing back on again, uninstalling and then reinstalling, and nothing has worked so far. I want to see the reader comments on the app, because it gives a greater perspective on me story. But the only way to do that is to go to the website version! Can someone help me please?",
"NY Times wraps facts in propaganda, then overcharges for it.",
"App keeps making ne log in, very painfully.",
"I purchased a subscription on Google Play. The NYT allowed me to log in, but did not recognize me as a paid subscriber. The message was "" you have run out of articles"". The software issue seems to be account validation with Google. The support desk was eager help but could not fix it.",
"Victoria Guardino (The New York Times Customer Care) Nov 29, 2021, 10:21 AM EST Hi Javier, When purchasing a subscription through Apple or Google Play, you are paying them and the NY Times gets a portion of that payment. The issue is that when purchasing through them, the subscriptions created aren't always integrated into our system that holds all subscribers information which then makes it harder for us to help users when they have a problem, like this example with you.",
"Nice app, but it'd be nicer if it could switch to website view, or as near as possible.",
"amazing coverage, quality app. able to request update notifications for certain breaking news",
works well except for the for you section,
"Enlightening and sobering. The realities of national and global population growth cannot be ignored, not only water policy.",
"Sorry, the NYT wants me to pay to look at a couple articles a month. The news is everywhere. Nothing is exclusive anymore. Offer me 10 bucks a year because I live in a flyover state, and I might use this (OK $12 - $1/ month). Besides, after this last year wants to listen to or read news anymore? Just asking.",
"There's a lot to love about the NY Times. The reporting is great and informative, which is why it's a shame that I've decided to unsubscribe after 3 years. The fact that the paper is being taken over and controlled from the inside by a group of ""woke"" bullies has soured me on the paper. Veteran journalists are being fired for morally questionable actions done in the past--such as using the ""n"" word (which was wrong) when explaining why someone was being disciplined for using said word.",
excellent detailed reporting!,
"I want to buy the Indian Subscription but I am not able to do it. Not am I getting their offer price. I cannot get their 600 INR offer. I think you can have a great base of subscribers in India if you put a little effort. Plus you also tend to project India in a very negative and a trivial light. Please improve your Indian Correspondence, because most of the time it lacks depth and thorough research. Otherwise the app is great and usually first source of information for international news.",
I Love the Times! Truly informative!,
"if you can get a deal, digital subscription is worth it even if you can't read it everyday.",
"Worst query system ever. Investigative journalism has an app that resists queries. Do your queries with Google , artificial intelligence is better than no intelligence. Then there are the truly frightening ads that reflect any web activity from any browser. I have learned to hide my tablet in a drawer. I much prefer to sign on online and view the remarkable NYT on a browser.",
"Hands down, the best. I didn't say perfect. I said the best.",
"Great app. NYT has some great journalists and they aren't afraid to dig in to get to the bottom of a story or start a fire storm with their investigative reporting. 45 hates NYT for a reason. Because they aren't afraid of him and not afraid to report the truth despite the constant bashing of ""fake news"" from the current administration. Fake is when its false. Thank you for uncovering this president further & further. Keep at it, the fun just started with impeachment proceedings! 🍑🦵🏼",
"We all need to support journalism, it's key to a vibrant democracy in America.",
App is intuitive and easy to use.,
"Never subscribe! Besides their questionable editorial, good luck trying to ever cancel your subscription - there is no easy, automated tool. You must chat, text, or call a representative and it seems like they only have one person on the job. Be prepared to try, try, and try again over multiple days.",
"There's something major wrong with this app. Its been fine for years, and now you can read headlines, but you click on the story and you get an endless bootloop. Unless they fix this, don't bother to download.",
"It does not allow you to log in. I'm a subscriber and with the other NYT apps (Crossword, Cooking) I have no problem whatsoever logging in. It's very FRUSTRATING. This refers to the app installed in an Android tablet. In a cell phone works just fine",
The NYTs has been my news source since I was 12 years old. That's 62 years. I have always found it the best of the best. However over the last several years I have found it. much more biased off of the editorial page. I am looking for an alternative non biased source of with equal reporting quality but have been unsuccessful to date.,
This app is collecting significant data in the background while idle. My firewall has this app communicating with social media and ad tracking sights almost hourly while not being used. This is also why it's using so much battery. I'll be cancelling my subscription and deleting,
"App often hangs opening articles. Sometimes closing and reopening app helps, other times not. Update: They fixed this previous issue. Ultimately I found the reading experience with so many interstitial ads unenjoyable.",
"the app used to be great, but now it is slow, it freezes and crashes regularly, and it often fails to load the full article. i will be canceling my subscription this month if it continues to not work.",
"App is fairly buggy, crashes a lot, gives me notifications that can't open articles or the articles are mystically gone despite me clicking on the notification almost as soon as it came in. Probably going to uninstall before my free membership is up due to how awful the application is.",
Simple and easy to use. Journalistic work on a huge standart - I dont think I have to explain that further. The App in itself looks and feels professional. And meets all the requirements I'm having for a always-on-the-latest-stand newspaper.,
"There is a big issue on the note 10+, when an article is opened from the facebook app, the ny times app displays a blank page. It was previously working on my note 9. Please fix ASAP. I have had to uninstall the app because of this.",
"App frequently replaces the text in notifications with those of other stories when you have multiple stories, clicking on notifications usually sends me to lists of articles rather than the article it listed, and the app forgets my login info. At this point I just use it to read notifications rather than articles.",
I thimk it is a horrible app. I downloaded it because I trust The New York Times so much. But after trying to use it I could see this is a WORTHLESS APP! I'm totally shocked!!! After a few minutes of trying to use it to see the video of Amy Klubeshar & not being able to... I immediately uninstalled this worthless app!. If this is truly from The New York Times... then I'd like to invite thrm to put this worthless piece of junk where the sun does not shine!,
"The content is great, but the app is subpar. They got rid of nightmode, and when you exit an article, it brings you back to the top. It has sketchy scrolling as well.",
Paid subscription but app shows adverts (and plays advertising videos despite normal video play being turned off) and drains data. Layout of news stories makes browsing difficult. Free websites like the Guardian make a mobile friendly site that is far superior.,
Half the articles won't display when you click the link. Have had numerous conversations with support to no avail. Extremely frustrating and disappointing. Would not recommend.,
"I love the articles and easy accessibility through the app, but the only reason I can't give it five stars is that the display really drains my battery. I can't figure out how to change the screen display from its current White to a dark mode.",
"Good work and covers many things. Seem to be unbiased also. Only thing is that the concentration is US. But they seem to get scoops of local Indian news also. Clearly they give an international view of other countries. Recommend a digital subscription, worth it. You get a good international vision.",
"I like this app and publication, but when I get multiple notifications and try to expand the notifications, it ends up showing the same summary as the first notification. It sure is annoying to have to open the app each time.",
7/12/21 upd i see ads & popular news ONLY. 5/14/21 Emailed dev. App is worthless on android. Is app worse after 5/4/21 update? I'm missing most of the Top News. Starts with Opinion & missing all above that. Crossword grid hasn't worked for MONTHS. Clicking back to top news is wonky with refreshes! Subscriber and still not a fan of app. 1/4/21.Mini crossword is missing the puzzle grid! Click back to top stories it goes to the top of the page leaving me to scroll through to find where I was.,
"Saving articles in this app is always a horrible experience for me. The ""Save Article"" tab is located in different places in different articles, and I can't seem to find where they save to I'm the app. I'm unsure if others have found a better way around this.",
"Simply one of the 4 or 5 best newspapers in our universe, broad in its coverage, accurate in its facts...thoughtful in its editorials. Yes it is ""progressive"" in its general outlook but there are lots of shades of opinion expressed in it. It is a treasure chest of information and an adventure to explore daily ...and it is courageous.",
I love the content but I pay 11$ per month and still have 5 ads per article. This is purely unacceptable and degrade the experience a lot. I'll cancel the subscription with regrets. I have the feeling to pay for seeing a bunch of ads.,
"After 11/18 Update: Suddenly I'm missing the entire bottom row of QWERTY keyboard in Crossword, which renders it useless. Uninstalled/Reinstalled, Refresh, Text Size...nothing fixes this. I'm paying for these games and now cannot play! Please respond!",
Beautifully designed News app - reading and navigation is very pleasant. Even ads rarely feel distracting. I only wish they had more international content but it was only 20$/year in my region(Thailand) which is very reasonable!,
"The interface sometime is frustrating but the new, analysis & commentary are incredible! No matter what your political position, every day there are interesting stories (and, no, I not live anywhere near NYC).",
"Total disaster. I often see 2 copies of the same giant ad in a row. News stories are often just blank white space. Content may suddenly appear later, then disappear as i scroll. Complete waste of time.",
"Fix your dang app! When I tap on a headline notification, it should take me to that story - not to the home page and not to a different story. Period. Look, the news is stressful enough these days without misleading UX errors.",
"The first 3-5 minutes, it was actually very good. The feed is nice but when I was reading an article the app suddenly went blank and logged me out. Happened twice. Uninstalled after only 8 minutes. Your app sucks!",
Very hard to navigate overall. Clicking on a notification doesn't take you to the article but to the home page...often times can't even find the article after that (and the search function was removed or hidden),
"The app works just fine. Anytime my Android is on, I can go on the app and read the articles with no problem. The categories are Most Popular, World News, U.S. News, Politics, Business, New York News, Sports, Arts, Magazine, Photos, Technology, Health, Science, Climate and Environment, Food, Books, Movies, Theater, Style, Celebrity Weddings, Travel, Real Estate, Automobiles, and National Obituaries. There are no pop-ups unless I want them.",
"Fantastic app. I couldn't figure out a flaw after using for so many weeks. But I've got one suggestion. A dark theme. As more apps keep bringing this feature on the table, NYT shouldn't be a laggard in that front. It'll minimize the strain on eyes. Once dark theme arrives, all 5 stars would be visible👌.",
"It's more important than ever to support honest, independent journalism. Sounds like a long-overused cliché. In reality, its importance is difficult to overstate. Truth is losing the information war. NY Times, please keep fighting. You are all absolutely necessary if this toxic tide is ever going to be reversed.",
"The app needs attention. In the Account chat function, there is no input field and selecting any screen option permanently hides the keyboard so the chat can't proceed. Account Management requires password entry at every screen. NYT great content though!",
"I want to like it but it constantly has issues. Now, the widget has now disappeared from my phone entirely. The app often won't let me click on a story, freeze, crashes, etc.",
"No longer holds my place when I return after reading an article. The app scrolls all the way to the top, then I have to scroll down each time to find where I was in the list. Extremely irritating!",
The app flickers incessantly on the front page for news stories that have some type of animated or video content in their headline. Makes it impossible to read the page and is really annoying.,
Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless.,
"I have a paid subscription and the app still has paid ads everywhere. While playing spelling bee, the app frequently never fully loads and displays a circular loading progress bar that never finishes spinning unless you click save and return to the hub.",
"The newspaper and the app are great. Don't show me ads when I am already a subscriber. Make the subscription more expensive if you have to, but do not show ads to customers that are already paying you. The adds are a new thing and they should be removed immediately.",
"Freezes mutiple times and the freezes always happen everytime you get on. EVERYTIME without fail. And I guess turn off your auto rotate because it will restart the whole article. And no, paying for the subscription does not help at all.",
"Constantly reloads. After each article, the app goes completely white and takes a few seconds to reload. I've tried turning off the reload refresh setting to no avail. Terrible user experience.",
"Fantastic journalism; lousy app. To be clear, I love the NYT content and am proud to support quality journalism. I'm talking about app. The paid subscription still has ads, for the NYT itself, to ask you to support it, which you already are, by paying subscription. Why pay for subscription to remove ads if your screen is still going to be covered with an ad? I suggest the app makers look at other quality apps like The Guardian for inspiration on how a paid subscription app should work.",
"New update is a step backwards. Harder to navigate, can't swipe between articles in a section. Freezes more often when internet is lost (which happens often on the subway). Please fix!",
"Plus: access to NYTimes articles Minus: The app itself It has not changed in years. It is very slow (compared to DW), uses lots of data when mobile, and is not nearly as polished as the Apple counterpart (trust me if you see the Apple version you will feel very cheated)",
"Well developed, good news app. Only one noticeable glitch. Push notifications will often take you to the wrong article, and will also flood your phone if you open the app when you haven't for a while.",
"The battery drain is real. Since installing this app, my battery drains at about 10% per hour. That said, I have an older pixel 2 xl so that may play a part. Also, the app is no longer updating to show new articles. I have to use the website to look for news now. At least it's a free app.......",
"7/20/2020: fixed. Back to 5 starts 6/1/2020: Bad Update. Won't even open. Just becomes unresponsive. 7/10/2019: It just works, really well. Reliable, doesn't have bugs, loads fast. Already subscribed to the Times, great extension of print/web.",
"I subscribed about two hours ago. So far NYTimes app and web version have not recognized me as a subscriber. NYT help person on the phone told me NYT can't help me because I went through Google Play, and that I should have subscribed through the NYT web site. This is a waste of time,and it's too bad it involves a reputable company such as the NYT.",
"If you accidentally rotate your phone slightly and it switches from portrait to landscape mode, it loses your place as soon as you rotate back. Have been asking for a fix for months. Come on, NY Times, please fix this already.",
"Always asks for a subscription, more often then not when I click on an article, even though I am logged in with my local library's ""free pass"", and the pass is current for the week. Also doesn't open up current article from Chrome to the app. Always takes me to my last read article.",
Excellent journalism and generally good app. Terrible experience cancelling a subscription: you need to either chat live with an agent (but the chat does not work properly) or call a phone number. Unethical Dark Pattern you should change immediately. Even more so when your journalism criticizes (rightly so) other companies for similar sneaky behavior.,
"Janky and slow on a modern phone; just trying to scroll through an article is painful, and navigating into articles and back takes several seconds. I find this extremely distracting and unpleasant to use.",
"The news is great, as is the opinion section (I subscribed for Paul Krugman). Did something happen to the Android widget? I switched phones, and now I can't find it; it was a great feature, and I hope this is just a bug. Its return would bump my review back up to a 5-star. Thanks!",
"App is so so. When expanding notifications in the notification area they often morph into a different story. Notifications can also become backlogged, popping up a dozen at once when the app is opened.",
"Extremely difficult to cancel my digital subscription. Instead of having a cancel button like other apps, I had to go through a chat bot and waited 10 mins to talk to a human who sent me an essay convincing me to stay. What a painful experience.",
"The top articles, plus information... truth in reporting. It doesn't get any better than this. Additionally, if it is an opinion, they tell you it's an opinion. Thank you, New York Times. As a retired, limited mobility individual you bring my world to me - this means more than you can imagine. From Florida, Thank You again, MMC",
"When I pay for a premium service, the last thing I want to see is incessant, intrusive advertising. Can you say ""double jeopardy""? I'm uninstalling the app, and will most likely cancel my subscription. Having ad content shoved in my face constantly is insulting, and does not override the Times journalistic value.",
After reading a few articles it becomes impossible to load any more. I've deleted the app and reinstalled and still the same. After a year and a half of no problems now it keeps crashing.,
"Despite having paid for the monthly subscription, I cannot access materials. The subscription pop up is displayed and on clicking shows that I have already subscribed. I have written to the app feedback, but no results. 4th day. Pathetic and disappointing.",
I value the attention to detail and the quality of data and research,
"No search function, no full content",
"Real reporting, real facts, opinions noted as such. Like the news used to be before ridiculous politicization.",
"This app works very well on my Huawai Media Pad T3 10 even on a slow 3Mbs connection. Takes about 6 seconds to initially load, but after that all articles load quickly, no lag, no lockups. I experienced none of the problems noted on several of the latest reviews. The sign up process was quck and easy and they have a special first year rate. I went to the NYT to get more balanced and professional articles unlike the mixed bag of bubbled up blogs presented by Google News.",
"Beware the scam. I registered for NYT under a special USD 10 for first year. I accepted this, but opted to pay via Paypal (my paypal account is linked to australian credit card, but i dont live in australia). These guys then proceeded to deduct AUD20 forn my paypal without informing me (a 50% increase in the agreed upon price). And they also informed me that future annual subscritptions would have a similar price increase. So be wary. I wont renew my subscription becuase cant trust these guys.",
"Seems to have issues keeping me logged in. I am getting the banner over the story that says ""You have used up all your free articles for the month"" or whatever, I'll log in for the billionth time, and it'll take me back to the article with the banner still over it, disallowing me to read it. And I know my account is good, because I can read the stories when logged in on a computer. In addition, still having the issues with push notifications not redirecting to the story that it's about.",
Discovered 10 months of recurring monthly charges for this service from Google Play. Canceled on NYT website immediately after reading one article while Google Play proceeded to ghost charged me for a service I didn't use on a platform I never used it on. I didn't even have the app downloaded.,
Why does it suddenly say my device is offline every 5 seconds? I've already uninstalled and reinstalled it twice on my phone,
"I was a long time supporter of the Times, but their shift to a definitive leftist bias over the past few years has made me step back from viewing them as a trusted source. Still a great tool for research and keeping abreast of particular events but nearly everything they print now needs to be filtered out of their lend they've applied to what they call ""journalism.""",
"The content and the layout are great. However, offline reading does not work. What is the purpose of having offline reading settings if the content is not available? I live in New York and read news on the subway, which will be fully internet enabled in... 2032. Could you guys provide real offline functionality until then please?",
"New York Times supplies some of the most informative, real, unbiased articles available. I get more from them than almost any other source of news. The writing is superbly researched, written and executed. I have never been let down by New York Times and I highly recommend them to those that wish to educate themselves, stay informed, be aware and keep their heads above the cacaphony of misinformation that we are forced to endure on the daily.",
The New York Times covers the news in depth and with excellent detail and balance.,
"I've been a subscriber of the NYT via Google Play for 3 years. Over the past year, the app no longer recognizes my subscription and asks me to log in before I can read articles. NYT customer service tells me that I don't have a subscription and to take it up with Google. Not worth the hassle, NYT no longer deserves my money or attention.",
"Facts and in-depth reporting have been essential during a time of corruption, lies, and an attempted coup by none other than the US president himself. The paper has made mistakes in the past yet without all of the brave reporting I'm not sure where this country would be now. I'm appreciative of this and many other publications here and around the world helping hold down democracy. Without the free press, we would be an authoritarian country. Support local newspapers too they are essential.",
*** If you want the NYTimes go directly to the NYTimes*** Do Not get this app through Google Play.  This app was clearly not what I thought I was buying on day one so I called Google to get it worked out.  They suggested I call the NYTimes  which I did and since it did not show I had an account with them they sent me back to Google Play - Wash Rinse Repeat during the week.  Seven Days later I spent another hour on the phone with the Google Play call center in the Philippines and asked to cancel my $125 subscription since I was not getting the features I expected.. They said no  I could not get a refund because it had been more than two days.  This despite my call on day one.   Now I have cancelled the app on line but it will not expire for one full year!  So I am paying for a product that is not delivering as promised.  This is certainly not customer service and is a bad omen for the future of Google.  And I still have to spend $150 to get the NYTimes account I expected initially.,
"This is a great app, and a nice Adjunct to the paper addition. I've used this app for years, relying on the widget to give me real time news. I woke this morning to discover the widget is missing. Please tell me this is a mistake and not permanent. Give me back my widet, please! I've replaced my real time news widget with the Washington Post for now, but please bring back the NYT widget. It's the best!",
"Some of the really low quality articles are making me rethink my subscription. Way too many Trump articles. It's like they haven't moved on. I'm sure he loves the attention, but I'm sick of that guy. Not much on the current administration nor the economy or inflation. And the latest article saying mental illness and gun violence doesn't go hand in hand is just dangerous. It would be great if users could curate topics that interest the user. And why is there no dark mode?",
"NYT app crashes about 60% of the time, soon after startup. The Wall Street Journal app never crashes on the same phone. Why would I ever buy a subscription for the New York Times when their app is so unreliable?",
Really attractive and useable. Only complaint is that tapping the notifications doesn't take you to the specific story. It just opens the app to the home screen. Otherwise very good.,
Excellent article about air quality. Al Gore has been right all along.,
Can't read it anymore. They took away the ability to enlarge the font size. Content is no longer accessible. Plus the app over rides attempts of accomodation via phone settings.,
"NYT sends regular emails to resubscribe. Eventually, after ignoring them for several years, I decide to resubscribe. I follow the link provided in the latest email. It tells me ""an error occurred"". Why ask to resubscribe if the link doesn't work?",
"Absolutely horrible. They nag you repeatedly on the mobile version of the website to download the app, then you get no additional content in the app while giving up personal information for their reselling and analysis purposes. I already pay for a subscription, but apparently that's just not enough, they need to sell my information as well.",
Works pretty well. sometimes confusing how to save articles as the save button my show up in different places depending on type of content. Also find the search bar hard to find...finally found it in the sections menu option,
Comments almost never load. Sharing ofteb doesn't work. Overall just generally pretty buggy for a major app. I enjoy reading the articled but the app needs a lot of improvement. I often need to read through the web browser to find what I'm looking for.,
I want my old version back. You cannot read an entire article or go to the morning in review without the app freezing and then going off entirely. I am a paying NYT subscriber and am getting totally frustrated! Please fix it!,
Really horrible execution on this app. The night mode doesn't work for direct links into the app and the scrolling is often inconsistent and frustrating. Doesn't hold a candle to the Washington Post or axios apps.,
"Edit: this app has vastly improved. After years of avoiding the NYT paywall by using incognito windows, I finally wanted to pay for the quality journalism I've come to love and expect from them. I got super excited to finally be in the elite club of my friends who had the app and unfettered access to the site's content. And the app is amazing... when it loads. I waited till this last update to write this review, but content still loads slow. Bummer, but I'll still pay to support.",
"One of the better papers but sometimes falls into familiar journalistic ruts such as the Both Sides game. Or tone deafness such as chasing after Trump voters but seemingly never asking Hillary voters anything. Deep investigations are usually great. Arts, Science, ey al sections are fabulous. As are the puzzles.",
"I love that there are articles and op-eds on so many different topics. I can read for hours learning about all so many different topics. World news, local news, education, COVID-19, TV, movies, technology, business, the list is almost endless.",
"High quality content for peanuts. 60 rs per month is a great deal. More than the app, I listen to podcasts which are free anyway. Op-ed section is slightly biasing itself towards the left but very often, the news is on point and unbiased.",
"Easy to use app. Homepage features 10 or less top articles, then you need to look around. I do wish it was a little easier to search for specific topics/subjects, but it can be done.",
"Been glitchy lately. I get a notification that has the beginning of one headline, but then when I expand the notification, it is a different one. It seems to take me to the original headline's associated article.",
"This app used to work fine, but now it's extremely slow and doesn't load content reliably. Please fix it or I will be forced to cancel my subscription. UPDATE: I just removed, then re-installed the app and things have improved a bit. Let's see if that was a fix. You can't expect millions of subscribers to do this do you?",
"I really like the way the NYT viewpoint, with high standards of journalism that I feel I can trust. I like the reporting of stories about the rich diversity of cultures that are represented, and not only in NY. It is mind broadening. The app works well, too.",
"Good, reliable app overall. Search is so so. Dark mode was a very good idea and I hope it is back soon. Without dark it is much too bright for my comfort. Looks like other experiments are also gone.",
"Recently, after an Android security update on my Samsung Galaxy s8, the widget has disappeared. I haven't been able to get access to a replacement and would like it to be reinstated and its disappearance explained. Thanks!",
"Love the NYT but the app is ridiculous - everytime I push the link button to subscribe to NYT the app closes out and prohibits signing up!! That's been for 3 days now. The disruptive ads are those that say ""you've used up your free articles - gives subscription pop up and then refuses to let you subscribe!",
"Love the app. Content is one of the greatest. So many sections. The only ask I have - took me forever to find ""Saved for later"" as it was hidden along a long list of sections. I would expect it in some more common (user) area.",
"What really irks me is that when you tap on a news post or breaking news notification on your phone, it just takes you to the main page of the app and you have to manually search for the article. And often times it's really hard to find!!!",
"Even after paying for my digital subscription and working with customer support, I'm not able to access articles and am repeatedly asked to subscribe. I was also told that digital subscriptions cannot be refunded so basically this seems to mean that I gave to forfeit my paid amount because of buggy issue with this app. 😡",
"Straight up truth telling. Incredible investigative journalism. Broad range of interesting topics. I really like being able to customize my favorite topics, politics, science, health and climate, for easy access. Simply the best.",
"I couldn't praise the NYT enough, so I need only say that subscribing is definitely worth your money. The app is generally good, apart from the ocasional crashes and some issues with notifications.",
"The app is borderline unusable in it's current state. It does not actually save all the content for offline reading instead either never loading or saying ""device offline try again later"". And yes my settings are correct.",
"Its The Times, so the content is great. That said, I dont like the recommendation section and find the world news an afterthought in the apps layout. Id love to have more control over the tabs of the app.",
"The widget was a huge part of why the NYT app turned into my first reads. I've been using alternatives ever since, and I find myself in the NYT app a lot less. Pulling the widget without a replacement ready to go was a pretty bad call.",
I like the non-opinion politics articles and that's about it. I had to install this app on my phone because the mobile web address won't recognize my account. I pay a monthly subscription but I see as many ads as I would on a free news site. There is no search bar or any way of bookmarking stories.,
"If you load an article from anywhere outside the app, it says it can't load the article and to search for it instead. usually takes 4-5 tries for it to load. unusable unless you have it on its own.",
"Considering nyt's resources, I'm very surprised how inferior this app is. As soon as the phone tilts the story reloads to the very top! And without internet, text Is not loading. The guardian app doesn't have these issues. Amy story loads without internet. And is faster this app.",
"I live in rural Alabama, where I can only receive NYT paper subscription by mail, often missing timely news coverage. With the app, I can have up-to-date, superior NYT journalism at my fingertips in a few seconds.",
Great overall. I wish there was an easier way to quickly navigate without having to sometimes use the 'back' button' to get from an article back to the main page.,
I subscribed but when I attempted to read an article on FB I could not. If I found an article on FB then searched the app 9 out of 10 I could not find it without being very specific. Otherwise I love the journalism :),
"Great app! Only wish I could see which articles I read on desktop reflected on the app (with the faded headline). Also, wish there was a way to see which articles were in that days paper organized together, like on desktop",
"The ""For You"" section just keeps saying ""an error occured"" and not loading, reinstalling didnt help. Sometimes it says im offline when im not. The ""Most Popular"" section shows a loading spinner for a second, then it goes away and the screen is just blank.",
It keeps updating to a beta format and I have to reload for NY Times. Its in English and yes to your other questions. Ready to drop subscription. I have an OPPO phone and called NY Times and no help. If you don't have an I phone there don't know what to do.,
"I do love the NYT, but like tolerate the app. When you get a notification, of time has passed and you click on the article it doesn't take you to the article. I find this highly inefficient.",
"Just one year ago, the times was an opinion rag; in my opinion. The Times, has changed and, the return to it's roots is why I'm paying for access. My social security is less than $10K annually and my medicine costs almost that, plus the property taxes and government mandated auto insurance ... and I give money to, The New York Times, every month because I feel they earned it. Need I say more?",
"I am paying for a full subscription, and the app will not let me connect an account. Clicking ""connect account"" does nothing. I will cancel permanently if this is not addressed by the end of the month. I'm on a Pixel 5.",
Love the New York Times but hate the application... Seriously why can't they take a look at the Washington Post and follow them to build a robust application that works. This clunker is like a 1910 Model T in comparison. Who are their developers at the NYTImes. Wow. Wow its a hot cesspool despite the awesome content why does it have to block out everything else and then you can't navigate away. Its a POS. Use the web browser instead its actually way more functional......,
"Uninstalled due to lack of ""night mode"" as NYT customer service calls it. It's supposedly coming soon, but I'd rather use the mobile site in dark mode than the app. WSJ and WP have both had dark mode for a long time. NYT app development is behind the times.",
"Well-written, concise articles. Keeps one on top of things.",
"The New York Times is a newspaper like non other. I live in Michigan, read obsessively and I have not found another news source that competes with its coverage of the world. In my book it is the ""world's newspaper"". At the very least it is the USA's top news source. True it does not cover current local events in my city, but get beyond that parameter the NYTIMES has no match.",
"Frequently I find NYT articles that feel more like an opinion column with headlines intended to spin up emotion and stress instead of an article intended to convey facts. I despised trump, but entire headlines and articles were dedicated to White House turmoil rather than actually talking about the policy that day. the bias and drama aren't very palatable, but at least the facts are sourced. I'd like to find a paper that doesn't feel like a propaganda arm. The writing is high quality.",
"Pretty bad user experience. The app is slow, sometimes articles disappear, carousels are difficult to swipe. To enjoy the great NYT journalism, the mobile website is a far better option.",
If you are interested in accurate news then the New York Times is the read for you. When our genius president came to power and started talkin about fake news this would be the opposite. The New York Times has always been the real deal. Because I am not paying for the application I am plagued with pop up advertisements but that's what's to be expected.,
"Updating my payment is *impossible*. The app gives me messages that they couldn't process my payment. So I click the ""Update Payment"" button, which takes me to a page saying my payment is invalid, and links to Google Play support to update my subscription. The link just takes me to Google Play. The NYT is not listed in my subscriptions. The site has nowhere to let me subscribe through Play. Fix your system: all you need to do is retry payment, and it'll go through. Incompetent web devs you have.",
"The website kept telling me it would be better in the app. I just want to read the news, I don't need better notifications and I definitely don't want you watching over my shoulder as I read to optimize engagement. I pay you a subscription and put up with a ridiculous number of ads as it is but some greedy genius decided to ruin the experience even further to push a pointless app that nobody wants. Will uninstall once this review is posted",
"used to love the nyt app and availability on my phone. in the last 2 months though it has gotten slow and weird (freezes constantly, screen flickers, ads are super annoying). I pay for a subscription but plan to cancel because it has gotten really bad.",
"The scroll bar is only visible on dark backgrounds, such as images. Very disorienting when reading long articles (Oneplus 6, Android 11). I was quite happy with the beta app while it was available.",
"It's America's paper of record. Ask your grandparents what a ""newspaper"" was, and why they were once an important pillar of civilization.",
"So many parts of The NYT are solely worth the price. All together, it's a bargain. The opinion columns make sense of the news, the crossword puzzles and other word games are the best in the English language, and the in depth articles the finest in world of journalism.",
"Overall, I like this app. HOWEVER, today an ad from NBC advertising the Olympics is autoplaying, even when I'm not on wifi. This is unacceptable behavior, and I will abandon this app if this isn't fixed, and fixed quickly.",
"This app may not be optimized for this device. You ain't kiddin'. No good on Android, Oreo. Shame, it looked like it had lots of promise, too. Aw well; everything is falling apart these days. NYT sends emails with headlines and leaders. There is about a one in ten chance that one will be able to read the story. The rest of the time, it is ""Sorry Charley, only the finest albacore accepted here."" The screen is darkened and a pop up asks if you would like to view your options: no more.",
"I love the comprehensive, compelling articles! Keep up the good work!",
Love this paper. But the app constantly has a bar on the bottom that says Suscribe to NY Times even though I'm alresdy logged in as a subscriber with All Access. I don't like that it's blocking part of my reading area and screen real estate when it doesn't need to. It should know I'm a subscriber.,
"I only installed the app because the website keeps popping up prompts for it. When I first ran it I was given 2 choices: create a new account or login faster with google smart lock... Useless. I am a suscriber but I don't use a gmail account. First page next is ""For you - daily recommendations."" It might be good for people who want to read the ny times ""better"", but me, I don't care. I am uninstalling it now, I have wasted enough time.",
"What the point of removing night mode when you cannot replace it immediately. Couldn't you just leave it in place until the replacement was ready? What shoddy app development is this? Agree with most of the low ratings from anapp development perspective. Good journalism, but lack of professionalism to outsource the app and website development to a competent tech company.",
"For the am'ts charged... This app & it's UX could -and should- be sooo much better. It is not enough, for the content to be solid <--> excellent. I have gone into more detail about this in the past, apparently no-one cared. I see the avg review score has since fallen - quite precipitously. Doubt I'll be renewing...",
"Giving this 1 star because the mobile site constantly bugs you to install the app. Once I say 'no', the site should just leave me alone. I'm a paying customer, NYT should be giving me a better experience, not annoying me into submission. The only reason to so aggressively push the app is to make it easier to collect data from the user.",
"Search function is poor. They leave a lot out from the subscription, constantly asking you to upgrade for $, many teaser articles. Wish paying for a subscription was enough to satisfy their greed. Extreme liberal bias. So liberal, they do not ever notice. Medical coverage not researched well due to novice medical expertise of some authors. Extremely hard to share articles, they do not want you to discuss anything without paying more first.",
This 14th Amendment piece is yet another pin to deflate the bombastic balloon that is Trump. If only...,
"I love The New York Times, but unfortunately I can't afford a subscription so now I just get a tease from great headlines because I have read all my ""free articles."" I'll be deleting this app but that's just a personal thing, if I could afford the subscription I'd keep it and use it regularly, probably so much as it could be a problem lol.",
I read it everyday and is my primary source of news. Warning to MAGA people. It contains actually facts.,
Great writing! Timely reporting! Wonderful columnists! Paul Krugman is the best at economic/political analysis! David Brooks brings humanity into the political realm. I love reading the Times on my phone because I get updates and breaking news all day long. Thank you for providing all the news that is fit to print.,
"Well this app is redundancy on top of redundancy. Not only you can see the news in tv, pc, or mobile browser for free, you can also pay real money to see the exact same news! But here's the catch, on top of paying Real Money!!! You'll also see ads with it!!! If this is not journalism in the 21st century I dont know what is :D. 1 star cause no dark mode.",
very disappointed. Switched from IOS to Pixel 3 and find this app crashes or hangs almost every time i use it. Very frustrating. I can read the headlinea but often when clicking to the story the page does not load. kind if useless.,
"Mini-Crossword has been fixed, but now the top of articles (title and first paragraph) are in white, making it difficult to read. Now the dark mode seems to be missing.",
"Decent for news but the search functionality sucks and if you want to cancel your subscription you have to uninstall the app first and do so through the browser, because their chat function in the app doesn't work with the Android keyboard properly so it's useless",
iOS favoritism. Android app is 2nd class and audio app not available. Please fix.,
"Beta version is not even working and it was a auto update to beta version on my phone, once updated it no longer worked, reason was version of app has expired and had to reinstall app, now i had reinstall like 5 time, i had tried to change the setting in app but still it was automatically updated, I just want to read decent news, opt me out from beta version it is useless",
"I am an avid reader of the NYT and I use this app quite a bit. It appears that Dark mode has completely disappeared, which is frustrating because the Washington Post app has Dark mode across the application without any issues. I would give it 5 stars at least for what I use it for if there was Dark mode.",
"I haven't been able to get articles to open at all. I can see titles for articles, but after trying to open them, the content is not present. I paid for a subscription that I really need & this is pure frustration. Please fix this app!",
I never understood the need to download a news app until I've used the Times'. I find myself preferring it over time on Instagram or Twitter. Quality content in such rich formats and crosswords and so on. Highly recommended!,
Constantly updating. Very annoying. So are the videos. I have asked the app to not auto play videos. They play anyway. Too bad the app doesn't live up to the journalism.,
"NYTimes articles are the gold standard for vetting stories to give information closest to the truth. if you are a skeptic, skip any opinion articles, and compare the research NYT articles require before publishing with your 'trusted' source of news. An honest comparison will show you very few institutions are at the NYT level. I am an independent, and don't view myself in the woke camp.",
"The talented writers give us all the news, good and bad, in a well written, straightforward manner. Yet there is also a deep compassion for the words written, bringing forth the human experience in every story.",
Generally a stable and accessible application. I would like to see a feature like the Washinton Post's e-version of the day's physical newspaper to help remove my reading biases expressed by the search algorithms.,
Refreshes every time I go back to main page to select another article. That means scrolling down Again to the section I was in. Plus ads are slow loading so text on page moves just when I go to pick an article. It has become unusable.,
The full keboard is not displayed for the crossword puzzle. My phone is a Galaxy S9 with the most current update. It is really difficult to work a crossword puzzle when you are missing 7 letters of the alphabet.,
"Since the update on 2/22/2021, half of the keyboard in the crossword and the mini are missing, with no option to scroll the screen up to access the lower part of the keyboard. Using Samsung S10.",
Worst app ever! I have never had an app that crashed fives times in a row upon opening. Nothing wrong with the tablet. Must cancel. This after a couple of years of no problems.,
"I get alerts about particular news stories, but when I click an alert that interests me, it doesn't take me to the story, it just opens the app. But then I can't even find said story when I scroll through the headlines.",
"App has inconsistent notifications. I never get a notification for some things I want and can't find them in the app, e.g. the Morning Briefing. There is no search function or easy way to go from one section to another.",
I pay for this and notifications NEVER take me to the article. Edit: a year later and same issue. Notifications on this app are incredibly annoying. And now I can't find a way to change my subscription type so I'm just cancelling,
Update is terrible. You can not easily swipe between articles or sections. Push notifications do not load. Home screen is not the equivalent of the front page. Useless is kind. Honset description obscured by inability to post expletives.,
"I love the NY Times. My dad was a NYT reader and no matter where he was always found the Times to read. I am grateful in this digital age I don't need to go in search for it. I like the variety of stories, the opinion pieces and the recipes. In this crazy time we are living in it is nice to have a reliable source of news.",
"NYT App is a dumpster fire. No dark mode, buggy, battery-draining, poor/inconsistent menus. This is the embodiment of bad mobile app design. The eye strain from reading for more than 5 minutes is unbearable.",
"The latest update ruined the app. It won't load, or if it does it crashes immediately. Reinstalling fixes the problem, but only for a day or so, then it crashes again.",
you tap on a notification and it opens the article with picture highlighted. the text is blacked out. Even if you tap on the text nothing changes! Disappointing for paying every month!,
"I love the news, so I will give a high rating, but the crossword games are unplayable in the app because the keyboard is under the phone's back buttons. This is part of what I wanted to enjoy with my subscription. And they have no way to give them feedback so I can't even tell them that the app is broken.",
Fascinating! Like a plot to a disaster movie- only more plausible and real!,
"Excellent, high quality journalism in an easy to use application.",
I love many of their podcasts but lately some of the NYT reporting has been disappointing,
January 6th was an insurrection! Any spin to try to play victims is categorically untrue! A full viewing of the videos will make it clear!,
Exceptional reporting. High quality journalism. Worth every cent.,
Absolutely fantastic app from perhaps the best newspaper in the world.,
"Well written article. thank you, NYT reporting the differences of the two African American justices viewpoints on race history. I hope to see more reporting like this.",
"absurdly buggy. long articles will randomly reload and scroll back to the top. tapping notifications frequently brings up a blank white screen, an error, or an entirely different story.",
"Quality News! The best,indepth and comprehensive analysis,ever!",
"App doesn't refresh, I see the same headlines 5 days running.",
excellent article .very helpful visuals. I'll give it a try,
"this app is the absolute worst way go read the times. like honestly half the time it says you have a subscription (I do) and won't let you read anything, the other half itll crash, upon relaunch and trying to reopen the article it'll just launch in browser. ABSOLUTE TRASH",
"Consistently great reporting: factual, penetrating and consequential.",
mostly unbiased news source with an user friendly app.,
"This has become the most frustratingly unreliable app since the most recent updates. Articles frequently do not load, and this morning the entire page was blank when I opened the app to read the morning news. Simpler was better.",
The For You section doesn't load. I am a subscriber and it says an error occurred. The only way i can get to all my saved content is to login a 2nd time and then click on manage subscription. Absolute rubbish.,
"Still the paper of record for our country. Great editorials and a broad range of excellent op-ed writers. The morning summary is as essential as a cup of coffee. The ""Well"" section is always interesting and informative.",
"Never crashes. Loads quickly and cleanly. App is well Laid out and easy to navigate. the notifications usually are specific to what you choose in the app, so no worthless notifications.",
"I read the Times every day, often using this app. The app is easy to use and generally bug- and glitch-free. Make no mistake, I prefer reading the Times on my laptop and desktop, but the app is convenient and usually reliable.",
"BEWARE: if you want to cancel your subscription they make you chat with a chat bot in a browser window, then you have to wait for a specialist... with the browser window open (can't leave the page or it will disconnect the chat). I waited for 10 minutes and then i gave up. We should be able to cancel our subscriptions on the site.. without needing to talk with a specialist, is this a cult?",
For some reason this app doesn't process when I am reading for free through my library. On my Chromebook there's no problem though. It doesn't really make sense because I'm logged into the same account on each device.,
"Keeps crashing with no explanation in all aspects of the app, and if it doesn't crash, instead it goes to the home page, leaving whatever I was doing. Terrible.",
"Can't connect my account for ""full access"", the button literally doesn't work in the app. When I tried to login on the website, it just created a new account and doesn't recognize my subscription, even though I got it through the Google account I logged in with.",
"Poorly designed ui, though looks pretty. One example is the inability to go to a specific article, even if I have the link. I would have to try and search for it. Maddening",
"Usually great with excellent articles and puzzles... when it works. Lately it crashes constantly, hard to even finish an article. Five stars if it decides to start working again.",
"This review is not regarding Nytimes but the app. They built one ridiculous app. Which has to uninstalled and reinstalled again every couple of days as the latest version is available. It doesn't auto update, or if you update manually does not recognize the update.",
"Two very annoying disruptive and distracting behaviors. 1. Asynchronous, un requested refresh while reading the overviews causes resets to the top of the page. 2. Scrollbar jitter while at a static area of an article as ads alternately change layout on obscured areas of the screen.",
"Recently I have noticed that the New York Times changes Like the Wind. At one time they were the Great Grey Lady, not anymore. Better to invest your subscription money into a newspaper with some intestinal fortitude. Also the app sucks.",
"I subscribe to the new york times and was looking forward to using the app. It only wants to let me log in with my google or facebook accounts . My account is under something different. I cannot get past the login screen asking for my google or facebook accounts. I have had to uninstall the app and use the browser instead. As a subscriber, I am disappointed.",
"The best thing that I did during the pandemic was to get a subscription to the New York Times, and start reading articles not only about the pandemic, but about all sorts of things, including an article today about how exercise appears to make older adults brains and memory work better than when we remain sedentary. What a wonderful resource this publication is, it makes me more informed about and connected to all things in this world.",
"Frequently stalls and does not load articles, loses all content when phone moves from portrait to landscape or vice versa. This app makes a digital Times subscription almost a waste of time.",
"l am very conservative but have found the NY Times reporting and opinion articles to be consistently thought provoking without the emotional fear mongering rhetoric and untruths propagated by so-called conservative media. In these difficult times, we need truth more than ever. I will continue to support responsible journalism and opinion pieces as an essential institution of our democracy.",
"Poor operation of the app. Every time I click on an article, I get an error message "" nyt stopped working "" and it closes the whole thing. After paying for the service I can't use, I'm ready to change to the Washington post. .",
FRAUD ALERT! I've cancelled my subscription and several times NYTimes tried to bill me afterwards. Even after twice escalating and getting a promise that I was removed from their system. Exceptionally abysmal. Do not subscribe!,
Ads cause lag. Anytime scrolling over an ad the app lags and stutters and sometimes I have to restart the app to get it to work again. The developers need to fix this issue - it's been a problem for years.,
"Displays ads despite me paying for a subscription. Also there's a very annoying bug that sends me notifications even though I have it set to ""silent"" in the app's settings.",
The morning briefing notification rarely shows up even though it is checked. Often pictures are not shown either. More notification options would be great and additional categories like smarter living.,
The notifications headlines rarely ever link to the article and there is no way to search. It drives me crazy. I finally just turned off the notifications.,
"Problems again and again. This app is so buggy recently, for over a year it was great but now stories won't load until I delete and reinstall it. After a couple weeks the same thing happens.",
"Impossible to read as the app is updating frequently. Impossible to get through an article. Not returned to previous place in an article after an update, nor for that matter, to the same category. Infuriating.",
"Okay - love articles... don't mind the Breaking News can be redundant BUT so hate that when I click a notification it often does NOT go to that article but, instead, the lady article I had open. I am done with that article... show me the new one I clicked on. Duh.",
A great newspaper with top notch reporting that both informs and expands one's perspective.,
"always reliable, always on top of news",
"Notifications need work. Constantly getting notifications that link to the wrong story. Super annoying. Also, says it is up to date until the minute your plane leaves the ground.",
hangs and crashes about 1/3 of the time i use it. this has been my experience on the last 3 phones I've used it on. ok when it works. perhaps find another way to access the Time's important content.,
"Some of the best news in the world that's unfortunately marred by a heinous amount of ads. Nine ads in the middle of a single article is beyond insane, especially for a paid subscriber! Use a web browser with ads blocker instead.",
"Problems loading stories I'm experiencing the same recent problem other users are: failure to load a story or, if I clear my phone cache first, leaving only partial stories. I keep checking the play store looking for a fix, but none is available. Please resolve. I miss my NYT.",
"Doesn't allow for one or two articles a month anymore. Just a way for NYT to keep their claws dug in. Previously, there was a reason to use the app for the occasional article. People won't pay for individual articles *ever.* Once *all* articles are behind a paywall, NYT will lose relevancy as a mainstream news source. Just ask other paywall news sources (oh, you can't!) When people stop sharing NYT links, NYT will die. See if the printed copy will support you then. RIP NYT",
"The New York Times is not news. It's filled with opinion pieces that present themselves as news. It serves only to destroy the idea of American exceptionalism, and to ""reframe"", to use their own term, American history. They focus ten times more energy on promoting stories that paint this Nation as an evil entity, and hardly ever focus on the good that the US has and continues to do for the world and it's people. The New York Times is nothing but a propaganda machine.",
"I've been an NYT reader for awhile, however after switching to Android the stability of the android version of the app is TERRIBLE. Articles almost never load and I constantly have to resort to using the web version to read anything.",
"Can't cancel subscription because ""device is offline"" even though I can load all the news and otherwise access the internet.",
"The app doesn't have a short cut to the front page (or maybe I can't find it). I always have to press ""back"" through all articles I've read since last time that I've been on the front page to get back to the front page. So I've given up and just use the website.",
I Marcos Turner I am getting what I am seeking when it comes to NYTimes in the sense of breaking down concepts in a article form; merging comprehension and bringing fourth understanding to the followers; listeners (y.t.d) year-to-date..,
"Two new updates/features I have to give a big thumbs down to. I don't like that you now have to go to Settings to see if there are any comments on an article -- an unnecessary extra step. Far worse is the new ""For You"" section, which has replaced my ability to arrange the site's sections the way I want. Don't take away users' control over their own reading experience. Don't be like Facebook!",
"Fascinating. I have been sleeping with my mouth taped, as recommended by my DDS. better for my sleep and the dry mouth.",
NYTimes app fails to adapt. I can't even provide a review without limitations. I have google news app. the google app is quick and ahead of nytimes. i have to rely on google news to let me know what ny times has reported. ny times doesnt always alert it's buyers of new stories. they pick and choose.,
"Generally decent news app, but ads load slower than text, disrupting the newsfeed scrolling. Bigger issue is how much storage it eats up in user data. Not sure why, since I have very few personalized settings.",
Overall easy to use and navigate on a small screen. Few persistent glitches like not fully downloading content for offline reading and notifications consistently linking to the wrong articles makes me only give this app four stars.,
This app has gotten really bad recently. It closes randomly and freezes up. Overall the user experience has gone from great to terrible. I will be using the wapo app until it is fixed.,
The app would consistently hang when opening articles from email. When this happened I would get a blank white screen and it would not respond to the back button. I gave up and uninstalled it.,
"Overall excellent experience in using the app. Only one major drawback is that the free subscription of the newspaper is too low, it should be increased because there are a hell lot of avid readers across the globe using this newspaper.",
I've been using the app for years without promblem until a week or two ago. Now app crashes regularly and/or functions differently from day to day. Mini-crossword crashes everyday.,
Bring back the ability to adjust font size within the app. Having to go into accessibility to change the global font size is not acceptable. This is a nonsensical change that degrades the usability of the app.,
"This app is an easy, fast way to find out what is happening in the world.",
Worked well on my Galaxy S9. On my new s10+ there are numerous errors and display issues. The text is often unreadable. i get errors that article could not be retrieved. Basically unusable now.,
"Night mode gone. Forced scroll to top. Way more crashes, especially with games. NYTimes is great, this app *was* ok. This last update made the app terrible. Please roll back the last update, it added nothing and broke so much.",
Get rid of the autoplay ads. They pause any audio I have on in the background. This causes me to not read the nyt when I have audio on. This means I'm now looking at the ads even less. Get rid of autoplay ads.,
"NYT journalists deserve a better app and so do readers. If it weren't for superior content would rate lower. Works on my LG 6 phone but no longer Galaxy tablet. What gives? Update 6/12/2021: after a period of normalcy, no longer loads at all. Update 8/15 After working for a couple of months now getting an ad blocking content that insists I subscribe. I am already subscribed and signed in.",
"when it comes to a thorough analysis of the news, and incredibly deep and meaningful data, the NY Times has few peers. The one thing I would like is for more diverse, left and right, opinion pieces to encourage healthy debate",
"I love the NYT and it's app. especially, now when we need so much truth in media and reporting. I subscribe because I want to support the newspaper even though I know paper newspapers are on the decline. it's my way of saying thank you . thank you for everything they do.",
"Please refine your definition of ""breaking news"". I had to turn this notification off due to regular updates about e-cigarettes and other non-breaking news. Now unfortunately, if there is real breaking news I'm going to miss the notification.",
started happening several months ago! the app/article will 'reload/refersh' on its own. also will slow down to a crawl then crash! am using Android phone. nytimes help your subscribers by getting a real programmer instead of a dabbler!,
Breaking news tends to be news that may be breaking but is not necessarily important enough for a news alert. It gets annoying. Is there any way to adjust my sets for specific news only or is it either or off? Because right now it's staying off.,
"Glitchy, at least on a Galaxy Tab S3. Scrolling is so bad that at times I cannot get to the end of the article. Content, of course, is great, but the tech needs work.",
Got a new phone when the one with my NYT subscription was stolen. There was no option i could see to enter password... I think i might have accidently agreed to pay for a second subscription. It shouldn't be this hard!,
"Since updating app, articles won't open! When clicking on them, screen flickers, then nothing. Have re started phone. If I can't use the app, will end my subscription!!",
"Between the NYT, Wall Street Jounal and Minneapilis Star Tribune, I get a comprehensive and comparative view of the days news of the world.",
"First 24 hours of running, DuckDuckGo app tracking blocker stopped 365 attempts by NYT to sell my data to the following tracking networks: DataDog, Google, comScore, functional software and Twitter. More than any other app on my phone. If NYT can't make a profit off the money I pay without selling out my data for pennies literally hundreds of times a day, you're going to lose both my money and my data.",
"Dear dev team—please debug! App was fine for me until the latest update. Once I updated, the app slowed my phone down and was burning through my battery even when the app itself wasn't open. Love my NYT subscription, and have enjoyed the app so far!",
"I trully adore the NYT!!! To the point that I close an eye on the fact that sold me a 50p monthly membershio (0.05 gbp) and it rather charges me £2. Its journalism is worth much more, so it's fine, and I hope the increments they get go to salaries rises for their amazing journalists. Their monthly news briefing is great (even if since covid arrived in Europe and US it's a bit too much its covering). I also love the fact that they're advertisment is OK: I will even subscribe to a service they advertised, clicking on their advert in the monthly briefing (as soon as I get paid in a few days). it's not outrageouly disgusting as the advertisement that I get on CNN, which honestly revolts me (CNN adverts are powered by Google, and I get adds with photos of dirty toilets - vomitable - of orange staff coming out of ears - really really revolting - and rasors!!! I'm a woman, I never ever browse such items or disgusting staff!)",
"I love the content, but this app uses way too much cellular data. I selected do not autoplay videos in settings, and yet videos still autoplay. It seems most of my data savings settings are being ignored.",
the mist detailed and unexpected news in the world,
"As a yoga therapist who works with assault and acute trauma, this is essential reading. I hope all fields of practitioners see this article. Thanks to the author for her devoted work. Diana Tokaji, author of Surviving Assault.",
"When this app is working its beautifully laid out and easy to read. Unfortunately, it is often unstable on my new Samsung Tab A and either crashes or reloads causing me to lose my place.",
"All media has a bias as it is written by humans who form their own opinions. The NYT is a very strong, healthy news organization and I love both the reporting and opinions. The app works great, capturing links and redirecting to the app for better content. A monthly subscription that can be shared with one other, is a great deal.",
"The daily summaries are so great, and the variety and depth of topics available are so exciting that I wouldn't like to live without it. Highly recommended for factual critical and broad journalism.",
"Frequently fails to start,often closes when you try to move to a different story or even scroll down the page. Have reported this, uninstalledand reinstalled multiple times. Doing so now after multiple issues today.",
"this is the most affordable high quality resource I know. you can share articles to friends for free without having them log in or join. Because I live in central Connecticut, I also have a subscription app to Hartford Courant- which has an advantage of highlighting local news- for a more expensive price. NYT is such a deal.",
"This app is always buggy. Articles fail to open regularly. For a paid subscription, you'd think the app would work better than most free applications, but maybe my expectations are set too high for a news app...i just want to read the news",
"The app is great for a weekday read, but I still read the paper edition on Sunday. The NYTIMES facilitates national and international connections to the arts, politics, science, world events... and helps me understand WHY they're relevant and important. The Times influences HOW to think, but not WHAT to think.",
"Love the paper, hate the app. When I click on a breaking news alert, it takes me to the main page - and often that story can't be found. It's incredibly frustrating.",
"The app occasionally suffers hangups/failure to load/that sort of thing, but it's rare and overall the value of having easy access to the Times, especially in these strange days, cannot be overstated.",
"Well you see, there's right wing and left wing. This one is left leaning most of the time(which is fine) and extremely left for certain content (Strong prejudice to the point it becomes ""just hatred""). As a media, factual analysis should be the norm. But, certain bias is expected of almost all news outlets. American media is probably the worst of them all.",
"The stories/content doesn't update regularly, which is frustrating considering I pay for the digital subscription. I have to go to the Nytimes website (outside of the app) to read updated headlines.",
"The widget got removed and i can't find it anymore. I can't believe why it would be removed, it does nothing to change the functionality of the app and just ruined the experience for me on Android. Going to uninstall it because that's the main reason I had the app on my phone.",
I've tried several times to cancel a NYTimes subscription to no avail. It's seemingly impossible to cancel and i keep getting jerked around by Google and NY Times both pointing fingers at each other. Google's cancellation instructions DON'T WORK!!!!,
"Articles are great. Viewing experience is ok, not great. Doesn't present as a paper, instead topics. Do not purchase a cooking subscription before verifying the app works on your device. There are no refunds.",
"It's a must read paper only if balanced with non navel-watching rags since it seems to studiously avoid both Bronx and Caribbean news. Its news focus lacks recognition of Latin American nations' populations despite their large numbers in the Bronx, in New York City and in the rest of the nation. it's no wonder the Bronx was the last borough to receive Covid19 vaccines. The NYT blindness adds to the deafness of the city government's general neglect for those same migrant groups.",
"Total waste of money. I paid for a year's subscription but neither the NYT app nor website recognizes me a subscriber. Google account won't link. This is a known issue since 2019, but NYT can't fix it and Google Play refused refund request, so I'm out sixty bucks.",
"I prefer my lectures at church on Sundays, not perusing a news site (sic). I can't hold the developers accountable for the slanted news presented but... there's not ONE response from them below to anyone having issues with the app that THEY are responsible for. Not one. I don't see that often, and that says a lot. If they don't care about their own app, why should I?",
I keep signing up for the New York Times through Google I've already paid them two times in one month and when I open the app or try to read online it says that I need to subscribe and shows me payment options. Even though I've already paid twice this month!!,
"Customer support cancelled my entire subscription and that option is no longer offered. The app is not great, the same problems aren't fixed for years. I think the company is too busy buying Wordle and moving into new media to care.",
"I really like the NYT widget, but they removed it several months ago. I really want to see the return of the widget. It's already programmed, I never experienced any bugs or issues with it, and I don't see the reason why it's no longer available.",
Very glitchy app. It frequently crashes or reloads articles while I am in the middle of reading them. Newest glitch is that the articles don't load when I open the app or a new section of the app.,
"Not objective in the writing, just way too influenced by the thinking trends of super liberals...i.e. Super judgemental. The app is annoyingly forceful about subscribing. The content layout could be better for mobile. Not enough multimedia. And then there is that whiney reporting thing again.",
"I may suggest hundreds of missing features, but I'll tell you to just go check out the Guardian app! New York Times is the best newspaper ever, how come you don't have the best app! You can do much better than that.",
"I canceled my subscription because it does not look good visually. It doesn't have a dark mode, and there are four to five advertisements displayed in most articles. The Guardian Newspaper app is my new go to for news.",
"A faithful representation of the web online NYTimes, the app makes quick searching and reading convenient, and notifications highlight key stories for later reading. For one living abroad, it adds value to my subscription, while helping me stay informed.",
"The July 2020 update now cuts off the bottom of the screen, which is a problem for the games and some graphics/charts (like the covid maps). Please fix.",
"The nytimes app is a terrible bandwidth hog. Reading a few articles a week results in over 100 mb of downloaded data. Of course, that data is only used for advertising as the news content is of high quality but insignificant in size. Bombarding paying users with ads and wasting their mobile bandwidth is fairly reckless behavior.",
"My toddler pressed two buttons without me noticing and suddenly I was subscribed to something costing me money every month. Don't even know what it is. I know I shouldn't leave my phone unattended, but there should really be more safety standards than this. At least a confirmation by email. I'm very disappointed.",
"I can never follow links into the app, even from the apps own notifications. They always glitch and return to the homepage. Then I have to search for the story if I'm interested in reading it.",
"The app and login system are just bad. I'm constantly logged out, and it never opens the app from a story, and tries to get you to install the already installed app. Super glitchy. Still true as of early feb.",
"Just uninstalled and reinstalling. The app has started scrolling on its own, unprompted. And I was recently unable to read anything on a flight, no idea why. Think there are now some bugs that need sorting.",
"Great content. Pretty good app. Content aside, the measure of a news medium's app is based on whether they can render the content correctly, which this does well. One slight Improvement would be making it easier to scan the different sections.",
Wonderful source of reliable and trustworty information!,
"To put it simply The New York Times doesn't understand digital editions. I told them many times, but they just ignore it. A great injustice to their excellent reporters and a pity for readers.",
"When you click a new notification, it doesn't always bring you to the article in the notification. Support says they are aware, but how long could this really take to fix? Others here say this issue has lasted for a long time.",
"Terrible customer service. Tried cancelling the service and instead was charged for another month. Took multiple attempts and talking to three different representatives to properly cancel the subscription and never recieves a refund because after being assured by several customer service reps, I was told that NYT does not issue refunds. You can keep my $17. This is the scamiest set up I've ever seen. New York times should be ashamed of this practices just to make a few bucks.",
Total battery hog. It's incredible that an app meant to replace a static piece of paper can be the most resource intensive app on my phone. Just use the website.,
"Without a doubt the worst app I have ever used. It crashes at least twice a day, and freezes on a regular basis. I have paid for access since the NYT raised a pay-wall, but constantly ask myself ""Is this really worth the aggravation?""",
"The app is quite buggy. is doesn't cache frequently while on WiFi and plugged into power, theres lots of times when I just can't scroll down or ads load while scrolling, anf sometimes it just won't load any articles.",
"While I'm a fan of the NYT, the app no longer works properly on my Android. Words disappear halfway through a story, or the content won't download at all. PLEASE correct this. I need my NYT fix!",
"App on my Chromebook is really problematic. Sometimes I can't scroll down an article (little ""hand"" icon appears) and lately the photos don't load. Am uninstalling it and going in via browser.",
"app is fine but every single article fails to load from push notification and instead of providing an easy way to try to load again, the push notification is now gone and there's a search button and i have no idea what the article was about and it's never on top stories or popular and i start to wonder why I'm paying to stay up to date if it generally doesn't work",
"Not perfect, but unlike its critics, it publishes a correction whenever it misses",
"Happy with the content, but the app itself is overly buggy and badly optimized. Doesn't feel great to pay for a service and the app is so amateurly developed, especially from a name as big as The New York Times.",
"Love the NYT but the app is unusable. Can't load a single screen most of the time and can never find notifications. If you have a galaxy phone, stick with the mobile browser version.",
"Has stopped working for me. Everytime I open it it says the version is expired. I uninstall and reinstall from play store, next time I open I get the same error. No problem with my account as web works fine. Have uninstaled and will not reinstall again",
"Please, I need help and find no way to get contact with customer service. I paid for NYT subscription on through google play and now i get no access to my subscription on my account. When I contact google they say the developer must sort the issue out. The once I was able to contact NYT customer service they say google play must sort the access issue out. Meanwhile I have no access to the service I bought.",
One of the best newspapers in the world I subscribe to the digital edition it is a fantastic newspaper especially it's extensive foreign reportage it has a lot of different sections great coverage of America Business it has two magazines a great travel section good science section a wonderful read every day. Very Highly Recommended 10 out of 10. 😃😃😃💘💘💘❤❤❤👽👽👽🤖🤖🤖☠,
"Tge daily briefing never loads when I click the notification - article failed to load,retry. And the headlines of all the articles do not display until after I click on the blank white space where it should be, go to the article, and then go back to the cover.",
"The latest update doesn't seem to load articles properly. It takes so long to the point that I have to keep closing the app, open the app, and find the article I wanted to read to again. Please fix this.",
"The NYT provide excellent reporting that is a given. The app is great at delivering that reporting to the palm of your hand. The app is uncluttered, clear and easy to read and navigate.",
Can't access Times through app as it keeps indicating I have reached my limit for the month. The only options it gives are options for a new subscription. I have been a subscriber for years. Customer service suggested I access through Google.,
"Far too many notifications and no settings option to prevent them. So only option is to tell Android to block them all, which works fine but it's such a strong indicator of very poor app design.",
"Half the time when attempting to sign in the app displays ""no connection"" yet the phone is showing that I am on my wifi network at home and my mobile data is on. The other half it logs me in but will not show content and I've been subscribed for 4 months now. Really bad app. Rates a negative 5 stars.",
"The New York Times holds your credit card info and forces you to renew your subscription forever unless you can then on the phone to ""justify"" your decision to cancel. Terrible customer experience.",
Lot of left wing oriented articles,
App is glitchy. This prompt for a review popped up sooner than the articke I was trying to read. It reloads whike I am in the middle of a paragraph and sends me to the top of the articke or back to the home page. Iy hurts my eyes when it does that. I hate these aggressive prompts for reviews. Each business that sends me emails asking for reviews gets a one-star review from me.,
Unable to log in to subscription on the app since the update. I get logged out with app update and now it won't let me log in. Can't read articles I'm paying for. Very frustrating. No response to messages sent so far...,
"Love the reporting, hate the app. Now when I scroll an article, the app goes into oblivion. Ads have overtaken the news. Unstable. Difficult to read. Headlines go to unreadable font after opened.",
Great app but having to call in order to cancel a subscription sucks (although I did get a good deal out of it). Trying to emulate the WaPo's way inre to digital subscription might hold the Times in good stead.,
They make it really hard to unsubscribe. Wastes so much time unsubscribing. UX dark pattern. Very consumer unfriendly. Ruined my experience with the app. Will never subscribe again. Just add an easy link to unsubscribe or pause the subscription. Don't be evil!,
"Refuses my login, no help from support. Good thing NYT does news better than it does android apps. I put this app on my phone and tablet, but in both places it refuses to log me in. On my desk top I can log in fine. If I access articles via Google news, the Google News App is able to handle my credentials, and negotiate with the NYT web site and present articles. But not via this app.",
"a year after my first review, on a new phone with updated Android, this app continues to provide a horrible user experience. text hops around seemingly randomly. you have to chase paragraphs up and down to try and read them.",
"Articles always fail to load and when they do they are often too dark to read. This app is a battery hog. I wanted to hear the news so I opened the app, turned my brightness all the way down and listened. After 2 hrs I was at 50%. I can get 9 hrs watching YouTube with the brightness half way.",
"Uninstalling since it completely ignores the setting to not auto-play videos. Submitted query to app team and no resolution. So many ads auto-playing videos, I can't read the news which is the reason I subscribed.",
"The app keeps glitching. I download the app and then it stops opening and keeps shutting down, so I have to delete it then and it has been a year and still keeps doing that.",
ponderous. elephantine. update: 2/1/21. this app has become so sluggish over the last few updates that it feels like it runs backwards. digital subscriber since the Times first went on-line -- will revert to browser-only.,
"The content is best, but you have a big opportunity for improvement on the opinion section (the reason I subscribed). I'm surprise to see you don't give direct access by autor or blogs and the only way left to access the content is through the chronological blog roll or the search.",
"Please fix the daily crossword. Lately on Android the keyboard doesn't come up fully, making it impossible to play. Also, I pay for subscription and there are too many ads.",
"Despite having paid a monthly subscription the app logs me out automatically whenever I browse through the news, and because I can't log in, the app keeps notifying me that my free trial is over and that I should buy a subcrisption. Terrible, terrible wait to spend your money. Quite infuriating.",
"Good news, bad app. The notifications never go to the correct article. Plus i subscribed within the app, was billed in google play, but it's still not letting me view the articles and thinks I'm not subscribed!",
Thoughtful articles in a desert of alarmist headlines,
"This is a rating purely for the app (average) not the journalism (first class). Layout options are questionable. Why is the search tool hidden away? Why is the ""For You"" section not seemingly personalised or at least have the option to select topics of interest. Could be a better user experience.",
I'd give it five except for one terrible problem. You get alerts and when you click them it rarely takes you to the story it's alerting you to. It drives me crazy.,
"App is now very buggy, it used to work fine. Since 7.2 update I can no longer view comments (spinning progress indicator only). Also others have noted, screen now often freezing. Please fix!",
The widget merely needed tweaking to allow decreasing the font size or perhaps a format change. It didn't deserve summary execution. Please resurrect it - without it I am unlikely to renew my digital subscription.,
"Love the content, but the app does not work well on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. I always get errors when loading articles from notifications and the color of articles is often off, as if the content isnt properly loading.",
"Worse experience and customer service, I paid a whole year in advance and neither Google or NYT could help me. Google blamed NYT and NYT blamed Google. I have never had any problems with Google so my best bet is that the bug comes from NYT. I recommend to stick to another news source which doesn't scam people.",
"I've been a subscriber since 2019 and pay monthly through my PayPal account AUTOMATICALLY. For the last ! been unable to access articles, my saved articles, favorite sections because the app nor web does not recognize me or my login. But display my account number. I phoned Sunday morning (at 0719am) and spoke with a young lady for nearly 30 minutes, she escalated issue with 'ticket' number but problem persists. I need this fixed. Or get my trusted news elsewhere taking my money with me!",
"App is just terrible. For one most breaking news stories are apart of the ""LIVE"" feature which means they are always posting stories there and they pin certain ones so even if you click the notification for ,say, a Ukrainian story it will take you to the live feed and you'll see the pinned story first. Then if you want to change any settings or subscriptions you have to do it on their website you can't through the app why just why let us do it through the app. 0/10 only subbed b/c my cc pays",
"The app constantly says expired and to download latest version, no matter how many times I download the latest version. I'm paying for a subscription. I don't want to cancel but I won't tolerate this much longer.",
"Dear NYTimes app development team, Please listen to your readers: 1. Restore Night Mode as an option. 2. At least allow readers to disable the ""snapback"" feature (i.e. snapping back to top of page and refreshing after every article read.",
"The credibility of the NYT, in your pocket, plus access to the digital archives. Can't remember if it's $4.99 or $9.99 a month. Either is a bargain Minor quibbles with fonts sizing, but no big deal 😀😎",
Thanks for a most informative article on the ecological impact of the end of the sugar industry and the context of the fires.,
"The articles are fine. Which is to say there's a lack of proofreading in any online news outlet these days. Sad for NYTimes, who deems to holds itself in such high regard. But more importantly, where is night mode? Seriously. Where, and why, did it go?",
"Just bring back the app you used 6 months ago, it was better in every way. Been waiting for months for Dark Mode to come back. Seems forever. Uninstalling. WHAT HAPPENED TO DARK MODE!!!!?? Wish you had noted it in advance,I wouldn't have updated. 2 Thumbs down ↓↓",
"As a paying subscriber, it's outrageous that HALF the front page is advertising. The TOP half. So i open the app and the first thing i see is a big advertisement, not the news or the headline, an ad for shoes. Scrolling through the news provided me with full screen ads every other article. WHY AM I PAYING TO LOOK AT ADS??",
Everybody is complaining about how hard it is to unsubscribe from NY Times & others complain about constantly being directed to the subscription page when they're trying to click on to an article. I think you guys (NY Times) are hurting financially because you've lost a lot of customers due to being so politically biased. You have shot yourself in the foot. LMAO You suck.,
"This app makes ""reading"" the paper more like holding the physical paper in your hands. I feel less guided and likelier to read articles I have been overlooking/missing when using a browser.",
"The only issue I have is it's impossible to play the mini crossword. The third row of the keyboard isn't accessable, even after changing font sizes.",
Slow. Tapping push notifications doesn't always take to the correct deep link. Back button doesn't work if you multitask away. Poor quality from a household brand name.,
"Over half the time, the notifications fail to load the associated article. I like receiving the headlines as notifs, but if the story is a day or two old, it simply doesn't load",
Real problems with this latest version of the app. Takes too long to load or doesn't load at all. The puzzles are so glitchy as to make them unplayable!!,
Works well. Easy enough to use.,
Among my top 3 go to sources of real news and thoughtful opinions.,
The most biased name in news. Period. Keep the rest of my year subscription. You disgust me.,
"if you do not read the NYT you will be scrolling through an avalanche of news. So let the Sulzberger family spoon feed you the latest news, op-ed, opinions and other articles of interest.",
It's fast and easy to use.,
My NYTimes subscription is OBNOXIOUS. WHY DO I HAVE TO LOG INTO MY NYTIMES ACCOUNT EVERY TIME I USE GOOGLE NEWS OR ANYTHING TO READ IT OTHER THAN FLIPBOARD. I DON'T KNOW ANY FRIGGIN PASSWORD AND IT REFUSES TO LET ME USE MY SAVED PASSWORD.,
"Excellent, authentic, and necessary",
An important way to learn about the news from well written and researched articles.,
Why did they revert back to the old UX? No tab for games anymore??!,
Up to date news and information,
i love my subscription!!! especially like Morning Read,
Still some of the best reporting on both sides of the pond.,
"Fine, but everything is locked behind a paywall.",
Always relevant and interesting.,
Check out NYT pitchbot on twitter which regularly calls out the Times for normalizing nazis and fascists. Click carefully - they often promote MAGA white nationalists on the editorial page.,
This newspaper has been telling us the coldheartedtruth about our country since the first day and contributed to our freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.,
Can't live without my NYT every single day. Only way I can keep my sanity being stuck living in Texas.,
This is essential reading that inspires me and gives me hope,
A fascinating piece of writing.,
they have great stuff and do good job!,
My daily go-to. App needs a 'home' button tho,
Amazing original content.,
This article about this amazing man touched and saddened me. Two of my children attended UC Davis and I'm sure we saw David Breax many times coming in and out of Crepeville. It warms my heart to read about the way people in the town responded to him positively while he was alive and with respect now that he is no longer with us.,
Upd: app works again on tablet. Thx.,
"I love the NYT's, it starts my day off right.",
"There's lots of new, which I like. What I dislike is: I get a news alert, I tap on it and it opens in the app, but then it goes away. Not to be found. Frustrating and time consuming looking for it. This needs to be fixed.",
Uninstalled from all devices. This app consumes more battery than every other app combined. Not recommended on a Samsung Galaxy S7. Also content is sometimes so full of Google ads you can barely read the story. Also crashes regularily while reading a story. Better app verification by code developers is required!,
"So buggy. Clicking on a notification never loads the article just brings you to an error. Clickiy an article from the widget gets an error too although that one at least has a ""retry"" button that works.",
"Sadly I'm seeing more and more of the anti-China bias so common in many major news sources today. I feel conflicted as the NYT does produce many incredible articles with impressive research, however, these articles are lost among ones that are produced primarily to promote a western liberal narrative. Good reporting is thus wasted as it gets lost within a sea of incessant agenda-based posting that one has to filter through. It is sad to see such genuinely great reporting being wasted like this.",
"The main page refreshes so often that if you tab off the app to share something, the whole feed resets on you. Feels like I lose the sense of a paper and is replaced with a dopamine pipeline.",
"I've been mulling over whether or not to finally get a NYTimes subscription, but have currently decided not to. The app signs you out practically every time the app is closed, making personalization utterly painful to deal with.",
"This app freezes and crashes consistently. often I'll be reading an article and scrolling will stop working, then the app crashes and I've lost my progress in the article.",
"Always very informative. Great place for breaking news, back stories, updates, and expected events in the future. Easy to read without taking away the integrity of the hard working, well seasoned reporters.",
"All of a sudden the 'dark' setting is almost completely unusable. It's a dark gray background with only a slightly less dark gray text. I appreciate the addition of a night mode, but it would be nice if it was actually usable!",
"NYT produces great journalism and high quality content in general, but they're showing ads despite me paying $17/mo for access to the app. I'll likely cancel the subscription and just use AP since, even though AP shows ads, it's free.",
"App DOES NOT work with Samsung Chrome book. Articles don't load/scroll properly and crossword doesn't load at all.. I have sent 3 emails about this since early June and all I get back in response is ""we will look into it."" Extremely disappointed.",
"Not sure what happened with the app,but notifications have become useless as unless I open them right away they never take me to the actual article mentioned in notification, just to the most recent thing I read or most recent update on the topic.",
Uses too much storage space even at minimal settings. Needs a setting for zero content to be downloaded for offline reading. Could be more responsive going in and out of articles,
"Honestly, I was a bit upset when they started charging for subscriptions, but the money is definitely worth it given quality of news and Web UI/UX design. Great work from the NY Times team.",
"I like the content, journalism etc, but I do not like junk emails cluttering up my inbox. I unsubscribed from everything I could find & still received nearly daily emails. Not cool. So not cool that I cancelled my membership.",
"What happened to the print version on the app? I want it back! Also, not a fan of the sections changes. I just want a list of the sections, not pics of what you think I want.",
"I never write reviews but this made me so angry. They force you to make an account - OK, but they don't let you DELETE it. You can't read anything if you don't subscribe so they entrap you by forcing you to subscribe and making it very difficult for you to unsubscribe and delete your account. You can read stories online about their dirty tactics",
You will never run out of interesting things to read,
Forced to subscribe to the Times when an undergrad freshman half a century ago. The rest is history. Is there a comparison that can be drawn? I dont think so. A class by itself? Yes. The app? The app brings me closer and on the fly.,
The app isn't working for me. I have been a subscriber for 10 years but it's not allowing me to log in. I hit the paywall when I try to read any articles not directly associated with the pandemic. Love the Times reporting but will probably have to rely on the Washington Post now.,
Awesome resource. Tracking the elections - tracking the pandemic across the country down to individual county - invaluable. Keeping news up to date by using all the current technology to make this a great place to gather information!,
"The app is very poor, forcing you to return to the main page before viewing the next article. The articles dealing with factual issues are filled with editorial comments. The times does a good job of finding out many of the things that it's important to know in today's democracy, but they have lost their way in the rest of their reporting.",
"News are ok but app sucks. 90% of times when there are multiple notifications and I select other than last one it still loads last article, one I wanted disappears and due to sucky nonexistent search I'm just frustrated that I can't read article that picked my interest. Please fix this ffs",
"I like the New York Times, but even though I don't like the majority of things Trump does, says or stands for, I think the NY Times is overly biased in their coverage of him and his failing administration. Also, unsubscribing takes over 10 minutes while you wait for a robot in a chat to process the request, which is what inspired me to leave a review in the first place.",
"Fix notifications please! Most articles don't open when i tap on any individual article notification; instead it opens the main page. UPDATE 12/29/2019 Downgraded from 2 to 1 star. A developing story won't even open correctly. NYT, hire a better app developer.",
"On the web, the NYT gives me incessant reminders to use the app, but there is no ""find in page"" option or easy way to open in a browser, so the app is a downgrade from the browser.",
"Updating to 2 stars - Bring back night mode, remove ads for paid subscribers, load saved sections upon exiting / relaunching the app. Content is great, but delivery and user experience is equally important as a digital subscriber.",
"The news content makes this app appealing, but it crashes so often that it's hard to read a single article. Others have mastered this. Fix the blanketyblank app!",
"The leading American news paper. I find the news paper to be fairly centrist, you might find some left or right leaning opinion pieces, but overall its a reliable source for news. One of several news papers I subscribe to. Including multiple news sources, especially outside of your average television media, is important in today's political climate.",
Removal of night mode is the reason for the 2 star review. Putting it back will get a 4. Making it work perfectly will get at 5. The content is great and I like using the Times as a source. Just a bummer the dark mode was removed,
Nothing against the content/journalism but the app is a CPU and data hog. My Pixel 2 gets hot reading news and 15 minutes of reading somehow used 100MB of data. And there are still ads even if you have a subscription. So many ads.,
"I'm a paid subscriber to the Times but it keeps preventing me from reading with these annoying popups. I'm sure these apps are collecting data or something that it's always harping on ""big tech"" about. Terrible user experience.",
"Love the NYT: reporting is consistently top notch and opinion pieces are thought-provoking and interesting. The app itself, though, is a clunky beast that refreshes every single time I read an article.",
"Never glitchy, easy to find the story(ies) I want.",
No reading outloud option. The news and opinions are biased (left-leaning) I do like the ability to comment or at least SEE comments and they are sorted by popularity great for research. No option to listen to articles and there are commercials sprinkled throughout even if you are a premium supporter. I recommend a VPN to block them within the app. Surfshark works well for that. It's not my favorite news source I use it only for research and to gain the perspective of others.,
"the app is super easy to use with a really enjoyable user experience, and very reliable. and, of course, the quality of news coverage for so many issues and topics around the world is second to none.",
"I can't log in to my account in the android app. Once I press log in via Google account, it freezes up - it looks like it's loading. but nothing happens. This way I can't use my subscription. Also, when I do log in to the account via the website, it claims that I'm not a subscriber, while I am. Its a complete rip off!",
"Extremely low quality app. The IOS version is pretty flawless, but this turd can't even consistently load articles, stay logged, or load the correct article referenced in notifications. Embarrassing.",
Can't read in landscape mode or have not been able to figure out how to autorotate the app. Settings menu is bare bones so I use the Wall Street Journal app when I do get a chance to read in my phone.,
Constantly crashing even when reinstalled and have not been able to open let alone read headlines. Only get notifications. Several pleas for assistance have gone unanswered...............,
Full of good information and great journalism,
"Since an April 10 update this app fails to update the news on a ""regular"" timeline. 19 hours? Very annoying as a paid subscription. I've installed and reinstalled the app each week with no success. Very disappointed. I now just go to the website.",
"Fails to handle links from online sites and other apps. Fails to handle links from its own notifications. No I don't want to browse the entire catalog to find the article that caught my attention a second time, thanks",
"Great content, but I'm always being prompted to download the latest version. I'll delete, reinstall, then be prompted again. It's happened at least thrice. Maddening!",
"Am very frustrated that the navigation tabs disappeared. It's unacceptable to provide an ""upgrade"" with the promise that this essential feature will be restored ""soon.""",
"Love them or hate them, they are one of the pillars in the US's Media machine, and among the top in the world. Reliable news source with very competitive rates. Spot on reports with balanced articles - relatively speaking since balance is another topic altogether.",
"The app is okay, but when I tap on a push notification about a particular article, I wish it would take me to that article, and not the one I was reading last. Then the notification disappears and I have to hunt around for what I want to read.",
"Love the content. App is nice, but could be a little bit faster, and it would be really awesome if it can save the position in the saved for later articles",
"when clicking an alert in the notification panel, the app gives and error msg, not being able to load the article. click ""retry"", same thing. I click back, and article appears. this happens each time. Samsung Galaxy s9+",
"Excellent Journalism. app is uneven. recent iteration has news ""updates"" that happen too often and lock the interface. still, one of the finest for Journalism.",
App has no dark mode even though it is becoming an industry alternative standard. I have Fuch's dystrophy and the white background and grey font make it extremely difficult to read this paper on the app. Please add dark mode. It'll also help people reading at night ..,
Good content. The links to activate the content are weak.,
Patricia continues to be one of the most insightful writers at the NY times.,
"Thanks for the real, factual and interesting news and current events!",
"In the post Trump world, we find that the very things we took for granted as the bedrock unquestioned values we could always count on, like intelligence, logical reasoning, and integrity, have been denigrated and undermined by Trump and his minions. The New York Times maintains these values to the highest degree. It's no accident that Trump singled out the New York Times as a specific target, because they represent the best of America. ...exactly what he specifically sought to destroy.",
It is super annoying that this app asks all the time to sign in with either its account or my Google account,
"Pithy characterizations using cultural signposts. Serious fun, thoughtful and possibly inducing thoughts about the nature of being a United States American. (Everyone in the Americas is American, to take over American for just one nation could suggest an essence of territorial Putin-esque possessiveness).",
"The Times delivers, as always. Worth the subscription!",
I can't figure out how to listen to articles. Perhaps it's only available for Apple. I'm going to cancel my subscription,
"I used to be a fan of NTYT until it published one of the eye catching news about my country, Philippines. The news didn't present two sides why there were trials between the network and the government and what were the reasons why the network in my country was shut down. It must be very interesting news because it's worldwide yet TNYTs got only one sided information. I hope they won't print such bias news. This turned to be fallicious report.",
Text size too small and can't zoom in to photos,
Pay for subscription app won't link and keeps trying to get me to repurchase new subscription 😑,
"Clarity, calm, maturity and reason that stands apart.",
Purchased all-access but am unable to access anything from the NYT.,
NY Times has always been one of the most highly respected news outlets in the world.,
"5 stars until latest Android update (Pie). Not compatible with new ""Dark Mode"". Notification stories fail to load when selected, and articles sometimes load with a black background and dark grey text within the app itself.",
I strongly resent that I cannot for my subscription price get cooking but worse than that and the reason I knocked off a star is for all of the teasers that lead to a story on cooking when I click for recipe then I'm informed I must subscribe but I do subscribe to the times online news service I live in a town where home delivery which I used to get is so expensive and it's ridiculous at least you are still giving us all beer a small version of a crossword puzzle that's the other reason minus-1,
an amazing article that concisely summarizes and connects so many dots,
User friendly app. Easy to share articles.,
One of the very best sources of journalism out there.,
it's said that no news is good news. NYTimes is the exception 👍,
"love the app. it would be great to give the option of a text size slider rather than the current ""small, medium, large..."" discrete choices.",
"Haven't upgraded my rating from lowest possible in the past year. This app is an absolute resource hog. It routinely locks up my phone with its content updates. I subscribe to support their journalism, but getting really sick of this garbage app.",
"All of a sudden, horizontal swipe no longer works to move between stories, eliminating main value of app. What happened? Might as well use browser instead.",
Not everyone is being accounted for starting from the top to the bottom. Cameras are stationary and people has figured out how to maneuver expecially people that share common grounds with Hi-Tech technology.,
I used to enjoy reading the NYT and even defend it as one of the best non biased publications out there. I can no longer do this. It has become a mouth piece for radical leftist propaganda now. It has deeply saddened me to see the journalistic integrity of the Times plummet over the past few years.,
"This app displays articles written by journalists. It's similar to a newspaper, but better. You can save articles to read later, the subscription is affordable and the coverage is far and wide. My favourite feature of digital NYT is the interactive articles. They are essentially on par with The Daily Prophet, the living newspaper from Harry Potter where mugshots scream out.",
"Uninstalling as its determined to get me to sign up. I realise I'm getting something for nothing but prefer to support apps by receiving a reasonable level of ads, NOT by creating an account. Others will feel the opposite way, all good!",
It's a horrible app. Links don't work correctly. The UI is atrocious I'm not really sure what these people are thinking. there's no excuse for a news organization with the type of revenue that the New York times has to not have a functional app in the year 2020. It would have been an embarrassing app in 2010. Epic fail.,
No way to disable personalized ads (same irrelevant ads over and over). I'm done! Articles tailored for me are of zero interest to me.,
"So janky! When scrolling, the page stutters so much. Usually because it's loading an ad. Terrible experience for paying subscribers. Tried clearing data and reinstalling, but not better.",
"app is decent. but forces ads on subscribers. because of the ads, i find it a better experience to open articles in a mobile browser with ad block rather than using the app for anything other than offline articles.",
"Frustrating beyond belief, have to log in each time I close app, can never find a previous day's edition. I use this app perhaps once a week, just not compatible with samsung I guess.",
"Desperately trying to stay alive in the digital era so now you're charging $5 a month to look at any kind of recipe or anything that's not some bs thrown-together daily article?? No thanks, I'll run a pop-up blocker and screenshot my favorite recipes so I never have to come back here again, thanks!",
"UNINSTALLED! This app just keeps getting worse. i can't read any articles. I just get the spinning wheel (hello 1990!) and if I sign out it's a neverending loop of signing in, change your password, etc.",
"(April 2019)I've had the app for a few months. It worked fine until recently...articles won't load. It seems I'm not alone with this problem. (Update June 3, 2019) Yesterday, the app wouldn't open...just a flash on the screen. Today I uninstalled, and now it won't re-install.",
"I just cancelled my subscription because of the latest Android update - removing the section scroll at the top makes it ridiculously difficult to browse articles. Customer Service only said ""we'll pass on your input to developers"". Too bad, NYT is one of my favorite news sources and clearly NOT listening to users.",
I have really enjoyed my subscription. I get to read the headlines on notification to see if want to read it. I stay informed and the part I love is that they have a covid tracker that you can select any state/ county you want to follow. I have 3 states and 2 county's I watch daily. I trust this paper and that is why even though I live in the West Coast I subscribe to this paper.,
"Horrible app.. paid subscriber, don't mind their journalism efforts but the app experience is unbearable, thought this would be improved so that you can atleast read an article it gives you a notification about.. but Nooo, think I'll stop paying for something that makes me want to pound my head into a wall, before I even get to the frustration that is the news",
"Push notifications never take you the article directly but to the home page instead. Pain to search for it manually, if you can find it at all. The fact that there are video ads for a *paid* subscription is also pretty ridiculous.",
"The mobile app is excellent, perfectly suited to my Android phone",
"Sometimes it logs me out which is annoying. I think that is more when I click a story via Facebook or Twitter. Other than that nicely presented, professional looking. And easy to navigate.",
"DO YOU NOT READ EMAILS!!!!??? I subscribed to the NYT a few days ago, but I subscribed twice by accident.  One subscription was made for Basic($53.09). And the other was made for All Access($78.75). I sent an email to you days ago to that effect but there is no reply. Most ANNOYING! Two payments for one subscription is ridiculous! PLEASE RESPOND!",
"I was getting their free daily emails a couple of years ago and when the 1st impeachment trial started I wanted to be in the know and I signed up for a subscription, best move I made. good coverage of all the bug topics. I've been a subscriber ever since.",
"I am stuck with old news from NYT. Every time I try to open the app, I get message that my device is offline with a request to retry. Retrying doesn't help. All my other online subscriptions work fine.",
"There content is top notch. The app is incredibly power hungry, devouring 2% power per minute sometimes, while just reading and scrolling an article. Please fix your inefficient code!",
"It baffles me that a news site/app intended for reading does not have a ""dark mode"" or ""night mode"" by 2022. They clearly don't care for the readers experience. Will likely end up canceling and sticking to wapo with their more functional app.",
"I've been videotaping the City during these last days of lockdown. As sad as it is to see her empty, it's also a dream to have her all to myself. Soon, my long shots of empty streets will end. Well... except on early Sunday mornings, where it looks as abandoned as a SF set. :)",
"I don't know how the app is, but it's incredibly annoying to have to endure a prompt to use it maybe 10 times a day on web/mobile. The prompt fills the whole screen so its very invasive. Please reconsider your Web design",
"The Times brings new and original stories each day, not rehashes of old on-line stories that you read days ago. It is also one of America's few news outlets that provides real international news analysis, not just international PR pieces. Keep up the great work!",
this app keeps asking me to download the latest app when I already have the updated version. emailing the support takes a long long time to resolve your concern and takes quite a longer time to get an update for the cancellation of my subscription. I deserve a refund here and they haven't even got back to me for that. disappointing,
"This app is a great way to access the news! I'm not a payed subscriber, but everytime I'm in the middle of reading, a message pops up and says Subscribe to read more. It is really frustrating! Please fix this! I'm deleting this app! So useless",
A daily publication of international standing and importance.,
My top news today: 2 big ads. What am I paying the monthly subscription for? This has been going on for at least a month. The right thing to do is refund or give people free subscription until this issue is fixed.,
"I love the nytimes but the app isn't very good. It is very slow and it gets stuck often. My phone is not the best, but I don't have this problem with other apps or when I load the site in Chrome.",
Finally decided to pay for the full puzzle after years of the mini. Worked for two days now it looks like I never subscribed. Won't let me log back in. It's my Google account so not a credentials issue. Can't find an email for support. WTH?,
"I am an online subscriber and look forward to the good, informed writing I get from this. I was particularly interested today in two articles: 1. the article about Mr Sheehan's role in the Pentagon Papers being published. I remember that well, being 23 at the time; 2. the article regarding some of the people involved in the storming and looting of the Capitol Building. A sad mess. Keep up the Good Work and Thanks to All of Your Staff!",
"I am almost 74 years old and this is a great Newspaper that my father, grandfather read everyday. this is a paper that separates news from opinion. I read 4 news papers every day including the WSJ, Washington Post and The Miami Herald. yes the Editorial pages are different but the news is the news.",
"Doesn't work well when your cell connection isnt great (like on the subway) which is typically when I read the news. Also I shouldn't see ads on something I'm paying for. unsubscribed, uninstalled",
"Earlier (2019, 2020) versions froze and crashed constantly. Happy to say that the problem has been fixed and reading the paper is a dream, almost as good as a delivered copy.",
NYTimes adds a broader and more in depth perspective that I don't always find in the Seattle papers...it is a joy to access the East coast view which is more global than the west. Thanks!,
For past 3 days the NYTimes android app will not open. Uninstalled and reinstalled without improvement. Powered off phone and restarted without improvement. Sent messages. Very frustrating .,
The best source of thoughtful critically important information today.,
Tapping push notifications doesn't take you to the right article. Frequently can't even find the article that I was notified about. Otherwise I think the app is nice.,
"For such a wealthy organization,with so many resources,I thought the software would be less demanding of my time and attention. I just want to read the damn articles. I am so tired of having to login and jump through hoops. It's uninstalled and I'm not paying any more damn money.",
"CANCEL WITH YOUR BANK (PAYPAL) ITS QUICKER. Really love the journalism. Unfortunately when you press cancel, you have to then chat to a chat bot. But you can't type. And UK phone number doesn't exist. This is a fraudulent way to achieve recurring revenue. In PayPal you can remove PayPal as the approved method for NYT transaction to bypass this fraudulent process by nyt. I was cancelling to take a break from digital media. Might have resubscribed in future, but never will after above experience",
"I'm very happy to have this app, but the fact that you cannot shut off notifications is a major flaw. When I uninstall and delete this app, it will be precisely because you cannot shut off the notifications. It's really not acceptable this way.",
"The content of the articles is great. However the app itself is not. My biggest complaint is that it even with video autoplay turned off, it still autoplays video ads, even when on data.",
"I loved reading the post. All the news I needed in one spot. I was on a 7day trial, wish I could afford to continue with the Post. Unfortunately I can't afford to pay a monthly charge for the paper.. If you can afford to pay a monthly fee, this would be hour best choice in my opinion. I am going to miss the Post.",
"A long read, but worth it. Knowing about her parents, their lives, struggles, and triumphs gives a good look into who our new Vice President is. Their meeting in the 60's appears providential and history making in a multitude of ways. Great article!",
"Have been getting notifications lately that, whrn i click them, open totally unrelated articles. For example, I just clicked on a notification about 'China's slowing economy' only to open an ariticle about 'Toni Morrison, Nobel-winning author'. This is quite bothersome.",
"This article does not highlight that the fitting and sale of digital processing hearing aids ( just as with the fitting and sale of single vision lenses and frames) is a lucrative business when compared to other service provided by otolaryngologists / audiologists ( optometrists/ ophthalmologists) for the amount of effort and office space required. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but plays into motivations of all parties involved when it comes to legislation and the effects on livelihoods.",
A must have app that I use on a daily basis. It's easy to use and feature-rich.,
For some reason the app has removed the vertical scroll bar from the display of articles being read making it impossible to determine just how long the article is. I've never seen anything like that before and I vehemently disagree with whoever made the decision to do it.,
"Great app. Much improved. Used to crash frequently, but has been fixed. Slow to load because of the large graphic content.",
"I'm having.problems loading.articles, they often dont load or load only partial content. Noticed since mid-March, possibly incompatible with Samsung updates on my Note 9 phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still having problems",
"This current version has text in odd combinations - white, light or dark grey and black text, in Singapore daylight hours. I'm not sure if this is a general app issue or a miss-syncing with SGP hours. Nonetheless, it's not conductive for reading. NYT contents still great, trying to read is not. Please fix or advice.",
"Always asks for version upgradation, dozens of time installed the app, and later forcefully uninstalled as there happens to be no updates available. Taken the subscription, and not able to read the news, waste of time and money.",
I'm having problems in that it opens other settings during the app I'm using and opens other apps as well. This needs to be addressed. I've sent an indepth email to your website. Thank you.,
It is the best source of international news as it always has been. I enjoy the opinion pieces. They are usually well thought out analyses of what is happening or what trends they are seeing. Most of all I see this newspaper as a real newspaper. They report things that they see or hear and you can make your own judgment of the facts.,
Non-stop fossil fuel ads. Seems like the Times runs PR for the carbon majors.,
increasing fees....anyone know how to unsubscribe or do a lower subscription?,
NYT has been the best source of information I can find on the internet for the last 3 years that I have subscribed. I get annoyed that the notifications I receive will not led to pages and that I cannot easily search for articles in the app.,
"The app is constantly updating/refreshing. This ruins my scrolling, causing me to wait for the front page to refresh & sending me back to the top of the page. At this point I'm doing most of my reading on the mobile site.",
"Also experiencing the same issue as the commenter below me. When I click on a news story or the morning newsletter notification, there is a 50% chance the actual story will appear instead of a random old story. And my newsletter is also defaulting to bringing me to an old December 3rd story. Get it together, NYT!",
"Fraudulent billing practices! I have an NYT Games subscription that I'm trying to cancel. The website says it's paid via Google Subscriptions but my PayPal acct is being charged and Google has no record of it. All in all, this is an $8/month reminder of why I now read WaPo.",
"Signing up for the nyt with Google subscriptions was a mistake. You can't access the nyt anywhere other than this terrible app, your subscription will not link to your nyt account ever.",
"If you pay for a subscription here, it's not a real subscription, it's only good for the android app- you can't access the new york times in a web browser or from a computer.",
"Uninstalled! Already paying monthly subscription. Have been giving NYT money for months. However, App lets me sign in but still asks me to pay. This issue should be resolved promptly.",
"Cannot log in using Google account. Acts like it's logging in, then immediately fails and asks to log in again. So much for the NYTimes deal Google had going.",
"The standards have gone down. I used to subscribe to it but now it's just hypocritical propaganda from the far-left. And I'm not even American. I ran away from an authoritarian regime when I was young, and I'm seeing that level of propaganda from NYT.",
"Love reading the New York Times digitally!! I get to read some of the best writers from all over the world, have a plethora of up to date information, and other articles that interest me about life, food, etc. - plus! Information that's relevant to my area. What isn't there to love about that?",
Navigation is horrendously counter intuitive.,
"This app can be pretty useless, you'll get a notification but it just tells you it can't find the article and to use the search function. If you come across an NYT link and try to open it, it will do thw same.",
"It's okay. It often gives notifications but when I click on the notification it usually doesn't open the article, which is really annoying.",
"To be able to save articles for later is a good thing. But it would be much better if the app could also remember where I interrupted my reading, a bookmark of sorts...",
"App keep asking me to upgrade. Has happened twice. i have uninstalled and reinstalled to the latest 9 dec 2019 version, it ran. now it shows again that this version 8.3.0/50022 has expired. Does being in a different timezone (GMT +7) gets my app expired quicker when the app update isnt even available yet.",
"No sharing options. Videos play in a tiny box and reload if the phone's orientation is changed. News notifications are nice, but wish it was a better app.",
Make it difficult to cancel. Cancel in the link takes you to a page with an American Number then another link to a list of countries. Which is not formatted to Mobile so you can't read the number that are you are calling like it's 1990. Oh and the office hours from midday.,
"Widgets seem to have disappeared from my phone and I cannot add them back. Were they removed? Welp after further reading I see thus far, for some inexplicable reason they deliberately removed widgets. Widgets were my sole reason for using the app but now I can get rid of this app and access my paid subscription through the browser and block the obnoxious ads. Seriously considering the Guardian.",
Journalism written with integrity.,
"I'm a paid subscriber, who only purchased a subscription because of the widget. However, the widget was apparently removed. I have rated the app as one star because of that, and will most likely unsubscribe. The app without the widget is all but useless to me.",
Third rate app. Search doesn't work. Chat client doesn't work properly. In chat mode the keypad disappears. Impossible to cancel subscription from phone.,
When clicking notifications I am rarely taken to the story I am being alerted about. Rather I am directed to the home screen of the app. Also the search function has been removed so I can't even find the story I was alerted about....,
Too many distracting Advertisements; more than using any browser. I paid monthly subscription to focus in reading. No way to remove ads. Do not waste your time and money. Go free on chrome without disgusting ads.,
"Quality material, excellent writing, correct journalism. My children (ages 10, 12 and 15) and I share stories - they benefit substantially by thinking more about the stories and current events; we all have better engaging discussions with one another.",
"Subscriptions to investigative journalism have always been a critical part of being an informed, thoughtful individual. In the age of Facebook & Google taking over advertising (revenues) upon which journalism was funded, subscriptions are far more crucial today, and a way of maintaining a piece of personal independence. Especially when read outside of FB's & G's surveillance mechanisms.",
"There was a dialog modal showing up on screen to update the app. There is no way to close it. And when I come to play store, I see only uninstall and open options. So I chose to uninstall. Bye bye",
Rapidly kills my battery. I've blocked this app from running in the background and it still will use 40% of my battery in the background. Considering ending my subscription to the paper due to how much this app impacts my overall battery life even when not in use.,
Cancelling a subscription is like going through hell seven times over. The amount of time I've lost on them (and still not got my subscription cancelled) is probably worth more than what I have paid for access.,
"I use this app every day. I have 2 wishes to make it better. Put a search magnifier somewhere handy, like on the sections page. The second is to enable a night mode. Other papers I read have it.",
"New app has a clunkier UI. Can't swipe across different sections anymore. The share button shares the wrong article if you've opened an article from the ""more stories"" at the bottom of another article.",
"Good resource. needs to work out bugs in moving from other platform links to re organize you are a NYT subscriber. too often, I am told I need to subscribe and then have to go to the NYT app to find the article.",
"Surprisingly terrible app for a great news organization. No dark mode, and barley any options for accessibility. I downloaded it, used for about 5 min, and will now immediately delete. If you want a good news app go with Washington Post. NYT- Your app is hot garbage and you need to fix it.",
"this app is incredibly slow on both my IOS and Android devices, are not the most current models. You should have sympathy on those those devices are one or two years old. On my Android device I can't comment on articles. But I will continue to read the Newspaper of Record.",
"Love the times, but the app itself is a bit glitchy sometimes. Never really bad enough to prevent me reading an article or watching/listening to files though.",
"Awesomely thorough coverage, dogged, groundbreaking investigations. A must- have for those who care about facts, staying informed, and the vital role of a free press in preserving democracy. An all-digital subscription is just $10 a month. Well worth it!",
"Worked fine for about eight months. Now it doesn't. Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling, still won't work. Very frustrating. It's a couple of months later and this seems to be a recurring issue.",
"I get pop-up notifications about stories so when I see something I want to read, I click on it. More often than not, this takes me to the home page not the story. This is frustrating and I'm waiting for the fix",
"This app is terrible. This is exactly why people don't subscribe to newspaper companies. Performance is inconsistent at best, no option on links people send to open in app, and littered with more ads than content. Go learn something from WaPo.",
"I downloaded program, installed it, but when I opened it on my phone, I keep getting the error message that my device is offline. What is wrong when your app can't tell when my device which just downloaded and installed your app, refuses to recognize the fact that it is indeed online.",
The news is great but the games are no longer playable. If this were a traditional keyboard and not a touchscreen I would say there was a sticky key somewhere.,
"Real News Here ! , I Trust The New York Times , For Bein Trustworthy Real News",
"What happened to all my saved for later? Why can't I see anything that I've saved for later on either my phone app or my tablet app? I can see it on the desktop, but that isn't very helpful. Also I can no longer save in either the phone or tablet, so anything that I think I've saved since September 29 is just gone...",
"Disappointing, not as good as the WaPo app and should be better. Frequently hangs on startup when trying to load Top Stories. Please fix as I would prefer using an app to viewing content in Chrome.",
Checking and comparing info from one great news information outlet to another. As well as enjoying other aspects of WHT the New York Times is known for. Literary ratings to technology going on now. Great recipes and articles for your health. Even in print the NYT has always been number one for me.,
"Please fix the bug which takes me back to the top page each time I return from reading an article. I lose my place in the scroll, and it's very frustrating.",
"annoying autoplay videos, cannot stop them even in settings. NYT no longer updating with news. App keeps old stories as top news for days. when I set the app to never play videos, I mean ALL VIDEOS.",
"Primordial. I cannot scroll with up/down arrows on my laptop keyboard. There are vast, empty spaces, no photos, and the print is miniscule.",
"I find so many very interesting articles each day. I do wish there where more condensed sections, because the detailed information is good, but takes a lot of time to read such lenghtly stories. But watch out for free trials rhat expire. They will grab your money anyway they can. They know all the tricks. Cancel a week ahead of time ane stop them at the money source, if you don't want to continue the on-line news with them. Tell your bank or credit company not to pay them past the end date.",
"Lately, I've been unable to read articles, as they do not fully load. This is quite frustrating. It seems ridiculous to weekly (at least) uninstall and reinstall this app. Please fix this!",
"Always direct without exaggeration. Polite, evento the worst.",
"Least functional app on my phone. Rarely displays more than one article without completely failing. More errors and ""app has stopped working"" messages per day than every other app on my phone has per year.",
"Its worth it to subscribe, unfortunatly, if youre poor like me & cant afford it in liu of a days meal, it just gets incredibly frustrating to see a bunch of stuff you might be interested in but cant read. But its well-worth paying for the subscription if you can & supporting independant journalism.",
"Excellent, timely articles and Wordle.",
wonderful news source. the app is easy to navigate. daily emails that contain a snapshot of the headlines are a great way to keep informed.,
Video could use picture-in-picture. Otherwise great reporting though sometimes has an establishment bias. The app is well designed and thought out.,
"I like the Times, until today. The mini puzzle WAS free. Now, NT WON'T let me play unless I subscribe! Black mail!! I'm a Vietnam Veteran living on SSI and my small military pension and I wish you had an affordable rate for me for a full subscription! If I can't play this puzzle, I might as well delete this APP; as it was once a free feature and what I looked forward to each day! THANK YOU to NT for reeming me too...If you are a retired Veteran DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! SHAME ON NT!!",
"The app frequently fails to load articles. need to close out app and restart to get then to load again. App does not automatically update content when opened. need to manually pull to refresh. More recently it has started to use way more mobile data than ever. In the course of reading 5-10 articles, the app used up 0.4 GB of data. I can now only use the app when on wifi, which had made me use other sources for news when I am out of the house.",
The last update ruined the app. It freezes and articles don't load. The keyboard for the mini crossword is cut off. It's pretty much unusable.,
"Science can't explain or directly observe conscious experience which is a combination of love and understanding. This experience is associated with brains, but is a separate reality not subject to decomposition such as a brain undergoes at death. It can't decompose! It's our everyday conceptions. Nothing material could exist unless it could first be conceived! All sacred religions focus on this reality of the Human Spirit. Find the ones that accept others as true & agree with science.",
very well done app. not flooded with advertisementdespite there are some. easy to adjust the font size. tricky to find older articles again to reread.,
"The app lags on opening from notifications, which is fairly egregious, I click on the banner to read the article, yet I more often than not have to manually refresh the app to see it.",
"I like the short snippets, well crafted with links should I want to dig deeper. The articles are well balanced (as far as I can tell), and I always feel well informed.",
"Notifications do not take you to the article. I click on a pop up notification, I expect to be taken to that headline, it does not. Today it took me to the ""Today's News"" Wich didn't have that headline if I scrolled down.",
The ultimate in 'click bait'. The notifications say one headline but if you click on it you get a totally different unrelated story. Mostly useless.,
"The news is great, but the loss of the option to have dark mode is really a big negative for me. It makes me often use other news apps in the evening.",
"Frankly the best newspaper app I've used. Well worth the sub. Only thing it is missing is colour options, ie a sepia colouring and a dark mode. Also the font they use is just beautiful 😍",
"I am a long time subscriber and have waited for a very long time for this app to get it right. For the kind of dough that the New York times makes, being a premier paper and having oodles of subscribers, you would think that they could spend some cash and make this app work right.",
"NYT is home to outstanding journalism, but the mobile app has critical issues. Frequent freezes, heavy network and power consumption, and unresponsivness. This latest update needs immediate attention.",
Incredible research and writing. Almost every day I learn something new and critical. The fact that I can trust NYT's vigorous journalistic standards is invaluable in this age of misinformation.,
I've always wanted to be able to read the New York Times since young being many teachers spoke highly about it. this digital platform is unbelievable it gives you access to the entire history of article at they disposal.,
reads more like a spy thrower science fiction epic. diligent reporting in the fascinating story. love the times for reporting these kinds of stories and count on them to do what other publications can't seem to do or want to do.,
"1)Type in password(to change obscene amount of notifications) 2)Says ""incorrect"" 3)I reset password 4)Type in ""incorrect"" password 5)Says ""you cannot use the same one x2"" 6)Inquire through ""chat"" (which I'm aware is a bot) 7)Chat asks for email/password 8)Uses every available option on my phone to respond, alas' NO KEYBOARD?!?! *Journalism/Reporting 10/10 *App for biggest name in written journalism :1/10 Garbage *Also note all the other users with identical issues",
The app works fine. Better than other news apps. The paper itself interests me in topics I otherwise wouldn't have considered. No need for me personally to comment on its' news and editorials. Read and judge for yourself.,
"Simple solution- turn notifications off! What you are experiencing is a Pavlovian response. You have now become a slave to the Google empire. Combined with notifications from other apps, you are working for them now.",
"This app is very much so adequate for getting the accuracy news too the people all over. Not just New York. New york time is dependable, and have been around longer than most. That means alot to us viewers.",
The app is really well made! I would really like a feature which allows me to return to right where I stopped reading an article. Also a text to speech feature would be amazing too!,
"While the articles are very mobile friendly, the games glitch. The mini crossword won't show the full keyboard anymore, only the top two lines.",
They've added dark mode...but no option to disable it. I've never seen another app make this mistake. I like to have my phone in dark mode but my news in light mode. Apparently this never occurred to the product/dev teams at NYT.,
"What aggreivates me is that this very expensive subscription, they still have ads all over the place. We pay you so much money- either make it free or nix the ads. $200 a year! You have to be better than that.",
still the best source of news!,
"Overall an OK app. There is an issue where if you click on a push notification, the article gets a dark gray background with black text.",
"Notification banners bring me to the main menu instead of the article. It's really annoying to dig through, and I can't find a search function.",
I always enjoy the extensive coverage of global News the New York times provides,
"Seems to be incompatible with my note 9 post Android Pi update. Articles load to black screens, images fail to load, text and icons disappear. Please fix. It worked fine pre update",
I believe the NYT is the very best place to go to be informed of news. I own a digital subscription I will never let go of and it's podcasts are superb.,
"As always, the NY Times columnists are thoughtful and provocative.",
"Obviously great content and a compelling price. App won't let you save or send wirecutter articles, recipes aren't fully available, and response to questions on app are painfully slow.",
Crossword portion has become very buggy. Only half the keyboard shows up. It is impossible to complete the puzzle now 👎. News is comprehensive,
Make it more lightweight. Annoying ads are there. Huge battery consumption is happening. Please fix. UI should be more responsive. Feed isn't updating well with time.,
"All the news that's for to print, gold standard",
"App doesn't refresh and keeps saying device is offline when, in fact, it is online. I'd like some feedback as I am paying a subscription. So being dead silent to all the people having the same issue is simply not acceptable.",
very important the piece regarding Pope Francis. I am a devout follower.,
"Very frustrating. Paid subscription, and after recent update get only ""opinion"", ""most popular"", and ads. Lots of ads. Top stories tantalizingly flash on screen and then disappear.",
"these days, the app stops and says, my app is an old version and download the latest. and it doesn't allow to upload. I have to uninstall and then reinstall it. Only to suffer the same problem after 4-5 days",
Subscription done via Google PlayStore did not reflect in the app or website. Neither Google nor NY Times is able to trace the payment. Google persistently asks to contact NyTimes and NyTimes says they can't find payment and that I should pay again. Frustrated by the experience and not by the loss of $5.5.,
the constant refreshing to check for new content takes you out of the article youre reading and jumps you back to the home page. you literally cant get through a full article without jumping out of it.,
I like it quite a bit. One big problem: it has stopped recognizing my subscription. I was not due to renew until August. It tells me I have no subscription. I've had a subscription since 2017!,
Works great and supports dark mode.,
"This is what happens when the right wing AND the left wing despise the political center. We are so fractured politically that the ultra conservatives, a distinct minority, have managed to take advantage of the hatred and have employed (literally in the instances of Thomas and Alito) the Supreme Court to impose their theocratic beliefs on the rest of us.",
"News is excellent. Alerts don't always link to the article they are about, though, which is confusing and frustrating.",
"Stopped working on my android tablet, maybe since last update. Says there is no internet connection, but every other app works. Tried un installing, rebooting, etc. Always same no internet message.",
"Professional editorial screening and filtering, informative, intelligent, factual, truthful, respectful, shining guiiding light tower in period of dark history of our times where people with no respect and total lack of human decency are in position of power to make it seem alright to continue as such.. But it's not alright! From a New Yorker, Lower East Side",
Journalism worth paying for.,
NYT is continuing to do an excellent job despite economic and political pressures.,
Great app. Love that some articles have been designed with special animations that really elevate the tone of the story. Do wish that there was a dark mode though.,
App has gotten buggy to the point that notifications don't take you to the story and often times stories don't load. Maybe developers should focus less on advertising to us and more on providing a workable app.,
"Very terrible app. I just downloaded not too long, and I am definitely deleting it. I don't advice anyone to download this horrible app. If they are not going to get a solution for all the complains, they should get this trash off goggle play store! Scam zone. Dont even try to subscribe!!",
Notifications never open the story. It always opens the main page. Sometimes notifications show different/duplicate story when expanded. Very annoying quirks.,
"Content is good and the app is relatively easy to navigate. However, the reason a star is missing, is because of no dark mode. How is there a reading app with no dark mode? I'll tack that star back on once this feature is added. Otherwise, I'm loving the app.",
"This app should be better. It frequently gives me news alert notifications, but when I click them, the app opens and says that the article could not be loaded. That's not much use.",
Your app is NOT STABLE. You open an article and you have 30 seconds to read it before it crashes and takes you back to home. Can't read like this.,
pictures do not load in the app on Chromebook. have to use browser to see photos. reported the issue several times and no progress in close to a year.,
Very frustrated by videos that play with audio. Would much prefer 'classic' newspaper - one where i dont have to frantically search for pause or mute.,
"Very frustrating. Pop-up ads, blank screens. Tonight I can read comments, but not the articles. Pretty much had it.",
I have only recently gotten into timepieces and the insane amount of internet real estate devoted to watches is ridiculous. This article was quite informative. I guess I have to actually get a watch now.,
"The main problems with this app, and I am a Times subscriber, are 1) The main page doesn't get updated quickly with the latest news, although the NYT web site is. 2) They post new stories in Facebook but lately the app won't open them.",
"Updated app is pretty good, much more reliable than before. I'm eagerly awaiting the return of dark mode. Notifications are timely and well targeted.",
Installed and unistalled app and reinstalled App . It keeps showing it is offline but all the other apps working fine. This was after a system update. Customer service not helpful.,
"Consistently does not open articles that come up in the alerts. Just opens something random, if it doesn't crash while spamming me with 70 articles in my notifications.",
"The main course of my news diet. I love the easy navigation of this app, the ability to share and save articles, and also search for articles.",
Love the app. Cancelled because my local library pays for a subscription for all it's members. Customer service person sounded annoyed and negative. Bad day? Hates her job? I don't know. She sucked to talk to. *Edit. Got it again. I love it. My favorite news.,
"Regularly loads random articles when opening a notification. Constantly shows me as logged out, and support is no help. Update: These broken notifications ruin the entire app. Wish I could give negative stars. How do you mess up notifications so badly?",
"NYT investigative reporting and journalism, especially during the pandemic, has been nothing short of spectacular. it has provided vital and practical information not only on public health during the pandemic, but also for this year's elections. It is a staple for democracy, especially in a time when that democracy is under direct threat, and from within its own borders.",
"Months and months of frustration. Issues with scrolling. Especially annoying being bounced completely off the app, often several times a day. Months and months, still no better🤬",
"The app is great. The reporters are generally great. The editors often stumble by trying to add ""balanced"" editorials that are disasters or by covering Trump's every fart as if it's rule of law. Still the greatest news organization in the world.",
"Can you fix the notification settings? I'm on android 8.0.0 with an lgg7 and even though I have the in app settings to silent and vibrate off, I still get pings when I get breaking news. I just want it to show up in my notification bar without sound.please fix",
"App runs well, journalism is a little left leaning, I would have preferred a more neutral source, but overall good experience. If you like the reporting already the app runs great",
"Every couple of days this app forgets I have access to the crossword, or the notifications they put on my phone, or articles on my computer. I am sick and tired of fighting with an app that I paid for to get the content that I paid for. I will not be resubscribing.",
No dark mode. Sluggish UI/UX. Alerts take you to live briefing which must be closed twice. Can't swipe between sections or articles. The Wash Post app is much better.,
"Content is good, performance isn't. Constantly freezes or refreshes & sends me back to the main page in the middle of reading an article.",
"(1) this app always nagging you to sign up & subscribe (2) but they won't make it easy for you to delete account or unsubscribe (3) it has thought provoking article though, very well written (4) but it doesn't have an option for low resolution images thus my data went drained (*) verdict: uninstall for good",
"If I tap on any of my push notifications about certain articles, it just opens up the main page of the app instead of opening that article. Really annoying.",
Used to be good. Recently when I tap to open a notification it just takes me to my home page and it's up to me to go searching for the article! Just fix your notification issue and this will be a 5 star app!,
Why did they change a great app? Loved this app until they recently changed the interface doubling the amount of work it takes top move around and read articles. Interface took 10 steps backward. Why? Why? Why?,
"I love the New York times. the diversity of subjects are amazing. I only wish that I could afford a subscription. being in my 70s and living on social security impossible. the times gives me 10 articles a month for free, these I cherish.",
"Works as expected, sometimes slow to load.",
Dark mode no longer working. Just dark beyond readable now. So much for my go to as my son falls asleep. Now it's bright white or read elsewhere. Tried to post screenshot but not an option. Come though with that dark functionality as the light in this dark time. Damn nyt. Get up,
"Chronological order as an option is still not available Can't swipe between popular topics, only between articles. This used to be a feature until the last year or so.",
"I have asked for and had approved a refund from Google Play for the NYT app. I had paid for an intro subscription this morning but the app never recognized the sub, and kept showing intro sub notices - the same with the NYT website. After a review here and complaints to the NYT, which had no info on my having subscribed, I asked for the refund. I went to the NYT website, paid for a subscription directly to the NYT, and uninstalled the app. Incidentally, I prefer the website to the app.",
"I have a free subscription through my company. However I cannot access my subscription from my phone for reasons unclear. It's I credibly frustrating and ridiculous. I have an account, it's paid for, now let me read your articles!!",
"I tried the app twice & it's was awful. These pop-ups are ANNOYING. If they can't recognize I have said ""no"" more than dozens of times in just the last week, why would I use the app? NYTs, make it stop.",
"I like the content but you are forced to pay a monthly subscription with the app. You can access the website for free. Plus, there are so many news sources that do not require a monthly subscription. This is bad form by NYT.",
I have been reading the New York Times for over fifty years. The New York Times has never disappointed! The finest newspaper in the world! Articles on the Arts and Arts Community are unparalleled Science features are always a fascinating pleasure The world is a better place thanks to the N.Y.T.,
"I downloaded this mainly because I see a lot of NYT articles on Facebook that I want to access. The app, however, won't let me access links from Facebook at all, just gives me a blank page. Honestly was better off without, hoping this gets fixed.",
For months now I've been unable to open links from the notifications. That's critical functionality for be. This app is useless without that.,
This is fantastic finding and will help in designing metallic glass application in critical areas taking the advancement of material science further. Thank you NYT for publishing such informative and educative articles. I haven't come across news papers publishing articles of such scientific importance.,
"I depend on the NY Times to provide accurate, fact based articles about some of the most important stories of our times. It's not surprising that ""Trumpophiles"" have their hair on fire as the spotlight of truth, common sense, reason and logic shines down upon them. GO Nwe York Times!!!",
"Far too many adverts, even for paid subscriber",
"When I was younger I thought so highly of the NY TIMES, always bought the weekend. Thought they were straight shooters with everything and I liked that as I dont consider myself Republican or Democrat, I just want the news how it is. I dont know if I was just young and naive or if the NY TIMES changed over the past decade. But they are very BIASED. Far leaning left news outlet and its so sad they are going this way. Are there any bias news outlets anymore? NY TIMES surely isn't it.",
Night mode is broken. The letters are very faint. Note says rotating the phone will fix it but the app doesn't rotate at all. Expected much better from NYT.,
"The personalized section of the app is SO bad. I get shown the same things over and over again, and there doesn't seem to be any ""learning"" about what interests the reader",
Can't read articles by clicking on the notification. Then can't read articles by clicking on them in the app. A complete failure of a news app. What a joke.,
Application needs advanced search options whenlooking for an article. Also search terms found in article should be highlighted. Finally articles themselves should be searchable for any term. Discounted subscription for new subscribers makes this app well worth the money.,
"And yet again, they change anything in the app that has to do with the mini-crossword, and they break the mini-crossword. GBoard on Pixel 4XL only showing the top two rows of letters. AGAIN.",
"Why would you remove the widget? Gets a 1 because the app is constantly trying to inform me of news I could care less about even when turning notifications off, the widget allowed me to at a glance see if any of the stories were interesting without the need for notifications every 10 mins",
"After hours of subscribing to the NYTime, I still cannot read the full stories. I reached out for help online, but responce was beyond slow, nonexistent. I also subscibed to the Washington Post, which was extremely easy and immediate. So, I am unsubcribeing NYTime app.",
"When someone dies, always go to New York Times obituaries first.",
I have found the NY Times to be diligent in research and outstanding in reporting news especially during Covid. I often compare reports with other reputable news both print and electronic and rely on the NYTimes for accuracy. The Daily Covid newsletter has literally been a lifesaver. NY Times is a Pulitzer Prize winning journal because of its integrity and excellence.,
Search option is absolutely terrible when looking for specific articles but the rest is rad. Kudos on all the things you've done to ensnare younger readers.,
"The app is unstable. The cinematic features, lead to lag and are simply not worth it. It's better to use the browser version.",
"I love this app. However, with the most recent update, I'm now seeing a popup message ""your device is offline. Ladt updated: oct. 24"" and none of the articles are up to date",
"Hopefully you don't try to cancel your subscription on the app! I have been trying for a few weeks to do just that and it does not work at all. Feels like a scam, because if I can't cancel this, they keep getting my money. Really not enjoying this.",
Google play subscriptions are broken in this app and support is unable to help. Eventually had to pay for another subscription because both Google and NYT support insists the other has the problem. (It's definitely the app that's broken),
"I assumed paying for a subscription would eliminate the ads, but the first article I read had 8 ads, all either animated or video. To cancel you have to call or chat online.",
The latest version of the app removed the headline widget for android. This was one of the best features and one that separated the NY times from other news apps.,
Gives you lots of status notifications but choosing them only takes you to the generic times homepage via the app. It's a good app if you know what you're looking for. Not that great for breaking news.,
Last update completely broke all games. Scrolling just forces the game to refresh and kicks you out to the game selection screen. Tried it on 3 Android devices including a tablet and got the same problem.,
"App keeps stopping before it even opens. { Up to date Pixel 6) Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to no avail. I have a paid account, and can't even use it. Pls fix.",
"Good news app, with some bugs. For some reasons most pictures in articles dont load for me, which is very annoying. All other pictures work fine.",
"Excellent, well written information.",
"Duplicate breaking news notifications are annoying. Glaring white background is fine during the day, but impossible at night. Give us a NIGHT MODE!",
"Kind of annoying actually. Articles won't load and then I'm told my device is offline, which it is not. I have full bars or I'm connected to wifi. What's the point in paying for a subscription if all I can do is read the headlines?",
"Unfortunately, the app is very inconvenient. It has so many bugs while going from page to another and it crashes. Please fix this.",
"The NY Times is a place I can go to get ALL the news - good and bad! And, you can trust what you read to be well-researched, well-written and fully investigated. Thank you for being there to get us all through the madness that has defined this crazy year!",
DO NOT PURCHASE A digital SUB VIA THIS APP. THEY HAVE NEVER given me an account number so I can't cancel. They do not recognize my email. AND YET I pay Each month Countless chats and emails have not resolved the issues. DO NOT TRUST THEIR SYSTEMS. I am serious about this.,
"I personally enjoy the articles from the NY Times more than any other Times that I read (Chicago and Japan). This newspaper seems to be for the world, not just for New York. Thanks for sharing.",
"The redesign with the tabs is better and the notifications not opening up articles issue seems to be fixed. A great turnaround - I hope similar improvements come to the Crosswords app. Saw you're hiring an iOS dev for Crosswords, but it's the Android version that's lagging. Be nice for Android to have a decent app too, we don't pay less....",
"Like the content, but app crashes all the time. Also, I hate that it scrolls up to the top when I return to the home screen.",
"For an app that requires a subscription, it is inescusable how badly designed and how poorly functional the NY Times app is. If they don't improve their app, I am going to cancel my subscription to the NY Times.",
"No dark mode. Instant one star. Everything else I use has dark mode, there is no excuse for this app to have this eye-searing trash in 2022. Cancelled my recurring subscription to the Times until they fix it.",
"I can't love the NYT app enough! It's fast and after a number of months with daily (throughout the day) usage, I haven't encountered any bugs.",
"beautiful for reading. needs in app feedback section, text size options do not work in some articles or sections of the app, recently viewed does not sync across devices",
the app was working great for a while but now I only get a bunch of news messages once a week instead of when they are released. can't find a setting to adjust that.,
"Crashes while loading ads App is nicely designed, but constantly crashes while loading the *many* ads. 3/11/19 - articles load, if i can complete reading them before ad loading triggers a crash, I am lucky.",
"I laughed all the way through ""Down the Rabbit Hole.""",
"An app that is as equally bad as its reporting. Don't waste your time. You're better off reading the label on the back of the shampoo bottle in your shower. Oh, and at least the shampoo bottle doesn't crash every 5 seconds.",
"Cannot access the articles All I get on screen is a message ""You have reached your 5 article limit."" I have contacted customer service and they say they are working on the problem. This is incompetence. We need a class action lawsuit vs the NYT.",
"This last upgrade takes forever to download the full text of the articles. If it continues, I'll have to subscribe to a competitor. What's with this NYT? Have you upgraded your membership in the data theft industry?",
"Too expensive. I know they post some great articles and, I finally decided to get subscribed ,but 8$/month for subscription??!! That is way too much. Some streaming services offer cheaper service than this.",
The Journalism is great and very well done. The App is clunky and antiquated to navigate. You should really do better New York Times.,
a voice reader option would be nice,
Times are you kidding me? The best journalists in the world are giving you stories and risking their lives. It's far more objective than some other newspapers I've read. Not everything is political to get perspective no matter what your opinion is.,
I rely on the detailed reporting and unwind with the arts and culture coverage. The crosswords and games are excellent. Highly recommend!,
Having trouble reading the stories. The page wouldn't scroll up after entering into the story (on Android). Very frustrating.,
For an app that constantly bugs you to subscribe. It's a bit strange that when you actually try to do so it can't connect to the Google play store....,
"The push notifications show me an article I want to read, when I click on it, it takes me to all the articles and I cannot find the one I wanted to read initially. Pls fix",
"I subscribed through the app without signing in. When I tried to connect my account it is not allowing me to do so. Through app sent request for help. Nothing so far except an automated email. Regards, Jeyaraman LS",
App feeds content you cannot access with subscription (wirecutter and food)... Deceptive and cannot be stopped. Hard to detect while reading available content. Tech support ignores. Needs to be flagged as nag-ware and advertising. Suggest against downloading or subscribing,
"There are so many news sources available, I almost never found the need for a paid subscription. Then you have to cancel by phone or chat, which is deliberately slow. I got Francisco, who delayed and delayed. It took approximately 14 minutes on chat just to say ""Thanks, but no thanks!""",
Notification settings are a joke. Stories about how someone feels is not Breaking News.,
NEEDS DARK MODE!!! I get it. Newspapers were always black text but reading a newspaper versus a backlit screens is really uncomfortable without dark mode.,
"Clicking on a notification almost never opens the relevant article. Also, searching for the article never works because the blurb doesn't match the article title.",
The loss of sliding section tabs at the top of the page is horrible. Bring back the old functionality. It was far superior.,
The best newspaper in the country at your fingertips.,
I have the NY Times app and it really keeps me informed. The news is so provocative and I learn about today's trials as well as historical events and factual information. I am proud that they do such an amazing job for the citizens!,
New York Times you have suffered the worst in the newspaper business losses and you have come out on top. Thank you for the hard work and investigative reporting that you have always done so well. Great App Too! bob brown Melbourne florida,
provides in depth information that I trust. I am grateful that I have access to such a valuable resource.,
"Great app, minus the forced refreshes making me lose my spot when I go back to the main page. Ad loading makes the page jump suddenly as well. Annoying.",
"The app was great until the update a couple days ago. Now it is very slow and barely functions! If you have not already upgraded, don't do it! I wish they'd worked out the bugs before releasing it...",
Buyer beware - it's unbelievably difficult to cancel subscriptions!!! It takes no less than 40 minutes minimum to cancel a subscription through NYT - save yourself the trouble!,
Always interesting.most are items that are more than what I expected.I wanted to share with some friends but didn't know how to use it or if it would be permitted. I know several who would have loved the DavidBowie item & costumes.I 'll encourage them to download themselves.,
"Bad update. Got rid of night mode. Return to the top after article is annoying. And broke the crossword, can't see the whole keyboard.",
"They make you chat or call them to cancel. Takes forever to do so also. I wrote this entire review while chat was ""pulling up my account"" after I was already logged in. Too pushy on cancellation. Just make it a button to cancel and I would join and leave as needed but since this is the process for leaving I definitely won't be.",
Excellent source of daily news.,
informative. wonderful cooking section.,
Scroll on this app is very sensitive where almost every vertical swipe opens an article. This doesn't happen for other apps on my phone.,
This update is much appreciated. I use this app to help me be informed. It's extremely important to support print journalism. Responsible press is one leg of the chair that supports democracy. Local newspapers are also critical to an informed electorate.,
Junk. Won't update with new content. Freezes up. Very poor showing. No clear determination to repair. Yes. I'm a subscriber.,
It never directly connects me with the NYT or an article. I always have to login after numerous NYT requests to upgrade or accept some bothersome proposal. I'm ending the NYT subscription after this month.,
No dark mode. Some good stories. Some fake news. A mix of both. Mostly establishment voices. Thanks for the service,
"scummy subscription stop policy, was just reminded about how Gross NYT is in requiring paying customers to call a service number to cancel payments. so gross, i will never fall for that again. so dishonest and disrespectful of ppl that actually paid you.",
"Apr 2023:Seems more functional. 2022: For neatly two years, the app will not allow comment posting from my Samsung Android device. It is not an account problem, because I have no problem posting via Windows Firefox on same device. Washington Post, L.A. Times, never a single problem! NYT? Incompetent programmers? Who knows...",
"Almost daily it tells me ""your device is offline."" My device is online for everything else. Tech support has said at least a dozen times ""reinstall."" It never helps.",
"Buggy app. The 'For You' section rarely updates, and my Wordle stats and streak got lost because of a bug they admitted to. Unsubbed and app deleted.",
"Words no longer appear, only pics and ads, not even headlines. I subscribed to the app, worked great until 3 weeks ago. Canceling subs soon",
App says my device is offline and doesn't show the news.,
"I am a subscriber for more than a year. News reporting is probably the best in the world. The experience however is not good. App is filled with bugs and customer support doesn't really care. I hope they see all the comments here and improve their services, because it's a shame.",
"Great app and amazing content as always. I have to deduct 1 star for the lack of night mode. My eyes hurt, it's so glaring white!! Please have pity on your devoted readers and offer a dark mode. Happy readers, happy newspaper, yes?",
"BREAKING NEWS has become meaningless. If NYT is sending out a push notification about a story, you really don't need to say breaking news... especially when it's the third notification about the same basic story.",
"The coverage is bad, and you should feel bad. Right-wing bias aside, whenever I get a notification, I always have to ""retry"" after tapping it.",
Clean interface but riddled with problems. Notifications dont take you to the article and insane data usage. 2gb of background data use in 24 hours! Uninstalled.,
"Can not Uninstal as pre-installed software on my device. This is bloat ware and malware because it cannot be shut down on your device by any means and it dues suck up on performance. Content is only accessible by pay wall. I didn't pay for this, didn't want it but am stuck with it. I am sure my device will function better once I figure out how to uninstall this peice of malware bloat ware 😠",
"Reviewing app functionality alone, & content opinions excluded from this review. The app works very well for me and is good at curating targeted content and for making available things I search for. Stable with few crashes on my OnePlus 8 Pro.",
All the news that fit to read.,
Detailed and well researched,
"This app was always crashy. An uninstall/reinstall might help, I thought. The app does look completely different now, but also crashes 3 times as often. Can I give it zero stars?",
Article links from FB to app does not always work on my Andriod phone. Both FB and NY TIMES apps have been recently updated. Often ended up a blank screen.,
"I see that my complaint about losing the top scrolling menu is common. So, I am not crazy. Multiple un-installs and re-installs still has not brought back my formerly functional NYTimes app. Disappointed. Did Russia bring your app down?",
I value the APP and it used to be excellent. During the last week it is has become terribly unstable to the point that it is unusable. Galaxy Note10+ on Android 11.,
"I read The Morning every day as part of my essential catching up on events, reading and listening to multiple U.S. and foreign news outlets. The Times always delivers thoughtful national and international reporting. And NYT Cooking has become a favorite, too.",
"It's a great news app! Articles load extremely quickly, even when the connection isn't great (on the subway). It's well designed and easy to use",
The Home Page takes forever to load. All other sections load quickly. It is very frustrating and pushes me toward the browser version over the app.,
"Tapping notifications opens different stories than what the notification is for. Rendering updates through notifications pointless. Premium cost, expect app perfection.",
"Good app overall. I would upgrade my rating if you incorporate a ""night mode"" in the app. It does take a toll on your eyes and overall health when you are blazed by a bright screen at night.",
"For Android OS, this app needs an overhaul. Content on the front page jumps continuously, pointlessly rearranging itself every half second or so. Absurd.",
Can the app stop trying to update the page every time I click back once finished with an article? It is so annoying-I don't need the page updated every two minutes.,
it's by and large great but sometimes it pokes unnecessarily in sovereign matters of other countries. Giving opinions without deep and thorough research and understanding the ethos of the people and historical facts can sometimes be misleading. However the articles cover a wide range of issues.,
"Great source of reliable up to date news. Highly reccomend ""The Daily"" podcast for an informative and captivating start to your day. Student rate subscription is worth every penny, and the money goes to support the best of the best of investigative journalism. Only drawback is its US-focus which means some articles are not as relavant for Canadian audiences.",
"The journalism is excellent, but the app still freezes and restarts several times weekly, and apparently randomly. Galaxy S21 Ultra with all updates.",
"Hard to unsubscribe. I get too many ads. When scrolling, ads load late and breaks scrolling. I paid... Surely we can remove the ads? App is also glitchy and I can't configure it enough.",
"This was my go-to app for news, then they decided to remove the widget, and also the ability to log in? I presume only the latter was unintentional, but both make as much sense.",
"Crashes and locks up on Android, 3 or more times before last article. Ads are too numerous and too large. Poor user interface for a great paper.",
Great journalists. Great newspaper.,
"I've subscribed for years then Ive had time to look at recurring billing and found my cost jumped from 8.00 to 15.00 plus precious taxes so 16.00 I'm not sure why but I do what I did CANCELLED. I did the same for the Washington Post. Similar action. I appreciate that people write , research,great reporting but during a pandemic. Costs are tight.😷",
Couldn't even open the app for the past one week. Kept telling me the app has expired and asked me to update the app (which I did). Still doesn't work. No email reply from Nyt's android team.,
"Although the NYT Android app works as a worthy ""Latest News"" substitute (albeit not quite the same) of the website, one cannot say the same about the website's ""Today's Front Page"" screens, which are still not part of the Android. I'll revise my stars upward if they change this situation.",
"I am really impressed by the amplitude and richness of the articles published, no matter what the subject may be. My decision to sign up for full content has proved to be one of the wisest taken in a long while.",
"Recent update renders crosswords unusable-- cannot see bottom row of keyboard on phone and tablet. Sorry for the low rating--was fine until update, but HELP!!!! Please fix asap!!",
"Disappointed with the way this version seems to share to Facebook - no thumbnail/lede, just ""nyti.mes"". Now I have to revisit the articles in my browser in order to share correctly.",
"Most of the app works great. The search engine could be a little better. But the comments are limited to only commenting to others. The ""pen"" button to comment on the article directly doesn't work on Android, Samsung.",
"About as honest as it gets anymore. Some opinion articles have a spin factor, but the news reporting can be tracked on other sources for veracity. So far, I have not come across anything patently false that is not corrected.",
Broad range of information. Thought provoking aetfcf AZ[,
"I'm rating the app, solely losing stars due to the annoying Lucy-pulls-the-football notifications. ""Thought that enticing notification was going to take you to an interesting story? Ha! The joke's on you. We like messing with our customers."" This has been going on for over a year; it's been six months since I complained (they're aware of the problem). While the rest of the web can support permanent links, you can't have yours last a day or two? Puts me that much closer to cancelling.",
Do not buy the subscription via Google play store. It will not work on the app or the NYT website. Forums are full of people that paid and can only access the content via Google Newsstand. NYT replies work generic emails saying it's not their fault.,
App performance has really improved in the last few months. Things are loading and it's working as expected. Now I can enjoy the NYTimes without cursing my phone.,
I get notification on my phone with a little blurb about an article. If I find that I might be interested in the article I tap it. Now the app opens. Does it take me to the article that I tapped. No it takes me to a page which has multiple articles on it. Now I have to scroll and search for the article I was interested in. This makes the notifications useless and the app is useless. I will be uninstalling and cancelling my subscription.,
"This offers me no benefit over the website. The only difference I've noticed is that I can't block the 5+ ads littered throughout each article. If I'm a subscriber, I shouldn't be seeing ads in the first place.",
Decision makers and other people of influence read the NYimes in the US and abroad. Although I'm just a little guy I like to read what these heavies read just to keep an eye on what's coming down the pike. I've been reading the Times for more than sixty years.,
"Generally like the content, however the ads have started auto playing with sound even when the settings are set to no auto play. So had to uninstall.",
"This is the worst app I have. Doesn't work on my phone, constantly has to be updated, just quits, won't update etc. I might add I never have issues with the Post. And I cant see other reviews. Gee I wonder why.",
This app used gigabytes of mobile data even though I only read a few articles and didn't watch any videos. I've updated the settings on my phone to block certain apps from using mobile data but I also uninstalled this app just to be sure.,
Freezes every few seconds and crashes outright at least a couple of times a month. Easier to read in the Chrome browser.,
"Still no fix for the bugs in the mini crossword. Advice from NYT was to subscribe to the web app or subscribe to the crossword app, even tho I already subscribe to the full service. No thanks.",
"Everytime I try and click on a link from chrome, and open it in the app, it cannot locate the article, and shuts down, don't recommend downloading.",
"Very comprehensive, like the Times. Articles I thought had saved seem to have disappeared. I have trouble using the search function ( often trying to find my disappeared ""saved"" articles).",
"The layout and design of the app evokes a newspaper but it's app. It's perfectly programmed, I haven't come across one bug since using it.",
"App can be buggy at times, went to cancel service after 6 months and they make u go through a chat which took close to 25 minutes, not really acceptable. I've gotten auto insurance quicker than this.",
"App is fine, but clearly lagging behind other major newspapers' apps. The lack of a dark mode is particularly disappointing. WSJ and WaPo figured it out; why hasn't NYT?",
Crossword not working again. Extremely lousy customer service with a very fragile product doesn't bode well. Once again the mini cw isn't working. Same problem as before -- inability to access full keyboard. The idea of paying for this is laughable . . .,
"What have you done with my dark mode? The beta version that was in experiments for many years was never great, but it worked. Now even that has been taken away! Please restore this critical functionality ASAP.",
"Serious deteriorating. Multiple video ads for the same product in one story. More annoying, they autopsy without any way to.turn them off. No ""Todays Paper"" section. Not refreshed very often during the day. The WSJ is seriously kicking their butt.",
"Full of terrible hit pieces on presidential and congressional candidates, disengenuous op-eds, and justifications for foreign wars with no factual basis - just proves you can't trust any US mainstream media. Fox News may be worse, but I'm finding a more reliable news source.",
This is version 6.20.6 Updated 10/19/18. Works well on both my older Galaxy Tab S2 and newer Note 9. I got a good monthly rate. I'm very happy with the service. I just wish the news wasn't so bad these days.,
"Love the Times, hate the app. Version 7.2.0 is unusable. Artcles fail to load, text disappears, lockups, random crashes. Please fix this!",
What is up with you guys? I'm in the first month of a twelve month subscription and I can't load a second article without continually reopenning the app. Some articles don't even scroll to the end but cut off three quarters in. Please fix this thing.,
"Reporting unbiased, fact-checked news is crucial to any civilization. The NYT does it well. Thank you. The Times is a daily go-to. Together with the AP, The Guardian & the WaPo, and possibly Bloomberg, the NYT is one of the rare US institutions we actually do right!",
Half the time the app doesn't load the stories I want to read. My internet is not the issue bc I've tested that. Due to frustrations there are days in a row I don't get to take advantage of my paid subscription.,
The NY Times is an awesome app to use. My only complaint would be the lack of an audio option to listen to articles. This is something that is present at a number of other papers.,
"Content is best in the world, but the app drains battery in the background. Didn't use it once one day, but it consumed 21% of the battery and ran for 21 minutes. Now I'm trying to restrict it to prevent this.",
"The app is convenient and user-friendly (getting alerts of breaking news is particularly useful), but I fear it is best used as a way of gauging what the majority of people THINK the news is.",
In the continuous death cycle and consolidation of media companies the New York Times has been a beacon the hill for overseas Americans like myself with an excellent digital edition which is a daily 2 hour stop with well balanced national and some great in depth international articles. Great Op Ed pieces and writers like Nicholas Kristof who writes with compassion and from the heart. An article on the transformative evolution of this great newspaper is in order !,
"My go to for updates and insights into the important political and cultural questions challenging our world. I appreciate the long form articles, focused research and timely updates. Kudos to the NYT team for their commitment to real journalism.",
Great! I must subscribe!,
"The high journalistic standard of the NYT is evident on reading, especially their election coverage. Editorials are broadly known to lean liberal but they do include a variety of voices. Sadly, Food and extra Crosswords cost extra.",
Incredible that NYT continues to raise prices and yet clearly doesn't spend a penny on engineers. An app that refuses to sign me in without redirecting me to my mobile browser... True quality software. And a surefire way to get me to cancel my subscription.,
So should journalism be in modern times,
I have a basic subscription access under my dad's subscription plan. I'm not able to access more than 3 stories a week. Customer service sent me a new link for my basic access and it hasn't changed anything.,
"There is something about this paper. I've had hard copies delivered to my home, but I find the digital version much better for my needs. Thanks, NYT I have been a fan since I moved to NY in 89', and found most of my job opportunities in the employment section of your paper. Keep up the good work. Sorry I grew up reading the Los Angeles Times.",
News articles are unreadable. The app cannot stay in one place and will wildly scroll in any direction. Tried on two android phones.,
"Using this app to follow news as it happens is nearly impossible, there's no ability to sort articles chronologicaly.",
"Always up to date, almost always accurate, and vigorous reporting is what I love about the NYT. The App is continuously improving (which I like) now if we can get editor's on board to stop pandering to every tweet AND BE MORE CRITICAL AND ACCURATE WITH HEADLINES YOU CHOOSE (THIS I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH). 45's impulsivity hasn't been news for well over a year (or 2) Move on. The NYT has the power to control the news cycle, its time you reclaim that responsibility for the sake of our freedoms.",
I wish someone would respond to me. I have 2 current subscriptions to the NY Times and cancelled another because all of them still won't give me consistent (if any) connection. Unless they fix this I will not renew.,
App is buggy and a battery hog on its best day. On its worst it will just crash over and over again. Ads everywhere despite having a subscription. The news is good but the app and ads are hot garbage.,
"ADS! It makes me want to cancel my subscription. E: Cancelled my subscription. The app is barely usable. Too many ads, laggy, uses too many resources and makes my phone overheat. Maybe when they fix it I'll resubscribe.",
I used to love this app but I'm now uninstalling. Notifications to read an article I already read every 5 mins for almost an entire day. Reported the problem and didn't get emailed back. Don't install!,
"Moved away from the inexpensive print newspaper area, across country, so I'm happy to have the online version. Does summaries of stories, which you can click for more in-depth. Timely news & reporting",
great article. insightful. informative. NYT is worth it.,
"The last update broke the links from the headline to the stories, the headline just flashes but the content won't open. I'm a logged in subscriber using a Pixel 3.",
Great summary on the issue of ground water depletion,
Can't access my subscription,
"A very informative exchange... ""spot on""!",
Advertisements in app even for paid subscribers. Oh and nice touch with the bugged out menus to access subscription management. Had to log in twice and then choose to chat or call to cancel. Lol. Support your mission but not your business practices. Unsubscribed and not returning.,
"Nit had a chance to use it yet, and you are asking me to rate it.",
Best journalism available. Real professionals work here.,
Every adult American should read this sobering article. We have poisoned the system by choice on the altar of the profit motive.,
"Awful reliability - it crashes constantly and is a gross dis-service to the work of the high quality reporters whose work it should be bringing, seamlessly, to all readers. I cannot comment on re-loading problems as I have not stayed on-line long enough to encounter such problems",
Real journalism is vital. Get this app and subscribe.,
"Article push notifications don't lead to the articles. They always result in the error message ""This article failed to load due to an error. Please try again."" Pretty useless.",
Killing subscribers with the a la carte options.,
"Keeps needing me to log back in. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixes the problem, but annoying bug.",
They need to rename this app The Wordle Game,
Good content but massive pester power to pay. Not enough unbiased content to pay. Removing it to save space as can get free news elsewhere.,
"Great news content. App generally works well, except push notifications often don't link to the article after a day or two.",
bigger is NOT better in light of emerging threats',
I really enjoyed this recent class of election discussions?,
"Substantive, reliable journalism.",
Always on leading news.,
very interesting! could have far reaching ramifications.,
"What do I think? How many people know about this monument? What's more, how many know of Crazy Horse and the Lakota people?",
I mostly read at night but can't read this app because there is no dark mode and it is **BRIGHT AF** (would be thrilled to hear how if in wrong on that). Because of this I barely use it and probably won't continue my subscription for long.,
Makes a good argument for international cooperation.,
Great except for the Opinion pieces,
Great morning routine (for older men),
Paints a very believable picture,
It's the best paper in the country.,
Very bias and expensive papper,
NY Times is the best.,
A wonderful story of a father and a daughter's love and acceptance.,
Unsaved resaves instantly,
The best newspaper!!,
An Indian who wants the world to acknowledge the scientific history & knowledge of Indians.,
Best news in the business.,
app is great!,
always 5 star articles,
"Five stars for content, one star for the app itself. This week of all weeks it continually crashes when trying to open it. Please fix ASAP!!!!",
The app turn to beta version which requires me to update the new version of the app. When you follow the instructions it always take you back to the popup message to download the new version. Confusing!,
"Articles never seem to finish loading, causing the screen to bounce around the page. Makes it incredibly difficult to read",
Nature always finds a way...,
"App displays ads to paying members. Also spams you with notifications, seems like everything is breaking news. Why not have better controls for notifications. This stuff isn't rocket surgery.",
Annoying that story notifications don't take you to the actual story in the app when clicked. Difficult to tune which notifications are received.,
"The NYT is ridiculously biased, but the app works great and the stories are still top notch, if you can learn to see through the bias.",
"Horrible app, good journalist content. It doesn't let you cancel subscription easily. The chat bot doesn't work for my Android, the human Service app never gets connected and you'll have to call to cancel.",
"Love the newspaper, like the app, hate the ads. I am paying a weekly subscription, yet you are shoving ads for luxury watches and perfumes in my face all the time. Very uncool.",
"Although I like many of the features of the app, it's a major power hog, causing my phone to warm up and drain the battery while simply reading news.",
"Before subscribing you need to know that there seems to be no way to cancel ever. You're trapped. Other reviews that said they canceled cuz of some perceived political bias are lying to you. If those people were actual subscribers they'd still, have it.. You will never get out of this even when they triple the price in ya without warning. Don't do it unless you are ready for a lifelong commitment. Its easier to get out of marriage.",
"Unlike any other app I use, the paid version (a.k.a. NYT subscription) still comes with ads. They suck up data, slow article loading, and make scrolling jumpy.",
"App has been broken for awhile now. Articles don't load or text color is messed up. I'm not quite sure what the problem is but they need to fix their app, especially since I am paying for the content.",
"Notifications don't mean anything. I get article notifications on my phone. When I click on them, it dosen't take me to the article but rather to the main page of the app, and then I have to search for it. What's the point??",
Can't use it without tones of pop out everytime you try to open an article for subscriptions and payments. Most annoying application.,
"Well, there is not much to complain about when using this app. It's pretty solid, has never crashed in the last year, and easy on the eyes. And it does exactly what it is supposed to do: work without problems. There is some room for improvement so far as the notifications are concerned. Worth paying for! A user from Calcutta, India.",
I am not a BETA member anymore but somehow the beta version gets installed. I joined BETA but then I was frustrated as every time I opened the application the old build expired and I had to install the new one again and again. Now again I can see the BETA version and I cant install the normal one.,
I've been unable to set a different sound notification for this app from what my phone's default notification sound is for months now. Is anybody working on this?!,
"Constant crashing. Refuses to refresh. It used to work fine, but a month ago it started having issues.",
"I believe in news papers. Your reading is very personal and allows your quite mind to decide what you believe. I get tried of shouting and repetitive voices on tv and radio. Print with individual voices, I let their tell stories. Thank you.",
"Outstanding news content, but app is increasingly clunky, slow to load, and frustrating. Gets worse and worse. Very disappointing in the overall app use",
One of the recent updates has caused constant issues with the notifications: they typically do not align with articles and they often roll in all at once.,
"Terrible customer service. Quality of writing and editing is at an all-time low. Plus, they raised my monthly payment by 375% without notice. Been on hold for over half an hour, waiting to cancel my subscription.",
This app drains battery life super quick which is unfortunate because you have to take the time to read the articles. I uninstalled the app but continue to follow the NYT elsewhere.,
"While the Times are my preferred source of news, the app is practically unusable. The app crashes within a couple minutes almost every time I open it",
Superb and informative.,
Horrible support Been using for years. Mostly works well. All of a sudden app is eating up mobile data. Support ignores requests for assistance. If there is no resolution soon I will be forced to cancel,
app is currently broken. just hangs on a black screen when I try to open. have reinstalled to no avail. it used to work great before most recent update. writing from galaxy s20 fe.,
"I have been using the NYT app for 4+ years and I would normally rate 5 stars. However a recent update (~Jan 2021) removed the DARK MODE feature, and if brought back I would happily change my rating to 5 stars again.",
"Drains battery Does not maintain location between usages No dark mode Poor UI design Hard to find articles because of crappy search Sooo many ads (see battery usage above) And I'm a paid subscriber. Ugh this is a ""Failing NYT"" app.",
I am a paid subscriber and the app is buggy at best. Doesn't open a story with the loading banner looping infinitely. Have to manually kill the app and then launch again.,
"This app is fine when it works, but it keeps crashing on some days. I have to use a Chrome search on those days to access NYT news.",
"A terrible app. Article often fail to load, the length of articles is kept a secret, and saved articles randomly disappear from the saved articles tab. Is there a reason NY Times' Android app is CONSIDERABLY worse than its Apple app??",
very convenient and easy app but after download the new version of this app in couple of days the popups are shows that version is expired..and there is not put any solution to get latest version,
Unable to read articles in Dark/Night mode. The print is gray against black background. Contrast is atrocious. Needs a fix.,
"It's not connected to Facebook or any social media i.e. it doesn't allow me to read more than 3 articles per month on fb, not realizing I have subscription. And this app does not have a search button so I can search the title I saw on fb",
"The pictures are hard to see. I can't enlarge them, but the writing and reporting are as good as ever! First time I've used the app, so I've got to wait before I can assess the app fairly.",
"Subscription starts out as Free, then goes to $2 a month, now goes to $8 a month. Cannot find link to cancel. Can no longer afford it. Hard times!",
Putting ads at the very top of the feed is like using the front page of the print paper for advertisements. It's a slap in the face for your paid subscribers. If this continues I will cancel my subscription. (I am a fan of the content though.),
"Some of the best journalism in the US, but their international coverage can be improved, specifically around content and context.",
l love the honesty of the news and variety of US and World news. There are always interesting informative articles about additional topics from art to poison ivy!! I am a huge NYT cooking fan as well as a fan the crossword puzzles.,
"Please roll back to the latest release before March 12, 2019. This release contains breaking changes that prevent articles from loading! I want a refund for this month's subscription (and every month until this app gets fixed)! Pixel phone user.",
"almost everything is as it should be. two suggestions: 1) bring search button to the main page 2) make the categories such as Books, or World movable so we can access them with more ease.",
"Good, however sometimes 'forgets' my subscription details. Articles I started reading in print often appear a day or two later - reallt inconvenient, especially when commuting.",
"The Grey Lady remains a bulwark against specious claims of anti-science, anti-fact, propaganda that reverberate within the echo chamber of algorithm selected opinion newsstuff. While publicly traded, the NYT presents well cited, superbly written, and thorough investigative journalism for discerning readers to decide for themselves. While not the Loudest Voice in the Room, its adaptation to digital expedites carefully curated news as the North Star and Paper of Record. Journalism par excellence",
This app is not accessibility friendly. It does not work well with Androids built-in accessibility functions especially the text-to-speach reader.,
"Mostly love NYT, though I did downgrade my subscription a couple years ago after some egregiously Rethug-friendly reporting, when it was clearly a weirdly-buased piece NKT based on facts, after 40+ years where Rethugs are known liars, cheaters, traitors, and hypocrites. The app is good, but I cannot enlarge any pages or anything as I read. Very frustrating. Please make this possible, NYT.",
Best current writing and seems very informative. Some of us may get more stuff by reading in a good app like this one. Thanks to many different things that have led up to this tech work there may be a way.,
"Very pathetic experience. No notifications on time, comes multiple at a time. And while reading, popup asking login into account often interrupts my smooth reading.",
"Crashes and burns constantly - can't read any stories with our paid subscription. Stories take a long time to load if ever, then the whole app dies.",
"Recent versions constantly reload (in midst of reading articles, sometimes as often at once a minute) and suck up Gigs of Data. At this rate the NYT should be paying me!",
Shouldn't have to view ads if I am praying. Will be considering canceling.,
"Good overall but the poor night mode is a killer. Why use the app? I'd rather sync the site and use Simplified View. Get with the times, NYT...night mode is everything.",
"i want to get Breaking News alerts, but I'm turning them off because it keeps using my general notification/text messaging sound even though I changed the sound within the app settings to something quieter that wouldn't wake me.",
I love reading the Times for the political articles and information of al kinds. The Times magazine has thought provoking articles on climate change and other topics. The ads are few and easily bypassed.,
"I expected top notch journalism, which the NYT delivers on, but I have been (3 months now) pleasantly surprised by the cool, interactive digital content available on the app!",
"I really like the journalism, but the app EATS battery. Today I read it for 9 minutes and somehow it burned thru 8% of my phone's battery. The developers need to look into this stat.",
"I love the paper and the app works well. Except notifications don't open the article they refer to. I hope they fix this soon! If they do, this is a five-star review.",
"Simple and effective, plus the immersive articles are really nice. Dev team seems active as well and any bugs are dealt with in a timely manner.",
"Overall, I love the app and it's very user friendly. If we're paying for the digital version, why do ads still come up ? seems unfair . Other request is to include a dark theme",
"App design, fluidity and stability is excellent on my S20. The journalism is great, and the articles thoroughly researched. Well worth the subscription",
"I click on an article and when it opens the article, the background is dark with white writing. The writing is so pale one can hardly read it.",
"First rate journalism. Great writing and investigatory work, but also often consider very interesting angles to look at different stories. Great international coverage.",
"No reporting is perfect these days but the NYT and a few others, have earned our trust with fair and balanced reporting, thorough investigative reporting while our government, corporations and special interest groups insist on skewing, spinning and pervertion of facts for selfish gain. You don't have to agree, in fact, you're urged to question everything but the truth is undeniable.",
Ruined the battery life on my phone. Only sending push notifications throughout the day and I had never opened the app even once today and it had taken out 31 percent withing 3 hours. That 3 hours also was filled with YouTube which only took 16 percent. Horrible,
"The app is flawless. Except for the AR/VR module, where opening few articles in AR is crashing the app. But no other app out there delivers news in an innovative way like this. Love it!!",
App on android currently does not corretly open any links to NYT articles. It simply opens up the app's homepage and I then have to search for the article I previously clicked on.,
"As usual, the mobile app isn't as flexible as the mobile site-- I can't resize text on the fly or zoom images. Comment links open the app but not the comment. I am uninstalling and good riddance.",
"What good is the app? Not much. Get a notification about a story, tap it, and go to some random story I don't want to read about. Seriously, what is the point of pushing a notification if it doesn't take you to the story?",
I signed up for a promotion of the NY Times. I was tired of the evening news. I am loving the Times. I can customize push notifications and swipe to see articles I am interested in on the daily thread.,
"I keep getting changed $4 each month even though I have NO subscription to NYT. I have changed credit card numbers and they still charge. I call NYTs and they agree, I have no subscription so who is getting the $4 each month? My credit card is investigating fraud.",
An outstanding app. Easy to use and quick to update. I've been using it for three years so far and have no complaints. The same quality as that simbolized by NYT.,
Latest updates made the app virtually unusable. Crashes are common. This is a frequent occurrence with this app. I'm done. Canceling the subscription.,
"Works pretty great. Love the personal feed section. A dark mode would be very appreciated, though, since I usually like reading my news late at night.",
"Unfortunately besides charging the reader money, nytimes think it is appropriate their articles with so many ads, that you can't swipe a single time without seeing one.",
my app keeps switching to the beta version which made me unable to use the app. havere downloaded many times but the problems keep occuring. someone please help!,
App feels janky overall. Feed is jerky and jumps around a lot as ads load. Can't play video in landscape mode so they end up being tiny. Even paid users have to watch video ads before videos,
So happy to finally get the subscription to NYT. It's great to have reliable news available on my device for a reasonable monthly price. Thanks to all the journalists for their hard work and dedication to bring us the important news stories from around the world.,
Having lots of bugs lately. Pixel 2 android 9. Articles fail to load cause of error. Homescreen often completely blank or app crashes.,
"Love NYT articles, but the app frequently does not recognize my subscription when viewing articles from Pixel news feed and blocks articles. I think I have subscribed twice now and it still happens.",
"News is great, but taking away Night Mode was a terrible decision. May have to change subscription service to another newspaper because it's nearly unreadable.",
"Notifications are weird. I get some headlines pushed but if I open the app, a flood of notifications pop up that weren't pushed out.",
"This is an excellent app. It is easy to find articles of interest and to save them for later access. I ended up subscribing as I was so interested in the articles, most of which are very well written.",
"Sluggish, and otherwise frustratingly unpredictable. As much as I love the NYT, this is the worst news app on my phone. Has made me reconsider renewing my subscription. Why must it be so?!",
"Love the NYT. The app is terrible. I want to be able to search for an article I saw somewhere. I want dark mode. I want the link on the website that says ""read in app"" to actually take me to the app, not the play store.",
Great customizable notifications and bookmarking. I didn't get enough use out of this app because they removed offline functionality - that's killer for competitive extemperaneous speaking.,
"I hate that when i get a notification for a specific article and tap it, it never takes me to that article. Just the default feed. I then have to hunt for it. May as well just use Google News.",
it has started crashing and just cannot open it. I have tried reinstalling it but in vain. Although it was working fine before for more than a year or so.,
Great news service. Absolutely the golf standard of journalism. But the subscription is a bit high. Wish NYT would come up with a cheaper option.,
"I subscribed, but it's still asking me to do so. Was advised by NY Times customer service that they were having issues connecting to Google Accounts, but the issue still isn't resolved.",
"Critical flaw in app is that when clicking on news alerts, it opens app to an unrelated article. Then you have to search for story. Inexcusable Android support. It was already obvious NYT didn't care about Android users when it failed to launch NYT Cooking App outside of Apple store.",
"the May 18 update introduced a bug my Motorola G Power phone and to my Samsung tablet. The mini-crossword puzzle layout does not fit the screen of either the phone or the tablet. The keyboard is clipped and runs off the page on the phone, and on the tablet the puzzle is useless without the keyboard",
"App seems to be broken. Any attempt at opening an article leads me to a blank screen that simply shows me the ""loading"" circle until I give up.",
I paid for a digital subscription. And now the app doesn't work. Shows update required message although downloaded several times. I need a fix ASAP!,
I've been a faithful reader of the NYT over 30 years. I much prefer the digital version. This app certainly meets my requirements.,
One of the most solid and trustworthy news sources out there. Good details and sources. I don't know why Americans get their news from bloggers and talking heads when there are still actual news agencies.,
"Really miss the Times widget. Perfectly sized, good photos. Doesn't make much sense that they would ditch it.",
App often crashes and needs to be re-started. I'm using a Samsung Tablet (S2). Looks like it has to do with graphics being displayed.,
Great article covering important history both of the past and in the making. Shows the personal sacrifice and ambiguity a lot of people in Taiwan are having to navigate.,
"Finally, it's refreshing correctly again, but now night/dark mode is gone! REALLY need that back again - is it really that hard to implement? I pay for my subscription, and among SO MANY others would like to have dark mode back.",
"The most up-to-date , highly relevant and informational, comprehensively detailed ,fair and unbiased news reporting,story write ups or articles in sub-magazine sections of the NYTimes written wonderfully in a manner has made a subscriber like me so much used to reading it .Over the time,NY Times has become my most favourite News Source & Family Magazine .",
"The New York times was really good, but it wasn't very organized. YOu couldn't search on the home page either. But the articles were super!",
"Hangs and crashes all the time. Sporadically reloads the page by itself. Strolling stops sometimes. Great content, but bad user experience.",
"I'm a paid subscriber and like supporting real investigative journalism... But being force fed advertising annoys me. Animated ads, video ads, geez!!! Also, this app consumes seriously excessive battery - what is it doing? Seems very suspect. Poor user experience.",
"Usually an excellent newspaper, but also capable of being less than objective when reality pops the bubble of a phantasy of the Editorial Board. Except for that, this newspaper is usually reliable.",
Having to reinstall this APP after every read of an article is fundamentally an extremely poor feature. Please hire some credible coders that have basic expertise. This flaw has been showing up for too long.,
"App shuts down and will not update, fix it b4 I cancel. It has been over a month. I have dumped the app and reloaded multiple times. I'm not getting my money's worth of use. No use, at all.",
"Great reporting. great photos, great opinion. Even when they make mistakes, they're not afraid to admit them and fix them. America needs The Times.",
The best newspaper in the United States.,
Notifications work terribly. Almost never open up the same story in app. Search function in app doesn't find recent and relevant stories.,
Irritating user experience. I'm also getting system notifications that the app is draining my battery when the app isn't even open in background. F that. Uninstalling; I'll just view content on my laptop.,
Since the recent update I can't play the mini crossword on my phone. The keyboard only shows two rows of letters. I will give the app 5 stars when this is fixed!,
"it's a great source for news, usually providing a lot of context. they let you customize some notifications so you get need of interest to you.",
"Nothing works. Background update is garbage, app doesnt download for offline viewing -- ever. They even removed dark mode. Complete garbage.",
Buggy. Crashes often. Despite having a subscription they load ads into the content. There crashes seem related to ads that get stuck loading.,
"Crashes way too often, long loading times for articles seem to be normal. Using a 5+ year old tablet should be possible.",
"Absolutely hate being lulled in by app notifications only to be told that I'm ""offline."" Since I have to use a browser to read anything, I'll just skip the infuriating spin in the barrel on the way to the news. Deleting.",
The app keeps telling me I'm offline when I'm not (all other apps are connecting to the internet normally). This is an intermittent issue and it needs to fixed!,
I've read (and relied on) the Times almost every day since the 1950s except for 2 years in the Peace Corps when all I could get was the News of the Week in Review which they sent us. It's a major asset.,
Was  not able to access the subscription after purchase. Neither Google Playstore or NYT were any help in solving this. The playstore denied my refund. I recommend going straight to NYT and not use this subscription offering from Google.,
"The news are pretty good as expected from NYT but, about the app... I would like the dark mode to be optimized and the ""Todays Paper"" developed in smartphones!",
It keeps on losing my subscription information and asks me to subscribe again and again. Far from seamless experience. Very frustrating.,
"So many bugs and usability issues. NYT has uniformly terrible technology to begin with, but their Android apps are much worse than the iPhone equivalents.",
"App constantly crashes. The elimination of night mode has made this app even less useful. At some point, the app undermines the content.",
"NYT content is generally excellent and worth the subscription, but bright, obnoxious animated and video ads interrupt an otherwise well designed reading experience in this app.",
"It's the comments that I read the most. Great newspaper, tops. Many useful sections. Have been reading it for years before they started charging, don't remember how long ago that was.",
"The app works just ok and it's not available offline. What really bothers me, however, is that I'm paying to have access to the content and still get lots of ads everywhere.",
"Another update, another issue. Fixed keyboard problem, but now I am back to not being able to open puzzles in landscape mode. Extremely frustrated with this app!",
"App keeps on crashing, I'm a paid subscriber but App crashes evertime I try to login with my Facebook credentials. Please correct this. Maybe this issue, with the App, is its compatibility with Android Pie OS",
"I find current information in many fields at the New York Times and love the digital edition. I want more than politics and I get it here; Technology, Lifestyle, Food, and Humanities. great book reviews.",
"The ability to open in Google Chrome browser to read instead of going back to app. Dark mode, ability to turn off, it glitches.",
Its good as a news app and the 360 videos are a good addition but nyt has so much more to offer. App content categories needs to be broader than just news articles - am going back to flipboard & trendeer apps am afraid,
The latest version is constantly trying to refresh content so you cant easily switch articles. Ads have become more invasive and annoying.,
The app has so many bugs. Articles aren't shown. No scroll bar. Notifications aren't displayed correctly.,
Half the articles I click on just don't load. I get a spinner. Using a Galaxy 10 with wifi. I've never had this issue with The Washington Post or other new apps. Disappointed.,
"Easy to read, but search could be better and there is no option to search text within articles. Some news content leans into opinion.",
I have trusted the New York Times since I was old enough to read. I appreciate the presentation of facts on important issues. The layout of the app is easy to navigate.,
"Chock-full of informative, dependable facts for people on both sides of the aisle. Of course, reading The Times also was part of my conversion from Republican to Democrat, so maybe that means something useful to you.",
"News app part is good, but the spelling bee interface is the buggiest thing in existence. So many bugs it's sometimes unplayable.",
It crashes multiple times when reading an article. Ads crash the app... Existing seems to crash the app. Please get your engineers to fix this.,
"Overly woke and blinded by a strict narrative. Sadly, it is no longer the paper of record. After many years of enjoying this publication/app... it's time to uninstall.",
It used to be a great app but now every time I return from reading a story it takes me back to the top of the home page instead of back to where I was on the page. Very frustrating and makes me reconsider my subscription.,
"Great news source - clunky app. When you get a notification and click on it, instead of going to the story, it goes to the top of the home page.",
"1) When a lead shows up on my phone screen, that is the story I expect to see when I tap the link. 2) I really get tired of repeatedly signing in on my phone.",
"Useless piece of junk. Forced to download & employ, not intuitive, not user-friendly, wish the Times would either allow reading or not, & lose this useless piece of junk.",
"Constantly up to date on info. you can't get from standard news media, factual analysis and presentation.",
Strong reporting from quality journalists and excellent articles. I don't always agree with what I read or certain angles and slants yet the NYT subscription is one I am enjoying.,
Every time they update the app they screw up the resolution for the crossword such that the keyboard is half off the screen. I'm sure it will be fixed in another couple weeks bit this is about the fifth time. Why do I keep paying for this?,
The site keeps crashing.I sometimes have to reload an article 3 times during a 15 minute period. I hope they fix it soon. Android user.,
Good content and easy to use. still some work in progress around the dark mode for special coverages.,
"Bugs. I see other people having issues and my most recent one was that it wouldn't update. Like, days and days later. I finally had to delete it.",
"The app is well designed 👌, and the articles are obviously pretty good seeing as how the nytimes is such a successful paper. It's the news app I use most frequently.",
Great experience and great news. I would add the option to read offline. Have had a hard time trying to read in the subway.,
"It's an OK app. The ""save for later"" feature won't let me unsave when I am finished with the article. It's very annoying.",
Drains battery! Articles are fine but the app drained the battery of my Samsung phone. Had to uninstall it. Oddly enough it seems to work fine on my Ipad mini.,
"great when it works. pixel xl, articles don't load and app freezes a few times a day. This is for the paid version of the app.",
"not as progressive leaning as your magat friends think but a decent app, easy to navigate, save stuff, and quality content if you go find it.",
I really enjoy receiving the notifications with the latest news. The games are also good if you want to take a break. I would prefer if they would show more international news in the main page.,
Brilliant app. It would be great if you could introduce one more feature for Android phone users: To be able to select and rearrange the Customized Sections and More Sections in the Menu much like way one can do on Apple phones.,
"The makers of this app can't even manage text inputs on Android properly, so beware of endless repeats when you input letters, in Spelling Bee for example.",
Truky awful experience. Almost more ads than text. And animated ads to boot. Even if you have a subscription.,
"I've paid for a subscription off and on as I could afford (live on a fixed income via disability) as I believe in supporting our newspapers as much as possible, even if that means digitally. The reporting released today led me to resubscribe simply to show my support of a job well done.",
"Always a source of intelligent, thoughtful journalism that respects and engages the reader while covering a myriad of subjects. And when they make a mistake, they actually admit it. How refreshing...",
"It is a good app, which I use on a daily basis. However, every time it gets an update, it crashes, so I need to uninstall and install it again. That is frustrating.",
Would like the ability to see the notification bar when reading an article. Just want to see the time when I'm reading through a lengthy article.,
"Bug in notifications: when there are multiple notifications, sometimes when expanding one to read it, the description text is from a different story.",
"After a while, the app stops displaying articles in a timely fashion. App has to be restarted to fix extremely sluggish behaviour.",
"NYT is, in my opinion, the best newspaper in this country. Their news is fact checked with followups, mind intriguing games and various crosswords.",
"Half the time article never opens, or wrong one. Also very slow. I was hoping some of this would be fixed!",
My experience: Very difficult to post a criticism and emails sent are rarely if ever answered. The snobbery is off the charts.,
"The app is making an awful screeching/white noise sound every few minutes today. I think its connected to an ad, but its made the app unusable today.",
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! couldn't unsubscribe unless I gave them a call. Chat wasn't working. There was no email. They said ""you can cancel anytime""... well I couldn't cancel at all! I can't believe the HIGH level of UNPROFESSIONAL behaviour from their staff! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!",
No point in having this app. It doesn't update more than every day or two. Nobody needs yesterday's news. Developer seems oblivious to similar complaints. Too bad. I like the NY Times but this is ridiculous.,
"I spend $5 a month for the app to consistently give me an error message when I try to read, plus I often use the cooking section but I have to use my browser because its not on the app. Please fix this o dont want to unsubscribe but its becoming not worth the problems",
"The app itself is fine when I'm using it, but even if I disabled background updates it was using 25%(!!!) of my total battery usage and melting my phone. Uninstalled until I hear that this is fixed...",
"After a recent update, the app loads very slow. The articles used to load instantly. Now it could take up to a minute to load",
Animated ads every few paragraphs guarantees the eye can never focus on the text more than a short while. Hope you don't like reading!,
"I look forward to the weekly quiz but rarely do well. the questions are pertinent to the past week. it tells me that even though I watch the news, im not really paying attention to it. I prefer facts to opinions.",
There doesn't seem to be any way to unsubscribe. I'm being billed monthly but told I don't have a subscription. Either let me read the articles or stop billing me. And add an unsubscribe button or link. This is ridiculous!,
"Freezes and often won't refresh, incorrectly saying device is offline when all other apps can connect. Really frustrated.",
"Poorly written app, causes unnecessarily high CPU usage and battery drain. Please get your devs to do a better job. As of Jan. 2021, ""night mode"" has been removed. Navigation within the app is also cumbersome, please get a UI/UX designer.",
"App puts notifications of stories in my Android notification list, but when you click on the headline, that story doesn't come up in the app.",
"the app keeps reloading, making it difficult to read. I keep staring at white spaces for a considerable amount of time. Irritating.",
"Very disappointing app. Many pages don`t load, others crash. Performance has gotten worse in recent weeks. Please fix this.",
Really good some times scrolling through the App or the articles is annoying because an ad will load that will bump you up or down the page making you lose your spot but other wise it's great,
Gives good info if subscription. Glitched until update where scrolling stopped after opening page completely. Status bar headlines are worth having if interested in big topic news.,
"The only downside to this app is that I am asked to subscribe to either the print &/or digital edition several times a day. I am considering uninstalling this app, but will wait & see...",
"Now I'm constantly getting messages that this app is draining my battery. When I close all apps, NYT does not close. One Plus 6.",
"I use an academic pass to access the Times, but neither the app nor the mobile site recognizes it. I'll be logged in to my account, and the pass will be active, but I'll still hit the paywall, the effect being I can only use my pass on a computer",
The best media outlet; let us not mince words when acknowledging the NYT as the best possible source of information. Its journalistic rigor is a beacon at a time when nothing is more significant than the current influx of conspiracy theory peddled by shady individuals and media groups.,
"have enjoyed up to date, well reported & balanced news on a variety of topics of interest. Some bias at time, but usually limited to opinion pieces. I trust these articles enough to share with friends & colleagues on social media to explain COVID, politics& other complex issues.",
"This is a rating for the app, not the NYT. The app constantly hangs and/or crashes, rendering it useless.",
"This app won't let me read certain news unless I sign up. So basically if you don't let them fill your mail with junk, it won't work.",
"Broken experience since recent update. Notifications don't open app to the story, app is cumbersome trying to find story related to the notification.",
THE NYT is doing it right. Digital subscription plus focused news letters (notifications) get you to your interests in a flash. Well written and investigated.,
I love my NYT! I have it open several times a day to read the new articles that have come out during the day or to read the updates on the ones I know will be or have been updated. Not sure what I'd do without it.,
"Please add a native Android share button. If I'm paying a subscription I should be able to share to any app I want, not just those that NYT likes (or more likely who paid them for the priveledge).",
"Being from across the pond it has been lovely to see, experience and get to know more of how our American pals are more directly :) (P.s. Don't miss checking out their cooking section/newsletter too!)",
"It's 2020, and NYT still doesn't offer voice-reading of the articles. The Globe and Mail and Bloomberg have wonderful features for readers to listen.",
Even if I only have a few minutes opening the ap helps me stay informed. If I have more time I can scroll endlessly in the different sections. All the articles are impeccably researched and written. A must have for any informed person!,
Navigation could see a little improvement. Needs to do a better job of allowing me to view news by sections. Maybe add a search function while you're at it,
"This app has as yet to have fresh, warm chocolate chip cookies delivered to me from whatever source. Until then it only gets 4 stars reflecting its dependable delivery of NY Times articles.",
"Cancelled the NYT. Not sure what has happened to the agency but when you have journalists who conspire with corrupt leaders of the government about when to release a story and what to report, it's clear it is not the reliable news source it once was.",
Since the latest update the mini and regular crossword won't load properly. Can't get the full keyboard to load so can't play.,
"Well-designed app. Easy navigation. $4 every 4 weeks for digital access (a one-year, one-time deal; goes up after the year)",
We need a dark mode here!! Also a little disappointed to see ads throughout the app since you have to pay to access the content to begin with.,
"To the author: It seems you are eligible for citizenship, which would entitle you to vote. If so, why have you not applied? Your suggestion is not constructive to bringing our country together. it would deepen the divide and increase the partisanship. Citizenship requires a commitment and loyalty to our Constitution and our country. I question the concept of dual citizenship, and allowing those citizens to vote. Where is their loyalty? Are they voting to benefit this country or the other?",
New version crashes constantly. I'm unable to read a full article without multiple crashes. Please bring back old version.,
"So I downloaded the app from the app Store. When using it said outdated - get latest. The get latest link took me back to the same version I've downloaded. Click open on it and I'm back to the same outdated app message. Repeat infinity times. And I just bought this, should I cancel you guys??",
"News, music, art, all very well done and credible. the app makes it that much easier to engage.",
The app works great once your settings are correct. I like having access to the entire paper on my phone.,
"Every day since December 2nd, when I click on the This Morning Daily Briefing push notification, I am shown the Daily Briefing from December 2nd. It's not a big deal but it is quite annoying.",
"it's good compared to its competitors, although the dark theme is still in beta and needs more work and it'd be good to have more audio stories in there too",
"I have other Media to read, the NYT is hard to use and unattractive to me, I only use it to repost on Twitter or FB. It would be cheaper for Students and Seniors to have a read charge instead of a monthly subscription fee. Where's my Sunday paper?",
"My favorite, most complete, most reliable, most fascinating news source! I gain useful knowledge & perspectives every day about our nation & our complex world, too.",
It is much better to subscribe directly through New York Times. The google play offers limited content whereas the direct subscription will enable the subscriber to read more content on their phone and on their computer.,
Do not download this app. This app doesn't allow you to read their news articles unless you subscribe. Just go to Google and search for NYtimes news and you'll see all their articles for free and you won't be hassled. The NY Times should remove this app from the app store because they clearly do not want people to read their articles using this app.,
"Costumer service is very bad. They charged me even when I told them to unsubscribe the free trial and they won't respond later. Do not take the free subscription ever, it is a trap.",
it's worth every penny. The amount of content is astounding and scrolling on your mobile phone is easy and delightful.,
I am not a great reader with respect to volume of material. I really count on good quality of the content that I do read. this makes the New York Times my go to.,
Recent updates have made the app practically unusable. It constantly crashes or refreshes to the homepage while reading an article.,
It doesn't open. Once it opens it says download new update and it leads me back to play where I already have the update. And this is a continuous process.,
"It never updates and can't cancel. I only gave it 1 star to get into this page to dis the app and look for cancel function. Ripoff, and I grnerally agree with NYT editorial policy. The app sucks.",
"Slow, often doesn't load stories at all. Phone is noticably slower when running the app . Will revise this score once fixed .",
"Every time I click on a notification, it takes me to the front page, not the story in the notification. The story in the notification is often nowhere to be found.",
The updated version is crashing constantly. Please abandon the upapp immediately and return to the previous version which worked perfectly.,
"About this app says: ""• Read our Spanish-language coverage with NYT en Español."" But the option doesn't exist. A real disappointment cause I've really enjoyed reading NYT en Español. Am considering unsubscribing.",
"I live in Los Angeles and have seen the steady degradation of a once great Los Angeles Times. On Mondays I now call it the Los Angeles Pamphlet. I have come to recognize the importance of the always reliable New York Times. Reading it every day gives me the assurance that I have access to the Truth, usually. Thank you.",
I paid for subscription and the app tells me to update it even though its the latest version in the playstore. Why does the app stop working when I can't update it. Not the first time it happened!,
"Rating 1/5. Not because of the app per se, but because NYT started auto-logging out any site users on mobile. Then they started pushing ads for the app to stay signed in. As a paying NYT member, I don't appreciate such an aggressive dark pattern.",
"great app layout, love the weekly Quiz on Fridays (especially when I score 10 out of 11, still waiting to get 11 out of 11), great writing, etc.",
"Not the easiest to use. It continues to ask me to sign it. Doesn't recognize my account. But sort of works, sometimes. Perhaps the CCP is at work trying to SILENCE the NYT.",
"This is easily the best news app. I live in Australia, so just wish our national news outlets produced something even close to the quality of the NY Times app.",
"Very clunky app. Clicking a headline on the main page often takes you to an awful live feed layout. Also, no dark mode.",
"It keeps closing the app and never opening again so I have to download it over and over, I do pay the digital subscription and enjoy columns and news very much but it keeps worrying me",
"This app is buggy, especially on Android phones. The app won't load readers' comments. The Times is aware of the problem, but I haven't seen any evidence that they're working on a fix.",
"Quality journalism and articles. Now in dark mode so you can read easier the intriguing and in-depth reporting. Be informed, be enlighten by all fact based journalism. News before its news thanks to the dedicated hard hitting reporting.",
"Great article with strong points I can use talking with my friends averse to ""social programs"" as infrastructure. Passionate yet avoids the syrupy agruements that turn people off. Our values are most evident in how we treat the vulnerable and marginalized among us. Love this!!",
The app dosen't have a way to unsubscribe. They need a call. They convinced PayPal to close my PayPal account because I tried to unsubscribe by not paying them. NY Times is a liberal account of current events.I unsubscribed because it was too partisan.,
Deep links via push notifications are still not working. They do not link to the specific article and push to the home page.,
"Aside from The wonderful news coverage, the app works incredibly smoothly and any issues are fixed promptly as they arise.",
Paid subscription did not include access to all NYT features. Unable to cancel via Google Play store. No one to contact for refund. NO RESPONSE TO SEVERAL REQUESTS.,
"in today's world of fake news, it's reassuring to know that some media giants such as the New York Times, are still taking journalism seriously (for the most part) and try to focus on the stories that actually matter to their readers.",
"I haven't been able to access my saved article, nor find any email for customer care for people who can't call the US local number like me...Even the web version doesn't let me log in.... The last update needs some bug fix....soon!",
"Beware google deals if you've already been a subscriber, you might end up asking for a refund like I did. (I did end up getting my refund within a few hours.) What's a few bucks for this level of journalism anyways? Back to the old plan.",
Anytime I click on a story from my notifications it takes me to the general page and I can't find the article... one of the most unhelpful mechanics I've seen on the app,
"Since the last month or so, it started displaying ads that automatically play sound or music. This is totally unacceptable!",
good coverage of national and world news. interesting in depth articles and opinions (on all sides). older articles hang on a bit long.,
"Notifications. News alerts, clicking on the notification fails to take me to the story, it just opens the app home page stories.",
Very frustrating. It's good this app updates the news frequently but often you can't get through even one paragraph before it reloads again.,
"Not usable at night, they dropped night theme/mode months ago with no plan or timetable to return. Can you say ""loss of functionality""? I would have given 4-5 stars otherwise. The Wall Street Journal can do this np, why can't these guys??",
I recently subscribed back to NYT and the app is much worse than it used to be. The current 3 tab menu is super hard to navigate through,
"My main source for news and features. Excellent user interface, great content and the daily crossword.",
"Good interface, but external links and notifications often don't open properly in the app, so has to be restarted.",
"Night mode is gone. Cannot abide all that light pinging my retina. The world is going dark mode. Why is NYT holding out? I'll be back when dark mode returns. Please, please restore dark mode. Why are you holding out?",
Always deep and interesting analysis. Their approach to non-subscriptors made the Washington Post (that does not allow to go past an article's title) irrelevant.,
Frequently fails to load articles. I much prefer accessing the NY Times via the internet browser. This app needs a lot of work!,
"Absolutely extraordinary! Careful forensic journalism here lays out not just the events at the Capitol, but a systematic account of the key instigators and the incompetence (and worse) of the various police forces.",
"Content is great, but canceling a subscription requires calling customer service or chatting with them online. Not having a ""cancel subscription"" button in your account section is obnoxious.",
Battery vampire! I want the NYTimes news but this app drains the Galaxy 10 battery from constant usage. Constantly warned to turn the app off but that kills the Notifications. Can't this use of battery be fixed?,
"It looks fine in the experience, but the notifications almost never open the correct article when I click them.",
"This is beautifully written, lyrically poetic. The accompnying images are powerful and haunting. And its final impact is strangely hopeful.",
Excellent app. Excellent news source. Crossword puzzles. Too bad it requires upgraded membership to play more games.,
"Thought I would give it a chance, but totally left biased very skewed articles. A lot of opinion, very little unbiased news. If you want a cheerleader for the left, this is your app. If you are middle-of-the-road in your views, as I am, look elsewhere.",
"Very well written and great photographs, but even more awesome is how this inside-out thinking of WiFi-by-bus pulled these kids and their families out of isolation and back on track to a more future-proof life. Kudos also to this Jackson school district superintendent! -Rick Setzpfand from the Netherlands",
I'd give this app a better rating if they just brought back dark mode! Why remove it? Even if it's being rebuilt just leave the old version in place temporarily? Anyways hopefully it comes back sooner rather than later,
"The most beautiful interface of all news apps, very up to date authoritative. Only fault is that it is not entirely free.",
"NY times tries to have good journalism, but they are also too sensationalist. Stick more to quality over quantity.",
"The NYT has long been my favorite print news source. Thorough, thoughtful, self-aware, evolving, the pulse of the nation. Thanks for keeping me in the know. Also, thanks for the NYT Cooking app - worth every penny.",
This killed a version of the app that was working on the device; not familiar with android so will have a hard time rolling back.,
"Notwithstanding being a subscriber I uninstalled NYTimes App because of inability to directly reference, share or comment on individual news stories & threads inside the App using a date, topic, web address or link. Useful only for breaking news and reading the stories.",
Its nice to have easy access to slanderous and biased journalism at your fingertips. A more serious approach vs. The Enquirer that entices you to want to flip a coin as to whether the material is factual or not.,
Really cool graphics and illustrations integrated in the app! Gives a different perspective than a still photo!,
"Video's won't show up or play, screen stays black and doesn't show anything, no audio either. I already cleared cache and logged in again but it doesn't work.",
One of the best sources of news on one of the best news apps. Very happy customer. (One suggestion for the NYT app developers: add an easily accessible search bar for NYT stories.),
"i dont have the app because the reviews are terrible. i love the NYT but all the reviews have kept me from even trying the app myself. until they fix the app I'll stick to the daily paper and other mobile outlets. NYT, please fix the app so you can take my monies",
Excellent worldwide news and well structured app. Works well on all my devices. I recommend the app and the subscription to NYT news 👍,
Following links to articles or even from my notification bar leads me to blank pages on the app. It is pretty frustrating.,
App keeps blocking me and asking me to subscribe even though I already have. Also asking me to login even though I already have. So frustrating and annoying. App sucks. I've removed the app and reading NYT via internet browser like it 2010.,
"Makes me sign in way too often. I have a paid subscription and I expect to be able to read the articles, but too often, it asks me to type in my password. Guys, I don't remember all my passwords and when I'm out and about, I don't have access to my password list. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to pay for this.",
"Paid for All Access subscription within Google play account - unlimited digital access, plus access to the NYT Games, NYT Cooking, and one bonus digital subscription for a year. But NYT, NYT Games, NYT Cooking apps say I am not a subscriber!",
This does not update its articles very often and it sends notifications but when you click them it doesn't always go to the story described.,
"A real issue/topic Newspaper that operates as Tabloid Publication with most of it's articles. Most posted writings are opinionated. Device Notifications and Article titles are the best in the click bait industry, extremely misleading. Not a recommended source of un-bias National or Local informative news.",
Dies every few days and I have to reinstall. I have cleared the cache and done a force stop. Nothing helps. Love the times. Hate the app.,
"Recent performance deteriorated, seems to be since last update. Headline links do not show content 50% of the time. Had been a long time satisfied subscriber otherwise.",
Writing is nuanced and more complete. Articles leave me with a sense of knowing a subject from different perspectives and with sources that are credible and hard sought.,
"This app is horrible. It won't let me read more than a handful of articles a month even though I have a subscription. I've tried logging in multiple times and it says I'm logged in, but still won't let me access articles.",
NY TIMES is a great source of information. While it is not perfect it is a solid source of well researched information. My only disappointment is that it costs more than a retiree on a limited budget can afford.,
"Horrible app, I am a paid subscriber for many years, but boots me to the paywall to subscribe. And, will not let me access anything on the NYT homepage or articles. They eliminated the app for the Kindle Fire, so bought an android tablet, but this app is worthless. How is the NYT going to stay in business without having apps for the most popular devices? Stupid",
The NYTimes is great!! The app is not so great on my Chromebook. It doesn't return to home after an article yet,
"I tried the free Times subscription. Very clear, no distractions like other news articles. Trustworthy NYTimes. Awesome!!",
"Even with the majority of news publications not to be trusted any longer, I still find value in the majority of NY Times articles. Most can be fact checked and are accurate.",
"for the past 3 days I haven't been able to read this site. keeps saying Expired, download latest version. very frustrating.",
"This version is full of bugs. Games section: mini crossword: bottom half of the keyboard missing, Vertex: kicks me out when zooming in.",
"The ads are a constant obstacle to reading. Without an ability to opt-out of ads, subscribers pay for the free version of Hulu or YouTube.",
Has become an ad ridden experience for paying subscribers. The content is great but I'd like an ad free offering and no dark pattern subscription practices.,
It quickly drains battery. The high battery consumption rate can immediately convert my phone to a pocket hand warmer. Need a huge improvement!,
"I like the app and the newspaper. the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is when I go back from reading an article, the app brings me back to the top and I have to scroll down again.",
"I used to love reading NY Times, but it's just not what it used to be. For a company whose name includes 'New York', it has a serious lack of New York related news. Also, I'm not a big fan of having to call to unsubscribe, when I didn't have to call to subscribe.",
"This app has become more trouble than it is worth. Too hard to navigate. Eats up my battery. Articles seem to appear, then disappear. Sad.",
"High quality content, but not great for searches and pressing on notifications doesn't always lead you to the teased content.",
"I love getting the NYTimes every day on my phone. it has become my go-to source for news, and their investigative pieces are exceptional.",
Up to date news. Would prefer a better interactive menu to select the news I prefer. I like the crossword puzzles. Still exploring.,
"!!!!NEEDS A DARK MODE!!!! I also read the WSJ, and they have a full dark theme/ night mode, making reading much more pleasant on the eyes. Outside of that the daily content & reporting the NYT puts out is terrific.",
"I think you guys got a bug going. When logging in using a google account, then logging out and trying to log in with another google account doesn't work since the app just logs you in with the first google account you fed it which is awful if you logged in using the wrong account.",
"Notifications don't link to the referenced article but to the main page, and then you can't find the referenced article. This has been going on for a while along time.",
Please add an option for a one time prepaid subscription for people who don't want to use credit cards. Let me purchase six months or a year of news access straight up by paying a lump amount.,
"What is wrong with your app?? I installed and reinstalled, and it kept changing into beta version which CANNOT BE OPENED! Pls fix your problems before making it available for users to download!",
"Downloaded specifically for Dark Mode, which used to be in experimental features. No longer exists. Will be reading on web browser with dark mode instead.",
You pay for the service and they serve you tons of ads. It is completely unnecessary too because I get no ads on the website. It's a shame they don't want it to be easy to read the news that you pay for.,
"one of the worlds best papers. my favorite columnist are Maggie Haberman and Thomas Friedman NYT leans a bit left at times, but I counter balance that by reading the also excellent WSJ too. WSJ leans right, especially on its editorial pages.",
Consistently crashes when I try to open certain articles--usually ones with more complicated graphics.,
"A lousy app was just made dramatically worse. it is now an app for 6 year olds designed by Smurfs. It is clunky, impossible to customize and completely riddled with ads (from bizarre places: I am not joining a synagogue that runs internet ads)",
I would have given it 5 Stars before. The new updates have made it incredibly difficult and frustrating to keep logged in even though I have an account which is more than 10 years old.,
"One of America's best newspapers. Their research and investigation are what impress me the most. A great job with the digital edition, I read many stories on my phone and PC.",
"Mostly good app, in terms of news etc. However latest update has stopped the crosswords and other puzzles working properly. Please remedy.",
Great app but way too many ads for paying subscribers and lack of dark mode makes it all but impossible to read at night. Ridiculous in 2022 this still doesn't have a dark mode.,
"the app is unworthy of the Times. it tells me I don't have an internet connection, but will open the minicrossword. back to the Washington Post. Their site works fine.",
"My favorite daily source of information. It's well organized, thorough, thought provoking and reasonably balanced.",
"Among other things, you are unable to exit an ad and go back to listing with all of the articles. Have to close the app to close the ad. Browser 4 lyfe",
"I would love it if I could avoid notices about sports. I don't subscribe to sports notifications, and I'm not sure why they would be considered ""breaking news"" or ""top stories""",
totally busted with Chrome OS 93.0.4577.xxx The page just jumps aroud and you end up with 4 copies of the top ad covering most of the stories. was fine until a recent update,
"App works great! It also gives a good number of push notifications, not so many that I feel overwhelmed every time I check my phone. Definitely worth a download.",
"Old app said I had to update, after doing so it stopped working, saying I had no internet, which is not true. Loved reading NYT now what!? Updated they sure did fix it, fabulous!!!",
"You guys suck. Your ideals are twisted and pathetic, so far away from what a paper was actually used for. Not your crappy opinions, just the facts. I realize this takes more effort than just writing what you want, but you are closer to an Enquirer style paper than a reliable source of current information.",
Craps out all the time. It's slow. Updates constantly. Ads seem more important than news content.,
"News isn't fake, though there are many fake news organizations. I appreciate the NYT for providing a reliable source of information that does its best to represent views fairly.",
"Great newspaper. One of the things I love about the paper is the writing, there is so little GOOD writing anymore. I'm always impressed when their prose feels more like poetry",
"Everytime i open the app, it says app has expired, install new version. After fresh install works for some time again same problem crops up. Now i am sick of it.",
"Really glitchy. Pages don't always fully load, and there isn't a clear way to do a keyword search.",
"It's 2022 and there's no dark mode. There's no reason (other than ads, despite already paying for the subscription) that I should be stuck blasting light just to read.",
App is pretty great. only issue is the notifications don't always send you to the correct story.,
After the latest update the app keeps crashing!! So disappointed. I love the NYT and hope they fix this buggy app soon!!,
"Android - Pixel 2, doesn't load articles. Quality control, anyone? Can they please just hire new programmers? I want NYTimes to succeed, but clearly their current Android developers are not cut out for this type of thing.",
"You need a subscription in addition to the app, but subscriptions are reasonably priced. Still a great newspaper and, unless you're a diehard Fox ""News"" fan, you'll probably find the NYT relatively unbiased in their reporting.",
"When I tap an alert, it brings me to the app but gets stuck on the previous article. Doesn't bring me to the article I was interested in. Longstanding problem.",
I created an account with the email and password and then I try to go tell it what I'm interested in and keeps putting me in a loop to create an account and login and it never lets me pick anything as my interest. Right now I have the free account for one week And I will not pay because this does not work!,
"I subscribe to ny times games but even when I'm logged in, it doesn't recognize me. Also, after reading 3 articles. It asks me to subscribe. I go to settings and sure enough, there's my name...I'm logged in. What's the point?",
"Downloaded three times, alwayscto be told it "" willbe instalked soon."" Is that a joke. Not showing 8n downpoads or on app list. I will seriously beyond pique if Im hacked for this fruitless experience. I am a brand new NYT subscriber, to boot. ZERO STARS.",
Would have rated four stars before but with the most recent update a lot of things got worse. The departure of dark mode means I essentially don't use the app anymore. Please bring it back!,
Was good until this week. Now visual scroll articles are failing and my device care has to force close the app because it's overheating my phone when not even in use.,
"I have subscribed through the app. My subscription is registered on Google play, I log in with that account and I still can't read any articles. I just keep getting the pay prompt",
Amazing!! This is the first news app that hasnt crashed my phone. Very reliable and helpful!! The best one so far.,
App has issues with search within. It keeps bugging out everytime I search and want to reopen an article I've read.,
The app is clunky. You can't swipe to the next story. You have to go back. Then the page reloads. It's frustrating.,
"Lovely piece. I grew up in Maine but have lived in Canada most of my life. You got all the Maines along route 1...the other Maines, in the lakes and mountains and the remote peninsulas and islands now awaits you. It's big and complex and wonderfully excentric. And there are no box stores or cell reception in those places either. Happily.",
"All I want to do is read an article about the Tonys, first they wanted me to download the app then to creat an about to read in browser I downloaded the app and now they want me to pay!! I ended up not reading the article and deleting the app and canceling my account",
"3 years in, don't know what you changed but I'm out. See yea neva, it's been real. Lost my widget. Lost article access. And now I just can't log back in. Probly better off with a book anyway.",
What in the world happened to the app's dark mode? My eyes bleed out now everytime I try to read in the dark at night :'( such a great feature that was suddenly removed for no good reason!,
"Not Fox, not CNN. Not WAPO, or NPR. _Trustworthy_ Clearly differentiates between opinion and news (facts). Called up to cancel my subscription after my ""special offer"" expired, they extended it. Will continue forever at this price.",
"None of the sections will load, just top news, on my s9 plus. Update: this was fixed. Now, the app freezes when I try to scroll",
"My father was a NYT reader, and so am I. It is one of my trusted news sources. The app is good, but I am unable to post comments to articles. The best I can do is reply to another's post, which is not the same.",
"The ""For You"" section is completely broken and lately basic scrolling has gotten worse in any story with a graphic element or a big enough ad. We're paying for our subscriptions and this is barely readable ok a phone right now",
The application is good and has a great UI. The quality of NY Times journalism is excellent. Must have app.,
App stopped functioning. Getting blank page and message that device is offline but it isn't. All other apps functioning properly.,
"Good app and good content. On my Android tablet, ads cover the article text. One example is the Good Thins ad.",
Constantly unable to open articles. Tried restarting. So buggy. And I am a paid subscriber. Frustrating.,
I get daily emails and read stories. Navigational tools and clues hard to locate. Cannot find podcasts.,
Simply stopped working 2 weeks ago!!!! Customer service said they are working on it!!! Nothing has changed though and I am paying for my subscription!!! Very BAD!!!,
"UI bad. Extremely easy to accidentally click ads, notification blips often dont lead you to the right article.",
Crashes constantly and notifications don't lead to actual content. You can do much better!,
Removing dark mode so that you can release a new version later is absurd. The latest update now makes the app scroll all the way to the top of the news feed for some reason.,
"I use this app because we have digital subscription, but it stops and crashes constantly. Extremely annoying.",
"Freezes and locks frequently, making it impossible to scroll down and finish reading a story. Cannot read the stories I've paid for.",
Every time I try to get accurate information from this credible site someone is remote accessing your concept of your information and changing to their own opinion and I can't get a true story out of an actual article which sucks because I love the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both of which I subscribed to and have all the sudden loss my subscriptions and now I see are highlighted images of what they want to save like the fact that they and Korean are stealing Google play gift card,
"Am very pleased w/the NY Times app. Is on both my iPhone & tablet. Thx to great $1 per week subscription, have unlimited access to NY Times articles excluding food section unfortunately. Still *Recommend*.",
"Always on point, always delivering a necessary perspective in a polarized country. Always following the most important stories from around the world. Always keeping me informed.",
Consistently freezes up on my Samsung Tab running 7.1.1 Touch and scroll goes dead. Frustratingly useless as is. Uninstalling.,
The articles on the Times are more detailed and informative than any other publication I've subscribed to. The app is a great way to get that information in close to real time. Highly recommended.,
The best news paper in the world. I love the fact that New York Times makes an effort to provide good journalism at an an affordable price for all. Everywhere! Thank you!,
"Educational and informative, I am thankful for the information this company provides. Unfortunately I am compromised (32 months) and cannot access all that the New York Times offers. It is NOT their fault.",
I've enjoyed listening the the daily podcast since it was released. I prefer I good mix of political/social and more global news and I think the daily does a pretty good job at this.,
No support and terrible communication between Google and NYTimes. They could not even locate my account and I never received access to the content. They took my money and provided nothing in return.,
#NAME?,
a strength of the online NYT is the ability to find old stories on a given topic and the extensive online graphics and videos. it's a richer reading experience.,
This app has gotten worse and worse over the years. From notifications that fail to open their corresponding articles to lack of ability to swipe left and right to move from section to section this app keeps falling behind WSJ and WaPo apps for usability/functionality,
"I love the New York Times, but this app needs a dark mode option for reading at night. Hence the low rating. Once it has dark mode, I'll upgrade to 5 stars.",
"a bit long winded. But, really worth the read for its revelation of artist spirit and motivation. And, some interesting action from copyright and intellectual property rights. I'll pass on the book though.",
"Needs a feature to personalise the news categories I'm interested in, something like a ""My News"" page where I don't have to select from the myriad of topics daily. If this is already available, please let me know!",
A helpful informative visual explanation. Cool to follow and see the process of air circulation on a plane. Article is good for considering risk of traveling.,
"My app simply does not work. It had worked for several years, but for months now...it will not open. I have installed and uninstalled...to no avail.",
"This newspaper is total fraud.First it shows that you can have the subscription with only 15Rs/week & then it does not allows you to make payment by your debit card.I literally tried 4 debit card but could not make the payment, then one of their plan showed 170Rs/month (after discount on 690 Rs) after after payment 690 Rs were deducted.I tried to contact their customer care but they were not helpful at all but misguiding me.This issue made me realise that not all prominent things are trustworthy",
Great news Garbage App. The search function is near useless- often will not return a word for word search of the title of an article.,
"Falsely declares my device is offline, won't update content. Worthless for a news app to not show current news and only show DNS errors.",
"I love this but and thepuzzles are amazing! However for some reason it wont accept my CC to subscribe but still the NYT is where i get my news fix everyday, very awesome app, hopefully the devs see this and reach out so i can subscribe",
"I've been a NYT on line subscriber for two decades but this app is unusuable, never recognizes my log in data, tells me my device ""is offline,"" offers no help to access my account.",
Just installed to give a negetive review for interfering with India internal matters. We going to start trend of biased false writing by you if you did that again. Would drop the ratings to 3. Huge population have it's own advantages. We choose this government with highest mandate and we love them.,
Intrusive ads constantly crash the app. Very frustrating. Will see how long i stick around as a customer,
If I have a paid subscription I should not be subject to ads that autoplay with sound. I uninstalled the ap and am considering cancelling my digital subscription because y'all are greedy and those ads are agressive. Shame on you.,
"Took away night mode via update promising it's return. Why don't you just leave it until the replacement is ready? Also, I hate how they display ads despite paying them a hefty subscription fee.",
"Why does this app CONTINUALLY tell me I am not connected to the internet??? I AM connected to the internet! This happened out of the blue. Uninstalled then reinstalled, no change. FIX IT!",
"This is a web browser with ads, don't bother (I'm a subscriber). You can do better than this piece of garbage, New York Times.",
"Excellent contents but very frequent malfunction in new app version, making impossible to access some articles. search engine to be improved",
Only one side of a story. Doesn't print news- but opinion. I want all sides of a current event to make up my own mind. The NYT's is like the pied piper. Leading us down their path. Help us to think- !!!!,
"I love the different sections, the depth of the coverage, and the overall quality of the content.Great app.",
"My most trusted news source for over 20 years. Even with a left-leaning bias they remain the most reliable newspaper, even for a conservative such as myself.",
"NYT isn't perfect (just look at some of the absolute ridiculous hit job reporters they employ, Jennifer Medina's horrendous article regarding Cenk Ugyur comes to mind) but overall it provides a solid foundation for reading the news and I do actually enjoy quite a few of the writers and journalists.",
Overall good but the latest update causes the app the return to the top of the page after reading an article which requires scrolling back down through everything to find your place which is frustrating,
"Decent app. Good pricing. But a very biased and US centric world view. Nevertheless, few media org have the breadth of coverage.",
"I have been trying to buy a subscription. While it mentions discounted rate, when I click on the payment link, no discount is offered. Stuck.",
It's an excellent newspaper but it's embarrassing how many ads are on an app I pay a lot of money monthly for. What a disaster.,
"App removed the widget feature while increasing ""breaking news"" notifications tenfold. Not everything has to be breaking news, you know.",
Used to work on Android tablet then started crashing constantly. So I uninstalled the app and now it downloads from the Playstore but refuses to install!,
"Great app, well designed. I do have trouble with the mini crossword however bc the last row of the keyboard is cutoff",
Recent updates to the UI have caused me to be very annoyed. Like why hide comments in a menu? Why change it from sections you can browse at the top. Why change it to be less intuitive? Stupid.,
"keeps freezing and shutting down. never used to do this previously, but it is now a constant problem. often app is unusable",
"Constantly does not recognize my subscription. I re-signed up twice -- same problem. I tried to support you, NYT, but...",
Great app. Pages and articles load faster now that I upgraded from Samsung S7 to Samsung S21 5G Ultra. I like that I can save articles and share. I love the separate NYTimes Cooking app too.,
Wonderful to read from the breaking news to the cooking to the spectacular obits. To the Year in Review. To the photography. And more.,
Notifications only link to the correct article about 25-50 percent of the time. makes it very frustrating to find an article I actually want to read. Please fix this,
"I preferred the older version of the opening page, I felt like it highlighted more articles. but it's still fine.",
"Great app, great journalism. I cannot recommend this app or the NYT highly enough. It's a pleasure to use, enjoyable to read, and the journalism is thorough and intelligent.",
The app is as awesome as the paper itself! lol I've never had a single problem with the app. It's always worked flawlessly!!,
"Had a class in high school in the late 60's on how to fold the NYT while reading. Need I say more. On Sunday, my father would go out early in the morning and buy The Sunday Times which included the magazine as well and The Daily News (New Yorker here). All four of us would spend the day after church reading the newspapers together.",
"The paper of record, all the news that's fit to print, the newspaper that always meant NEWSPAPER after the Herald-Tribune and the other New York Papers suddenly disappeared into the Daily News and other tabloids, especially if you were growing up in New York State during the 1950s and 60s, AND if your mother would not be without the Sunday Times Magazine Section in which, before Will Shortz was even wearing them, the Sunday Crossword Puzzle was her weekly challenge AND justification of brains!",
NYT makes it overly difficult to cancel subscription by requiring a phone call. Secondly they absolutely hate on Bernie Sanders up until the moment he drops out then praises him to no end. I would avoid this garbage news outlet.,
"Disappointed that so many journalism sites are so biased. I cancelled my NYT subscription after trying it out, you can't read a single article that doesn't take digs at Republicans/conservatives. They're clearly biased to the left & I don't want to read partisan publications. I want truthful, unbiased reporting with just the facts & leave out the biased opinions. NYT is NOT capable of that, terrible journalism, another MSM spewing division & hate towards the right. MSM needs to do better. 👎🏻",
Ask me to login. I put in email address which I set up my account but it doesn't proceed to let me put my password in. Looks like I will be canceling my subscription. Why does this have to be difficult?,
App has become much more stable but the revised ux is a downgrade from preveous design. The new ux adds multiple steps to browsing by sections.,
"App updates constantly, every time you return from an article. You cannot scroll from one story to the next. You must go back to previous page first.",
Excellent reporting on the whirlwind of tragedies hitting some of the most vulnerable in our country. I hope all who read this article and are able to help participate in lifting up those in need.,
"The app is good, but I wish it had a dark mode option for more comfortable and power efficient reading.",
"cannot start my day without it. most accurate up to date news, great articles, professional reporting, impeccable journalism, and damn delicious food section. worth every cent.",
"Jerks when scrolling because the bottom bar keeps popping up, and also has no dark mode still. Edit: app is SO much better after recent update. couldn't be happier 😁",
NYT is my go-to right after email every morning (which includes subscribed email updates from NYT). More than worth the few pennies for a digital subscription!,
"Deleted the app, even though we have to login with our subscription, the app only gives access to a handful of articles. I'm going back to accessing my subscription through the Chrome browser.",
"Sketchy if best. When you click links, you received errors all the time. They need to improve the app or I'm unsubscribing.",
"great daily format of the worlds news stories, or a Sunday morning spent reading about culture,book reviews and events near and far. I was slow to internet version but am hooked after a week.",
"Reliable, well- researched and concise news. Really helpful, gives quick important news updates! Must try.",
"Broken app, works just well enough that the times can have a nagging pop-up on every story urging you to use it. Making your customers hate you is not a good business plan.",
I love the news subscription I pay for. I get updates in my inbox and the app is easy to use. Do wish I could get access to more stuff for the price.,
The NYTimes was a very good news app. The stories were interesting and informative. It was worth the subscription.,
Interface used to be smooth and fast. Everytime I exit an article now the entire page has to reload.,
The biggest issue I have with this app is that when I click on a notification I'm not taken to the story I was notified about. What's the point of doing notifications then?,
"Still needs a dedicated section link for The Wirecutter! Otherwise love the app, the journalists and all they offer. Thanks very much.",
"Regardless of all the finger pointing concerning Media Bias, I have found the NY TIMES to be one of the few that seems to be more interested in sharing an objective and unbiased presentation from reliable sources and professional journalists.",
"NYT has some good articles, but it censors all the negative news about the Israli occupation of Palestine, and many articles shown by the app or search are just teases – they show a few sentences and then state ""Subscribe to continue reading"". About 3 to 5 notifications interrupt me every day on the phone about articles of old/repetative news or of no interest.",
"App doesn't work. Try to log in and the page reloads on my S10+. NYT, I'd happily pay a few dollars for a subscription but your app is worth nothing.",
"I love that NYT does a great job in reporting the facts, news and updates. They also make public corrections when an error occurs. Good journalism with ethics!",
"Great app. I was hesitant to subscribe, but they do journalism so well in the mobile format. Good job, NYT.",
"It's very pretty, but every time I try to open an article that it sends as a pop up notification, I get an error message",
Too many ads and the repeat rate is very high. I did not pay for repeated ads showing disturbing pictures of starving children. l am going back to Washington post for my news.,
"They'll take your credit card and start charging it every month. You want them to stop, well that's your problem. Want to ""unsubscribe"" good luck getting that done, they'll be ""to busy"" to unsubscribe you.",
"while i love the NYT site, very good, i prefer accessing the site in a browser, i find the layout is better in the browser than on the app.",
Awful experience when trying to cancel my paid subscription. They make it practically impossible to do so and continue to take my money. Would not recommend,
"NY Times is one of the best news sites available. In depth and comprehensive coverage and, in my opinion, fairly unbiased politically.",
"great way to stay up to date. Unfortunately, the top stories hasn't been loading correctly on my pixel 3 XL since the new update...",
"I miss the newspaper. Endless scrolling is a fad, and it's irritating that NYT cannot seem to make the app read more like a newspaper.",
"After subscribing I thought I would be able to read articles....nope, I am still blocked from seeing articles and being asked to subscribe to see articles. This is a huge problem.",
"Love the app. I was previously able to view it in dark mode. Currently, that's not an option. Hopefully, the developers will rectify the issue.",
"It let me join and enter preferences but then it won't let me read anything unless I get a subscription. That is okay, I understand, but I uninstalled it. Misleading.",
Love it all! Wanted a subscription for years. Smartest money I spend in a month. Keep doing what you do. You really are the link that is keeping America's democracy alive. Thank you,
"After paying for one additional year of subscription via Google, I was locked out of the paid area. Back and forth with nyt customer service was useless. Despicable service. $25 thrown to trash.",
good source of news. truustworthy journalism. only gripe is app sometimes makes it difficult to find the story I want.,
"I was ready to assign an earlier article by Moss to my students on Monday. Now I can back it up with this essay about his new book-- perfect timing, NY TIMES! Thank you!!",
"jittery. And the various parts don't talk to each other. like, in the settings menu there are several sections and they all prompt me to sign in again",
"This is a remarkable conclusion from a well designed study: clean up a vacant lot and the impact is felt in many ways. Clean up and green up that lot, and the effect is stronger. What a wonderful return on a small investment.",
Canceling my subscription next month if they don't fix the video ads. Why would I pay to have my experience disturbed by 3 AUTO PLAYING VIDEOS ADS per article? This tells me they don't appreciate their readers.,
"The latest version is horrible. Can't swipe, clunky, slow, and stories sometimes don't load",
"The content is great, as always, but the new app style feok the most recent update makes the app a pain in the ass to read. I hate it now.",
Have to uninstall the app everyday then reinstall it to get the website to properly open. Have called NYTIMES about this problem. Very nice folk but they have not been able to fix it. IT IS A REAL PAIN,
Why all the ads?? It seems that if you pay to subscribe the ads should go away! They are very distracting. Is there a way to stop seeing them every paragraph or two?,
Year-long subscriber but the app has gotten worse over the years. If you're having trouble support will also simply tell you they've forwarded your problem and that's that. Probably cancelling my subscription.,
"My go to source for everything news, culture, opinion pieces etc. Navigation is quite easy as well.",
the New York Times is one of the best information Bargains on the network. I used to walk 2 miles and pay twice as much to get a copy. some things get better,
Allows you to sign up for a free account but you can never read any stories. Constant wall of sign up for a pay version. Why are you offering a free account if you aren't allowing people to view articles?,
Since I became a new yorker'er 9 yrs ago I've been a Times subscriber. I love that I can customize my digital subscriptions from which notifications I receive and when to my interests showing up on my For You main page.,
"This app keeps failing and shutting down on my Samsung tablet. I love the reading options when it works, but it isn't working!!!",
"The app often won't download an article, instead giving me an empty page or just staying on the home page. Today, I realised it was taking close to 900 MB of space; so it's getting removed.",
"Since the most recent update, the keyboard for the Mini crossword is half hidden on Android. Impossible to play.",
"It's okay, but I need dark mode and when I click on an alert, I expect the alert news article to pop up in the app..which is doesn't.",
Used to love it. Latest update is terrible. App freezes and type on the initial screen is hard to read. Hope they fix it.,
I have my news and so many wonderful stories about culture and art each day. I feel smarter on all fronts because of my NYT subscription. Having all of this delivered so easily is a real gift.,
So buggy! Articles don't open about a third of the time. Linking into the app from a notification opens the app with some conttast issues.,
I've loved reading the New York Times for approximately 25 years though I never lived in or near NY. The International news and editorials are so beyond any other .,
I prefer unbiased news and NY Times is a key source that never wavers. I do ignore the opinion part that sometimes seems a bit off.,
"Five Star. Enjoy the headlines that stream to my inbox allowing me to stay current and dive deeper with just a click of the headline. Clear, concise, transparent, well organized writing.",
"Excellent app, very high-quality news, perfect for keeping up to date with what's going on in the US, very reasonable subscription price",
It crashes at least once day. And about once a week it stops giving me access and acts as if i don't have an account. I'm really disappointed.,
"User interface is a bit Clunky/Confusing/Cluttered. These 3 C's make one.. Contemplate, Consider and Choose.. Google News App =Better all around.",
"Love the ""Everything you need to know this morning"" compilation. And appreciate being able to keep up with the news with push notification headlines. Thanks NYT!",
What happened to the search function in the New York Times app? No ability to search within the app hobbles it. I may as well find articles in a browser. But if I have to do that why do I need the app?,
Having to deal with oversized ads that autoplay is ridiculous! We are paying customers! I understand some ads but these video ads are obnoxious and annoying!,
"I enjoy the news stories I read, they are informative, and easy to understand. I like I can share the stories in this paper with young to old. Keep up the good work.",
"App still doesn't work at all on my Oneplus 6. This is the primary way I access my subscription. Updates should mean improvements, not rendering the app unusable. Please fix it.",
"Still waiting for them to implement dark mode, a feature that they intentionally removed in early 2021. Seriously, how long does it take to implement dark mode again?",
"I don't see the point and who are geniuses who created this app that's more limited than mobile site, eg in terms of links for specific sections/subsections. Uninstall and just use browser.",
Uninstalled the app because it slows down the phone. It doesn't work the way a normal app does - not loading up quickly.,
"Big fan of the journalism and approach. The NY Times is the best newspaper on the planet. However, quitting your subscription is tedious.",
The sop shows the the version of the app had expired. Play Store shows that the app is already in the latest version. Don't know what to do,
Notifications are broken. When you click on a notification it goes to the wrong story.,
Has incredibly buggy notification system that has been buggy for years. Don't know how one of the most massive news organizations can't get their app working,
"Since the Jan. 20 update, this app no longer opens on the Samsung Tab A tablet. We have 2 Tab A's and both are experiencing this issue.",
"I'm paying customer using a OnePlus 5T, and the Top Stories section does not load from time to time. I've to kill the app and launch it again to see the Top Stories section. Please rectify this issue.",
"I generally like the app, but it's very unstable. It frequently crashes after a minute or two of use.",
"Used to be reasonably good; now dreadful. Articles don't load at all, or load partially. Uninstalling and reinstalling made no difference. Why am I paying a monthly subscription when the app doesn't let me read the material?",
im paying for this app and frequently experience issues where complete articles are not visible. whats the point in paying for this if i cant read the content? been a times reader for years..at a point where i may cancel and go elsewhere,
"Absolutely incredible digital coverage, visuals, and abundant content across all of my interests.",
App is really sluggish slow. It doesn't seem network related. After a few weeks it is just annoying,
"Please remove that pop-up that appears every time I read an article on my mobile browser that says ""the mobile app is better."" Dark patterns suck. Let me read the way I prefer without annoyance.",
"As an international subscriber, too many American news and too little international news. So different before subscribing. Very hard to unsubscribe, they put you through multiple agents which dont respon at all. Finally give up and blocked my card instead.",
"Really bad app. Freezes all the time. C'mon, Times. You're one of the top 5 papers on earth and you can't make a good app? #verysad Now down to one star. Just awful. Canceling my subscription",
"Be warned. To cancel a subscription is difficult. After two years, I had to cancel. NY Times makes it difficult to cancel a subscription.",
Great app. Easy to navigate. 4 stars. Wish there was a dark mode and a place to bookmark/organize articles.,
It gets stuck. Will not open articles (paid subscription) consistently. I had to just use the regular chrome browser on my Android.,
The app let's you use it free for a few days and then blocks all articles unless you subscribe and take membership on a monthly/yearly basis. Disappointing.,
"I'm a subscriber but as of a week or so ago, it's not showing up in the app. Works in the browser. Same issue as reported by others. Please fix!",
"This is really good app, butt I'm going to uninstall it, because it's no longer free. I have to subscribe and pay 4.99€ per month for using it, but I'm on contrary on paying apps.",
My favourite news app. Excellent content and reasonably good to navigate. Quick loading times as well.,
What was the point of telling it all my likes and dislikes with innumerable categories if the for you page is just health and wellness articles? Its a very limited app you can't even browse all the articles anywhere.,
The app is great but NO DARK MODE! How anyone with such a budget can make an app and exclude a night time reading feature is beyond me.,
"Thank you, New York Times, for continuing to be a reliable, ethical news source during these trying times. Despite the unfair attacks on the media, you continue to shine and stand firm. I appreciate your team's dedication to journalistic excellence. I am a fan. May God bless and protect you all.",
"Latest update fixed the problem below, thanks-- Nothing happens when I click on story links so I can't read anything on this app except headlines",
FT is way superior! Using NY for a day with subscription. Already annoyed by all the in-app ads. Is it really necessary to trash all the fine articles with that much advertisement ?,
"Love this app! Gets the news to me in the way I love best about the NYT - without apology or hysteria. App is fast, and I have not experienced any glitches.",
I want to support the high quality journalism NYT does but cannot condone this practice of forcing advertising on users. Thankfully the Washington Post app subscription does not have ads with its subscription.,
Reliable news on a reliable app! Plain and simple. It's an affordable subscription for the news as well.,
"I have wrote multiple mails regarding the issue of not loading the app as well as website. I am facing this issue from last couple of weeks . Kindly look into the issue ""developers"".",
Not an international standard to have with. Back to back two fake news in a month. App design and hovering also to be changed.,
This is a top notch newspaper that appears to be non bias. The photographs displayed in the articled are always amazing.,
"great app, easy to navigate. I use it every day to access the quality reporting you expect from the NY Times",
Do not opt for subscription. It is a scam. They will not let you to cancel the subscription and will keep on deducting money. Their agents will not be available when you chose to cancel the subscription.,
"Always an interesting variety of articles. My go to resource for news, articles of interest, recipes, etc",
"Great news media app, standard-setting journalism. One of the best mobile apps to stay updated about news and views while reading content that can change your worldview. 👍👍",
"The mini crossword does not appear properly on screen. One cannot see all the letters, ""keyboard.""",
This app is useless for me. I have a subscription. Bought a new tablet. This app only lets me open a new account. It will not provide a way for me to open my old account on my new tablet. Don't waste your time.,
Mediocre writing and biased reporting. The search function isn't good and there's not enough filtering for types of articles.,
"repeatedly, our choice for easy delicious bread. even when it doesn't come out beautifully, it is so flavorful.",
Some bugs in the crossword since the new version yesterday. The keyboard no longer fits on the screen.,
l really appreciate the excellent reporting from the Times. I know I can always rely on the facts I read. Cheers to the dedicated reporters at the Times!!,
It's supposed to be a newspaper. Instead it's an opinion paper. There's hardly an article that doesn't blast Trump or the republicans. I want to just read the news. I'm sick of them pushing their agenda of making sure Trump doesn't get reelected in EVERY article they write. It's not a newspaper. It's politics siding with the left.,
Good overall except for the buggy save function on some articles. Sometimes the just don't save even after I get the save confirmation.,
Real harassment. After downĺoading app went for purchase of annual subscription as per offer of Rs 600 by NYT for basic access. Play store deducted Rs 6000 in stead of Rs 600 from my bank account. Chatted with NYT their records show payment of offer amount. Play store refuses to cancel the order or refund the amount. Really obnoxious behaviour.,
America's newspaper. By far the best journalism in my opinion. Wouldn't live without it. Much of its investigative reporting is top-notch and wouldn't be reported except for the New York Times!,
The app will not recognize my all-access subscription that I purchased through Google Play. My Google account is linked but I am still denied access to portions of the app.,
"The subscription utility isn't fixed. The slam offer made doesn't reflect on the invoice! Also, the dark mode has suddenly vanished!",
"I used to love reading the NY Times in this app, but now the articles don't open. So incredibly irritating. I'll be canceling my subscription.",
"Admittedly a (slightly) left-leaning news source, but the app is easy to use and navigate. Kudos to your dev teams!",
"I Iove the NY Times, but their app is, as others have pointed out, pretty buggy on Android right now. There are a host of issues detailed in other comments and all of them are spot in.",
"May be the worst app I have used in recent days. Every other day, it will complain ""Expired version"" and after that u can't download. Only solution is to re-install the app.",
"So disappointed The New York Times has become The New York Trash... The spin and liberal slant is so obvious, there is very little I can trust in this newspaper and I'm an independent... The gold standard of news once put out by the New York Times is now lower than dirt to me... We are in the middle of a pandemic and all they care about is pandering strictly to the left and the Hate Trump agenda... It's really very sad... What happened to unbiased news?",
"Since the update on 2/23/21, the keyboard for the mobile Crossword is partially blocked by a 'subscribe' banner. I do subscribe, and would love to be able to solve the crosswords.",
Horrible app. Incredibly biased and far left. News is often incorrect and has to be revised after the fact. DO NOT RECOMMEND!,
"What a beautiful, practical and long overdue vision of creating people-centric streets in New York. Kudos to the thoughtful planning and wonderful illustrations contained in this article.",
"slick, multimedia app. Not just a scanned newspaper. And obviously the NYT has excellent content.",
I love NYT but the app should allow me to select which account I want to use instead of assuming the default - my subscription is on a different account and I see no way to link the app to my subscription so back to the web for me...,
"Looks professional. I am pleasantly surprised. As for the quality of journalism, the articles are informative and quite balanced.",
I am a native New Yorker and loveThe Times and their in-depth reporting. I also love the daily crossword and weekly news quiz. Thanks for the opportunity to make these comments. Harriet King,
Bad app but excellent news. Swiping and navigating poor. Font sizes either too big or small depending on the header.,
I love the news from the Times because it seems like it isn't slanted one way or the other. I like the impartial approach. And there are really fun games on Fridays. :),
"I really like the app and the content but since downloading it, my battery life has significantly decreased. I have to uninstall.",
"I only downloaded it to stop the pop-ups on the main site. No luck. Every article I click on every day, do you want the app? No I do not stop asking.",
The New York Times is great. But after installing this app it is difficult to view NY Times stories on my browser or save them as pdfs.,
"I was really hoping that a news app made by the most popular newspaper in the U.S would less clunky, but frankly this is the worst news app I've ever tried to use. Do better, NYT.",
"Just updated to Dec 2 2019 update because older version was not updating stories. Latest release will not load at all! White screen only! Log shows the app crashed on my Note 8. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled - all OK now.",
"Have to log in every time for it to recognize my subscription. Annoying at best, illogical for a piece of software that is subscription based.",
"titles often missing, text inexplicably light grey at times, links to app from notifications fails 90% of the time.",
"It's always worth to know what is happening and where, and to read true and unopinionated information, which news should be. I minored in Journalism in university.",
"Bite-sized news in a format I control. It's been a good way to stay informed about the issues that matter to me, without the endless litany of doom-and-gloom stories that TV news offers.",
"Good writing, wide coverage of news and other topics, no major complaints. Links were broken, now fixed. Notifications were broken, now fixed (13-Jan-2020)",
The app does what one would expect. To get five stars its recommendations for articles to read needs to be better. About half the time I find articles I care about via Google News.,
One of the worst subscription models I've seen. You have to call and talk to someone to cancel. They place you on hold and expect you to wait an unreasonable period of time. It's easier to get out of a gym membership.,
"This is a lot of information for up to date news all on the Google Play Store, may have a few ads as well ,but the news is more up than most of the news was up dated.very good way to keep informed . YOU WOULD LIKE IT A LOT,it is so much better than the rest of your family to be here and how much you can get to know what you are doing with your life.",
"I love this newspaper, but I wish it would allow account holders to share a limited number of articles. It would be a good marketing tool for increasing subscribers. Give them a taste, and many would subscribe😊",
"App itself works fine, but the lengths you have to go to in order to cancel the subscription are a joke! Would not recommend as a result",
Tapping on a news story in the notification tray doesn't open the story. It only opens the app.,
"I am a subscriber, but currently having to uninstall and reinstall on my Androud whenever I want updated news. NYT is aware there's this problem for some users, but no fix yet.",
"This app has a puny 2.5""-wide text strip, replacing the preiously available full-screen desktop view of the NYT that featured content titles by section in a sidebar and presented each article on a wide frame.",
"This is guys are real cheaters. If you want to cancel your subscription you need too call an US number or foreign number. There is a chat option but never someone available. You cant remove your card and so baiscally they lock you in. Really guys, what is this??? i bought a subscription of a paper i didnt join NKVD....i want to cancel with a click, bloody rip off.... worst digital purchade in my life, i will never click on anything from them again and tell all my friends and family to stay away",
"Simply the best. I love the Washington Post, being from the area, but the journalism is impeccable in both. NYT is a leader!",
"This app crashes a lot. I don't have this problem with the Washington Post, Guardian or any other newspaper apps. I'm considering canceling my subscription.",
"I have also worked in Afghanistan as a journalist and trainer of journalists, many of my students are still in Afghanistan including some who most recently worked for some of the organizations in this article. I think it's too soon to pat ourselves on the backs for those we've gotten out. too many are still there.",
The section menu is not working correctly. Some sections (Technology) do not show names. Some sections (Science) do not show content. Pls fix this. I am a subscriber.,
Best most complete and thorough newspaper in the world. Open and transparent discussion on tough topics. Prompt update of breaking news around the world. Reader and subscriber since 7th grade.,
"Great news, but the app appears broken and won't recognize my login. It tells me I've just signed in and need to register on the same screen.",
Due to android malfunction I had to uninstall & reinstall the app and my subscription was lost. Major issue if a different payment method used. Bombarded with warnings of cancellation and major time consumption trying to rectify....accounts not user friendly. Cancelling and moving on 😣😣😣,
"I'm so happy that I finally decided to subscribe, the 10 free articles per month wasn't enough and these days it's very difficult to find such good journalism elsewhere.",
This used to work well but within the last few weeks the app freezes up and restarts itself after reading 2 - 3 articles.,
"I have been subscribed for some time now, allthough it will not show me the articles because it says I need to subscribe. I can only access through a browser.",
Love all the info I can read very diverse media and of course the crossword easy app to use graphics are good overall I am very satisfied with my purchase,
"app doesn't work on android, and it took me 30 minutes to cancel my subscription. quite disappointing that they put so much hurdles to prevent you from cancelling your subscription.",
"Since most recent update, the crossword only shows half the keyboard, making it impossible to fill in.",
"Just rating the app, not content. On Android one this NYT app does not work anymore. Just freezes a start up",
"I love the depth of coverage on news issues, the recipes, the games, the art and literary reviews. Everything",
The notifications have nothing to do with the news in the app. Just turn them off. Otherwise you can't get better news. It's just the app that sucks.,
How can there even be 114% of Americans with there own podcast? The accuracy and unbiased facts of news are very important to me. You lost me with the 4th article I read.,
The morning updates are concise and extremely helpful. The articles are informative and engaging.,
"Objective, well rounded, backed by facts, wide coverage across the entire spectrum of life, cultures, science, technology, politics ... . Get it if you can.",
"It should be mentioned that the process of unsubscribing nytimes has been designed to be outrageously hard. Very scummy, you should really think twice before you subscribe.",
"If you love to learn something new every time you read, this is the news source for you. Definitely not failing my need to learn about history, culture, cooking, business...on and on.",
I paid for an annual digital subscription and still get advertisements in the app. Seriously? Is this how the NYT app and digital subscription are supposed to work?,
Great unbiased journalism. It is what is missing in many other publications. The best thing you could do is grab yourself a subscription.,
NYT tech support confirmed to me this morning that that they intentionally removed the widgets as part of the latest update. Baffling. Guess I'm switching to Washington Post app 🤷,
"Puzzles still glitchy after Android update. While I can now access the bottom 2 rows of the keyboard, Vertex is virtually unusable.",
Used to be fast but getting slower. Freezes frequently to load advertisements and Covid related statistics.,
Browser has a better experience. There is a constant banner in the app. Very annoying,
"Very frustrating, the app keeps stopping and I cannot access the content, despite having a subscription.",
Nice and clean but clicking alerts doesn't always take you to the story and sharing content is too limited.,
Will never order from Google Play again. I ordered NY Times and cannot unsubscribe. I am cutting back on everything since I am semi retired. But cannot find unsubscribe anywhere!!! I like NY Times but not this app😠,
"The app is about as good as the newspaper itself. Need i say more? A completely biased app full of ""FAKE NEWS"" trying to claim they're a regular, non-biased, news organization. Stop lying to the public.",
"App used to be great but is now super slow, doesnt scroll correctly, and kills my battery. This is a news app, not a game - completely inexcusable!!",
"Beautiful, inspirational, and aspirational. Very thorough reporting. More interesting stories would be nice! Please see my Twitter account for some ideas, recommendations, or suggestions: @maryellenwayne1",
"Worth a read. Covers 2 points very well. 1) What Republicans need to do for the future of their party and our democracy. 2) How to stimulate our economy AND jump start saving the climate. And YES, both can be done. And YES, now is the time...",
"mostly good app, but notifications are useless. the headline in the notification IS NOT where the notification leads.😿👎",
So much work has been done this year to improve the app. Works great. I love it. Minus 1 star for all the apps I still have to avoid even with a paid subscription.,
"NYTIMES LISTEN TO US. We cannot stand seeing that link to USE APP 5 times a day. Subscribers, they do not care about this inconvenience. I called them. Any ideas.",
Terrible news app. You can only read 10 articles before it makes you pay. There are better and free news apps on the play store. Don't waste your time with this one,
"Terrible app, news is filled with ads, it deliberately stops scrolling to keep the ad on the screen longer, unacceptable, uninstalled.",
"Subscribed to all access, not getting all access. Keeps wanting to charge for NYT cooking app separately. Can't log in on ios. My online account doesn't show the payment that Google play took",
"Crashes constantly, I can't even read the news in the morning. Also impossible to find the NYC covid map.",
It is very informative and interesting. The fonts of the app is unique as well as the articles presented.,
Terrible. Needs dark mode and better integration with Google play. Subscription doesn't even show active.,
Went from five to three. Multiple repeat notifications that don't link to the article I selected. Breaking news alerts no longer appear,
This app is the worst. Pages don't load all the way and the comments section won't load at all. It seems to work fine on my iPad but Android version is terrible.,
"this app is not updating the latest news or articles I have to uninstall and reinstall three times a day to stay current. As a subscriber at considerable cost, this is maddening. Please address",
"NYT are FRAUDSTERS. They are charging me fees every month and i am unable open the app. It says ""please download latest update"" but it doesn't downloads latest update. FRAUDSTERS HINDUPHOBES.",
"I rate a newspaper for the quality of the public service it offers, not for the games. So it's excellent, period. Keep going this way.",
"Great paper, but horrible app. Needs to be scrapped and rebuilt. The obnoxious adds foisted upon subscribers clog the app and crash the pages. I suggest you ask Bezos if he'll let you dupe the WaPo app!",
Great sories of all kinds. Good games and recipes too. The Times newspaper app is handy and easy to use.,
The articles keep randomly refreshing and auto scrolls to the top. Really annoying while reading.,
"While I'm scrolling it's pretending I've clicked on ads. I understand they make money if I do, but they will lose money if they keep it this trigger happy. Really frustrating.",
"No longer works on Samsung tablet. Guess I'll have to cancel subscription. UPDATE: Jan 31 - Hey, it works again. Yeah!",
missing some key features. you can't swipe left/right to go to the next section or even search articles in this app.,
"The app works well and the NYT content is timely, relevant and trusted. Highly recommended, if ""you can handle the truth"".",
All new sources need to be checked for accuracy. I feel confident reading the New York Times. You just have to separate facts from opinion the best you can and I really do this.,
"Writers are biased and try to confuse the readers when they disagree with something, witholding very important data and pointing out irrelivent data to sew confusions. They are fake news and shouldnt be allowed on google play. They also take permissions to all your data to collect and sell, DO NOT INSTALL",
"I rarely come out here to write reviews, but getting night mode was a thing to celebrate. Bravo NYTimes, it was quite the time!",
Good app all around. I only wish dark-mode would work for all articles. Sometimes I'll have to read on the mobile version to force dark mode.,
"ALWAYS stellar covearage no matter the topic: detailed, informative, challenging, thought-provoking, well sourced, often inspiring, but never boring.",
Not particularly happy. Content not great for international users and can't unsubscribe without phoning a constantly busy toll number. Shame on you nyt.,
Great app and reliable news! The app often has very cool visualizations on some of the stories. Well done.,
Too many ads for subscribers. And large distracting ads at that. Just use a browser with an ad blocker. Skip the app.,
"The ""monster""might just be the best word to call this turbine, I would want plenty of environmental studies and designations of shipping lanes. A large tanker took out the bridge in Tampa Bay years ago. It would be like TWO dinosaurs getting into a rumble, and both would probably lose.",
A phenomenal news source and a great app to access that writing. Digitally optimized content is a pleasure to read.,
I really hate the fact that you removed the ability to swipe through each page of each section like an ebook. Please bring back the swipe feature.,
Notifications don't always direct to the headlines listed within article. Very frustrating.,
Reasonably good interface; primary issue is that the notifications often don't target the right stories if the app is already open,
Subscription doesn't remove ads. You need to call in to cancel subscription 😕 But at least they provide local numbers in some countries.,
I just spent money on the subscription and it doesn't work. I called New York times and they gave me a number for the Google app support which doesn't work. What a waste of money.,
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the this article in the times. Nice descriptions of different music and math.,
It say free access to all the articles but shows me subscribtion menu on trying to open the article. Same article is fully available on their website without any restrictions.,
"Please beware. NYT subscription engages in predatory behavior. Once you sign up you cannot delete your payment info, and it is almost impossible to delete you account.",
Excellent app. Award-winning journalism and breaking news coverage that are so good without the noise.,
"Wish the Plague on this unremovable app, that came pre installed with my Samsung. Useless malware app asking my money and preventing me from installing apps i actually want to install... Dont put up with unremovable bloatware.. 1 star them all",
"This app isn't letting me read the article I want without subscribing. There is no point in installing this app. Also, I can't search for an article.",
"Most biased articles against India. uninstalled the app after their job postings for India. NYT hardly understands India, is a club of fools who think they can stop India from rising. News is freely available everywhere. Why subscribe to a media which hates India?",
I wish the Today tab houses more sections than it currently does. I easily run out of articles to read in the Today tab and the For You section is full of irrelevant fluff. I'd prefer for other prominent sections like World to be in the tab menu or to be within the Today page.,
The New York Times has ceased to be a legit source of news. It is now a festering sore on the back of true journalism and more of a political tool than a newspaper. Avoid.,
Forces you to make a phone call to cancel your subscription. Should be against the law to allow sign ups on the app but force a phone call for cancelation. Shame on you NYT!,
I love the content but the navigation design choices are strange and sometimes frustrating.,
It still shows me ads even after subscription and there's no “rotate screen” option. There is NO print edition available. I've unsubscribed.,
Latest version of the app has removed text size options and font size has reset/default to a small font. Bring back this option please!,
Too many glitches. Stories repeatedly fail to load on both wifi and mobile. I won't pay for an app that doesn't do what it's supposed to do.,
"The app experience is quite amazing. Reading made interactive, hope other news publisher bring data, tech and news together in this way",
"I loved this app, but The Times announced in autumn 2019 that they were discontinuing it. They're sending is to the web browser instead. 🙁",
"Top quality journalism. Even though it's usually classed as a Conservative paper, it remains balanced in its reporting.",
"This app sucks. It says to download the latest version, but when I click on the download, again it will show up to download the new version. Please fix it",
"I love this newspaper, despite its flaws. All journalism enterprises make errors but the NYT still has among the highest standards for writing and investigations.",
The app is fine...the content is tired and frequently stale. I am not here for opinion pieces I am here for news. Updated news more than once a day.,
"I found the constant barage of my phone pinging from this app annoying. Like most people, I want to get the news on my terms, not the other way around",
"After about a 4 year absence, dark mode has returned! And with that I'm back, thank you for not clubbing my eyeballs. BUT did you have to remove text resizing to do it?",
The app is good but the search is terrible. Often results in searching for articles on Google to find what I'm looking for.,
"as much as I love this app, as a paying customer it is extremely infuriating that the website constantly prompts me to open articles in the app. to reiterate, I am a paying customer. should I not be able to view NYT articles however I like?",
Cancel New York Times subscription. Going to have to cancel my credit card. Not happy there is no way to cancel this subscription that has doubled to 18.,
Bring back dark mode! Every other app has this option. It's easier on the eyes. I don't get why the latest update removed this feature,
So much better than the usual sensationalist online news outlets. I'd forgotten what it was like to read real news coverage - so nice to be back,
"ads intrusive, especially ones with moving content. comments section on individual articles often hangs. why bother. use privacy browser instead.",
Paid over $200 via Google Play and can't access. NYT has no record of account (over an hour on the phone w/customer service); Google refuses refund. BUYER BEWARE.,
i like the broad spectrum of topics addressed in the nyt. nyt has a neutral view but sometimes it seems to lean towards the right a bit.,
Keeps asking to subscribe. I have a subscription and am already logged in. Edit. Downgraded to one star since it still does this a year later. Fix your app NYT.,
Love the N.Y. TIMES. APP is reliable. Never any problems and the customers may cancel a subscription at any time.,
NO SPOILERS! the app really needs a way to disable sports score spoilers. otherwise you have to disable all notifications which I wouldn't normally do.,
"Antiquated with limited features. While a great news organisation, they really don't give enough resources to make their app good.",
"No one in the chain, from writer to editors at the New York Times, knew the definition of ""iniquity,"" and that what they should have said was ""inequities."" Get your act(s) together.",
"The dark mode was just removed because it's being ""reworked"". Very weird - why don't you keep the old one until the new version is done?",
The button to leave a comment on an article does not work on either of my Android devices. Frustrating that they can't make something as simple as that work.,
"All I want in life is to get on the metro in the morning, where there is no 4g, and have my news waiting for me already downloaded. Why can you do this NYT? Settings suggest this should work. Easy 5 once that's in.",
"OK. But does not allow to see all the sections, even as a subscriber. Including Today' paper. Not very well thought out. 😕",
A Times reporter had to leave the paper because he used the N word when asking a question about someone else's use of the word. An article by a conservative Times columnist questioning the move was not published. An editor had to leave because he published an opinion by a US senator that some staff and readers didn't like.,
Excellent reporting especially their investigative reporting. First with a lot of breaking news so the New York Times is worth your time.,
"Very nice. I wish there was less, rather than more: more curated, summarized info for the time starved. But very nice source of info!",
Far more complete than any other news article I have seen. most illuminating to see it may have years or decades of protection.,
"As a 5 time Hawaii Ironman Triathlon finisher, I find this very very interesting, and comforting. The author is an ultramarathoner, so he's got credentials to say what he has said.",
[p.s. the free days are browser only not for ap????] ...mods to address. if anyone has offline reading now DO NOT UPDATE! anonymous etc. use of feature will be lost. if this notice is too late try finding article in Washington Post! most stories get syndicated and many apps offer offline reading. Use browser lol!??,
"Amazing app, trusted journalism, appropriate amount of notifications, all of which are worth reading (unlike some other news apps) What else do you expect from the NYT?",
Updating my review: Night Mode is back for Android! And it works great. Please do not take it away EVER AGAIN. Thank you thank you thank you!,
Relevant reporting for a wild world. More important than ever to have solid journalism for information and as a check on our government and industries.,
"I love this news at my fingertips everyday!! Keeps me up to date and gives me all kinds of user friendly tools like recipes, links, etc. Thanks NYT!!",
I dont get any recent articles that are being sent to my phone...when i click on the notice it tells me the article has failed to load!!!!,
"Dark Mode nyt available for S21 fe. Don't know why, Don't really understand why. Also app alerts do not navigate to the actual news item it alerted about.",
"Used to be a good rating. Now they're just tailoring the news for me instead of giving me all of it. Highly suggest just staying with the Web Browser version, as app is just a coercive way to make an echo chamber for a singular user.",
"One of the last great news outlets in America. You may like or agree with the truth but that's what you are getting from NY times, deal with it.",
"The app can't be opened, I have uninstalled and installed it again and again and keeps failing. It closes just as I click it to open. What can I do????",
This is a brilliant piece of writing. I am from England and the same age as the 7up participants so I have some understanding of the time(s) and places the writer describes. A humane vision of Apted. Superb journalism.,
it keeps telling me i am using an old version every two days. and there's no update option in google play so i have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it literally every other day,
"Sometimes they have relevant news. Mostly biased nonsense. I keep it around, because it would be foolish not to know what bs people are being fed by the media. But not one story Is written without thick layers of bias and irrelevant opinions. Take this media with a grain of salt and you can find useful news. One star because your opinion is not wanted, give me the news and nothing more.",
No dark mode is a deal breaker for me since I like to read in bed before I doze off. So many other news apps have implemented it already.,
"The Times works nicely in Chrome but is somewhat confusing as an app. It is missing current market information. Also, how many apps do I need?",
What is up with all these ads on a paid subscription? I don't pay to have ads shoved in my face every paragraph scroll. Fix this or I will cancel my subscription.,
There should be ways to follow favorite journalist in the app to not miss their reports as well as dark mode immediately. More reports need to have audio version as well.,
Edit. Dropped from 2 to 1 star. Pathetic coding. Hire a 15yo to revamp this pathetic excuse for an app. Less than a week on and I'll be canceling my paid subscription. Don't waste your time. Plenty of better & free ways to get around their paywall.,
"If you value America's free press, subscribe to the NYT. It's the gold standard for accurate news and investigative reporting; a genuine national treasure.",
"Android app bug - scroll bar is the same color as the white background so while reading an article, I'm unable to tell how far along I am (and also how long the article is)",
"This took me about 10 seconds to kick to the curb. You can't enlarge photos or text. More ads? IDK, I couldn't wait to dump this junk.",
Stinks. Does not allow reader to enlarge print. Stories have worse and more confusing layout.,
"When will developers add something like Reuters ""The Wire"", showing headlines only, so one can quickly see the stories that interests them without scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.",
"Excellent, balanced news coverage and great features. Sorry but I can't afford it... Too expensive",
Constant birage of subscribe offers on the free app. Cannot get the good recipes unless you subscribe. Dont bother with this app unless you want to subscribe.,
"i appreciate the depth and detail of the NYT reporters. While certainly liberal, the paper brings knowlege and understanding of the issues we face.",
I wish all you guys who run the newspapers would give us a break let us subscribe to all the papers at once!! you can't subscribe to everything and nickel and dime us no one can subscribe to New York times LA times Washington Post when you only maybe look at it five times a month give us some balk rates will you!,
"I don't want 3rd party running in the background. Starts automatically .hard to defeat. I want the news,but I don't want the bastards running my phone.",
Have been trying to stop subscription for a year and every month they continue to charge me and the price is INCREASING for soemthing I don't even want. >=/,
The specialist reporting is second to none. I love that you can expect a high level investigation from these authors. The crossword and Spelling Bee are awesome. Thank you.,
"Says my device is offline even though i am connected to Wi-Fi. COVID and ""FOR YOU"" pages load but the front page and all news will not.",
"I love this newspaper. It's one of the best researched, with well written, easily understandable articles and opinion pieces. It's definitely one of my best investments.",
Crashes more than the elderly into a farmers market. Complete garbage. You are better off using a browser and going to their mobile website. Zero stars if I could.,
NYT covers it all. my first choice (and WAPO) for breaking news. their readers' comments are the most intelligent of any site I've encountered.,
PITA. I subscribed but it kept kicking me out when I wanted to read an article from Facebook. I will be requesting my money back and cancelling my subscription.,
"As an International subscriber finds NYTimes one of the better in the World of ""Peni-mation"". Archives from 19th & 20th Century is, an experience worth living. 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠💖 for the archives",
Beware. You cannot cancel without speaking to one of their representatives. The app is also riddled with ads and the articles are average.,
"The New York Times app is fantastic and of course, the journalism is world class. Highly recommend purchasing the very affordable subscription.",
"Can no longer link to articles om my tablet.. NYT said to update to 9.1.1, but I don't see it in the google store. App works fine on my phone.",
"This is a subscription based app, and they can't manage to stop trying to sell other content as another sub. Pretty ridicky",
"I feel like you can trust the NYTimes to give you non biased, informative and up to to date news about what's going on in the world.",
"it starts my day... from relevant news to thought provoking (and not always liberal) opinions, to challenging games. can't live without it.",
just realized that I can access all sections of the paper by swiping right... this is fantastic! I love this app!!!🙂,
The quality of journalism is degenerating. Tried to unsubscribe and the process is excessive. Unsubscribing shouldn't be an act of Congress and shows poor integrity on the part of NYT. Would not recommend.,
"Thank you for the fine, trustable reporting.",
Real reporting means answering all of the unanswered critical questions you still have after being constantly showered by miriads of tidbit-news. Truly worth your reading pleasure. Thank you NYTimes!,
"A powerful phone (OnePlus 6T) overheats on running this app!!! While the content is par excellence, this piece of software needs to be revamped.",
"I used to love this app, but recently it started scrolling to the top every time you return from an article. Please make that stop!",
fantastic newspaper with the best news in the world but even after paying a lot of money for subscription that are certain formats you cannot access you have to be have Superior Stature to get to those formats Like e-paper,
I love reading the articles and supporting independent journalism. I wish subscribers could get NYT Cooking at a discount though as that one is a pricey add on.,
"Still no dark mode. Please get with the times and address this, I can not have a bright white screen much of the time.",
Got it as part of my husband's subscription but it would never let me open any article in spite of 3 attempts by him and 1 by them. Guess it's time to cancel,
Why isn't there a search function (for a string within an article)? The app needs to be at least as good as reading in a web browser if I'm going to use it,
NYT does a great job covering the topics and issues of the day that I am interested in. a lot of other media outlets usually report on a NYT story so why not get the story/news directly from the source.,
"It's a decent app, but I can get dark mode in my browser. App used to have dark mode, and when it comes back I'll up it to 5 stars.",
"App doesn't connect my NYT subscription, so always asking for login. Try to login (i.e. NYT Cooking) and it won't let me past the ""Subscribe Now"" page.",
It would be good if dark mode could be enabled in the Android app. Much too bright at night!,
Articles that help me sleep better. a MUST for me!!!,
"Works fine, but 2 big issues: 1) no night/ dark mode 2) search bar needs an upgrade, i struggle to find articles unlessbi know the full name",
"The app is really convenient! There is really so much to do, read , learn. You feel better and do better with the pages of the times. Thank you!",
Can install. I push the install button but nothing happens. I just paid for a subscription and cant use the app. I can download any other app just fine.,
This isn't an app... It can only be opened by opening chrome and searching nyt. It's very strange.,
"Provides in-depth reports on news about top stories, both in the headlines as well as lesser-known topics. Love it as a top news source 24/7.",
"I support journalists, and subscribe to the New York Times from abroad. Thanks for all you do, and the user friendly app.",
"It wont let me sign in with my google paid account on the app, only via the browser. When i click the Google sign in while in the app I get a 403 error: dissallowed useragent. ""Google can't sign you in safely within this app"".",
App works fine. Content however is not news. NY Times is a part of the leftist ministry is propaganda. Completely biased. The Epoch times presents unbiased news. Use them.,
A great app which is a joy to use. If give it 5 stars but night mode has been gone for years and I miss it!,
"Every other major news app (CNN, BBC, FOX, etc) provides content for free. Period. I value good journalism and believe in living wages, however forcing readers to pay flies in the face of a free press and democracy itself. How elitist of you NYT, to only allow access to information for those who can afford to pay.",
Swiping pictures is too sensitive on my Nexus. Reading articles when offline would be great (check the Guardian app). Why there are ad's even though I have a subscription?,
"NYT site sells for $52 instead of $99, and it can be cancelled anytime. Also NYT site app works on Windows and Android, not just Android as this app is crippled to just Android.",
Great content but the amount of ads is overwhelming. The ads are still served even for paid subscribers. Worse reading experience comparing to read directly on the mobile website.,
"In addition to beautifully written, reliable new reporting, it also contains Travel, Arts, Cooking, amd other content. Well worth the cost.",
"Upgrading tablets but when I log into new tablets saved articles is empty. On website, phone, and old tablet it all shows my saved articles. Why don't they show on new tablet nytimes app?",
I paid for the subscription. Why am I still seeing ads? What more do you want from me?? I can't even read an article without 3-4 sponsored ads. This is absurd.,
"The app is almost unusable. Articles will not load, occasionally restarting the app will work but not always. Given how expensive access this app is this is unacceptable.",
"Annoying. Really, really irritating. Reading reviews here clued me into using a browser instead of this horrible cludge. Sorry NYT, your app is a fail.",
I love the Times. Where is the widget now? This was an important part of the user experience for me.... much like the equivalent news widgets for BBC. Please bring that back.,
"Why on earth would anybody pay to read news, while they are available online for free? I like NYTimes and the app is good but I cant pay to read news. There are millions of free alternatives out there for instant news.",
This article nailed a very difficult subject. The amount of research should be commended.,
Mini crossword puzzle does not show the bottom row of keys on the keyboard in this update. Can I revert back to the last release?,
The best way to stay in touch with what is of importance to me. From Politics to food to foreign affairs. I appreciate the investigative journalism most of all.,
This is the only trusted news source out there these days. You get to set up interests that are tailord to yourself and view what you really want.,
Simple app that works great for all news related content. Push notifications are very helpful to stay informed.,
"When I try to open articles they don't open, so I can only read headlines. Not sure why this is. I'm on a Galaxy 10e",
"Night Mode no longer works on the top of the ""Today"" tab and ""2020"" election story sections. This breaks accessibility and people with vision impairments can't read the content.",
Battery Draining. The last few days app has been killing my battery. Draining 23% of my battery in the last 6 hours on my Galaxy S10+. Looked at a story 6 hours ago and it's been hogging my battery and making my phone hot. Uninstalled,
"Great source for current news, in depth articles, culture, cooking and community. I must have it every day!",
"Ms. Dowd always tells it as it is. She has the courage to stand up to the big libs, who have a lot of power behind them, but she doesn't back down She pokes fun while always telling the truth... She is a rare commodity in this day and age",
"no one puts correspondents in the places the Times does. If you care about news that's outside of the United States, it's NYT",
Good balance of information.,
"I used to love this app. I rated it 5 stars. Now that I am able to afford the subscription, I got the app back on my Android 5.1.1 and the app will not load even though it's supposed to and I have great internet. What happened NYT?",
Top Stories is still broken. What gives?? I've updated the app three times now and Top Stories still will not load any article I tap.,
"It is a great app and importantly with terrific content. I ❤️👏 as I am informed, entertained, and sometimes profoundly moved by its stories",
"Used this app for years on Android with no problem. Now articles don't load, ads have weird flashing effect.",
"This piece explains so much about the disturbing trends in our culture. Clearly written, concise, helpful!",
"Hangs, often slow, changing orientation of device causes app to hang. Overall a poor implementation",
I enjoy what I believe to be great and factual journalism. If a mistake happens they are accountable and make the proper changes.,
"Wouldn't load the page ""Coronavirus in the US, Latest Map and Case Count"" but they fixed that. Loads everything faster now, good going, people!",
The app worked well for a while and constantly crashes now. I can no longer open it.,
App crashes all the time on Android. Sometimes fails to refresh news feed and I can only see days-old articles,
"The app is incredibly clean, easy to use, and offers not too many adds when using the free version.",
"they cover more detailed news, relevant news, and I feel that I learn at least one thing new in each article I read.",
It keep crashing while I am reading the news. Please fix it as I am a regular reader and a subscriber.,
Doesn't overload you with push notifications and gives you high-quality news from every facet of life.,
"Sharing options are totally inadequate. High quality, reliable reader app otherwise.",
"Most recent update is very unstable. It crashes constantly. I love the NYT, butvthis version is awful.",
