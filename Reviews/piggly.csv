Cannot set the store to my hometown. So many PW apps. Corporate needs to create 1 app for everybody so you don't have to search for your local one. Do better.,
"This could be a helpful shopping tool, but it will not let me change my home store from the AL store to my actual local store lication. It's so annoying! And I believe I am missing discounts because of this.",
Can't get it to set to my location either.. It needs to be in the location that people live in..,
"Great app for organized shopping at my local Piggly Wiggly for sales, ads, coupons, the free item of the week, the one day flash sale item, and a special discount if you use it each purchase.",
"Umm I live in WV but the app says my ""home store"" was somewhere in AL. I tried so many different ways to change location, the app fought me each time. This is a brand new phone has been no where but WV. I deleted app. I don't need this.",
Home store is 124 miles away. I live 5 miles from one. The app wont let me change it so the ads and coupons dot apply. So far this app sucks.,
"READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING! This app ,for you who dont know, is for a local Piggly Wiggly in a small town in Alabama. It will only work with that store ,therefore ,no you can not change your location because it only works with one store.",
It's a really good place to buy groceries has a great and the are helpful and friendly and really act like very professional employees and the apps very good too,
"Website will not let me choose a store less than 2 miles from me, making sales and coupons useless.",
"They have no app that works with a new store in prentiss, miss.",

It won't let me change to my store. I don't live in Alabama. They need to do better.,
