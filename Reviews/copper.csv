Review Text,Category
It is just too inconvenient with the options it gives. You can't add prepaid debit cards. The auto reload sucks because you can't add a specific amount of money on your balance when its below your selected amount. They charge money for sending with a linked debit card which I think they shouldn't charge for. It also takes so long for bank transfers to enter the copper balance and its just irritating and annoying. Kids can't even link thier own cards and bank accounts. Step is a better option.,
Been using this for a while and i do recommend it. Though DO NOT DO THE INVESTING. Copper claims to do most the work but it's honestly a scam. You get a couple bucks after first putting in money and then it drops and you get nothing. Im waiting to earn my couple bucks back and pulling the money out and never adding it back in.,
App UI is cutoff at half screen. So I can't press 'Finish' on allowance. Has been broken for months... world be great,
"Love the product itself, but when opening the app, it's split in half and only shows at the top half of my screen.",
As soon as you get to a certain amount of credits it keeps telling you the surveys don't count anymore its a scam. Obviously.,
"Awful experience trying to set it up properly. Not intuitive. Not worth money IMHO, unless of course it works somehow. Which for me, it did not.",
I'm not sure about other people but it worked just fine until I got the card set up and the 5$ that it said I would get if I shared it with someone but after that it takes like forever to open the app like I've been waiting for 10 minutes and I just gave up,
"I had this for my teen for 2 years and thought it was great UNTIL she got another phone with a new number and the old phone was turned off. Well, she has money sitting in her savings that she cannot access. The verification sends code to old number. Duh, we cannot access. You can't get a live body to help you. And the bot is useless. WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP. Because if you need help there is no one there and your money is gone.",
"I just downloaded so I don't know much otherwise I would have given it a 5 stars. But so far it's amazing!! I love that its very detailed in what it does! Even with being a teen and being confused with this ""stuff"" it's nice that Copper explains everything to you! I definitely would and am recommending this app to MANY other people! ❤️",
my kids love it. I use it for they're gaming and shopping online. that way they can't over draft my account on accident. also easy if they are with friends and need a little extra money. my son also learning a little about investing,
So far I've been dealing with the same problem even after the recent update where I can't make purchases. I've been trying to buy this item for the past week but it won't go through. The copper helper ai is pretty useless with the current situation and I'm still unsure if it's the Xbox store or the copper card it won't work no matter what so I don't know,
terrible app. takes DAYS to transfer money to another account and then constantly wanting you to upgrade your plan. and the thirty day free trial is pointless seeing how you don't receive your debit card till the trial period is almost up. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,
it helps me with money even at a young age it's really good I recommend with those who want to save or learn banking,
it is an amazing app my mom is happy I'm using this keep in mine I'm only 15 so this is a great way to keep and save money.,
Terrible customer service. When applying for an account the form asks where I would like the card sent. My application was denied because the address i provided doesnt match my licence. When i asked if i could reapply with a matching address i was told no. Interesting business model.,
I was unable to link my bank they use plaid to link your back which works with my bank I've done it before but they told me my bank wasn't compatible. The cancellation process is drawn out you are required to chat with a bot and then an agent in order to cancel.,
Tasks are a good feature but please add an option for a day of the week,
so far it's pretty good and I think you guys are really nice for letting this be free unless you wanna upgrade,
It's really good for kids so they can learn how to save it's overall a good app I like it.,
This was fun and I need to save money so this was a good saving app for money :),
it is good for you child to save up to get the things they want and need and the parents are whatchi g over them,
"Does transfer money, but there's no notifications settings in the app. At least none that are easy to find. I don't appreciate spam notifications.",
this is the best app ever even better then cash app the only reason I say that is bc I'm always losing my card and after you by the first card you buy the second one you have to pay $5 just for a second card so this app is really going to be a big change for me and every thing else,
"Its really easy and rewarding for me and my family to use, I honestly haven't yet found anything horrible or just nor perfect about this app! I would give 10 stars if available.",
"it really is great! it works like a regular bank, but underage people can use debit cards! I definitely recommend",
"A convenient way to set up kids with a debit card and to start teaching them about money management. New features keep coming, too!",
It seems like the perfect banking app for teens and/ or kids. It looks like the perfect app to teach them some responsibility.,
"Wow as a teen, I am surprised with this app, it has good intentions towards the financial lives of kids a I recommend it for those who like to spend as it comes with great features. 10/10",
It's a good app for teens I love it and doing the lessons is easy as I know most of the answers. I really recommend it for other teens,
The app is ok. If I were you I would just open a teen cash app account. It's much better and the reload is super easy.,
"easy to use and the children love having their own money, it has really helped them learn to budget and save for things they really want.",
"We're learning about this app in my class through a copper representative, it's been a nice experience so far.",
I am enjoying copper and I'm only 11 and I'm learning how to use it and I'm loving it alr,
it's really good for kids no cap,
"Its easy to use, highly recommend",
the app is a super good at banking and when I got it I thought it might be bad but it was insanely good and I hope that people that need it will give it a shot,
"App crashed when trying to setup and was stuck at verifying. Support sent me a link so I can finish. Then, the app wanted me to provide phone numbers for the kids. It wouldn't accept my number for them. I'm giving 3 stars because support was responsive. That's all I can rate; I'm not giving out kids phone numbers for a prepaid debit card.",
"Signed up over a month ago The app uses a third party linking system called plaid which is common,I have used this before to link my bank in apps with no issues. Recieved the debit card in about 2 wks, once I was able to get my bank info linked after several attempts I set up the "" free"" 3 day transfer option for allowance, my account I linked was ""locked"" & the transfers I set up cancelled. Support could not help. Guessing because they wanted me to use other pay fee options",
So far I've had absolutely no issues with the app. I just wish that it would let me sort out the money in my savings rather than making me complete a goal before I can add money into a different one without changing their spots.,
I think that the copper App is a very unique and brilliant app I think that it's worth wondering for me especially because of how easy it is she used,
Good banking app had it for a year now,
"Never got to use it. I was forced to go through a bunch of set up - my cell phone number and verification, last 4 of my SSN, name, address, invite my kids, etc. Decided not to finish when it was forcing my hand to submit my banking info. It's bad enough that I had to subscribe without seeing the app, but this is over the top. I know they need all this info to use the app, but I wanted to SEE it to determine if it was even suitable.",
it's a good app so far because you basically get free money when you sign up and helps you reach a goal for stuff you want or like,
This is definitely a really good app and kinda acts like a debit card. You are able to keep track of have how much money you have and your parents can put money on it. It's really great for teens who want to have their own saved money and use it whenever and wherever they want. They also send you texts of ways you can get more money. It's amazing!!,
"Terrible. If you want so much information then make the process easier. I had to redo my information even though I positioned everything correctly the first time along with the selfie. Then in the end they ""can't verify my information."" This system is garbage and needs an overhaul",
you may need a parent to help but it is a good app to help you stay away from spending to much at a time.,
"easy to use, very convenient. I have both my kids (ages 14 & 16) on this account with me. I can always see how much they have in their account(s), & I can send them money instantly if needed. could def do without the transfer fee though.",
"Initially, this was great! My issue with Copper did not start until I closed the account to start a student banking account in June for my son & requested a refund of my wallet balance. To date and after numerous times reaching out to via their chat bot and email support, I have still not received the refund. Customer service is very difficult and disappointing. Be better off just adding a student banking account under yours & have better, more reachable customer service and online accessibility",
prolly the best banking apps for young teens,
"so far so goood, I just created my account!, my mom is trying to approve my card so I can put money on it unless it has money already on it I'm not quite sure at the moment, it's great for teens and easy to use and it's FREE 😎 I highly recommend to every teenager that's looking to get a job/in collage and in highschool!! have fun with Copper everyone 😁",
really helps teach kids about managing their money. empowers them to manage money and investments.,
(5 Star App) This is an amazing app for teens who don't know how to save their money for the future by having both you and your parent be able to keep track of the money you spend and if your spending to much of it. Sure it may seem a little embarrassing having a parent whatching your bank account but at least it would save you in the longhall by saving money instead of spending. Ps. Just give it a try its the best way to learn about the money and how to spend it only when properly saved.,
I mean it helps you know how to invest so far but it doesn't promise what I saw on the ad In tik tok,
"well I read in a review that says u nd a valid ID because banks require it,but I thought u guys state u r not a bank but financial tech co",
It has been a charm I would recommend this for your child,
Doesn't work with textnow,
It is a great way to save money as a teen.,
"it's good, I find it a little easy to use.",
My teens haven't received there debit card in the mail and it's been over a month now since I started with the company. Other than that I think that this bank app for teens is awesome. But if they don't get a card in the mail by the end of May then I'm cancelling our subscription. And we're going to another bank app for teens,
"Why does it ask for my social security number, what you gonna tell everyone what i buy with the money i get, it kinda makes no sense",
"So far, if your feeling down, I try to keep myself busy if you have no other choice but to spend something you really need in life. To save money during quarantine for college, maybe for excercising materials, saving it from a part time job and juat learning how to spend money wisely after a year stuck at home. Therefore as I teen, i just earned 5$ after signing in and taking the quiz. Really nice so far all I need is my dad to accept the invite loll. So far so good....",
Liking the app but came across a problem when I go to use copper after putting in my phone number it's a blank white screen I can't login,
copper is an easy and great banking app for teens and it lets you take quiz and once you finish it give money for taking the quiz,
Its a great app and you can get small amount of money by doing their quizzes and stuff,
i love this you get to take quizzes for money and you learn alit about saving and investing money. to be honest by yesterday i was spending money like crazy but now that i have copper banking I'm saving my money and waiting till i really need it!,
most recommended it's more useful than it looks on videos recommended for kids and teens,
"it helps so much I don't no what I would do without copper. when I first installed it, it helped me with so much",
I love this app because it helps younger people understand how to save money!,
it's really not bad you have to do lots of quiz but at least they give you money,
"Kinda sucks ngl...I had to change my bank from step to copper because my new phone can't download step. This feels like a huuuuuuge downgrade because I can't do the majority of stuff on here that step can. Step has a virtual card and physical card. Copper only has the physical card. Step allows you to withdraw, and deposit from your card or different cards. Copper doesn't. You can transfer with step, I don't think you can with copper.",
As a child I think this is one of the best banking experiences. I do I got my actual card and all I had to do Was 3 steps,
very easy way to send cash to my child and track her spending.,
It's really fun that you can get your own card and you can spend on however you want and their parents can put yours on there and you could do it to make it more fun,
Really easy to use. It's a real banking app that allows children 13 years and up use of they have a parent/guardian. If you have a child that needs a banking app where he/she can invest or save up...THIS IS THE ONE!,
BEWARE! This company locked my daughter's card after we loaded it with money. Could not use it. When I contacted support was told that they could not verify my social and that I had to upload a copy of my social security card before they would unlock my daughter's card. A bank has never made such requests. I requested that they close her account and return all funds to my checking account which is the linked account. I was told that they closed her account but that they would MAIL a check.,
"Copper card is helping me achieve my goals at a young age, with the help of my parents also. I love how this app shows me how to invest and how to save money.",
"Card doesn't work. Everywhere my son tried to use this card, he gets a ""can't read chip error"". If tries to swipe it, it says insert into chip reader, he inserts into chip reader and it says can't read chip. Useless. Trying figure out how to get our $ off this card. He tried it at numerous gas stations, grocery stores, and restaurants. No one takes this card.",
it was so easy the test was great it's a amazing app for the future,
it is a very great app. when u download it you can get free money!!,
First of all you get 5 dollars just for signing up then you can get a free card. They give you a routing and account number for direct deposit. There are other features like emailing them and making disputes on transaction that make this app absolutely amazing,
😒I couldn't even recommend it if I wanted because after finally getting the app to work(it crashes and glitches) and process my sign up I was told they can't offer me an account. I guess I'll be signing up with another bank app for my teen to use that actually works.,
"This app gets noooo stars it's awful. The customer service is awful 😖 I signed up get a welcome email then waited 3 days for verification not a few seconds like it says!! Then to be told after I emailed them that my account wasn't accepted. Asked why I wasn't accepted, they had no response. I'm glad I have green light I'll just stay with them!!!@@",
I like that the app makes making money fun. I also like to see the number go up on my card whenever I answer quizzes. I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to make easy money that is fun and helpful.,
it's a great way to find out more about money and how to save up for things!,
Bank transfers take longer than they did in the 1900s. Even after setting up and transferring money from my bank several times the transfers into Copper take several days after money has been withdrawn from my checking account. My guess is they are drawing interest on my funds for 3-4 days before deposit shows up in my Copper account. Actual experience is not standing up to reviews.,
This is a great app to use to learn how to spend and budgeting for teens. People can add money to it and track your banking. You earn money just by activating it which is awesome. I think this is a great way for teens to learn money management earlier.,
"i transferd 150 to my savings acount, it showed i did so, i had 200 on the card, i was transfering 150 to savings, and that money dissapeared! it showed that i only had 82.98 bucks left, so it took most of my money, it ticks me off, i tried getting it back but it didnt work. it was a waste of time and energy.",
I love this it will help me with being able to have money for video games and going out with my friends,
"I love this so much, I feel like I can truly control my own money for the first time :)",
This app has no customer service whatsoever! They only have text or email. And at that they will either respond saying they can't help you and pretty much tell you oh well or not respond at all! Worst app ever! Save yourself the time and energy and NOT download this app! It's pretty sad that there's apps like this that are supposed to be a helpful tool can be so shady and sketchy! I wouldn't even give this one star! More like 1000 negative stars! This app sucks!,
perfect app to start making money. I'm very impressed of this.,
Great card for Teens! cheaper than bank and atm fees.,
"My teen and I don't really like this bank amongst others a available for teens. It's alright, check it out for yourself and make your own opinion on it. Interface runs well and app never crashed while using it.",
I got a person that helped me so much I really appreciate that they took the time to help me,
"Almost IMPOSSIBLE to reach a LIVE person. Fees are to HIGH to support my kids wanting to transfer money to each others copper accounts. After trying several times to close the app, I decided to uninstall it. This was a great experiment of what NOT TO DO, now on to Cash app and bank cards.",
TERRIBLE! Closed my account after reporting fraudulent charges! I emailed CS to report a list of charges on my daughter's debit card from unheard of companies. The charges caused her a loss of over $100. She was unable to make a very important purchase due to this. They emailed me back and said because they closed the account there is nothing to that can be done. That's BS!! You mean to tell me my daughter is just out of her money????????? Someone with a resolution needs to contact me ASAP!.,
it is a good app and it is so easier to get money for teens,
It didn't give me $5 when I send it to my friend and my friends sat up a account and it didn't give us $5,
"I am using this program with my Autistic son, who wants more independence. We are loving it. Me because I can keep track of his spending, him because his card is accepted everywhere.",
this app is really helpful with controlling my money,
"we love this app, the ease and the convenience",
it's amazing because it's not a scale like other stuff,
it's very nice and teach you how to save,
"Card not working or activating. I can't even active my son's card nor will it work to make a purchase. There is money on his card, but it is stating to input another card when trying to purchase online items. Also your customer service help line is not active to call I tried activing the card for my son by calling customer service but it is a none working number.",
"It's a good app not going to lie, but ever since the new update, I can't even get into the app, it just says that there's something wrong. All it does is continue to load and load and load and it won't let me in. Fix this",
love the app thanks tiktok,
love this app!,
False advertising. We in the 20th century make 20th century apps.,
"Nice concept, but the app is a POS!! It requires me to take a selfie then the screen goes black and wipes out my ID info. FAIL!!!! Thanks for contacting me so quickly. I'll give the app another look",
it is really helpful and helps save money thanks copper,
I would say this app is good and it could have more to it but other than that it's amazing :],
it good for goal setting,
"I like the idea of giving a free 5 dollars for the quiz and sign-up. Clean and simple design that is easy to follow,, gotta love it.",
Tried to open it says hmm something went wrong ..not a good way to start.,
This is a really good app if I would have to choose it would be copper I guarantee you I'm not lying.,
They declined me an account twice. I tried reaching out to customer service and they said they couldn't confirm my info. I then asked what they needed to confirm and they said sorry we can't see that info. Whaaaattttt? I asked if there was a number or something I could call and they said no.,
"K I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, the apps great and all :/ but EVERY time I quit the app for more than like ten minutes and open it back up it forces me to create a new password because for SOME REASON it literally never remembers the new passwords I'm literally forced to make",
This app is awesome but the parent setup is frustrating. My parent can't even get through it because it keeps crashing and she has to scroll down to tap a button but it won't allow her to move the screen. I tried doing the help chat with the robot but she doesn't understand me and won't let me ask for help unless my parent has done the set up but the app won't let her. I wish there was a way to use your money without having to have the card because now I have $20 I can't even spend...,
"If I could give zero stars, I would!!! This is a scam no doubt!!! Gets stuck after you put in all your personal information and take pics of your license! I emailed like they said to do, and now they are saying I can't get an account because THEY can't verify my ID pictures?! They just stole my identity! They're probably all in a room with their faces in a computer just waiting to scam people! If you value your identity, don't fall for this....",
It's quick and easy to sign up and it takes less than 5 minutes when you get to the home screen you automatically get 3 dollars and you take a quiz that says watch and earn once you take that quick quiz you get 2 more dollars so your balance now is 5 dollars.,
For some weird reason I can't buy anything online. It did work once with Amazon but then tried ordering something else and it keeps giving me payment revision needed or it just couldn't accept my payment (I have enough money for the product),
a very easy app to manage my savings and its not the best app out there but great for parents who are trying to get started on allowance and there invest opinion when I mean not the greatest is there is no way for kids to dispute purchases no matter there age other than and there also is no option to see each individual stocks other than that its great 👍,
it's super safe and keeps your money safe for you to spend or save and it doesn't even take slot of space on your phone so yeah and it's completely free and you can earn money by just signing up.,
Lost money! Support staff reports they can see I added money to my son's account on their end but I it does not show up in his available balance. Despite multiple emails the support staff just stopped responding. Horrible.,
Me and my mom had been looking for a bank account that worked for the both of us and this is great!!!! It's perfect she gets to monitor and I get to save and invest and learn how to do it properly!!!!,
"I think this app is very reliable when it comes to the teaching aspects to teens, none of us get taught about banking in school so this app is awesome if you feel you don't know what you need to know!",
I love that it opens new opportunities to put In to your mind that you would have never thought could be achieved and now u see it as a challenge like in a game and u want to attain it like it's the in of the game reward.,
"It's a really go debit card app for teenagers like me. For making an account, you get $3 and if you take a quick quiz about saving, you get $2 In total $5.",
Everytime I try to open the app it makes my phone power off and it makes it really laggy. It only does it with this app and I constantly have to uninstall it and redownload it,
"Highly impressed. I didn't expect an app this well written so early on. It truly outperforms one of the largest banks; actually, a top 5 financial center in the United States. Keep up the fantastic work!",
An excellent way to help your teens learn to budget as well as automate the allowance process for a large family. It's a new service and they are actively soliciting user feedback and implementing new features.,
"Don't trust them! My kid overdrew the account, which isn't supposed to happen according to their deposit agreement. Then they closed the account with no notifications. Now i can't even give them the money i owe, and they won't help at all. Stay away!",
"I'm sorry, I love the app and all, but I got this app specifically because I did NOT want to invite my parents. With my parents knowledge of me having this app they still get to control my spendings. This app is a great idea, I think it defeats the purpose of ""You control your money"" with strict parents like mine.",
"Great application. Simple ,easy, safe, and puts my kid in the right direction with money. No fees and no concern from a normally concerned teenage parent . 5 stars easy.",
"No way to actually talk to someone. I've been trying to send my son money in Florida and it won't let me. There is money in my wallet to send but it keeps saying error. No true customer service to help. My son is stuck, trying to help him, but can't.",
You cannot find the cost anywhere on their website and you have to register before they tell you how much you're going to pay. I even sent a message to their customer service team and they won't tell me. That seems really shady. Not pleased at all.,
I was suppose to download this app for my school. They came in to present and this app is not trustworthy. The person presenting said they are not making money yet and never explained where they are actually getting their money from. It's not trust worthy and is a knock off of a chase mobile account. If I could rate it lower I would.,
I really like the design and the simplicity of this app. It can really help me manage my money and make goals for me. overall I recommend this to teens,
This app is good I was looking for a Way to get a bank account as a teen and this app really helped out. My card is getting Shipped out to me rn and ofc you need to have a parent to be able to do anything on the app but it let me make an account then add a parent. Unlike other apps where they say teens can have an account then teens try and can't make an account or have to wait for there parents to make it for them not this one. AMAZING APP RECOMMEND 10 OUT OF 10 😌👍,
App won't load. It's sits there waiting to load and load. I can't even use it since I can't even get the app to load. I will move on to another app. They should really fix it.,
Horrible. Can't link bank account and they have all my info. Frustrating. Unless they remove the fees on adding funds with debt cards copper will not be as good as others. We joined step as others suggested. No hidden fees like I saw on copper.,
"Tried to set up account and gave them all the correct information to verify I am who I said I was. The verification ""system"" doesn't allow retries and support can't call me to verify I am who I said I was to allow me to open an account. If they can't use another method of verification I don't how much I would trust this company to maintain my money! And now what am I supposed to do that they won't allow me a retry? They have all my information!!",
"Everytime I go to upload my driver's license it's glitchy and don't go thru, would really like to try this app for my daughter but it glitches so badly. Won't let me even get past the I'd upload",
They wont even let me sign up. I put in all the right information. All they have to say in customer support is IM SORRY THATS JUST THE WAY IT IS. so fine ill keep my money then thanks. 😊 and go else where. Is probably not all it says it is anyway.,
It's a ok app but it charges to many fees if I were u guy I would recommend step step doesn't charge any fees and always if u go to bank machine that has fees copper will not refund the fees but step refunds any fees from what ever place u may have used ur card with fees so I were u I would definitely check at step great app,
"Best bank ever. I love Copper, and so does my teen. It's easy to use, and provides freedom for both, my teen and I. It allows my teen to budget, and save. Copper provides financial stability, and awareness.",
"My daughter loves it. She was so excited to NFC when she forgot her card at home. Still getting use to it but so far, no complaints. Took some time to get use to it, we came from busy kid.",
"Cool app for parents. After enrolling your kids, it's a breeze to transfer money for the thousand reasons they ask for money. Or you can setup a scheduled transfer so it's hands-off for things like doing chores etc. It also gives you visibility into what your teen is spending the money on which can help determine if they understand responsible spending and such.",
"Slightly bad. There is one element that almost every user of this app hates. And that's the fact that you can't use your debit card UNTIL you either get permission, or you use another device. But I do understand why this ""ask your parents"" thing exists. It was done to stop kids from using debit cards without their parents' permission. You also can't ask multiple people if you didn't copy the ""can you please unlock my debit card"" message, because it just says your card is waiting.",
Great app for me and my family! :) I have saved so much money with Copper and it's easy to spend and transfer money between family members.,
it's a good way to learn,
I really like copper and it is fun for me to earn money.,
There was a lot of info needed but so far it works great,
very good app👍👍,
They don't pay you for your referrals. Ive emailed over an over an get absolutely no were. Its ridiculous every person ive referred has not gotten paid n neither have i!! Customer support dnt answer nor fix the issue,
It is just so good how I as a As a team get a debit card and get to user and get money it's just so good how it gets even using on shopping apps online apps anything and it's so good to using it so easy you guys need to download it for your kids or Teen,
Everytime I try to sign up it would just say oops something went wrong and then when I actually got in it didn't work whatsoever,
im loving copper because it's fast and help you and i really like to answer stuff,
it is AMAZING for teens. super easy to understand and they have explanation videos that help sooo much!! would DEFINITELY recommend to other teens!!!,
"A person attended my school , convinced us all to get the app and sent us all 15$ we have yet to receive anything because the app is terrible and it verification system is rudimentary at best I would not advise you to get this",
Horrible!!! My daughter's first paycheck took 6 days to transfer from my bank then she uses her card this morning and the enter account is deactivated with just 2 emails nothing else no other attempts to contact me then I try to contact you and our says we can only by email and it can take days to get back to me. What a mess,
"haven't gotten a debit card yet, kinda don't like parents gotta help set that part up, but this is meant for younger kids I guess. It's somewhat slow to open on my phone, but otherwise it works really well. Does anyone know if you don't have a physical card you can still order things online?",
It good and already helping me reach my goal as a teenager.,
"it is very easy to use and simple to start using it, you can even get money from it by going to their Instagram or taking quizzes 😀",
"So far Copper works well. I haven't been met with any bugs or problems. However, I wish you could cash checks directly into your account.",
This has been a great card for my daughter and they keep adding more features. I definitely recommend the copper card.,
this is a good app and gives you free money for answering the right ones,
I haven't been very good at saving money and this app will help me Learn to manage money and budget well. I cannot wait to start using this app to help me keep track of my spending.,
Tried to be added as a parent on my sister's account and couldn't get anywhere because I couldn't be added. Hoping I don't lose my money!!!,
"Perfect. Just what I need to get my 14 yr independent and able to spend her bday money. Free transfers of money in for parent, takes about 3 days to do it at no cost. Coupled with an Amazon teen account we are all set",
"super cool for earning money! not recommended for free money. As a tee,n who can use extra cash, the quizzes are not that hard!",
they are the best they are real and they help you save,
"Doesn't have any options for preferred name or ""true name"" for anyone transgender, non binary, or anyone who happens to go by a different name. It's not inclusive whatsoever.",
App is stupid. When I tried to verify my account it started the process all over. Could never set up an account,
cool and esey for kids to save thare own money,
I love it. I helped me set up a goal to save money for. then it gave me a starting $2 after I set up my goal.,
Im a teen and this is the first card ive ever used and it works amazingly. Your parents can easily send you money while your card is locked and it gives you $10 for your first purchase!,
i love it so much it gives you 2 dollars if you take a quiz,
"Copper is the poorest excuse for a bank I've ever heard of. Someone from the customer support department told my son that they had messaged me about the account, I received no notification and when I went to login they had closed the account along with all of the sub accounts. With no explanation no email nothing. I highly suggest that if you're looking for a team Bank look at step. Or any of the other ones out there because copper is useless.",
It is a good app and it has great potential but I think that more than one guardian should be able to be connected to it to send or receive money.,
It doesn't get my address and keeps telling me there is an error customer service is very useless it doesn't tell me how to fix the problem.,
This is a great starting app for a cage,
"Its a great way for teens like me to learn about saving,earning, and spending. Its awesome and very easy",
great tool to use to manage your money and put it to work for yourself.,
it's amazing I already got 2$ by taking a lil test thingy,
This is the best app ever thanks so much,
it's good me got 2 free bucks,
#1 teen banking app recommended by my family,
good app making money,
it's a great app,
"I was gonna sign up, but after I viewed all the NEGATIVES over the positives. I rather be safe and get a bank card instead of this app.",
Seems to work have yet to receive my coinout bonus for signing up. Support replys talking about someone else's issues... Real professional,
This app is the worst banking app to ever exist I've been trying to add my mom's phone number to get my debit card and it's saying to add a Child go to invite and select my child whenever I've been adding MY MOMS number I've been trying to get it to work for 3 hours,
"Great way to pay kids allowance and send money in emergencies, but the fees to load money into the parent account are a little steep.",
really great banking app for teens.100 percent recommend,
it's amazing and really easy !!,
It works fine and is easy to use,
It's great I just don't like the parental signup,
I dont know how to start to make money but if I am able to get a physical card then I can add and stuff to it,
I really think it's a good app for kids to save,
I love copper banking they gave me $2 to start saving for 10000 for a phone and gaming pc! they also don't make me be 18 for a card,
copper is such a great use for me im a 13 year old teen and love spending money but with copper I get to save money for things I want get copper today its amazing 👏 ☺,

great app for kids and teens,
I actually earned 2 dollars doing a stupid simple quiz this is dope,
great way for teens to get the things they need,
it seems great and good for teens,
I love it! I just don't like the fact that your parents HAVE to sign up for you to get a debit card 😑,
cool site runs smooth helps make money,
it is good so far and hop to learn more about the app,
great apps and now I have a place to really see my goal,
I get money for doing stuff in the app and on the first day I got $2,
"just downloaded, not bad so far for a teen like myself trying to save",

"I just LOVE it! This may not be helpful but as a child a.k.a teen that has a LONG wishlist of things I want, Copper is the way😩💞👍",
Haven't used it a lot but the time I have was real easy to use. No bugs or crashes thus far. 5 ⭐,
"I like the app , but everytime I try to use or link my card it declines it ..says adviser declined it or it says it cant find my card when all my info is right",
Keep freezing at get started screen. Sent the invite but it keeps saying try again later. What am I doing wrong,
It is amazing I can get money for myself and not have to ask my parents,
it's perfect for teens,
Does not allow adding child accounts unless child has an active cell phone number on a cell carrier. Please add an option for using an email or other child registration method.,
"I uninstalled the app. I created my own account, then my son's, and then learned they wont accept his google voice number. But they took it for the invitation I had to send him. Misleading and I have to trust who I do business with.",
Copper is really a great way to start teaching your kids how to manage their own money. You can keep track of their spending and if you choose have set deposits directly into their account. I highly recommend this to anyone who would like to teach their teens how to keep track of earnings.,
"I want to use it more don't get me wrong, but I had an account and when I went into it the next day it logged me out and now I can't find a log in button so I can't get in. If there's a way please tell me, Thanks",
"copper is a good way for you to save and have a secure place for you money, which helps me a lot . I miss place my cash a lot and just last week I lost $20 in my room so I cleaned my room and looked everywhere and can to find it was in my pocket the whole time. so no more loseing money",
very helpful and resourceful. also teaches you a thing or two about what a debit card is.,
this app is soo good if u sing up it gives u 3 dollar just for signing up and it only takes u 2 minutes to sing up and if u take a quick quiz it give u 2 dollars and u start investing.,
it's helping our teen family members to learn to manage their own money.,
You cant use a VoIP number yet when this is fixed i will change my rating (a VoIP number is a number that uses the Internet instead of a service provider),
"app is good to learn how to spend money and is generally a great banking app, your parents won't have to pay a subscription fee",
The app worked smoothly and did what I needed it to do. This is a great way to help with financial planning and money management for teens.,
so far it's good. idk tho.,
it's cool I just can't wait to get a certain someone a present,
best app ever,
this is a really good idea,
Bought something on eBay and somehow went on my account off here but my accounts closed can't even contact them to figure out anything,
Love this app great for teens!,
It keeps on telling me it is creating my accounts but won't change screen. I just joined and Ican't even use it.,
Finally convinced my mom to install it and she loads on and it's all glitchy with a black and purple screen that you can't get off even when you restart the app,
Horrible costumer service they do not allow you to apply for a card after putting your personal information down I dont not recommended you guys use this app at all.,
Don't keep their word.. I signed up thru coinout and I was surprised at how ridiculous it is to try and get the bonuses they promised me. Neither coinout not copper will take responsibility for the mistake and neither one will fix it either. It's been months. They also ripped my kid off for $20 of our own money. Can't be trusted!,
Handy service to help teens learn to budget. The app is very feature rich.,
It's an amazing app for younger people to understand how to start saving money,
Great starter banking for teens. Love how I can monitor my child's spending and send money to her directly in seconds!,
It was a 4 star app at first but then it messed the app up and literally I can't get back on anything and it won't let me access my card,
When u first join it puts you on a waiting list and ut doesn't actually come out till mid-2020 so right know its a waste of space download it when its actually active.,
New.added 2 kids. BUT :-< I cannot add my cash app card. Or cannot add my western union netspend card affiliate with Meta Bank? Help. My kids are so excited to start using there card and waiting patiently for them 2 card to come in Mail. This was easy to set up for kids and myself. Really need this to work.,
it's so amazing they give you free money when you start and it helped you save till you get to your goal I love Cooper,
just got the app. within the first 2 min I already earned $5 for taking a survey and signing up.,
"it's a good bank for teens, I just got on and it's so awesome and easy! you should try it out.",
this is actually pretty helpful and exciting,
"Works relatively well, customer service can take a while tho which is a problem for a banking app.",
I like how it allows your kids to have a way to save money,
I feel like it's a great app because it also gives you question just to make sure what you know about saving up money!,
Thank you for the owner that made this app it really helps me a lot with saving money and my goal for that money.,
"I am a teen and within the first couple minutes it was easy, you could even earn money on the app.",
It's awesome. I just had $0 on Copper and then I did a quiz and set my goal and now I have $2,
Love it amazing app easy to use an easy to learn gives you insight on how to better save money an invest money,
I never received the coinout bonus for signing up. Lame I did Reach out they sent some Bullcrap & then stopped responding.,
it's amazing,
like it is so good to you for teens,
A great app to teach financing and saving to kids in a fun and easy way.,
"This app sucks. Before downloading, read this. This app asks you normal questions, like Age, name, email, and phone number. But something that isn't a normal question is it asks what school do you go to. I think it makes it extremely unsafe letting random people knowing where your school is, and letting them know your bank account. I wouldn't buy.",
"As far as I know, this is great! It even gave me a little quiz and I learned more than I usually do in school haha!",
"This is app is nice, it does have some requirements that are not fully supporting financial freedom which is why I'm giving it 4-stars.",
I can't even open the app. I've already tried to uninstall and reinstall and it still won't open.,
super good app for kids,
its a nice app to help you learn how to save,
This app let my 14-year-old daughter overdraw and his not sent out any type of debit card for my child which is one of the reasons that we wanted the app I tried to contact customer service about this only to be told that my daughter has to request a card from her phone that I cannot do that for her she is still unable to receive a card,
"Could not add funds to my wallet, attempted same steps many times and kept giving me errors.",
Seems like a decent but limited app. What I cannot stand is it takes over 7 days to fund any transactions from my bank. You can only setup allowance payments from bank accounts not from my parent copper balance... So my kids get their weekly allowance a week later when it finally goes through. Meh.,
It's a good app over all I prefer to make copper cards atm approved because we are not able to deposit or withdraw,
best app ever got $1.00 for logging in and $2 for completing a quick and easy quick ❤️❤️,
"so far I'm in love with this app because they give you free money, and it easy to sign up I'm hopping that it will be like this more in the future.",
"I really like this app even my mom and sister plan on using this app and I actually like that you can earn money by doing ""quests"" like a little game",
"So frustrating, I went through the process including transferring money in only to find out a telephone number is required for your child.",
Won't open :(( I just installed the app and it won't open at all.,
"Inspirational, very helpful and helps you Guide for a better future.",
"easy to use, good way to learn about saving and budgeting",
Customer Support is not great. They didn't even help me with a refund issue.,
"I like it (so far...)! There are easy ways to make money, and over all, ITS FREE!!",
it's really good and it gives me little money at a time so we just keep working for it with quizzes,
This app sucks it just throws you in with no directions at all and this app will be the reason I lose my mind I was honestly having a good day until I found this app,
pretty good and gives out useful information on savings and is well organized,
i like it...it helps me earn money fast though sometimes I do get confused on things but overall it is pretty good,
"totally awesome, great for kids that's for sure, and so easy to sign you for",
Its really nice and it feels like as if you're playing a little mobile game inside of an online banking system,
Better than expected by simply making an account I got 3 dollars and by learning to save u got 2 more and some knowledge I think once I know more ima get me a copper card but for now It's the best I've seen for my age range.,
"I like it, however I plan on using cash app for their card as you can send/receive money from other users.",
I love how official this app is it's built for teens and adults you can save your money and you can buy stocks and I like to do that as I'm trying to create a business one day and if it becomes international I have this app to thank.,
Cannot take pics and send them. Need to capture ID. PLEASE FIX!!!,
"I wouldn't use, wanted my user name and password for my banking account, to much info to give out to a app or scam",
I really like this app for the main reason that it teaches you about money and all the good juicy stuff school doesn't.,
copper allows me to spend my money well so I don't spend it on wasteful things. it's a good app.,
It wouldn't let me use the textnow number that I have and I was getting the app to get the money to buy the phone card,
really good app just take one little quiz and reach 2 dollars out of the blue.,
It's really easy. I recommend it to any Teens that want to earn money for their stuff!!,

"Great investing app for teens, but how can we continue if your parents don't agree to do it but you want to do it.",

it is good to save and for teens I love it you can invest and you can get a card too,
It gives you free money when u first get it for setting up goals and answering goal questions.,
"Changed rating since I finally got the app to start working, you need to make sure you're child has their own phone before you can use the card, this is not specifically stated and I waited several weeks for the card to arrive and several weeks for support to tell me he needed a phone.",

I love this app if u take the free quiz u get free money like what I think everyone should have copper it's a great app,
Error's out all the time and you need to re-install to use the app.,
"Poor customer support, spammy push notifications, lack of control over your own child's finances - they give them more rights than they give you. Investment product is also very lame, forces you into their own (weak) mutual fund ideas, can't select more specific or conservative strategies.",
This is cool. It's a great way for young adults to learn how to save money and finance for their own future.,

It was great to have both my highschool kids come home from school and different days and spout the same stuff. Great brainwashing. Why not tell them the truth about the five dollars why tell them it is free?,
very good earned two dollars just to do a quiz,
it's a great app to use all the time almost anywhere,
"Kept saying ""oops something went wrong"" It just doesnt seem like the app is up to par",

"I personally like this since you can earn money, so its good in my view.",
"I'm a parent and I gotta say, this app is a must have to teach kids about money while they bank. I wish I would've had this when I was a teenager. I would've been much more prepared for the world. Copper is not just a bank, they educate their users to become smarter with money. I know a lot of adults that could use this lol. This is a no brainer. Get Copper for your kids and prepare them for when they leave the nest.",
very great for kids and teens,
This is a scam for sure a money trap they don't allow access to your money at all less through them if you ain't got a kid and cell phone you can't even order your card they hold money hostage didn't even get the promo award double burn I pray to god you didn't send more than the ten dollar cause one they ain't a bank they are agent read the deposit agreement wish I did before hand bottom line. Don't use forget you saw it and more along they have nerve call it a interest bearing account o.ooapy,
