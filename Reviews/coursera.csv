Review Text,Category
"Until recently I have had no problems with the app, however the newest update has caused a large down tick in my productivity. The modules no longer continue automatically, you can no longer take practice exams or assignments on Mobile, and the transcript jumps back to the middle anytime you try to scroll down to the bottom. Please fix this Coursera.",
"Your new app update is not intuitive and less visually appealing than it was before. I am frustrated that I can't take a multiple choice exam on my app, but can it be on a laptop bc it was designed for a larger screen? You have the ability to make it fit phones as well. You guys pride and sell yourself on being able to learn wherever at your own convenience. Having to relocate to a computer to take a multiple choice test when it could fit on the phone isn't convenient at all.",
"A lot of courses have content that doesn't work on mobile, even a large screen. The instructors are fine and that's why this is 2 stars instead of 1. The support is unresponsive (they closed my issue without doing ANYTHING). It's really bad taste to send a survey for how my support experience went after never contacting me about it. I think Coursera is being incredibly cheap and it's not worth it anymore.",
"For both the app and the pc version, I continuously lose progress. I've emailed for help three times now without a single response. I would complete a week, go back to finish up the next week and the previous week's work is gone without explanation. Right now I am somehow on week three of my course, but all grades from weeks one and two are mysteriously missing. I've had to start over already completed work several times now and it is getting really frustrating.",
"Coursera is the worst, do not recommend! I was charged multiple times even though i tried to cancel my account. They offer a free trial, then sneak in payments without notifying you. Most free trials work like this: you get a notification before youre charged. Not only that, but the class i took (for 1 hour) was so unbelievably basic and low level. Definitely not worth paying for. I am now out $150 for a course that i studied for less than an hour. Avoid coursera AT ALL COSTS.",
"Requires a computer for assignments because they're ""designed for a larger screen"". So I have to open the browser (on my Samsung Fold) to Coursera, copy the assignment link and paste into a new tab, otherwise it just opens the Coursera app again, then request the desktop version in the browser menu, and everything works fine. It's a hassle, but there's a workaround.",
"I have a zfold 4 my screen is plenty big to be watching video lectures and see diagrams but the app won't let me access some material on mobile. Why even have an app if you won't allow the content to be completed on mobile? I even clicked the ""try anyway"" button and it just gave me another message telling me I can't access this content. I want to wake up and do a few lessons in bed before getting up, as well as use during commutes & unexpected downtime. PC requirement makes this app useless.",
"This is a very nice app, that allows to do almost everything one needs to do in order to complete a Coursera course (with the exception of writing, submitting and peer grading peer-graded assignments). There are a few bugs though, that seem to be easy to fix, yet are infuriatingly annoying, because they pop their ugly heads every single time one opens the app. The first one is that once you open an app, it keeps refreshing a couple of times, and you can't do anything until it's done, because no matter what you do, it will bring you back to the main screen. The other one is that videos you've watched do not appear as completed until after you've reset and restarted the app. The third one is that progress within a video is not retained across app restarts. If you fix just these 3 issues, it's a 5-star app.",
"Following my course was made smooth sailing thanks to this app. Only problems that I had was that the Android version doesn't sync immediately if I were to continue the course on another device. It can get frustrating if you don't remember the last video you watched. Another is that the app doesn't keep track of how long you watched a video, only if you completed it or not. I can watch 14 minutes of a 20 minute video, quit, and then come back to have the timer start back at zero. I did love the video quality, though.",
"So far, it's an easy experience. The app is easy to navigate, and the lessons are a cool ""at your own pace"" style. The biggest issue I have is not everything (especially tests/quizzes) is viewable on tablets or phones. Not everyone has access to computers these days, as portable devices are what people prefer. It'd be really cool if the app got an update to support small screen viewing on everything the app has to offer.",
"The app seems to serve its overall purpose. Due to the app being developed for a mobile device, there is a perception that you are privileged to always have internet access. If that is the case what is the point of having a feature for you to download course material for usage OFFLINE when you are at a location with no internet access, and you can't log in. This was my motivation for the install, to use it during my 70 mins train commute. Please fix, it worked and now it doesn't, very annoying.",
"I loved this app, but the last update has made it hard to use. I have ADHD so watching a video/reading alone can be difficult. The feature i loved the most was the highlighting of the transcript along with the video, and being able to jump to different parts by tapping the text. Now, that doesn't work at all. It doesn't allow me to highlight to save notes. And I can't focus on the course for the life of me.",
"Half baked. My biggest problem with this platform is it doesn't track your progress very well. And it doesnt seem to sync with the website. Example: I'm doing a course that has 7 parts, the first part is complete I have the certificate.. it shows on the website but the mobile app wants me to enroll?! Other times I'm 90% finished with part of the course, but when I return the progress is gone. I like the courses but I hate the platform and UX.",
"The app has its uses, but there are many times you're prevented from seeing a grade or assignment because ""it's designed for a larger screen."" But if you uninstall the app (or the webpage will just open it again) and go through the web page it works - on the same screen. This is EXTREMELY annoying when I'm traveling and don't have a larger screen available. Make the app open things and let THE STUDENT decide if they need a larger screen.",
"This app is horrible. The video player does not work at all. Half the time it will only play audio. The other half of the time the video will stop playing and start buffering several times in the middle of the video, even if I've fully downloaded the video. I then have to ""go back 10 seconds"" to fix the issue. I have 1 Gb/s Internet speed, so it's definitely not that. What am I paying to use this platform for when competitors like Udemy exist and have working video players?",
"Any application is expected to have some bugs. However, bugs that hinder learning in a learning app should be high on Coursera's list to fix. Yet, two very simple bugs have remained unfixed for the several months I've been using this app. The #1 thing that would get a 4-star rating from me: the ability to set ""no subtitles."" Frequently the subtitles occlude what the teacher writes, and I have no way to turn them off. To get 5 stars, I want the watched/casted videos to consistently check off as ""complete"" in the list of videos when they finish. Right now, they do not, and there is no option to manually set them as ""watched."" Thus, you can lose track of your place, and waste time trying to find it. Those two bugs annoyed me throughout the DL Specialization because they hindered learning. In case it helps the developers, my primary way of watching the videos was to cast from my Pixel 3 to the living room TV.",
"Cousera is amazing, however, this app needs to have some bugs fixed. Certain videos have questions in the middle of the video, but once the video pauses it's a struggle to get it to play again. Once you pause the video, playing the video again is a big hassle. Even though u press the play button it'll automatically pause by itself. Not a very smooth experience unfortunately.",
"Just to be clear: this review is for the coursera APP, not the coursera courses themselves. The courses are great. The app is terrible. The lesson never starts without a ""whoops, restart the player"" message, with no explanation why the player won't work. Then if I do get lucky and the player works, the video ends up freezing 30 seconds into it. I like courseras programs, but I can't do them away from my computer because of these problems",
"Very slow, videos can't play properly, and courses are not at all optimized for mobile, so they are full of bugs that crash videos and prevent tasks from being completed. Excellent on a computer. Complete trash on a phone as no effort was made to adapt anything to mobile. Portrait and landscape flips crash the app. Searching for classes crashes the app. Looking sideways at your phone crashes the app.",
"Previously five, had to bump it to four. I don't know what happened but learning between app and browser would mess up the progress I made between the two. For example, I completed two lessons for the week of a course I took in the browser. When it was time to continue on a lunch break -within the same course- nothing was completed. Incomplete quizzes, watch time reset, and past weeks undone. I would have to redo everything. Logging out and back in doesn't update my progress back to normalüßê",
"App itself its alright, two main things I highly dislike The fact newcomers are able to jump to any module in a set course, makes the content that u experience just to repeat itself for about three lessons in a row. Second, some of the text is small in the PowerPoints, and the only way to zoom (keep in mind you are still fullscreen) is using accessibility tools on your phone. There should be a zoom feature to see the text better.",
"Got a free trial, only to not be allowed to take courses unless I cancel the trail pay 39$ a month and $150 for each class. Why advertise free certification if it's not free? Won't give me the option to cancel. Followed the steps, and still won't let me cancel the 7 day trail until I pay the monthly fee!!! I have to wait to be charged so I can hopefully get a refund. What a waste of time. Scammers.",
"Although I've been enjoying the courses and assignments, the app itself is pretty terrible. I usually have to refresh several times to find the class and then after watching the videos, the app doesn't register that I've watched them. Additionally, I can't see my graded/reviewed work or review my peers' work on the app- I have to go to a computer to do that. Since I don't have easy access to a computer (only tablets and phones), I feel uncertain about whether I want to take more courses.",
"This app is phenomenal. Who needs to pay to learn something when you can do it for free? If you do pay you're paying for a certification/degree. I love the app and I'm sure it will end up saving me time and money. One thing I wish you could add though is like a ""For Later"" playlist so I can keep track of courses without enrolling in them right away. Amazing app.",
"The app is ok, but there are a few improvements to the UI that I think would greatly improve the overall expreince. First, there should be a ""Add Note"" button while watching videos. The button exist in the web version, but not the mobile app. Second, the ""Learning Log"" should be better integrated for mobile. Third, there should be an option to watch videos picture in picture, or just not in full screen on mobile. Desktop is fine, mobile needs work.",
"The courses are extremely limited. The video quality is awful (extremely glitchy), and the controls are as well (just had a video get stuck on mute). You also can't do the quizzes unless you pay, but they don't tell you until after you finish the quiz. And you also can't mark the course as complete unless you pay, so if you continue, you end up having to sort through and remember which ones you've completed. Or you can delete them and probably them all mixed up when looking for similar courses.",
"I don't think this app is properly optimized for tablets because the experience is not good. The discussion prompt box where your response is supposed to be typed in is very glitchy and difficult to use. Also the video player is too zoomed in when watching lectures, resulting in cutoffs of definitions and important figures in the video. Hopefully these errors can be resolved in future updates. (using Samsung Galaxy Tab S3)",
"Mixed opinions about this app. LOVE the website and the courses they offer! Fabulous! however, it doesn't play nice on my tablet. For example, on my tablet important content is often OFF the page, it doesn't allow me to take ""nice"" notes and frequently rests to some other note or won't save. As well, it is super slow even with an excellent internet connection. I prefer the online experience but OH so wish the app functioned better so I could use it away from my computer too.",
"This app really missing some features like being able to hightlight / make a note in the lesson and being able to rotate the screen in any direction, you are locked to watching a full screen video ONE WAY! The quiz and test screen could be better, they're trying to be facncy but it's TERRIBLE! Keep it simple, all the questions in ONE page!",
"It's true that Coursera is the best online platform; however, my review includes only the application. sometimes it lags, and most significantly it requires you to open your computer because there are some functions that may not work smoothly on the phone. I hope that you make your app as independent and fully dependable as possible.",
"While it has some very useful features like downloading courses. It also has issues with how it frames the videos. These cut off important buttons sometimes along with other issues. However given the usefulness of Coursera in general, I'm willing to overlook these flaws for the convenience of being able to take a part of class anywhere.",
"I used to use this fairly regularly when it was all free. I was disappointed to log back in after a while and find that most courses require payment now. I guess I understand it since these are very high quality classes, but for someone who is just learning for fun, I'm now much more inclined to just do some google searches instead. Good app if you have real set goals for learning though, and I am glad they've allowed continued free access to the courses I'd already enrolled in.",
"Ok for watching videos. There is a bug which results in the reading after a video being automatically marked as ""complete"" just by being open (when autoplay is on). It would be great to allow to mark a reading or exercise back as ""non complete"" because it is confusing this way what I read and what I didn't, but only opened.",
"They tout many of the courses as being completable as quickly as you can work, and say the faster you finish the less it will cost as it's billed monthly. But if you push through too fast, they push back the start date for the next course in the series, ensuring they'll keep getting their money if you want to finish, while keeping you from studying for weeks. Between the false advertising and deceptive practices, it feels less like education, and more like a cash grab.",
"Best learning app ever! While I have only audited the classes I have learned so much! Rock History taught me so much about my own city and how it played a part in Music history along with the class I took on Patrick Henry which was SO enlightening. I have so much fun on this app, taking the best classes from top universities and learning so many new things. I only wish I had the money to access all the things students can do. One day! My wish for XMas, really!",
"I really wish I could give this app a higher rating. Pros -Good in a pinch if you have no other options to work on lessons. Cons -Automatically marks sections as completed even if you have not finished them, making it confusing to figure out where you left off. -Type is very small and thin in text sections with bright white background and hard to read. -No support options for students with learning disabilities. (Same for the phone apps and website.) -Poor customer support.",
"Extremely buggy site. Some quizzes frequently display overlapping text and quiz elements making it impossible to complete them. Sometimes the quizzes don't even load, essentially wasting your attempt to take the quiz unless you log in on a PC before time expires. On top of that, some of my enrolled courses are not showing up, leading to me having to search for them individually to resume them. And some of the courses I have finished don't say so when highlighted (still says ""enroll now"").",
It's ok but the video player is terrible. I just updated it and the control options keeps on overlapping the screen without coming off. Also when you press on a word in transcript it doesn't start on the exact sentence you press. How are people supposed to learn if they keep messing up the updates that effects the way the content is given?,
"I really like using this app on my commute and will likely continue to do so but there are some basic functionalities that are damn annoying. the biggest issue is that when I'm watching downloaded lectures the app never updates the website. I have to search through videos to see where I left off. second issue is that if i don't have the screen on, the video will randomly pause.",
"Love the platform, but the app is a bit frustrating, esp. the video player -- keeps stopping when out of focus on Android Pie. Also, it does not remember my place in the video at any time, which can be irritating. Also, it would be better UX to allow a toggle for completing the readings, and optional homework.",
"General use and setup is fine, but if the module has a quiz it absolutely falls apart terribly. The quiz texts literally disappears most of the time making it almost impossible to complete. You have to page back and forth to read the text between pages before it disappears in order to complete quizzes which is quite frustrating.",
"The pages on the app aren't formatting correctly. The audios are way at the bottom, the text sometimes are in logical order, and sometimes all mixed up. Also, the course material on the app is sometimes different from the website on a pc or even on mobile chrome/ browsers. It's like a different course, or a first draft that never got updated and synced to the final copy. Please fix this! :(",
"Love Coursera, don't love this app! Trying to type into any text boxes (e.g. discussion prompts or assignments) makes your text come out backwards and you can't backspace. I've been having to type it in my phone's Notes app and then copy/paste into Coursera. Also, not possible to take notes on videos like you can in the desktop app. Much better to just access your courses on the computer.",
"Course lives up to its name: truely professional. The course materials are all encompassing and the trainers are outstanding. Also caters and adapts to every form of learning style from video lectures, write ups, hands on activities and projects and so much more. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would. Its really superb!",
Great app to gain knowledge from free courses and paid courses. Only downside is the videos in the course when playing it if we open it next time it should resume from the last played point instead of beginning from the start. Sometimes the certificate doesn't show after completion I have to relog each time to get it in the achievement page. Few bugs here and there . Now after the update the app crashes more always not responding and it starts from other lectures rather than which I'm taking now,
"A very wonderful application for sure! But the latest update forces subtitles within the video even without magnifying the screen, please fix this malfunction quickly, thanks! (*Comment on the new update: I don't want any subtitles within the video! Please solve this problem and make the application more flexible and options.. Thanks a lot for your marvellous job and efforts!) ü§©ü§©ü§ùüèº",
"Dear team, it is a wonderful experience studying on Coursera,I'd say a side gig for students who want to explore the basic of each subject or a topic. At the beginning I had problems like the pause option during the video which is so frustrating when it doesn't hide and also the transcript which was always in a hurry, lol But the recent update has made it disappeare and splindid work team. Good day ahead üòÑ",
"The Android app allows me to do practically everything the website has, with the added bonus that I can download all my classes to my SD Card and have it at the tip of my fingers no matter where I currently am while still saving space on my phone memory. The only downside so far is that it doesn't let me make annotations on videos. The website allows this, but not on written materials. Anyway, thank you so much for making my studying so accessible <3",
"Bring back the old video player please. The subtitles are not playing together with the video, the double click forward/backward is no longer working, the loading before a video starts playing and my nav bar is not disappearing in full screen mode. I am using Samsung Galaxy S9 plus.",
"The platform that's change my life and by doing more courses and learning more courses it keeps on changing it more in a good way. Thanks to coursera for providing us such a range of courses and all other course providers, thanks to them as well.",
the subtitle/transcript is no longer in sync ‚Äî it doesn't allow you scroll to what is said. It keeps revert back to the top. The year is 2023! Someone cannot add a course to wishlist or favourite it for later. Think please!,
"Please bring back the ""downloaded"" view or equivalent :) I use this feature a lot where I can see all my downloaded videos courses. Very useful when on the plane or subway with no internet coverage instead of trying to see which one I remembered to download. Rating only 1 star to hopefully get this review triaged faster. Otherwise super fan of Coursera and the app : 5 ‚≠ê",
"course difficulty if language is not chinese. testing questions level are often higher than for beginners, as subject matter included is not always covered. when attempting testing retrials previous correct answers are marked as incorrect. Generally not satisfied after one month. Would have rather had audio selection available for more languages rather than having to read lesson discussions while following video lessons. Though I passed the thirty day period, it was better for me to cancel.",
"It has been an amazing experience using the app. It is seamless and even the details that I never come across on the web version, I saw them, such like the scorecard and summary of each lessons.",
"After the recent update, the app for my tablet has become quite problematic. I can't maximize the screen anymore; it persistently displays the status bar at the bottom. Furthermore, the double-tap feature for fast-forwarding and rewinding isn't working either. ""enhanced video player experience?"" No it became worse than ever.",
"It's a great app but I have one issue with the app which is, while watching a course when you pause the video you can't tap on the screen to remove the paused icon or the faint overlay and that makes seeing things a bit difficult while you pause a course. I have issues with that on coding courses. I hope something should be done about that to increase user experience.",
"Both the app and the website are not working properly, I can't edit the SQL query of my graded course. ü•≤ I failed in that test. Please, solve these major problems. I'm enrolled in Google Data Analytics. I can't edit it (the SQL queries) on Laptop (can't even select it) and on phone the text turns out become horrible and which you can't even delete. ü•≤",
"Everything was working fine, but today I got the message:"" No Connection. Please check your connection and try again later"" . First I cleaned the cache. Then I erased the data. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing works. My connection is perfect. Both 5g and wifi. Everything works on my phone except this app. I also have udemy and it works perfectly . I'm using Moto G stylus android 11. Please fix this.",
"Latest update broke a ton of features, and I consistently and annoyingly get ""No Connection"" error trying to access my classes. I can browse through the whole catalog and access the Internet using other apps, so it's not my issues I'm facing.",
"The app itself isn't bad. The problem is the scummy nature of the business model. They will try to double charge you for a course certificate you have already paid for, or will continue charging after cancelling a subscription. There is horrible ""customer service"" - no phone number, no complaints process, and will take days to get back with a ""tough luck"" response via email. Will be opening a consumer law violation complaint with ACCC if the issue is not resolved.",
Great improvements to the user experience. Especially the text enlargement slide on the transcript. And the new orientation of the video. I hope the text enlargement can be replicated on the readings pages.,
Overall it is very good app but since last update there is one bug which is quite annoying. When we reach the last paragraph of the transcript whenever the tutor spoke the highlighted line then transcript automatically scroll up & move to other paragraph of transcript. I have to go again again to last paragraph. This happens when we use in phone in vertical position means half video & half transcript. Please fix this issue.,
"The app is convienent at times, however, I myself tend to use the Coursera: Learn career skills in the ChromeOS browser. I like that environment and experience on more than average of the time that I am on the education platforms. I will always choose Course:Learn career skills to recommend to my colleagues, or network square.",
"while i love the experience, sometimes either because of the course maker or the app itself - everything is glitchy. the content is nice and simple, but the assignments are very amateurish and the certification provided at the end has no value because of this lack of challenge - you better off with a dipoma.",
"I'm thrilled to give Courseera a resounding five stars! The wealth of knowledge I've gained here is truly remarkable. The courses I completed have not only broadened my horizons but also equipped me with practical skills that I can immediately apply. The engaging content, expert instructors, and user-friendly platform made learning a joy. Thank you, Courseera, for being my go-to destination for meaningful learning experiences!",
"Can't switch my course to English even though it was originally created in English. There clearly exists an English version, all the videos are in english, the UI is in English, the transcripts have an English version. But all the written lessons are in French. This is a massive bummer.",
"Coursera is a great supplement to YouTube university. The courses are well organized, and it's nice to earn certificates. I'm enjoying the Google IT support courses, and I'm learning programming as well. This is so much better than college. for my Associates degree I was forced to take a bunch of useless filler classes that had nothing to do with my major. 3.76 gpa, honor roll, dean's list, and huge waste of time. Traditional education is a corrupt, broken, scam.",
"What the hell happened to Coursera? Just logged in for the first time in awhile & the app is unrecognizeable. It's mostly certificates & degree courses, where are all the free courses? I only see about 12 on the app. It also seems the diversity is gone, most courses are computer science & data anylysis oriented. Coursera used to have hundreds if not thousands of courses, all free, where have they all gone? Also there is apparently no way to see courses you have completed anymore, frustrating!",
"Nice app that works well. Sometimes, the % of course completion is not updated immediately, which is somewhat disturbing. However, overall, it is a decent app.",
"I have experienced amazingly. More than easy interface than website for videos and readings only. But it have quiz and labs interface problems. Please make and allow all quiz and labs for app also. Overall, the experience in app is great. Thank You.",
"Please remove subtitles within the video. We have the full course in the moving text below the video and that is sufficient. Further, improve the video and text movement. Somethime the end of the paragraph does not come up when the related audio is being recited.",
"I could have full bars on both wifi and 5G cellular and the videos still wouldn't work. No other app does this (literally just tested this on Udemy and Coursea in the browser), incredible! It is updated, the cache is cleared, & phone is restarted/updated.",
"They've been double charging my fiance since he signed up. He's using coursera plus to take the google IT course for 3 months. You advertise that its a flat rate of $50, but hes getting charged an additional $50 every month for the course hes taking. They make it incredibly difficult to navigate their customer support for us to find a solution. I was planning to enroll next week, but not if this is the scam their running. I cant afford those problems.",
"As much as this app remains a blessing, the new update to the app has been a disaster. Now I can't use the while offline, but the download for offline use still remains, what's the essence? Secondly, the subtitle has also not been great. Subtitles are suppose go with conversations, but in this new update, the subtitle is always still. I'm going to have download the older version pending the time you make necessary changes to the app.",
Would be really awesome if there was a favorites list. There are many courses that I want to complete but it's hard to focus when there is no option to favorite courses and move on to the next when one is completed.,
"Great app which allows me to utilize small chunks of time to get through a few videos or readings. I'd improve on the items that cannot be done on mobile phone, e.g., some exercises and tests.",
"Coursera has provided me with an enriching learning experience. I have taken many professional and educative courses. Special thanks to the team. However, Coursera should consider including diploma courses, for instance, diploma in education, diploma in legal studies etc for people that cannot afford to pay for Bachelor and Masters degrees. Once again, hats off to Coursera for the great work.",
In progress in website and learning in app can be improved and optimized property to show the enrolled certifications and their respective courses properly. Whenever I try to see my progress it gets refreshed and shows different data.Please solve the issue.,
"The app is great, one thing that makes it hard to use is how you capture notes from videos, I can imagine a button that can capture the moment of the video, that will make it very easy to hughlight notes on mobile.",
ever since the new update on mobile it has been causing a bug where when I try to read along with the transcript while videos play it will constantly move the position in the text to one specific spot instead of following the place of the current highlighted words.,
I like the app and website. What I don't like is for once that I can't save courses I find and might be interested in taking later on. All I can do is either enroll them or send them to me as a link. The search function could be improved too. I usually look for free courses since I do most just out of interest in learning new topics. But the search easily gets mixed up and you find classes you have to pay for. Besides these little cons I can only recommend.,
"It is difficult to sign in from a desktop with the google picture feature, I have tried for days answering correctly, and it is still not working. we need an alternative authentication method, like a code to your phone. other than that, LOVE coursera!",
This is a great course. I do spend alot of time going through the other resources outlined within the course material. But the knowledge that I have gained so for is fantastic. And the instructors have been clear and interesting in their discussions.,
"Great to be doing this intro to AI course. I am happy to be learning but it takes effort to listen, read and repeat... Thankfully, the course allows me to return to materials as much as I like.",
Although I am grateful that these certification programs exist at such a cheap price point I am unhappy with customer service there is no way to contact Coursera to report bugs. There is a test question answer that is invalid and you can only get it right if you give the wrong answer. Does this affect my grade? In order to reach the support department you have to navigate a maze of articles and hyperlinks only to find that it cannot be done. The app is unimpressive but at least it is organized.,
"Coursera is the best learning platform so far for me. It is friendly and easy to navigate. And yes, most importantly offers professional courses.",
"I love the fact that it makes learning bite sized and easy, but I won't give it 5 stars for a reason. When we are going to correct peer-graded assignments many of the files that have been uploaded carry viruses from the user's PC. Meaning that I have downloaded files from this app that happened to be viruses. This has happened to me twice on my PC. I hope they try to figure it out and fix it, like put a scanner or something, I really don't know. If it will be fixed, I would give it 5 stars.",
"I would have given a five star but this new update is annoying. Unlike before, I can't use Coursera offline even though I have previously downloaded all my classes. This doesn't make sense to me. Besides that, the app is awesome. Affordable and the option of financial aid is impeccable. Great courses from great institutions. It's excellent.",
"I would give it a 5 star rating only that I spotted spelling errors. Also when given the example of the pin ball machine, it's worded as paint ball. Please fix so I can enjoy properly. Othereuse the app is phenomenal!!",
"The Coursera app is a game-changer! With a user-friendly interface, top-notch courses, and personalized learning, it's the ultimate tool for knowledge seekers. Offline access and a vibrant community make it a must-have. Five stars - Highly recommended!",
"A good place to get a certificate, but the problem is that Coursera does not support audio mode or picture-in-picture mode. It becomes worse when I minimize the app, as the sound suddenly stops automatically, not because of the quiz. Some assessments do not support smartphones, making it worse. Overall, the app is very messy.",
"Coursera is constantly improving, and that's evident from the continuous releases of updates that enhances user interface and experience. What would be great though is being able to answer the graded examinations on mobile because external links/apps work fine anyway and also the functionality of being able to run picture-in-picture mode too.",
I'm having love with Coursera. Anybody who wants to learn some extra and gain new skills it is the very first and last choice. I highly recommend Coursera to learn with your own choice of time. High gardes faculty with highly gardes lectures. Endless Opportunities..,
"My assessment writing css is not as simple as it should be. I wrote some pretty simple css styling and the assessor keeps failing 2 lines of code, yet everything performs as expected in the browser and there are no errors in the code. My code does what is asked of it, yet I keep getting failed on the same 2 lines of code despite trying several different ways of generating the same output.I'm beginning to see the Meta Front end Web development course as a waste of time and effort.",
"Coursera has been very useful to learn new things. Using the app in particular is smooth and efficient for on-the-go learning, but of course, using the web version is still the best experience. I also love that you can apply for financial aid if you don't have the money to pay for the courses you like. The courses in Coursera are also from reputable universities and institutions, so it is pretty credible.",
"Ridiculous!! I didn't expect this from coursera. I have purchased one course in 5700 INR and payment is done through debit card. I have invoice as well. After purchasing a course I can expect to be enrolled but heres I didn't get enrollment. I went through my payments and subscription it showing active with autopayment. Also, it says refunded on my recent purchase of 5700 INR but I have not received money in my bank account. I sent two mails to developer team to look into this but they didn't.",
"not sure if I am rating my course on coursera or the app itself. Coursera is fine, the course could be better, more practice while learning the material rather than after long readings",
"Ever since the last update, there is an annoying pop-up that shows your weekly goals several times in a session. It usually pops-up when watching course videos.",
"Good Morning, I am using this coursera platform last one year. It's a great platform for learning. But recently updated version (4.5 and up) of this app not properly working on my device.

"I love the experience so far, of course my procrastination isn't really helping me to make optimum use of this opportunity but I love the app, the fact that I can download the courses and view most of them offline is awesome as well. The courses available, as well as the instructors, actually make me want to continue learning.",
"If it were possible to give more than 5 stars, I would have done so.

Indeed, your choice of lecturers is top-notch.",
"I had purchased a course my coursera. Course was not showing up on my dash. I raised a support ticket for the same. The first ticket's solution was that I will get a refund in 7 days. I requested for the course instead as I was interested in taking it up. I. Despite follow ups, I did not get any response nor a refund. Raised another ticket with the CEO on cc. This mail asked for email confirmation. I provided necessary confirmation and followed up on the email. No response again. RIDICULOUS.",

"absolutely ordered learning. visual, audio and text are included to aid faster and better understanding. I love Coursera",

"Coursera is a home of innovation. I wish to add that every healthy minds would love to go for Coursera courses. But then, there are intelligent passionate learners that can't afford computer like smart phones and laptop to join and leverage the opportunities offered by Coursera.

"Wow, Big thank you to the coursera team for a wonderful putting together of defined materials which is able to build one up mentally and otherwise. indeed is really a place for future building. thank you all.",
"A good Platform for Career Building and I'm rating 4 Stars only because Coursera doesn't mention Grades achieved by Learner. And the Second Problem is that after Completing a Course, even Premium Learners lost control on Purchased Course. I think Coursera should provide full Control to the Learner even after completing the Course. At the end, I'll suggest Coursera Team to mention the Grades on Certificate also. It'll provide the surety that the Learner has done hard work! Thanks",
"I love the Coursera app, it's a great platform anyone can use to acquire an online course. you can learn at your own pace, I also love the fact that you can extend the deadline if you can't meet up with the initial deadline.",
"Coursera in general is a good platform for earning certificates. However, in some courses,like the Social Psychology course there is an issue, which remains unresolved for years. There is no button to finish an assignment in a quizz, which must be completed inorder to get the certificate. Therefore, I paid, and many others, for a course which can't be completed. There is no way of contacting a real person to forward the issue in order to resolve it. There is no way of getting a refund either.",
"I have learning on coursera for some time now , but on the website page either on my phone or laptop but trying the app Isa game changer , easy to access , tract you learnings",

"Fraud. They make it impossible to manage your subscriptions. There's countless articles telling you, if you want to cancel a subscription, go to the "" manage subscriptions"" tab... And it doesn't exist. On top of that, If you do find a way to cancel your subscription, they will continue to charge you. I didn't notice until 3 months of payments had gone through.",
"The app does not work well with Android or Chromebook. I am taking the Google Analytics course( which I was enjoying). Reached a point where the app told me to use a larger screen, so I used my chromebook. Same issue. Could not complete the assignment. Had to regretably cancel the course as I am not willing to purchase more hardware.",
"I got addicted to this app. But there is a small problem, sometimes my account logs out on it's own, so I need to log in again",
"I'm dropping one star from my previous review. This is because the app pauses video at one point or the other or sometimes does not even play at all, throwing erro messages. This has been my experience since like 5 to 7 updates away. Do well to fix for seamless playing of videos. This hampers my experience and sometimes demotivating.",
"coursera is such an amazing platform for learning and teaching. it is very flexible for use and so easy. I highly recommend to get knowledge ,skill and much more from coursera.",

Good app but I don't like the new update because of the way the text are disappearing from even when you scroll it back it will still be disappearing What I mean is the transcript is not working properly please fix it,
"Coursera is a good quality company worth going with. I came here and after a year I had an issue, this company worked with me on an individual level when needed, we resolved the issue and now I can highly recommend this company again. This is online classes and may be different for other people so coursera offering their trial gives you the ability to decide if it's for you or not during that trial period. Take a chance with Coursera, I think you'll be impressed with what you get for the price",

Maybe Facebook ü§îCan wait to finish and become career possibilities.üéâ",
"Overall this is a great app with is slightly less than the website. The most frustrating issue is that I can't take tests on the app. I bought a huge tablet thinking that I would be able to do everything on the app on my tablet, but come to find out on the first test i tried to take only works on a large screen even though my tablet screen is bigger than some laptops. If this ever gets fixed this app is an easy 5 stars",
"The app is good for everything except taking the graded exams at the end of each lesson. The best way I've found to access them on mobile is to uninstall the app, open the course in a browser via desktop mode, and then take it. You have to uninstall the app since attempting the quiz from the browser with the app installed will automatically open the app, which is an irritating workaround for multiple choice exams",
"Worst experience ever! First i purchased a course having 3 months of emi. In between I was denied to access the course and asked to buy a subscription. I bought the subscription also but still was not able to submit the assignments and on the same day, when I cancelled the subscription, I didn't receive any refund . In this way, i lost my 13k without getting any certificate üò¢",
I love this app. I love the learning interface. It is easy to navigate and I'm excited to see more courses added! One thing I wish it had us an option ti save or favorite a course. There's so much I want to learn and explore and I can't do it all at once.,
"Coursera is a fantastic online learning tool. It provides a flexible and accessible approach to expand knowledge and skills with its huge variety of courses from prominent universities.

Overall, Coursera is an excellent platform that allows people to study and progress at their own speed.",
"When using the platform on Google, you are able to select text from the video and add it as a note to view later. Also, when taking the pop-up quizzes that are in the videos, I will answer the questions correctly. It will respond that I answered incorrectly and give me the chance to answer again. When I correct my answers, it will tell me I missed an answer, and it will be with the response I selected the first time that I was told was incorrect.",
"This app is great for professional development but One thing I found very frustrating is that the perticular course that you have already completed it shows you again ""Enroll"" option But when you click on that enroll option of that completed course it shows all the topics you have already covered. And also it contains some more small small glitches which I think it needed to be fixed.",
"Good idea, poor execution The course videos introduce only basic ideas and then quiz on very in depth, specific and poorly worded/instructed questions. There is very little help with the ""hints"" on quiz reviews. The forums have other students who also don't know what's going on and need help. You cannot ask questions to a prof, admin, TA, etc. directly for help or other general questions. As a previous college grad this was a nightmare",
"I have enrolled for google project managment certification, my profile language is English but the course is running in French, I have written multiple emails and raised tickets, till date no response. Only the reading content is translating to English but case studies are in french. No option to change the course language to English. Not useful at all. I just wasted money and time. Need full refund or fix the language change to English.",
Continuing my courses on this app has been awesome. There's literally no difference from the web experience besides the screen size of different devices. Coursera is amazing in and out. Good job to the team!!!,
"I am not able to review some the survay form to fill.(it asks for big screen to review). It shows ""try again"" option to open in the mobile scrren. But it doen't make any difference. it would be great if you could improve this function. it may give good use experience.",
It's almost impossible to navigate to the videos of the courses I'm taking on the PC. I'm having a hard time locating where the videos can be found. I've opened the page for the course I'm taking but all I can see is it's contents. I'm unable to go to the videos/notes and continue the course on the phone. Please consider making the interface more user friendly. Thanks.,
"It's a great platform that helps you to enhance your knowledge, Horne your Skill Set and harness your Professional Competence. Online Methodology helps you to go back and attend the class when time permits and therefore for working Professionals it's easier to schedule their Daily routine accordingly. So happy that we have something like this available. Thanks to the Course Instructors and Mentors.",
After the most recent update I cannot see any course content. A message pops up saying there is no connection despite being connected to wifi.,
Most amazing place for my learning. But make an option where we can do bookmakers or wishlist for our favourite cources üòÑ‚úåüèª(suggestion). Please add the Download option. I got lost with the downloads.,
"Literally the worst app, worst website ever, can't even save the progress of a course, and even after completing a course, it says incomplete.",
"Well....I recently just downloaded the app, but I'm having a swell time with it, plus I've been using the web version for a long while now, and I like it. Thanks Coursera and the whole team behind it",

"As a person who trying to change careers and have zero time outside of work (15 hour days, 7 days a week) to ""study"" not being able to take test on mobile is really difficult to feel like I've progressed. I'll change to 5 stars if we can get this.",
"No doubt, Coursera is the best platform. learning is made easy with the way they're been explained to the lowest of explanation. With good time management.",
"The app was awesome untill the recent updated version, which makes it difficult to follow the caption while watching videos.",
Multiple times I've been told I cannot use the device I am on to complete an assignment because it requires a big screen. I have a Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the screen is big. Wish I could use the big screen device that I have to complete them.,
The app is quite good. Haven't had any apparent issues. I am giving 4 stars specifically because the app doesn't come with a dark mode which is much needed in my case. Please consider it. Thanks!,
"Best decision I made is signing up for Coursera, truly a treasure trove of knowledge and Information at your finger tips, discovering a wealth of knowledge and valuable skills is a beginning of new ventures and experience, learning is the key to knowledge, and at Coursera you can achieve what you set out to do, and change the course of time.",
I have paid 5700 INR for Coursera plus and I didnt get a subscription. Money debited my credit card and I have sent multiple emails and no response from your admin team. I will recommend this money looting app to anyone.,
"coursera is bigger than the four walls of a classroom or any lecture there... where dreams are made, sometimes free of charge...the best among any teaching app",

"The best thing a person can do during a day is to learn a new thing about anything, and with this coursera app I'm learning every day.",
"I went to try and cancel the plus portion of the subscription. There was no option. I went to cancel the entire thing. They presented the option of continuing but for half the price. I agreed. This morning they charged the full price with plus. They are liars and thieves. Avoid. Use Udemy or some other option. Or just don't pay. Also, report the fraud to the FTC. I have.",
"great app you can learn anything there and almostly for free. it could be better if subtext be able under the video when i turn off the sub, becasue i just dont want to see the vixeo be coverd by sub but really want to see the sub text",
"I do not like the new update. It's very distracting when you have the caption on the screen in addition to the caption below the screen area. I liked it when it was just the caption below the screen area. If you turn off the closed caption on the screen, it turns off the transcribing below the screen and I don't like that. I have only experienced it for one lesson just now. But I really don't like that update. I like reading it below and not around the face of the person that's speaking.",
I love learning through Coursera. The app is set up in a way that I am easily learning and retaining the information and excited about completing my course. Thank you to all.,
"Transcript, Subtitles are not synchronised in many Meta Front end development course videos, making it extremely difficult to watch then in one go.",

"Makes it easy to learn on the go. Nicely designed, and very easy to navigate. Good work done for learning.",
I am enrolled in the IBM full stack developer professional certificate sponsored by Infosys springboard but still I'm unable to submit the graded quiz. It's asking me to upgrade but I'm enrolled in sponsored course still it's asking me to do so. Please help,
"The new update is have problem with the transcript, the transcript doesn't scroll with the voice. Please fix this.",
I am facing issue after login using my university email id. Using WIFI it's not working page got stuck on COURSERA page. Only using mobile data it's working page is loading. Kindly fix this issue as not working using WIFI.,

"Coursera (offered by LinkedIn) helps users get job-ready in the most competitive roles, and gets them up-to-date on emerging technology. I've already learned so much, after completing a fraction of the full certification course; that I feel confident I will get my dream job as a UX Designer.",

Coursera is a best learning platform that has been always meeting my needs at all times. They have been a source of help to me anytime I need a financial aid from them. Weldone and keep on doing the good job.,
This app has a very good user experience. the courses are also broken down to the easiest way possible.,
"This is an amazing app, it's really helping me out in reshaping my learning path & achieving success in my learning journey!",
Coursera is one of the best online educational platforms that I have ever used. I look forward to learning through Coursera.,
Please make a dark mode for those of us who are light sensitive or study at night. White is actually pretty painful and dark mode is the first thing I look for on any web site or app.,
Very convenient to use. Downloadable content means that I can still view the courses even without internet connection. Lots of interesting courses that I want to learn even if I'll never actually use them in life but fun to learn regardless for the sake of knowledge. I think this is the best app for learning out there.,
"There is a bug in the app. Every time I tried to play a video, I received the error message, ""Oops, Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again."" This problem persisted despite multiple attempts. The app was working perfectly fine before I updated it. Please fix this problem ASAP.",
"Apps won't crash but won't work either. It just lags, showing loading and then does nothing and go back to diet page. Take infinity to download lectures even with high speed fibre connection. Not sure what to do with the app. And it's updated, not an an older version",
"great app, good for learning on the go. Best for mobile learning if you bring coursera up on your laptop and use Notion app to take notes on your phone. so far in my course data analytics has been pretty easy, but I rather take good notes with laptop phone combo than just read and wing it with only coursera on laptop or phone. good luck everyone",
"Everything is perfect in the app, but main problem is that it doesn't run well, hangs every 2 minutes the app doesn't operate smoothly, gets stuck after every move I make, that's really irritating & frustrating!!! Rest everything is perfect!. Useful & wide variety of free courses that interests major population of youth!!! And useful as well!",
"App asks me to enroll in courses that I've already got the certificate for. I tap on the class and it says I'm already enrolled. I have had two tests mark answers wrong despite the correct answer. Once it showed answer wrong and when I clicked on detail, it said the answer was right. But marked it wrong. Second time correct answer was marked, practically direct quote from course material, but it was marked wrong. I like the content but the Coursera testing is faulty and not trustworthy.",
I love the ability to tune in for a segment here and there. It makes learning fun. Having access to topics directly related to my business performance is also proven beneficial. I wish the classes had more value transferrable value or recognition.,
"I'm not thrilled with the performance of the app or with the content of the courses, but still I'm happy to have the ability to pay for a subscription I hardly use. On week two of my data analytics course I was asked to collect two weeks worth of data and then return to complete the assignment.",
"Unable to access registered course. I fell ill few months back and unable to continue my lessons. I tried getting back in today, I was asked to update my version of the app which I did. But I'm unable to access or continue course from where I stopped. The error message is, I have no data connection and or unable to fetch my data, I should check my internet connectivity. Could please look into this asap.",
"A great app that can put you on a fast-track to learning skills or languages, with some courses coming with their own professional certificates from well-known schools and organizations. There's also a few Bachelor's and MBA options in there as well, albeit from lesser known schools. Some of these courses may be free; if you research a bit, your local library may pay a service which sponsors certain courses.",
"Candidly speaking, Coursera is a great place to learn. I find it very interesting and fulfilling to access courses that I never thought I would be able to find some courses in real good time, place and ease to learn. The app too is very efficient. It just makes learning a little more delightful. Gracias, Dankeschon, Thanks, Uruese kakabo üôè.",
"I love how compact and user-friendly their mobile interface is. Learning can now be more effective and saves you time. Thus, making you more efficient in managing your time in and out of workspaces. Transitioning from desktop to mobile learning is easily adaptable. Keep Up!",
"the platform is very engaging, but i hope they add the option to control the streaming thru your earphone gestures. I dunno if there is a setting for this (might need to explore, currently busy with engaging with the lectures), I'm using a sony wf-1000xm4 earphones",
This is starting to be my worst learning app. I can't play videos from the web version. Ok! I downloaded the app and i can't even login to my account. Keeps telling me network problem when my network is full and good. Like what is happening üò£,
Needs a dark mode badly since its so much small text on plain white background. Also annoying that you cant just read the module without having to skip to the end of the video to proceed afterwards. I dont personally like the note thing and will never use it.,
"The video controls (pause, next and previous) are stuck on the screen when watching a lecture. When you click to hide them, they reappear. They used to auto-hide after a few seconds but even that doesn't work any longer. I can't study because I can't see much of the lecture, please fix it.",
"The majority of Coursera's courses are so that you can learn at your own pace and schedule that suits you, while you are in full-time job, student or retired. The courses are affordable, job related and most of these courses are recognized by employers and companies. Coursera for me open a new world with so many wide range of different learning programs, I would definitely recommend this way of learning to all that is interested in online learning.",
"I usually took courses on PC but I have portability issues. So, I installed the app in my phone. Now, It is easy for me to take course and quiz anywhere. The app performance is really good.",
"It's like having an intellectual blast. App is stable, progress is recorded and the instructors make teaching relatable and simple to grasp. Keep it up coursera. Need to work on the honours badge though. Sometimes navigating this section and following the rules are not so clear. So I give 4",
"Coursera is the best online educational platform I know. The app is easy to use and very effective, and the quality of the teaching and knowledge gained are top notch. Many lives have changed for the better because of the work that Coursera is doing, mine inclusive. Coursera is a blessing to humanity. I thank the Coursera team for their service, and I urge them to keep doing what they're doing.",
"I commend the level of efficiency of the app, but some improvements should be considered in the next update. E.g 1. Add dark theme 2. Addp a function to bookmark a course 3. Option to monitor financial aid application from the app 4. Make it possible for us to highlight and copy subtitles on the app, if possible, note on the app. That's all for now. Regards",
"I can't learn on my Galaxy Z fold. The video is not loading, and it's totally makes me delayed on my courses. Even though I try on my iPad Pro, it's not working as well. Please fix it. I can't always handle my laptop around.",
Learning is a continuous process for me because of Coursera. Thanks for the amazing gift of learning,
"Very bad app I have enrolled for frontend developer certificate from meta after 20 days again asking for enroll, I have to contact support team I got nothing in the site to contact with them.",
slow load time between lectures ....worse than browser not a great experience.....better use on web browser not your appp.....half of my time is getting wasted just to wait for the next lecture,
"Disgusting, sleazy, dubious business practices! If you forget to cancel after a free trial, you can't get a refund. Not even within 48 hours. They get around the 14-day refund law by claiming watching content during the free trial is the same as having started watching a movie you purchased online which nullifies your right for a refund. It's not! I would not trust this company with anything now, definitely not my professional future....",
"It's the worst app and not reliable, how will u subscribe for a course and it's not up to a month, your subscription will end and once u pay for it, they will take you to the beginning of the course, and you have to pay again till you reach the level u have learnt to. It's so frustrating. I have paid #6940 five times and it won't get to a month my subscription will end. I have write to admins but no response. I won't encourage anybody to use this app.",
Please give different settings for subtitle and transcripts. And the previous update was better with the transcript.,
"No support system, no help line number or email. I had purchased my course and the end date was 14th April, 2023. I'm trying to appear for the test today itself. The final test. And it's asking for me to pay again. It's still 14th. And I'm trying since morning. I can't reach anyone for help too. Neither their customer support on their site has an option to talk about this issue. Worse for students like me who save up to buy these courses and end up with nothing.",
One of the Best platforms to learn. The courses are designed and delivered in a very efficient way.,
"A good app, but it would benefit from providing some kind of audio only option for commuters, like that of the Linkedin Learning app, which allows some learning to occur in otherwise 'dead time'.",
Good. A fast way to learn. All the content are not available on mobile phones due to the screen configuration. please could you do a responsive design for all the content? especially the assignment.,
Learning at my own pace and having the mobile option are crucial options that I really appreciate.,
I bought one course and after some time i bought plus account and go for request of refund. Customer service replied google will return you money just make application there. After this i made it and Coursera denied. After this one no one from customer service is replying to me even am making again request.,
"downloading is a hassle; it takes over three hours just to get started. ui is acceptable, but there's a lot of room for improvement.",
A superb app with limitless potential for upskilling and career enhancement efforts. The course quality is second to none. The app makes it possible to complete any course at your own pace from the device of your choice and convenience. Great job team Coursera!,
One of the best educational platform for the beginners as well as for the specialists. It provides a bunch of courses for the students of all fields,
This is the best app for learning skills and tools for their career or the business but I found one problems in that which was I am not able to save any skill or tools course I recommend the company or the developer to add the Save option in all there tools and skill courses to save their tools and skills for the future thank youüòá and I also recommend the students of the colleges are the schools to check this app for choosing their career üëçüèªüëçüèª‚ú®,
"It's pretty easy and intuitive to use, I haven't seen a feature in the web version that it's not available in the app.",
"The fee structures are vague. Coursera Plus copy lead you to believe it is 90% inclusive, when in fact the ""meaty"" course, allowing you to do real work are labeled ""specializations"" so you have to pay additional fees for them on top of the $59/mo subscription fee for Courses Plus.",
"Its a nice application. The videos are very brief and clear. Nonetheless, I've a things to point out: there's no certificate to students who didn't pay, I wish there was some sort of an award to keep students motivated else there will be many drop outs and the non-monetary value of the course can't be reached.",
"Coursera has given me so much knowledge and needed wisdom that I needed in my studies and job. Regarding the App, sometimes when I open it, I find out that some of the courses I had already completed are closed again and that I have to ""Enroll"" for them once again, which makes no sense. It's like finishing a 100k MBA degree, and after 1y, the school asks you to pay so as to keep your diploma. I love Coursera, and I hope this bug is fixed. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
"I'm having a great time learning so far. only snag is not all task are mobile friendly, that causes learning breaks having to move to a desktop. Generally, great learning experience so far.",
the process of linking to an institution as a student is confusing but is overall a great app.,
"I have loved your app but this latest update is very poor, it keeps telling me to check connect and try again thereby making it impossible for me to access the app .",
"Thank you Coursera for providing this learning platform to people all around the globe , This means so much to people who are unable to afford and learn new skills and abilities.",
This is the Best course i ever take. The method of teaching is so good because of small video clips with fill of required detail and somewhere with gui and daily life examples and some where as per need you show proper physically tour of hardware. Thanks Coursera for this best Opportunity.,
"A great way to learn. Quality institutions with great content. The certificate option is great when you need to illustrate knowledge of a skill, and the free option is great when you need to keep your education up to date in a current job.",
Coursera's platform for learning is one in a million. The app has a very easy-to-navigate interphase. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning skills online. It is wonderful!,
The app is cool but you need to upgrade it in a way that videos automatically download with their original name because renaming is such a pain,
"I can't give more Stars now since I haven't been able to open the app since download, it keeps saying network error. Secondly, the site have not been opening my coursework since I enrolled and took the introduction, it keeps loading and coming out blank.",
it is best learning website I have ever seen you can find the courses with best teachers paid as well as free se don't waste time download it and enroll in your desirable course and start learning today,
I love this app cos it has provided me with the opportunity to learn.. However this new update is so so frustrating. It's making learning so difficult and uninteresting.. I cant play the videos of the classes even though I had previously downloaded them...,
"it is a beautiful app, where you can basically learn any skill at your own convenience. You can also learn for free, which is one of the reasons I love it so much.",
Coursera is so convenient and simple to use. For busy parents or people it provides the ability to learn at your own pace while providing support by helping set goals and reminders.,
"The web it's OK but the app is ugly, when I go to multitask and go back to the app scroll resets, So I always lose my progress when I am reading",
wont stop buffering after every few seconds. Internet connection is absolutely fine. have to restart video all the time and skip that timeframe. starts buffering again. takes ages to watch a single video.,
This application is ridiculous. When I log in to mobile app it says enrollment starts but already have membership given by my university. This app asks me to pay again even I've paid already. The support doesn't work properly and their agent put me on hold for 10 minutes regularly. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS APPLICATION TO ANYBODY. PLEASE FIND ANY OTHER RESOURCE INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR TIME ON THIS APPLICATION. POOR APPLICATION EVER. EVEN THIS DOESN'T DESERVE SINGLE STAR. POOR SERVICE.,
I am learning way more than the exposure I have gathered practising in my country. The experience is better because I am happy seeing as I make progress through the intensive course outlines and tasks. I can't wait to work at Google as a project manager,
How many Autodesk classes does Coursera have? But no access to Autodesk 360! This is sad. The class seemed really helpful but I can't spend $400 for a program I'm going to use for a couple months while I take the classes and then have no more use for. If it was a text book I could find a used copy. It makes more sense to spend that money on a community college.,
"this a great learning platform, I like how everything works together seamlessly to give learners wonderful learning experiences.",
Good app but keeps on crashing the moment you try to download a week of any course. Or switching from a week to another in a course. It will just stop working.,
Returned to take courses but the app seems problematic when trying to review my own previous assignments for feedback. Even the email notification can't access the feedback. I thought by now bugs would've been fixed.,
"Since the update when reading a transcript for a course, it keeps going back towards the previous paragraph.",
One of the best online courses I have seen. Very interesting to learn. Everything is 100% ok to me. This is the best.,
It is a lovely course and I love the tone and pace. Very insightful for us in developing and emerging economies. Thank you.,
I love the courses here and it's easy to use as well as challenging and helpful contents to learn more,
"This is one of the most intrested and useful courses I did in my life. My thanksand appreciation to Coursera, Stanford University, and to the great teacher kristin Sainani.",
"This is awesome and amazing. I'm glad to be part of this team. Gaining a whole lot of knowledge. Thanks for the wonderful privilege, I'm super grateful.",
This application is amazing for helping learners wherever in the world to get the best learning experience,
It is a very useful and helpful app for the learners. It makes easy to access the courses. Thank you so much.,
"The classes and everything work ok, but the sync between comp and phone is off. Also completed week 1 on a class and it didnt say i completed it then trying to find week 2 to do ended up making me reset my progress on week 1. Content is ok so far but app/site is kind of clunky.",
Their courses are interesting and the learning platform is great. Both on web and app,
Excellent app to give access to Coursera content. It makes logging on and doing courses very easy.,
"Little bit glitchy from time to time, but 100% my favorite learning app for years now. Well worth it!",
I never thought Coursera app would be this cool because I've had lots of experiences using many other platform's apps and they were not perfect as their actual website not even close. But this app is way better than expected. You don't need to browse your courses from web browser. This app has everything. All the main features are here. P.S: Noticed a bug which is subtitles are automatically scrolling up even I tried to manually scroll down. Synchronization works fine but cannot read with that.,
starting the rating with 3stars as I have just started the course and will rate later once i will complete the course and based upon the evaluation what I have learned.,
"I found the educational platform to be a valuable resource for learning. Whether you are a student looking to improve your grades, a professional looking to upskill, or someone simply interested in learning something new, I highly recommend coursera.",
"I can't get the labs to open, I can't find anywhere to enter a support ticket, I can't find any chat support or number to call, and the community support is worthless. I live in poverty OK spendibg money on this was like literally painful and I didn't eat that day and now I can't even do the work to get the thing I need to not starve thanks for an awful experience I literally just can't stop crying.",
"There is absolutely NO customer service. You can ""chat"" with them through text or email only, but there will most likely be no resolution. No IT support, or knowledge of the course whatsoever. You will feel completely in the dark if you need to talk to someone. Horrible service because of this. In fact, if you persistently have issues they will DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT. Kind of a scam if you ask me. Be careful where you use your time, it could easily be wasted.",
I have used . It is not only one of the best online learning app but also excellent to use. It is more informative app. I had done some courses and that helped me in my studies and improve my interpersonal skills. Thank you coursera .,
"Please bring downloaded video in app, after update app, i don't see it. Although i learned completely some courses, but sometimes i want to review it.",
"excellent instructional designs, easy to navigate, and it helps you track your learnings to keep you on the track till you finish the course.",
"I'm pleased with how Cousera how has their learning segments set up. They are easy to understand and follow, with the option to review at anytime. This makes it easier to absorb the information, then comfortably continue on.",
"While attending a quiz, it shows that the resource is also available in supplementary section. But the supplementary section doesn't exist",
"best learning platform , helping contents , it provides motivation to grow day by day more",
The SSO sign in is terrible. It redirects you to the web browser and keeps you there,
"Error while playing video. I have enrolled a course and while playing this course video I am getting this error saying ""Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again.""",
"There's some simple content that can shown on the app but it forces you to use explorer. For some interactive content is understandable, but for a simple quiz not. Has no support for dex",
Transcript only shows first paragraph. when I scroll to the correct line it skips back to first paragraph.,
"This app is one of the best app I have ever use so far, it very simple and easy to walk through as I study my course",
This is the best learning app where we can learn many things...,
This is one of the best learning apps out there. The interface is very easy to navigate and user friendly.,
"Overall great app, and inuitive. Wish it was tailored for tablets a little better. Being able to take notes on videos while on my phone would be nice too.",
"Thank you for the opportunity to be a Coursera learner. However, please add dark mode... I feel hard to study üòî",
"Add tge dark mode too, it would be a lot less strain on the eyes that way.",
"So far so good, this learning platform has opened the floodgates of knowledge and helped me learn more about professional occupations and specific learning paths that lead to them. The interactive, multi-media learning really sets the industrial standard.",
"I have been in the media for quite some time, however this course has enlightened me and also invigorated me to reach for a new heights. Great course, great teacher, hopefully great outcomes!",
"I love Coursera itself but the app leaves more to be desired. It keeps logging me out of my account, so that when I want to do my offline courses, I can't because I need to log in again - and I can't, because I don't have wifi !",
I can no longer enroll more courses minus the introductory ones,
this app is very easy and helpful to learn more knowledge and get more information. which is very beneficial for everyone,
An amazing app indeed for grasping an understanding of how to do research. Really liked it.,
"For personal enrichment and growth through learning, Coursera provides clear, engaging and enjoyable courses, on just about anything that you need to improve your life and career. Thank you Coursera!",
The abundance of exceptional courses offered on Coursera is truly praiseworthy and reflects the platform's commitment to providing high-quality educational experiences for learners worldwide.,
"Downloads make mobile slow down, and sometimes I need to clear data of the app, Ok, but not satisfied.",
the course is high educative and presented in a manner suitable people without prior knowledge to follow. I whole heartedly recommend it to persons who want to develop expert knowledge on terrorism studies,
"Hello Team, I purchased mothly subscription of ‚Çπ 3650 on April 2nd for IBM data science certificate program, but I received email for order cancellation receipt, which I have not raised. Now my money is debited from my account, but i do not see any active subscription and there is no notification for refund. I request refund for the deducted amount, so that I can register myself again. Also is there any way to reach out to customer care representative.",
Overall very good platform;)...one thing that i dont like is the fact that i can't pin or save the courses that i want to take later,
my experience is overall good. there are some tiny changes that should be made like turn off auto play,
Currently working on my Google Cybersecurity certificate. I love the fact that I can download the classes and learn offline.,
has been an amazing learning platform on the desktop and I love the fact that they have an app that works,
"Brilliant portal for learning. Neat, simple and elegant.",
Great when my laptop isn't available but y'all should add a dark mode for both the web app and mobile app,
One of the best platforms to study any course that is available for study.,
"wonderful experience indeed... looking forward to a successful career help, this is the best place to be...",
audio transcript highlight is missing to follow up audio readings,
Awesome application with great courses. Highly recommended.,
The app is very great but the last update isnot good at all it dont let me to submit my quizzes,
haven't used in a while but I'm glad to see the changes made while I'm away. I can only pray it gets better.,
This is good application for beginners and up skill very easily,
I felt the exercise interesting and learnt a lot from it.,
"Great e platform to learn every thing, which you have to learn from the different cornor of the world. And the mentors came here who have vast knowledge on the particulr subject. I had got great experience with google team. Thank you team.",
"Getting worst experience with , Coursera. I completed data analytic course 2 and still it's showing like not completed, when open in desktop üñ•Ô∏è that shows completed , in mobile app not completed , getting bad üòî experience.",
"I can not login into my account via Android app. Changing password did not help, copying password via clipboard did not help, etc. On PC it works flawless. I do not even have special chars in my password.",
"App does not let me login with organization email. Makes me log in in a web browser and then send me back to app to resume a course. But when the app opens, asks for login. It's an endless loop.",
"New update is awful. It can not even load videos which I already downloaded. For the love of God please fix it asp, because it my deadline and I can not see anything, and I didn't want to update it, it was automatic.",
Great platform to learn advanced-level skills.,
"I Love this App, I learnt a lot. I like how they made it both reading and videos with subtitles for I base on mostly videos",
"best of best. just because of it, I am learning extra things along with my academic studies.",
"There are very cool courses available from very good schools, and all you do is learn and then at the end okay for your certificate. Ba da bing ba da bomb! That simple.",
Coursera is really very nice app for to learn any course online but they have limited free courses on their platform.,
"There's a bug in the app. Videos are playing with the playback options on the screen. If I touch the screen to make thiese options go away, it would come back in a moment. Please fix ASAP.",
Its the worst. I bought a course but when I tried to the assignment it's showing purchase the course and there is no way to contact them either. All they do is take money. They should close this services. I wanted to give them zero stars.,
When i search for a course and click on see enrollment options it pops up an error saying Error loading enrollment data fix it immediately I have bought,
"I love coursera for its neat and elegant interface. One of the best feature of this App is ability for one-click download of the full course. However, it takes time in updating the data from the database and sometimes does not update. Secondly, it shows assignment Not submitted even though the assignment is submitted. Similarly its shows ""you are really getting close"" even if you have completed the course and certificates. Though these issues are petty, fixing these issues will make it perfect.",
"This is a very nice app, but sometimes it doesn't register (mark) that a video lesson was completed, although I think this is only in offline mode. Sometimes when watching a video, pausing it, and switching between apps, the position time is lost when bringing it back to the foreground. I would also like to ask for a popup asking whether you would like to resume video from the last timestamp, if the video has been viewed for more than a minute.",
"Great courses and lots of informative courses available at a very reasonable price, with few other courses available free. However, after the most recent update, there were some glitches with the video controller not disappearing after a certain amount of time, ultimately covering up the content with the video controls. I think the most fastest way to resolve this would be to reduce the shading when opening the video controls... Please help me",
"The course content is greatly appreciated, but the subscription service was a bit sneaky in charging by the month. It turns out, if you take the monthly subscription upgrade, you do not have permanent access to the original course. Further charges are now needed per course. I would have appreciated distinctions between the two instead of making one ‚Äúan extra upgrade‚Äù on top of the existing purchase",
"After the recent update, this app has become totally unusable. I download weekly content and watch it. Before the update it worked fine. But since the update, once you watch a video for about 4 minutes, the video begins to stutter and lag. The only solutions that works is you have to quit the application and clear it from recent apps and start over again. I have tried all sorts of tricks but this is the only trick that works for now. It wastes times and demotivates me.",
"It looks nice at first glance, but there some major shortcomings. First, it actually does not work offline. Thus, it is almost of no use to download courses because you anyway cannot open them being offline. Second, useless ""Recommended"" page which of very low value and should be changed or augmented with ""Favorites"" section. I would definitely prefer to see the courses I found interesting instead of Coursera's recommendations. In addition, there many minor glitches that should be fixed.",
"Great app overall for getting through some course content on the go! Some issues for improvement: 1) No audio screen reader for text pages in courses - so you can't listen if you're busy or have a health condition where a screen reader would help. These are standard, every news website has them, so Cousera doesn't get a free pass here. 2) Doesn't work well with tablets. The screen doesn't rotate into landscape mode, some activities made for a ""large screen"" don't work.",
"The app is amazing and I'm very grateful for this education. It has definitely impacted my career in a positive way. However, I've got something to point out that irritates me about the mobile app (sorry Coursera): The video player has this huge problem that it never leaves the video screen empty, it's always showing me the options interface with that black shadow over the video. No matter how much I press a free space in the video, that annoying interface comes back. Please fix that :) thanks",
"The content is really good. But the app could do better. First of all, it'd be much more helpful if we could be able play and pause videos using the button on earphones. Second, the app really lags and becomes awfully slow when you download the courses offline. Autoplay for the next videos can't be disabled. There are stability issues with this app, I'd recommend using Coursera from the Browser.",
"Brilliant app. The automatic subtitles scroll also - > well done. Sometimes there are mistakes in the transcription though and there is not easy way to suggest a fix. Would also have been nice to have a landscape view of the video and a two liner of the scrolling text. Maybe in landscape, you could only need one line. Offline use is brilliant. Good job guys.",
"Tried a course and in quizzes it doesn't display properly. It's unusable on a small screen. Some formulas are display in their mark up. It looks as if the app cannot render all content. One question asks me to modify code then execute it. The result is ""error"". I also tried to look up feedback for a quiz I did in the past which, too, resulted in ""error"". 30 minutes of use, three bugs found. I can't do the course on my mobile phone and will be limited to times I have access to larger screen.",
"Coursera has helped me a lot, particularly the app, which is mobile data efficient for some of us that cannot afford internet for our PCs. However, something about the current upgrade has to be undone. Before this upgrade, if I pause the video, the action buttons disappears, allowing me read and write the content on the screen. Currently, if I pause the action buttons stays there, and the screen darkens preventing me from reading unless I click on play. Please review this setting. Thank you.",
I personally loved the platform. But the app has some limitations and it's okay to have that. Coursera courses are really organised. It's been couple of months I'm on it and my experience is excellent. Very well described. And difficulty level increases with intermidiate level and then advanced level courses. It's a really good platform for knowledge and also promotions.,
"I have put a rating of two stars for this app, I personally love the layout of the app, and the courses it provides. The problem is that I cannot study anything due to its constant loading when trying to learn, then it says that it cannot download the material. I am somewhat tech savvy and have checked my internet, settings, accessibility, etc. However I believe the problem is the app itself, if this issue can be fixed then I will change my rating to 5 stars.",
"The good side of this update is that you can pick up exactly where you left your video, that wasn't possible before now. This new update caused more issues than it fixed. 1. Downloads can't be accessed any longer work. 2. Videos take ages to load, regardless of your internet speed. 3. Closed captions no longer skip to the corresponding part of the video. I have noticed a similar pattern in web too. Please @coursera, we're trying to learn. This is so so frustrating",
It is an amazing course! An awesome eye opener! I have learnt a lot of new theories and ideas presented in simple and interesting ways. I also enjoyed the regular quiz questions that pop up at intervals as the program progressed. The course has widened my knowledge and scope professionally and in my private life... in building and sustaining an effective group communication. I cannot wait to get back to work as an Administrator to test out the theories while practicing the new ideas.,
"This app is really something, I love all the features and knowledge that I enjoy. But recently I am facing an issue where the various options that appear on the video for a second or two and then disappear, are not disappearing anymore, it's really difficult to watch a lecture like this,I put the phone really close to my eyes so that I can understand what's happening in the lectures. Kindly solve this problem. Otherwise it's such a great app.",
"I wish there were more accessibility features. For example, I'd like to change the appearance of the CC. This app isn't great for diverse learners. Also full screen video cuts off the edges of the video. Being able to download the course content to my phone/tablet is great since I don't have wifi at home.",
Coursera is best platform for the learning skills and technology related and it can be easier to use.,
This is a very excellent Google learning app. I'm yet to finish my courses but it's been great.,
"I hadn't been able to finish a course on any other online learning platform, but with Coursera, I haven't just finished many courses but also learned a lot that has changed my life. I particularly love the safe-paced structure of each lesson, and the videos are not exasperatingly long. I recommend Coursera to anyone who likes to learn but doesn't wish to be tied to a boring lesson structure.",
If your truly want to learn and earn something this is the best platform and also easy to use.,
this is a very good platform and alot of thing can be learn here. I highly recommend this to everyone.,
"One of the best apps for education. Easy & good learning and the best thing is many courses has ""financial aid"" available for students like me who can't just spend ‚Çπ5k just for a certificate while paying college fees. Thank you Coursera!",
The best app for people like me who are thirsty to gather different types of knowledge. This app helps us to learn from top universities and top educators for free( price to be paid for certification only). Thanks a lot for existing.,
"Its effortlessly easy to go around with, consumes very little data and does not consume energy",
I love taking free courses on Coursera. I've expanded my awareness on so many topics.,
"Coursera help me to gain knowlegde, skill and real world examples and happy to earn more and more new insights. thank to have such platform.",
this is a great way to learn some new material and if you pay for courses earn a certification,
"Coursera app is very useful, especially for busy people like me who uses phone most of the time. However, some improvements might be helpful to include like everytime I swap to another app (in my case google slides, for the given assignments), the Coursera would save the scrolled area where I left. Coursera usually takes me to the top after I switch to back it, and I have to scroll down to the bottom of the assignment all over again.",
"The idea, the courses are amazing. But the app has limitations. 1 categories are poorly designed, the only way to go is through search function-but with categories I could discover so much more! Also, the course page should have info in what categories it is. 2 You can only search by keywords- √±why no advance search to filter out paid courses (you can always audit, but where's the fun in that?), I personally would also like to filter out courses with peer graded assignments (I prefer quizzes)",
"I wish the app loaded faster. A feature which would let us watch videos from where we last left off would be super helpful, both on the app and website. The reading sections get automatically completed even though I didn't finish them. On the website, I can just mark the section completed. Coursera should introduce this feature to their app as well. Overall, I'm quite happy with the lectures and practice exercises. They have an amazing catalogue of courses. I love using Coursera!",
Good for learning on the go. Assignments that involve programming are not available.,
I will highly recommend it because it's very useful to know about what we are eating and what should be its impact.,
Looks better than the desktop version. It's responsive and intuitive. I like it.,
"Hi I am doing courses on Coursera from last year, everything was great except for some minor issues few and far. From this month, the app is not working properly. The video player button(accessibility button) doesn't disappear when playing video. Kindly solve this issue . This is wasting time. Thank you.",
"Have been taking the react course and everything was going good, I was a bit slow due to my job, but I'm now receiving a notification saying my session has been expired and the new session only start after 15 days, this is just straight up stupid considering there was this learn at your own pace thing",
A good place to learn but the app asks to be updated almost everyday which is annoying.,
it's a nice online teaching app with different courses and you can even apply for financial aid if you don't have money to pay for a course. I've not had any issue since I've been using this app. so easy to use.,
"I usually download the courses so I can watch the video lectures seamlessly, but I notice that in recent update, the videos lag. The tracker in the transcript also disappeared. Made this review last July 25, 2022. Now it's September 4, and still the same. The previous version is better when it comes to viewing downloaded video lectures. The newer versions ruined it.",
"Transcript subtitles are not moving with the video, after the latest update...",
I'm using this for a month now and I've got a good experience using the app. But I'm having some problems the past few days because the lecture videos are lagging even if you download it. You need to open and close the app everytime you pause the video just to fix the way the video lags and it's pretty annoying. I hope this will be fixed if ever an update will be available.,
"Though the courses are awesome. But the are a few bugs. (1) After watching few tutorials it starts disrupting the video Then I have to close the application and have to wait for few minutes like half an hour. Then it starts working fine. But again after 45 minutes it happens. I think it's giving me time for rest seriously fix this bug.üòÇüòÇ Jokes apart, but (2) When I start watching videos, my phone heats up like a small heater, everytime. Thank You for the rest. Please check this.",
"Some limitations compared to the browser version of coursera, otherwise pretty good.",
"overall very cool resource. however is so unbelievable that you cannot use it on android (app and Web because of lack of must have features). and is unrealistic to submit a bug (simply no way)! that's why I put here as review which doesn't make any sense and should be a separate thing. Details about the issue : The app allows you to watch videos and read some texts. The issue goes with quizzes and assignments. It simply doesn't support it. I've reproduced the issue many times with Project management course by Google. Same time I've tried to have a workaround by using a browser, and nothing loads on quizzes even if try to emulate desktop experience. Cmon folks is ""22 yr and many phones and tablets has power like a laptop and support external screens with physical mouse and keyboard! No idea why the experience should differ from Windows or Linux.",
"Terrible experience! I have enrolled in the UX design course. It contains 7 different courses, I have completed the first one now I'm not able to access the second one. I enrolled in the 2nd one, but it keeps showing not enrolled. There is no option to start learning. I've never had such a terrible experience on a website or app. The irony is they are providing courses on better user experience but their website is designed so badly. Never been so frustrated in my entire life!",
"Am glad for the easy and available access to the courses, learning with comfortability",
Please put in dark mode. Dark mode is really helpful for visually impaired persons like myself. Thank You.,
"The app is phenomenal BUT! I really wish it had like a wishlist option. It's not possible to enroll into all the courses one likes in a single go. Thus, a wishlist where we can keep track of the courses we want to enroll into once we've completed our current ones will be really helpful! It'll allow us to complete a streamlined set of courses without getting deviated too much (Because c'mon! there are just too many interesting things to learn here!)",
"I'm not liking this app at all. The videos do not auto rotate even if I turn on landscape mode. Now I can't seem to find my program I'm running. The UI is dull. I cant enable dark mode, the app is just too white and bright. Doesn't make learning fun. Needs improvement in the user interface area. Also for an app that services a lot of app development courses and all, this is not a good representation of the resources you guys have.",
"Coursera's impact extends beyond individuals, as businesses and governments also benefit from upskilled workforces and informed citizens. It fosters a culture of lifelong learning, empowering people to adapt and thrive in our ever-evolving world. Coursera, with its blend of accessibility, diversity, and excellence, exemplifies a paramount learning ecosystem, enriching lives and shaping a brighter future.",
"One of the things that have hampered my learning with this app is the UX! Seriously, why would a video be playing and the viewer can't make out the message on the screen because the interface for playback tools/options remain onscreen instead of disappearing until when viewer needs to use them (they should appear when the video screen is tapped, or something)? What's the point of having videos one would not enjoy watching at all?",
lots of improvement has been made. it makes studying on the phone more comfortable,
Great app with great content to use on the Mobile. sad that some forms are not properly displayed and have to be done on a larger screen device.,
"I've moved my rating up from 1 star to 2 star, some of the courses on this platform are great, but there are a lot to choose from so it can be hard to find the good one. The reason why I haven't rated it higher is because the app still looks and feels terrible. The worst part is the text fields used for completing assignments never work. This makes the app redundant for assignments, but at least you can watch videos on it, they got that right (sort of)",
Its very good platform for learning skill and improve your spoken English and many skill.,
"i don't like the flow of the app when it comes to course navigation. Also, i couldn't find my courses. You have to have CC active to see the transcript.",
"FANTASTIC app. FANTASTIC platform. Applied for a grant about 2 weeks ago, it just got approved. This is huge for me. THANK YOU COURSERA. Them there's the app that just makes everything seemless. Haven't experienced an issue yet. Great job guys",
"excellent application for learning so good. it's a great platform, intuitive, easy for use, interesting, beautiful. and so much better, the learning is certificated. excellent. simply, the best",
"Coursera has been an awesome platform for me, from the financial aid which is an opportunity for me to learn data science to the interface and learning experience, it's been awesome.",
"Very good platform for learning in demand skills online, however there should be room for wishlist or save for later to be able to save courses or specialization you don't want to enroll immediately so I'm giving 4 stars",
"Great app: works well, even on small screen, and basically free (can pay to receive full certification but generally the content is free and and not leg breakingly expensive)",
"Loving this class so far: easy to navigate; multiple learning styles to reinforce the material; diversity honoured, respectful teaching methods and word choice; and bite sized modules for a busy lifestyle",
"In my opinion, it's the ardent learner's choice. It's the upgraded YouTube. If you want to learn from the best, choose Coursera. If you want to be the best, choose Coursera. If you want others to be the Best, recommend Coursera.",
the mobile app is pretty good üòäüíØ but organizing and going through different modules and courses can get a bit confusing so the UI can be totally improved more,
Sorriest app i have ever installed. Out of the box it doesn't allow me to login via SSO. It pains me to say i would be happier with Udemy. Imagine that...I am choosing Udemy because their app actually works! Unbelievable!,
I love it I applied for course funding and got approved. Very helpful. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn news things or develop their careers. Keep up the good work!,
"I really wish Coursera is one and the only recommended online study center, i really found it very interesting that you wouldn't believe it until you get through. 5 Stars+ to Coursera.",
"Very expensive, even for courses that you might find on YouTube. They get you because you can't get any certificates that I know of without paying high fees.",
"I can't complain. Affordable, smooth interface and usability and excellent value.",
"Best online courses and free! But issues with login, every other day i have to log in again and again, sometimes i forget my passw and its a hassle. Fix please",
"The reason why this app is far better than udemy is because it is overall mobile friendly. This app allows to enter code, has a compiler, have quiz option which makes this app user friendly comparing to other apps.",
"This is the best application on the planet for online learning. I am very happy being here, and my learning experience has been awesome. Please join me to enjoy the wonderful experience of coursera",
The Course Data Analysis is an interesting course to enroll in. The tutors and lesson note are easy to understand... I am happy and excited I made this great decision. Cheers.... From Victoria Effiong from Nigeria.,
I completed nearly half portion of the course google data analytics but after update I lost all my progress can you please fix it ... Or I'll have to leave the course I can't invest that much time again,
The Google Project Management course is well explained and easy to understand. Thank you to the entire team for presenting such a course to us which enhances our knowledge and skills to become a successful project manager.,
"I've tried a lot of sites to learn Korean. but I believe the most accurate, easy is available here. yonsei University is the best.",
I'm so glad that I have got this little opportunity to be part of Coursera students to improve my knowledge and gain skills and experience. this app is really amazing!,
so far so good. on my pixel 7 pro this app functions more or less exactly as it would on my laptop,
"The content on Coursera is phenomenal, as are the periodic projects and peer grading that use what I learn, and therefore deepen my learning. The app has some bugs. It freezes my phone sometimes. I can't upload pics/files from my phone when submitting projects. If you fix that, it would save me emailing them to myself, downloading on my computer, unzipping, and finally, uploading. It doesn't really let me do peer grading when on the go.",
"The app is not usable without a network connection, or with poor WiFi, even though i have already downloaded on content to use offline. The app becomes very unresponsive, slow in loading and when trying to start a downloaded video, and more often than not crashes. it's great when I've a good connection, but when I'm on my morning commute I want to use the app but end up more frustrated because of how the app behaves without wifi.",
"So far, I really like this app. I've only started so I'm browsing the offered courses a lot to find courses that interest me. I'm missing some sort of list that I can put courses on that I might want to take later. Kind of inconvenient having to look for the courses all over again after finishing a course (given I'll remember them at all).",
"This Coursera learning application is good as per my personal experience. However, as per my own experience, may I suggest that it could have been better, if it was easier to get a certificate, instead of endless waiting as when someone will see your assignment and review the same. I have finished my course and have enjoyed the classes. I have also paid for the course. However, I am still waiting for the certificate. Hope I receive the same.",
"The app won't accept the email address used on the web account. This caused confusion, time looking for login credentials and the abandonment of my course for months. Typing in input fields in the app is pointless as the cursor keeps moving in front of the letter that's just been typed. The result is a jumbled mess of letters. Also the progress of videos isn't remembered, so if you navigate away then return you have to start again or guess where you left off. Feels like a broken experience.",
"Wow! it's an amazing learning platform, I have learnt how to build a mobile app within a short time",
excellent studying platform. Though I am only scratching the surface I can firmly say this online platform pay the way for an enduring and satisfying learning experience,
"Well resourcefull, rich of knowledge delivered in a most organized easily comprehensive pattern of tutorage.",
It's great to learn new things from here and develop new skills. Also add to your character. Give it a try.,
"Fabulous app honestly. It didn't glitch at all. Courses are all good. I'm here from SCIENCE OF WELL-BEING @Yaleuniversity. Loved the course, beneficial with rational views.‚úåüèº",
"Great learning, and the instructor made it look so simple. Thanks Cousera",
I have been using the app for several months and was satisfied with it. But this update has bugs that need to be fixed asap. 1/ It is difficult to find and access the course one is currently taking. Why changing what works well? 2/ The video player doesn't work and it shows an error message when we want to watch.,
"The UI is great, but I experienced issues with the synchronisation of data. Progress made online on the main desktop browser did not reflect immediately (my last week did not update on the app until course completion). Offline use of videos in the app did not synchronise back to the online view of the app, therefore, I had to watch them again in online mode to log completion. Offline use is very important as one can work through content while in transit or out of range of internet connectivity.",
"Programs are great easy way to learn new skills and topics on the side. But, and it's a big one. BUT the app sucks. It doesn't update well with the browser work, you can't do much in app apart from listening to a lecture but if you want to do more like add another lecture you have to use the browser",
"I think this is a great platform, not had a single grievance since I started working with this program. great work guys",
The platform is great for learning and the courses are filled with knowledge,
"One of the best online course learning ever. In fact, the best!",
Missing a lot of options and futures in comparison with the web version.,
Coursera is the best platform for learning. I strongly recommend it.,
It's been interesting so far. Great work you're doing for mankind coursera. Thank you.,
it's giving us more knowledge and information than my expectations when we focus on...,
It's a well informative course though tricky to pass if you not re-read the questions,
Best space for learning a good skills that can help get a dream job.,
Now I am beginner but this app is helping me alot of because I want to improve my listening ability and speech delivered,
a very good and wonderful app for reading and studying online courses,
it's a brilliant application that offers and create great opportunities for self developing and improving,
"Coursera is the other hope outside formal school settings,... impressive learning experiences here!",
the course is intuitive with hands on real life application,
I love this place where we can learn almost everything to our hearts content and at anytime,
Great app but Dark mode should be there. It should be mandatory Please update with dark mode Then will change it to 5,
"A great application, but please support translation with artificial intelligence",
Very good app with a user friendly interface,
it is a very good app to learn online courses..,
Cousera is a great up for learning.Take more courses to enrich yourself,
"App does what it should. Though there are few bugs. First, impossible to completely delete material. After deletion each course in preloaded material keeps having 10-500kb and just clutters visual(UI) space. It becomes harder to find what I need. Another issue is with list of my courses. It's not convenient to horizontal scroll courses in a specialization. If I take 5th course of 5-course specialization then I need to scroll horizontally every time",
"very easy to use , platform promotes love to study",
Great platform for online courses. My favourite.,
Coursera app Helps students to save time ‚è≤ during the course.,
"Awesome but one bad flaw The app is great except fpr one pet peeve: on a finicky network connection it takes forever to resume a cpurse despite the videos already downloaded. What's worse, the app freezes, preventing the user from switching to the offline mode. Consider auto-switching to offline mode if it takes e.g. more than 10 seconds to perform any network operation.",
"Coursera is perhaps the best platform for online learning, but this app is WORSE THAN RUBBISH. It frequently crashes my phone, making it completely frozen, and I'm forced to power cycle it to recover. The interface is not user-friendly on phones with small screens. Moreover, the app doesn't appear to work without a live network connection, which means you can't learn on the go. My daily commute is the only time I have during the day for watching lecture videos, but I can't do that with this app. I used to be a Coursera fanatic, but now I'm not able to take their classes on account of their app being totally unusable. Consequently, I rarely take Coursera classes now. It's a shame that such a great online platform for learning has been let down by such a poor app.",
I have learned many things at this platform. I have shortage of words to admire Coursera. thanks you Coursera.,
"The courses coverage aside. My review is primarily on the monetary policy. There is a loot going on, you need to check out a free trial by giving credit card details and then there is no warning but direct deduction from card and no refund policy over that. Anyone using this app/website should beware of financial transactions with them. I have lost a good amount.",
"good courses are offered and their are good trainers also ,in a blink I would like to say just join and make your career achievements have a stronger boost",
"Coursera is the best learning platform, i would recommend it to my friends and family.",
"Smooth, responsive and error free as an app that brings Soo many courses together in one place.",
Best platform to do global standard of learning,
"I am not a fan of writing reviews but i was forced to write about this particular app. I was managing the older version and i was finding it difficult to learn my course. The reason this app hangs while watching the videos and for me to press fast forward button before it can play is what i don't know. I update to the latest version and it is the worst, like i can't learn my course up to 2sec without my video hanging and me pressing forward button. No offense, please look into it. Thank you.",
"The app is amazing but I have two major issues that need to be solved. First, the font is too small for reading pages and there is no way to make it bigger than changing phone font. I need an option for changing page font during reading. The second issue, is some pages stick to portrait and dosn't flip to be landscape on the tablet. Thank you",
Learning is easy and options are great!,
"What the app tries to do is great! But it does it pretty bad. It keeps crashing and freezing and the offline feature doesn't work well (not all of the content is available offline). In its current state, I dont find the app usable. It's a shame, the app could be really good!",
"I like coursera, but...Video player is horrible. Video is truncated at left and right on my tablet in landscape mode. It is all fine, but when you have text on the video it sucks. Have to use it in portrait but in this case video takes space equals to phone size. It would be great to have fit screen video player, so that it will have black top and bottom, but video won't be cut.",
this is great I ever had. thank you. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to do digital marketing e-commerce programs 10/10,
Coursera course are really inspiring and educative. No regret from taking their courses,
The App is Pretty Good But Many Improvements and Bug Fixes are required to run app smoothly.,
I have choosen correct answer but it shows incorrect. When I want see correct answer it shows correct answer (which is also choosen by me).,
coursera is a very broad platform that is good for IT skills learning. Awesome,

Coursera has been of great help to learn from and with. It's a great app,
This is the best app to learn any skills online with easy access of all manners of courses,
"Full of knowledge, and easy to use. Thank you Coursera",

The app is always crashing every few minutes It started when i recently updated it,
really helpful thanks to people who loves to help other. Coursera is the best!,
"The app has been great so far. I don't have anything to complain about. Got approved for financial aid, so I'm hoping it all works out for me.",
one of the best platforms to begin your online course where you find most beneficial stuffs....‚ú®,
"I use it to gain high quality education, anytime and anywhere. I love this app!",
"a great platform, and a useful app. wonderful courses.",
"I really love the app, for it ability to promote remote learning.",
It's been a easy one for me through this app. I don't have to carry my laptop around to learn. Great app!,
I am really progressing well with this app I can't wait to start my own practices after this course and I am positively hoping to reach my goal,
"Coursera is a great platform for students, individual or institutions to expand their knowledge on any career path",
"Great platform Ever Recommended for Students especially in Colleges, Undergraduate and Masters !!!",
"An awesome self-paced learning platform. One of the best, if not the best!",
"I don't like the new update, that was perfect 1 week ago!! I don't recommend to people to update it",
I am really excited and enjoying and feeling my skills are enhanced by using this.,
The download button is hidden in the latest update and I can't get to my downloads when neither I'm offline nor online,
the best online school i ever attend. good friendly instructors. latest content and and a very friendly app for taking lectures in comfortable manner,
Fantastic app that allows self paced learning. I enjoy using Coursera,
"I love with Coursera , we can easily read and get knowledge and obtain courses",
A really authentic source to enhance and learn new things and skills with freemium to give permission to all people.,
This is really helpful but I wish more courses would be free.,
Coursera helps upgrading and updating me to the latest requirements on the Industry we live in.! I can vouch on this!,
great app interface for quizes and watching video lectures.,
Pleeeeeeeaaaase add night mode. Very essential feature.,
the app is much more easy and simple to study with.,
difficult but what it teaches prepares you for almost anything outside,
"Great for learning anywhere, anytime at your own pace.",
Amazing. Coursera takes higher learning to a new level.,
This is a useful platform for learning who could not go to abroad.,
"Hello, Coursera is the best online studying platform I have ever come across. Join all, let's grow together.",
I like coursera than edx . I gave 4 stars because some courses can't audit for Free.,
"no support through call or mail for any issue raised,very frustrated",
easier to use and videos are at full screen then website viewer,
it's a great place to learn about data analysis and other courses.,
i am glad to see this app in my phone every day it so simple and free i mean really thank you for giving us this chance to develop our life's,
actually testing and no any bigger problems at trial period.,
I am currently doing google data analytics specialization. it's a perfect for me.,
Downloading video is painful Can't download videos and its buggy,
"Convenient and good to use, but started to loggin out very frequently! It strange but can't open any already downloaded material when offline! What is it?",
I'm using Coursera on a tablet and it would be better if the app can be designed in such a way that it can stay in landscape mode. It's hard when the app keep shifting like when viewing the homepage it stays on portrait mode and when you click a course it could be in landscape or portrait but when you go back to home only portrait is available and you have to tilt your neck every time! üò™,
"The courses are structured well but there is a claim that credits can be gained and used to further studies at other institutions after to doing the courses but when youre done, there is a disclaimer on the certificate saying the course is a ""Non credit"" course. This is very confusing and the disclaimer does not look attractive on the certificates. My further isssue is the fact that we cant use phones or tablets to do assignments, this affects studying while on the road or while on the move.",
"App is generally good. I mostly use it to view videos and go through materials on the go. Layout seems to be fine, and works with mobile. But I'm deducting one star because there is some issue that it can't seem to download offline materials through wifi. It always download just a fraction, and then the wifi-signal indicator turns or be inconsistent (i.e. no transmission). Not an issue of wifi since the signal is quite strong and I could download and do other stuff without problems. The only way I could download offline content seems to be using data only.",
"As many other users have said, this app is atrocious for video/audio playback with constant buffering resulting in an extremely choppy experience. It does not matter if you download the content because whatever is causing this issue occurs regardless. This does not facilitate a good learning environment! If I could give zero stars I would!",
"Wonderful learning platform,I will recommend this platform to anyone",
"This app is pretty good actually. Simple interface & easy to use. But there's one thing that I would suggest. What if you add a wishlist tab? It's kind of tiring when I look up for a course and interested in it, and since I have several course going on I have no time to take it, so I have to write the course name down my notes to enroll later. It would be nice to have a ‚ú© or ‚ô° button to save the desired courses. Or something like youtube's Watch Later. Thank you, you guys already helps so much!",
"Does not work. There are only two options after I log in: to sign up/create an account, and log in/out (I show as logged in with FB). No option to browse the courses, access profile, anything. Just to log out&log in with email. Also, crashes after logging.This is extremely weird. I have used Coursera years ago on computer, wanted to start this habit again... But the app simply doesn't work. I tried logging in and opening it several times. Even deleted and reinstalled the ap. Nothing has changed.",
"This application sucks! Complete waste of time. The courses I have subscribed in do not appear on my homepage. Troubleshooting refers only to desktop or laptop option, but I couldn't find any troubleshooting for the mobile app. They could have at least provided the flexibility to allow you to enroll in the course through your subscription page, but they did not even bother... Keep away:(",
"Generally android version is OK, except two things which are annoying. First one is, when you make the video to full size, it does not fit my screen and some part of thevideo(left side) does not show. Second one is, when you want to do the labs, it does not open the tools page. So everytime I have to use a browser to do the lab even in the same device.",
"Even though there are still things you'll need to do online, the app works perfectly.",
Coursera notes and videos lay out the information in a very simple and straight forward language. Making it fun to learn.,
"Sometime gave me error ""something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try agian"". But when I played again nothing is fixed, so terrible. On IOS don't get this error. Please fix it.",
"for a long time I've wished to be in the IT world but it wasn't easy for me, a lot of things was at stake like how to even go about it, how yo finance the program and so on till coursera was introduced to me and trust me it was the best esp for offering Scholarship to those who can't afford it",
"Somewhat slow ompared to the website version. Also after completing a section it doesnt register sometimes for a few minutes, hich doesnt allow me to go to the next part. Overall I like it though.",
The full screen keeps cutting off edges on my tab. Really annoying overall great app though. But I think I prefer the online version on my laptop,
"Perfection and easy to use. Although it can't call be done via mobile, it's still really good and easy to use. Perfect for multitasking as well",
Coursera is a great option to obtain advanced educational skills towards a career path. I highly recommend this if you want to advance your knowledge and skills without the expensive cost of college courses.,
"For some reason I can't play the videos of some courses, I think it needs update but there's no update But other than that everything is amazing, I love learning in this platform.",
I detest this app! I've trying to change my password since I forgot the old one and they keep sending me unrelated emails when I request for a password reset!!! Very frustrating useless app!!!,
"Amazing app with easy to use interface. It has wide features such as download for later, which is amazing. loved it.",
App is absolute garbage The courses are amazing but it's near impossible to get anything done properly on this app. So many bugs. Please fix,
"Coursera is a dream for those who love to learn. In addition, the affordability of the AAA grade courses and skills taught can be life changing. Bravo Coursera!",
"Coursera is a great place to learn and develop yourself,I started a course a couple of weeks ago and I'm really convinced at the progress and everything I'm destined to derive.",
"I purchased ux design course and they gave me free Adobe xd subsciption with it but when i am trying to redeem my reward it says page can't load. Now i have stuck in my course for more than a month and i can't complete my course i have already sent email regarding my issue but got no response from them. Absolutely pathetic customer service. Dissapointed Adding another issue with this platform Currently i can't access my course from my account, they say you don't have any course. Pathetic service",
"For some reason you can't do quizzes and tests in the app, but you can do them just fine in a mobile browser. Coursera, what is the point of your app if it can't even match the features of the mobile website?",
"I updated the app and now its showing me ""no other courses"" or not able to find it, it was working fine before the update. Please kindly look into this matter as soon as possible.",
"It's amazing and best of learning platform ever seen. I enjoyed Coursera app easy to navigate and flexible. I'm enjoying my course, Feeling like not to log out lol. so excited. Thanks COURSERA.",
"Accessible application for learning, but one concern, sometimes for my friends app font colors become white , it makes difficult to readability. for me the Coursera app Is üíØ for everything.",
Coursera is a great app for learning. I love the way it makes learning fun and easy to understand. it's flexible and very engaging. keep up the good work.,
It is a very great application for study and there are a lot of courses available for you. Learning experience is easy and fun.,
I need verification just for my certificates. Your verification doesnt even work. You dont allow uploaded photos of our government IDs and encourage the use of coursera's built in camera. Your built in camera DOES NOT WORK so how will we even get what we came in for?,
"Coursera might look lucrative when it comes to online courses but has third class horrible customer service. Most of their support is based on arrogance. Since Im writing this review from India, they dont recognize India at all, makes me wonder who permitted them to do business when they dont know India or Indians. Extremely HIGH priced courses, no UPI payment method, app is buggy & no dark theme. Anyways, if it wasn't for Google courses, I would have not jumped on this but would look altrns. üí©",
"Payed 9 payments of $79 instead of 4. I got charged over $700 for a course. I got charged double, but they don't do refunds. Be VERY VERY CAREFUL.",
App does not work... Money scam! Google UX designer program is the worst experience I've ever had. They have no Customer Service and whenever you report an issue it just goes into the void. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!,
Please make this actually available to use on phones and tablets. It always says I need a bigger screen to watch videos. No one wants to have to use their laptops constantly.,
It's a very good platform for learning new things and skills. The courses and lessons are related to real world and current situations.,
"Coursera app is a very awesome app to download and use from time to time without regrets especially for users who are new online learning. Its usable, enjoyable, equitable and useful.",
This course is helping in gaining more knowledge. The assignment and quizzes provided are really interesting and brainstorming.,
"The new update has crashed the app. Even if the wifi is connected, the app doesn't display content.",
Developers have failed miserably. Doesn't work well with dark mode on Android. It is a mess. I guess they need to take a course!,
"Years ago, I was confused about where I needed to be in my career until I came across this platform. Coursera has provided an opportunity for me to choose courses of my desire, study at my own pace, build up my resume and gain confidence in the job market and the cool thing about coursera is that it is open for anybody in any part of the world to grab. I am greatful for such an amazing opportunity.",
coursera has helped me learn a lot in my four years of engineering... you can audit the courses without need to buy subscription... it really helps.,
I'm not able to attend weekly assignment on mobile app and i don't have a laptop or system can someone tell me if it is compulsory to attend the weekly assignment. Coursera help section is such a waste.,
"When I tap on My Subscriptions, it says ""There was an error loading my purchases."" Please fix this. Also I cannot find a way to bookmark/wishlist courses.",
Mobile app is the best thing that you have added. Whenever i get free time i invest 30 min in learning. There are some pages that won't load on mobile but i know with update you will fix it.,
Please introduce the dark mode. And the app performance plummets to the dark depths of crash when the you open the settings option. Ty <3,
This course is an eye opener to becoming a successful security analyst. Each part of this course are well structured and the content is broken down to lay man understanding.,
It's really a good app for learning and broadening of one's knowledge. Getting certificates is however the issues for those who are not financially buoyant.,
Filter option doesn't work. All filters not available.7 day trial option not visible. Can't bookmark a course I liked. No sort option.,
Pretty impressive and enlightening. Small gaps for improvement as with most things in life. I wish I had more time to take advantage of what is offered. Absolutely worth while.,
"Life Changing App. Great content and purpose. One of the best learning platform for online formal education. Financial aid, a life saving option.",
"The introductory course to cybersecurity is very informative, easy to understand and motivating. I am inspired by the two testimonials shared so far.",
"Perfect for easy learning, I have only one point didn't like about producing the trainer which take longer than expected.",
"I used to be able to take classes for free, but now every single class is 59.99 or 49.99. Even 15-hour classes. I'll just teach myself for that.",
Would be 5 stars because of content and convenience but the app messes up so often that I have to get on web browser on my phone or tablet and do courses through their website.,
I love the app. It's easy to navigate while doing my research on web Chrome and resuming my studies after taking a break.,
Great app for upskilling. I enjoyed the Google data analytics course and the Google project management course. I like that some courses can be audited.,
"Hi. Thank you very much for developing a mobile app for Coursera, which has helped me a lot in my professional life. I would like to give it 5 stars, but there's an issue the developers need to fix. I can watch lectures in different qualities depending on my network connection, but when I try to download them for later offline use, the videos are downloaded in HD and this consumes lot of mobile data as well as phone storage. Please fix this and let us download lectures in low quality as well.",
"I pause the video to observe some details in code or equation. But , I can't view the screen because video controls does not hide. They cover up the screen. Please consider including the option to zoom the video like in YouTube. Watching code tutorials on small mobile screen is sometimes difficult even though my eyesight is perfect and I don't need glasses. So zooming would be a helpful addition for mobile learners.",
A very impressive way of learning is there on Coursera,
Edit: The new update fixed the problem. Thank you coursera. Changed rating to 5 stars. ****************************** Earlier post: The latest update has a bug. The screen is permanently dimmed with the navigation buttons obstructing the previously downloaded videos when on playback. I'm using a Samsung phone with android 8.,
"The app works perfectly and updates my computer sign in quickly. The only complaint I have is that the tests are designed to be used on a computer, not your phone. This is annoying since I want to use this on my breaks, lunch, and any available time I have, which means I might not have my computer to take the tests. Other than that, great service and great instructions.",
"Lot of problems playing videos. I keep getting 'something wrong with the player' error. Updated, restarted did everything. Pretty frustrating experience with the app. And why dont they show the course i have enrolled as soon as i open the app? I have to search for my ongoing course. Why doesnt the next video play automatically? The UX designer deserves a turing award!",
"gr8 till so far till teaching and quiz, lets see if after certification does dat really help to get job which is more important",
Even though I have downloaded the videos the playback is not smooth when you have bad signal reception. Its next to impossible to understand what instructor is saying. This app was probably not built for offline experience. If you are not on network then app won't even show you your enrolled courses. It's no big rocket science to cache some of the data locally and make the offline experience better. Please relook the offline experience,
Very good course. Everybody should enroll to this course.,
Excellent for listening to the audios and reading the transcripts for focused learning.,
the packages here are just too awesome and make learning dun,
"This is a great app. If I could rate a 10, I promise I would do it.",
"I have bn studying Entrepreneurship for beginners and I have noticed that 1. the modules are well planned, concise and straight to the point. Even though English is my 2nd language which I am very good at, I have bn able to follow the lessons in Spanish with the aid of the transcript and learn a bit of Spanish in the process. I've also cross referenced the information and it's accurate. nothing is rushed. I recommend it",
"Worst app I've ever seen. It keeps crashing and whenever I play any lecture, it plays fine for few minutes, but after that it keep on stopping again and again. Whenever I try to download the lecture, it crashes. Have updated the app multiple times, but the bugs are not fixing. It get even worse with every update.",
"Wow! I am deeply grateful for this opportunity, learning this Project Management Program is a mouth full. I am completely impressed with the training material and and their deliveries.",
"I would give it a five star but bcos of a few major bugs I'm holding back. First of all it said on the official website that I can't unroll from a course I had applied for in the previous version of the website and app. And second, bcos of college exams I couldn't finish the module of one week. And so I want to reset my deadlines. But it stops responding and many times right after taking a quiz, the app shows an error and resets the quiz. This is seriously annoying and time consuming. Do fix it.",
Has not been able to load a video on Android in weeks for the IT course. Forced to use desktop.,
"An embarrassingly broken app. Sometimes the videos reset while watching. If the app is moved to background while watching (e.g. for taking notes), the video is reset. The app doesn't memorize the video position in general, so if one changes module and goes back, the old video position is reset. The module ""Resume"" functionality works only when online. What the hell!?",
Easy to learn and Can Get international certificate or degree from online.,
"Courses are satisfactory , but the thing I felt it is short of is, courses heavily lack practice questions and exercises, more practice content (more good if they are real and practical in nature or industry level exposure) , heavy testing to complete courses, so that, in the end student really can appreciate that couresera course really transformed his/her life. Video based learning can play it's role in learning upto some extent only, it cannot make student think on his own.",
"Since the update, I can't even sign in. Keeps losing the internet connection. That problem was due to problems with my internet service provider. Now, I use the app offline. I download the unit material and tap aeroplane mode in order to access downloads rather than the online version. The answers to quizzes are supposed to be saved and graded once back online. This doesn't happen. I have to do the quizzes again online in order to get them graded.",
"Great platform for learning, upgrading a skill, picking a new career, and there are 1000 of courses to choose from. I was introduced to Coursera some few years back and it's been an interesting journey so far. I recommend Coursera as an awesome learning platform to anyone around the world. Good instructors, you can learn at your own pace, contribute in discussions, peer review and courses are made lively as possible. A 5 star Platform for learning.",
"I don't know what you have done to this good application , I could see good quality videos when I downloaded them, but after previous few updates downloaded video scenes slow mo I don't know stucks video stucks, only audio works and the subtitles works, Please fix this, Note: when I use Wi-Fi to see videos the video seems good but only after I download them this problem occurs Update: this happens to the courses created by Google",
It has gone very slow after last update please fix it üôè,
Buyer beware ..... My youngest tried the free trial didn't like the sight and canceled the subscriptions now 4 months later they somehow were able to access the debit card and charge the acct without authorization Look at others whom are complaining about the same thing....,
"The download feature often stopped progressing and the problem persists even after deleting, redownloading the course. There's no problem with my internet connection. It didn't help to clear cache or clear data either. The problem disappear after a clean app uninstall-reinstall, but repeating this so often is a very unpleasant experience.",
Amazing place to learn. Thank You Coursera cheers!,
thanks. learning is simplified and amazing.,
"I love the app but after the update it is impossible to pay for anything. I have completed a course and now I would like to pay and get my certificate but with the new update it's impossible. There is no such option to make payment after you enroll for free. I usually enroll for free and see if I like the course but pay afterwards. It was possible in the earlier versions but the update made it really confusing. Also the earlier versions audio, subtitle and the course text options were way better",
"Logs you out all the time, very annoying. If you enrolled in a course of a program, it does show all courses of the program, but you have to vertically scroll to all past courses to get to the one you are currently enrolled. The completed courses only have an enroll button, but why would you want to enroll in a course you already completed? saving and resuming ongoing exam clears multiple choice answers of the first question. Playback speed setting reset on reading exercise.",
"Worked fine, untill the update to the most recent version. Now, the text below the videos isn't automatically time indexed, any more. It's just, a basic text file. Whoever this was, I am not impressed. You've just ruined, an otherwise great feature, of this application. (App version: 3.33.1).",
"Recent update broke video viewing on mobile. Every video is displaying the HUD overlay (pause, skip, subtitle and resolution buttons), constantly, in both full screen and minimised view. Uninstall and reinstall also didn't help. Please fix so I can see the people I learn from again! üòÅ Then I'll give 5 stars as well, because the app itself is great. üòÖ",
"This app isn't working as it should. It is pretty good for watching video lessons, and that's all. The app doesn't remember or tend to forget your progress. When you try to do peers evaluating, it asks for comments and doesn't see them, insisting there is no text no matter how long my comments are. And it shows that I failed to pass modules because I had not submitted my assignments, though in desktop version everything is ok.",
"This platform really fits my needs. I can resume from where I stopped, even when switching from the web to the app",
"I've signed up for a course that only downloads to my cell phone, but has assignments I can only open on a laptop. How the hell am I supposed to complete this course that I'm paying boat loads of money for if I can't open/download the assignments?",
"Whenevere i wanna try use this app the below message shows : ""We re making hard to make this content perfect on android devices, try again in a few hours. """,
"This app is terrible. Coursera is great this is just a review for the app. Can't play a single video I keep getting a ""whoops something went wrong while attempting to play this video"" I've been doing my course work on a laptop thought it be nice to just watch videos here and there on my phone but nope guess that's not gonna happen. Tried uninstall, clearing cache but nothing. Just stick to doing your course work on a computer.",
So far so good. The courses seem interesting and it's indicated that you can earn credits.,
"I cannot hide the video controls in this app. It plays fine through the website and on my laptop. So clearly this is an issue with the video player used in the app. When the controls time out, instead of hiding, the player flashes and the controls stay on. The flashing is annoying and I've finally given up.",
VERY SIMPLE TO USE AND PERFECT FOR SMOOTH EDUCATION PROGRAM,
Best online learning platform. Ever!,
"It's interesting to know that one can gain more knowledge with ease and at the comfort of your home. No bugs, works pretty well. Well done!!!!",
"The app does not load my ""Learn"" page. It shows the message ""We had trouble loading your data"". When I tap on the ""retry"" button, the same message appears. I have tried reinstalling the app but the problem still exists. How am I supposed to learn anything if my main learning page does not work? This is extremely frustrating.",
I am starting to settle in to a study schedule that fits my when and where able 2z and picking up where you left off is as simple as 1-2-3 . I already believe that this course will be invaluable to me.,
First of all i say about it cousrsera is very best for everyone because its gives to everyone a opportunity to learn about related computer courses. and then. I start a course from it i love coursera....,
Great opportunity for those who just want to know about a specific subject or course.,
Lots of issues with transcript feature in new update,
A great way to learning with the cousera App.. Super excited using it now!,
Coursera is the best platform to learn online because it provides the best quality of education with proper examination system.,
Wonderful app. Great features. The only problem is that my phone heats up after I'm into few minutes of a video. Then the video and audio starts lagging. I have to restart the app to get the videos run smoothly. This is the case for even videos that have been downloaded for offline watch. Need a fix for this!,
Thanks Coursera for making my learning a smooth one. You stand out among others,
"This is great platform to learning, I really appreciate the way they impart the right ingredients in leadership development.",
"I've used it for a few weeks now, and I can say it is pretty good! One thing I would like to see is dark mode!! Unless it is there somewhere and it hasn't been discovered yet!",
"Coursera app is great. It enables faster learning. Unfortunately, it's available for more newer Android versions.",
Is now that I come to know the sweetness of coursera app. Very easy to use.,
"If I press the home button, receive a call, or just switch to another app temporarily, it doesn't maintain the state of the video I was playing. Thus coming back, I have to find that video, start it from zero, and adjust the slider to where I left. This is very bad and unprofessional.",
"very inconvenient. hard to have a general view of all courses one is taking. plus small but stupid glitches like the view is recentered on each screen touch and you have to scroll down again. update may 2019: after an update of the application, coursera app does not see previously downloaded courses. 2 gb silently buried. great job!",
"It's amazing, easy to learn at your schedule and better understanding.",
"Not Optimized The previous version worked well and I much preferred the layout. I seldom used my tablet but now I do and it is never quite clear why things work as they do. After years of fitting the Coursera typical demographic of a learner who had a degree and basically dabbled I wanted to finish two very different courses, before reaching a conclusion about future study. I had a strong start and now difficulties with the app are perhaps a newer world issue.",
I like this platform very much. Good experience of learning,
"Deep information about it infrastructure and easy explanation of, what precaution to be kept in mind before doing anything changes in it infrastructure life cycle.",
"This application is a great learning platform. This application provides valuable course and certificates. You can do courses with top universities and course provider like IBM , Google , Microsoft ,harverd and more.",
"The app often crashes or cannot load courses. It's also quite difficult to navigate or explore many courses available, and we cannot see introduction video of a course unless we visit the course page via website. While playing course video, the app doesn't remember our progress by duration, so if you for some reasons have to stop playing the video halfway, you'll start it back from the first minute once you get back to the video.",
"While this course is by no means perfect or error-free, it provides an excellent introduction to consumer neuroscience to someone with a background in psychology. Its main strengths are its broad overview and the extensive collection of research literature it provides. Those reviews which are more critical tend to focus solely on the video content which is a less significant part of the course.",
"All courses discussion are completely bugged... If you start writting the letters are positioned randomly and, at some point, it ends crashing the section with the message ""Sorry, we are down for maintenance.We will be back up shortly."" So I can't progress my courses on the app. Furthermore, the app lose the account several times (and force you to login again) and, when that happens, the offline feature doesn't work. It force you to login when cliking on any course item.",
"Videos don't play smoothly. After playing a video for a while, it starts to lag and becomes very irritating. Closing the app and reopening removes the problem. But you'd have to do that every 4 minutes or so. Also, I joined some courses on the app but I can't access those courses through my laptop. On desktop, it says ""No more enrollments left""",
"Good UI, nice content; Sometimes though content cannot be played/viewed (eg. YouTube Videos or Assignment components)",
it's very sad that the app isn't optimized for tablets. You also can't go with the browser version as rhyme didn't su[[ort mobile version of browser. It's verys strange and sad. Looking forward to see you in real cross-platform world. Will not use the app - will read the texts in browser and will need to start up the pc to complete exercizes in rhyme.,
one of the best app which helps you to learn a lot of skills for a better future,
It's a wonderful app for learning from the very best and learning formally. To keep my learning continued I do have the Coursera plus subscription active. My only real complain from the app is that the videos do not resume from where you left them off. This should be an obvious requirement and easily achiveable technically. Some sort of note taking abilities within the app should also be a good feature to add to the app.,
"App is ok, it has its glitches at time. Yet for the most part Coursera: Learn career skills is a work in progress just like every other developing app out their in the Play store selection. For an education producct it top for me in the Top 5 though or recommended for an Editors Choice",
"it's accurate ,easy to use and lovely",
"Good website, terrible app. Unable to submit assignments or see peer reviews on the app and BE WARNED subscribing via the app will cost significantly more than via the website.",
Currently taking the Google IT Cert. Really enjoying the experiece so far. Beats the hell out of going to college & becoming a debt slave.,
"It is a great platform to learn effectively by quizzes, some little activities and assignments.",
"Buggy - the autoplay doesn't respect IVQs, they pop up but the next video starts playing behind and you if you try to submit your response it throws an error. The video playback speeds don't offer 1.75x, even though the browser classroom does. They're small things, but they add up and negatively impact the user experience.",
Great platform which helps build our life . Thank you for this App!,
"I think Coursea has a lot of great options. Two years ago I took a free course, using my laptop. It was great. Using my cell phone for a recent paid course, did not show everything. Tried to download on my laptop, it was a scam. I notified Coursea and they immediately provided a link to download on my laptop. I was too far behind and had other commitments, so I quit. I have LD, someone else would have been fine. I highly recommend them. I went through the Google classes and they used them.",
Writing in the Sciences is a highly helpful course which helped me improve my scientific writing skills and enhanced my performance at my office too.,
I want to use my android mobile for my course but unfortunaly the video is affected drasttically by the overlays of the playback controls and the greyish overlay on the whole image. All this makes impossible to watch the video efficiently.  I would expect that these overlays vanished after few seconds of no interaction but instead they are shown permanently. I kindly request to solve this issue so that video experience is improved.  >> The contact email address of the developer does not exists.,
"please add an option to select script under videos, I'm not a native English speaker and it's hard for me to understand the meanings of some words. enabling selection for the scripts allow me to copy the word and ""tap to translate"" that word. app lacks bookmark ability & bad rotation.if you could add an section to request the financial aid in the app, that wouldbe very useful. thanks and keep up the great work! you're not just the best online learning platform, but greatest online university! üíû",
interesting and exposing one to the reality of the course,
"Very good platform But assignment file upload doesn't work, just gets stuck indefinitely. Tried Word, PDF.. nothing works. Very frustrating to do a homework assignment and be unable to upload it... I am stuck in the course. This is such a basic, primary feature.. The web is filled with issues regarding the uploading of files in this platform, but none helped me. I find this ridiculous, as a web developer with many years under my belt: no error notification, nada. Contacted support. Hope for help",
"This is the very best of apps to learn all skills you wished,and a good platform to divert into a new career. I'd even like to give 7 stars if it were possible ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
"I enjoy taking Coursera classes because of the setup but I encounter inconvenience in accessing this app since helpful features are not available. Uploading files for assignment is always unsuccessful; I use my mobile browser instead. Peer feedback cannot be viewed too; same as the downloadable files in video. I did not know there are downloadable handouts until I used my laptop browser. Also, the updates are inconsistent; my grades does not reflect yet even if the browser shows otherwise.",
"it's the best app for learning. I'm able to acquire more skills ,and expand my knowledge through Coursera",
"After updating the app recently, unable to open the app.",
"Seriously a crappy buggy app, even though the lectures and the content are good, the tests are so buggy. I've passed a test with 9/10 questions correct, it shows me I've passed, yet it shows all answers incorrect, and doesn't even show which 1 of the 10 was wrong, by just displaying a blank screen for all the question cards. Really disappointed.",
Coursera is addictive if you love learning casually,
Downloadable option is very good for user experience as you can learn everywhere without worrying about data fees.,
"Coursera as an app in function, design, and content is great. It used to be very generous and was a wonderful educational tool. However, the more time has gone on, the more obvious it is that the educational aspect of the service has been compromised for profit. Of course there ought to be compensation for the different universities, institutions, and for the creators themselves; but perhaps a subscription-based service would be more equitable and consistent with the former values of Coursera.",
"I'm sorry to say that, but the current Android version (April 2019) of the Coursera App is a total trash:  1) the videos are permanently covered by the info banner about 10 sec scrolling. So, the app is just unusable.  2) in the horizontal regime the half of screen above the list of lectures within the week contains absolutely unnecessary info about the course title and number of the week. It would be much better to hide it after scrolling down. 4.5 inch screens are still in wide use in 2019!  3) the most stupid thing is the new list of courses! Seriously, one course per whole screen?! What for? Please try to use it with at least 10  courses in your list. It becomes unusable.  Again, sorry for emotions.",
"I love the idea, but this was clearly not made by educators. There is no logical flow, there are mistakes everywhere (sorry, little oopsie notes are no substitute for actually fixing mistakes and providing correct information), and the presenters are pretty awful. Google is great at tech stuff, but this thing leaves a lot to be desired.",
I really appreciate the way you rendered your services and also different people from different countries thanks your a lot I wish you all the best,
Coursera is such an excellent platform to learn any skills of your choice. Easy to understand and keeps your data safe,
"Would give more stars if the support email listed was actually active. I normally contact an apo developer if something goes wrong. In this case, courses I've completed on desktop are not being marked as completed on the app. I messaged the developers, but the email immediately got sent back to me because the address didn't exist and was undeliverable. If the app doesn't have accurate information and nobody is available to fix it, it only gets 1 star.",
"I love having this app. I was originally taking my course on a desktop, which limited the times I was able to study. Now, with the app, I can study any time, anywhere, which has greatly improved my study habits and brings me one step closer to completing my course and gaining additional skills to further my career. Also, the user interface is very functional and easy to use. I love this!",
Great learning and skills acquisition platform,
"The icons shows on when you pause a video, it's frustrating especially when the course is on coding üò§",
There are subtitles in the course videos,
"Here is my experience using coursea after using it for a few months: Every time I retake a test, there are always multiple questions that I had answered correctly the first time I took the test, but when asked the same exact question on the retake, the same answer would be marked wrong on the retake. Despite learning a lot, I have been giving tasks that do less training and are just time consuming. I want to learn more not spend hours giving a long winded response on ""why I like using coursea.""",
"This app is not working properly.. the video player is not working. When i tried to play a video the message appear """" Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again"""" Kindly resolve this issue. This issue has been started after the last updates.",
"Cannot watch video on the app. Have to be on computer to watch a video. App takes a while to fuly load and when it does load it freezes half of the time. I keep getting the ""Oops the video could not load error"". It will not even load the video without giving me that error.",
"Incredibly easy way to learn something new for free (most courses). I've already completed several Korean courses and hoping to complete a few more in other areas. Even when you do pay, it's still incredibly cheaper than in other places",
Thank You for this gift of higher learning. Amazing.,
"Coursera is amazing. I think the write ups could do better in terms of grammatical and spelling errors, but it helps you learn despite where you are starting from in easy and fun ways. I wish they'd shorten their videos more, maybe to 2 minutes each for those struggling with low attention span, it'd be really user effective for us too. But otherwise, amazing amazing app. Kudos to Google. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"Content is good, but i cannot rotate the screen to the right side. App is too inconvenient sometimes. Added issue: you cannot pinch to zoom or adjust the screen ratio. Some courses are designed that can only be good watched when Im using coursera from laptop! This can be easily solved if they provided something like pinch to zoom/adjust aspect ratio option. How can this app be so impractical?",
Excellent platform to learn and grow,
"I am facing too much problems in this app. It frequently crashes. It can not work properly. Please, fix it.",
"To be honest, I would give 5 stars for the content. But the four stars are coming for the performance of the mobile app. It just doesn't work normally at all and sometimes it's very annoying and time consuming. The app freezes constantly and also responds too slowly. Please, work on the app performance",
I really love Coursera. I recommend this to anyone to upskill and reskill you careers. You could also learn new skills or brush up them.,
"Love the learning interface. I got my Google Certification from here as I am a content writer. The course was great, and Coursera had an easy navigational interface that worked well on my laptop and desktop and was great on my mobile while commuting.",
I don't trust this app. I don't recommend downloading it. Better rely on your strength. spam app,
"smooth learning experience, can receive my lectures and do my assignments via my phone. Good work coursera",
"I have been noticing this lag bug during the video courses as well as browsing within the app. While watching a video, it starts normal but in one-third of the video's duration, it starts dropping frames and lags which then is consistently magnified along the video. This turns out really uncomfortable and restarting the app is always needed, though later the app starts misbehaving again alike.",
"As much as i had loved the apps, the update Is beginning to annoy and frustrate me. After playing a video the transparent overlay of the fast forward and go backward disappear and reappears almost immediately thereby no giving good experience while watching the learning videos. Please fix the bugs. I can't continue with learning.",
excellent platform for learning new things,
"The app keeps crashing when trying to download videos offline....very irritating and takes the experience of carrying your course content with you anytime right out of the window. frankly the whole point for me to download the app was to view content offline and if thats not possible, there is no point really for me to have this app as i can view the content online on a bigger screen on the web. please look into the problem at the earliest. thanks.",
Hmmm yeah the latest update did not make the video player better. The overlay controls no longer fades away. And worst the transcript is no longer in sync and scroll up. Before this update it was nice to be able to use the transcript as a video control. Kindly revert back to the previous version.,
"The app overall is greatly appreciated but the enterprise experience has one significant annoyance. The app first completely loads in the private mode after which reloads again switching to the program page... making you wait twice as long to get started. Would it be possible to improve this, please.",
"its a awsome place to study, financial aid also available, and the mobile app is awsome.good internet connection required to get high benifits.also u can download course content and see it when u free",
nice media to learn from anywhere. [thanks] :),
"Experience was good but it has some bugs when I open reading documents, the lightning of the screen mode switches constantly, from dark to light and makes very difficult to read my assignments, if you could fix that lighting problem on the readings it would make a big improvement for read on the go. Thank you.",
"I like to mention this online help me have more insight on my career change, material nicely put together, üëç",
I am enjoying my classes. I never knew online classes could be easy and interesting. thank you Coursera,
Best learning platform for latest skill sets..,
"The courses are good but the app is horrible. Cannot increase text size, cannot zoom into images or open them separately. Closed captions are a scroller that automatically jump to the sentence being spoken, this feature while helpful becomes irritating if you are scrolling through the transcript while the video is playing because it keeps jumping back to the CURRENT SENTENCE. There are no app settings. It's 2023, where is dark mode?!",
"I have been using the app for a month, and it's been great so far except for an issue I discovered recently, I was automatically logged out and I tried signing in, but there's no interaction after putting my account details. This is really disappointing as I have downloaded 2 weeks worth of lectures and I can't have access to them. Please try and rectify this.",
"I'm loving this app... planning on learning a lot more courses... No complaints Thus far, it's wonderful.",
"So very bad. I have been trying to enroll for a course for the last two hours, but the currency comes up in GBP when I am in Japan and trying to pay with a Japanese credit card. I am trying to use my google account to pay, but for some reason Coursera keeps accessing a different google account and I am unable to change it. SO I went to the website to add my credit card, but...still no luck.",
1. Tried to subscribe to a specialization course & couldn't do so coz they CHANGED their payment rules within a matter of months! PURE BS! Just coz I'm in India I can't pay or access any course now? Not everyone has credit cards of rarely heard banks!! 2. The app is such a waste compared to the browser version. Wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE. 3. Courses are good but HIGHLY EXPENSIVE. Not that it matters as I'm unable to pay even though I'm willing to!! I'm very very DISAPPOINTED!,
"The Coursera app makes it very easy to study online because it is user friendly. For instance, it is easy to navigate through the courses on the app and it reduces the stress of learning when compared to the traditional style of a conventional school. In fact, it is simple to put it that you can learn on the go anytime, anywhere as long as it is convenient for you.",
"Application has a lot of bugs. For instance, there are in-video questions in few lectures and when I skip a video and play next video, it will ask me same question again, but when I go back and play again, the question is gone. Sometimes it shows that I've completed a video and after a while that tick mark disappears.",
"This is the best learning platform in terms of usablity, availablity, performance and robustness. They also have many different courses for a variety of people with different backgrounds. Especially I like the offline features they have made it so much easier to learn.",
great app for a great program thanks. makes my learning experience easier and less of a hassle.,
"I'm having trouble using the app. The app background is dark grey and the font is black. So I have to turn my brightness to the full to be able to even read. When scrolling, the text randomly becomes white, thus frying my pupils at full brightness... Maybe this is a glitch in the app or maybe it's not running properly on my phone. Either way, it's annoying AF. Other than that, the app is simple and easy to use.",
"for the past decade I have used smartphones, this app by far stands out to be the most resourceful out of thousands whether of a similar kind or different. With the content and programs I can clearly see the future, definitely bright and thanks to the funding programs they make it accessible to many out there that are kinda vulnerable and unprivileged. I would rate more than 5 starts if there was anyway possible. I tip my hat to you, the great brains behind this huge initiative!!!",
"...so excited, everyone can learn just anything with Coursera as each lessons or modules are made so easy and interesting. 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê to you guys",
"I'd rate this 5+ stars but I can't find my downloaded videos in the new updated version and the courses I enrolled, the older version had a download page for all the downloaded videosüòê üòë . You need to fix this . I can't recall some of the courses I downloaded I have to study them I can't find them , how do I get back my downloaded courses only two courses have displayed the rest have disappeared from my list.",
My best online learning platforms that achieved all my educational needs,
"Be careful with subscription! I enrolled the course but after 2 days I decided to cancel subscription. (It is possible only on the website). In addition I did everything according to instructions, but I didn't receive the confirmation letter. I didn't pay attention due to enormous amount of ads from Coursera on my email. Today I've gotten a receipt for subscription and unsubscribed one more time. There's no possibility to refund my payment according to Help Center. ;(",
one of the best learning platforms.,
This app is absolutely perfect for when I want to study late at night cause I can't sleep. üòÇüòÇ Highly recommend.,
"So far, this app is AMAZING. I have been teaching myself about the stock market and finance (not necessarily even to make money, but because it's just so interesting to me that I've become obsessed.) My self-teaching came from a combination of books, YouTube videos, and Google searches. I have learned much but the way I did do was so all-over-the-place, from one topic to enough. This app lets me take a YALE course on finance, and with a structured curriculum it's like a real college course. 5/5",
Since updating to Galaxy S10+ the video controls on the video do not go away.  I uninstalled and re-installed that seemed to help but a day later the video controls do not go away.   Unless I can't find a setting somewhere?  Also just spent 30 minutes trying to find a place for feedback or request help on the site and I can't find any.  Hopefully someone from coursera actually reads these.,
the app is a great place for learning and I love the feature that you can download it and play offline,
The cousera app is great and i have had no issue whatsoever since i moved from my laptop to mobile the user interface is great and helpful,
Best place to learn free and get legit certifications.,
I would not recommend this app to anyone. I applied for financial aid for the Google It support course and while I was waiting I decided to audit one of their other courses the CompTIA practice course. And as I was about 25% through the course I decided to double-check some of their answers because they didn't feel right and turns out they are marking my answers wrong and giving me incorrect answers as the correct answers. This is terrible. You should not train people incorrectly.,
"Works great as expected, just one thing tho. There are major bugs when I'm using it in dark mode. Im using Mi 11 Lite and it has a built in forced dark mode for all apps, but with the systems dark mode enabled the app faces issues like, page scrolling stuck, video stucks on moving backwards or forward and some minor freezing here and there. Might wanna look into it.",
Downloaded videos starts lagging after a few minutes and the app doesn't close all at once. Audio keeps playing in the background for a few seconds after closing a video. The app altogether is a bit slow and need performance improvements to make the experience better for the users.,
"it is such a great informative, Helpful app ( ground of knowledge )",
"there's no way to report a bug so I'm writing it here. The audio is constantly disappearing when watching videos while using Bluetooth headphones (they work correctly with everything else, so headphones aren't a problem here). It can be after taking quizzes inside the video, going back a couple of seconds or simply starting new video. It seems so random, but it can happen after any interaction with video. Makes the app simply unusable",
"Courses on Coursera are very easy to follow, goes straight to the point and the tutors are well vexed in their areas of specialization",
"On offline mode, after watching a video for more than 4 minutes on average, it starts lagging. The lag rate increases from 1 to 2 to 4 to 6 seconds with time, so I have to kill the app and start again. This is very irritating and breaks the chain. Fix it ASAP!",
I have ZERO issues managing my progress on PC with a web browser. I am not chancing using this app to mess anything up which is why only 1 star. Not going to attempt to introduce any glitches to my progress. I will just work with Chrome and my PC for this ONLY as a precaution.,
"this is the best app ever, download and enjoy, no regrets at all. been using since 2020",
Excellent app but the developers should work on removing the play button when the video is on pause.,
"Nice app, i would rate it 5 stars if it is not force latest update which wont let me open the app",
Some courses are Ok. But the app itself is quite annoying. When you open a video it starts playing only to stop immediately to show the lesson summary. In activities where you interact in the forum the app opens a browser within the app and links to the forum but you have to login again. Except it doesn't login at all and you have to do it at your computer. Even though I paid for the course support is hidden in the website and not accessible through the app,
great app. just it would be nice to add accordions for the sections of every week for the courses,
"Started the course with a free trial,with a price of $39 for a monthly fee. I didn't have enough money at a moment they tried to charge me but I updated it tomorrow, when it was too late. Now, if I want to continue they offer me higher price of course... Such a shrewd way to work..",
Coursera is a great platform for learning in any related fields and streams. It provides huge variety of courses that learner can learn and upskill himself. Content is good and beginner friendly for anyone. Most remarkable things is that it doesn't impose any deadline to completion the course while we can complete the course at anytime in which time we are comfortable with.,
Great courses and great content. Coursera really helps you in exploring new skills and growing in your professional career.,
the best for people who are curious and love learning and so useful boosting your career and even starting a new one !,
"I think the app has great potential. I had a good time completing the course work and felt like I learned a lot. Unfortunately, it wasn't smooth sailing. Specifically, there were a lot of little bugs that made it sometimes impossible to continue: I reached the end of course one and was given a link to the next course in the series in order to, ironically, make it easier to get to and start the next course. This link did not work and I couldn't even locate the next course.",
"It's mostly just reading, videos and some assignments with peer reviewed being a thing. I also wasnt able to take any quizs on mobile yet could do a most of the UX course. The Odin Project is free and has a better job of doing stuff.",
the best app in learning...and thank you for the financial aid opportunity will forever be indebt to cousera,
"I don't know what's the problem but app is not working well after the update, i wanna join a course but stuck at step 1.... really need to fix it",
I am learning with enjoyable activities. This is great way to learn and feeling excited after getting result,
The Coursera app has made it easier for me to learn on the go. Quite resourceful and simple to use.,
Among the best online course I have taken. Easy to understand and straight to the point.,
"I love it!! So. Much. I really enjoy the range of subjects, and the course I am taking in machine learning is so well paced and engaging-highly reccomend. But even better than that is the service!! I messed up a setting about 10 minutes ago, I contacted the live chat (it's 11pm at night here in the UK) and boom its all working again. These guys are the absolute best",
I think Coursera have built a formidable course learning platform over the years. so suitable to learning effectively a course,
"Coursera is a great platform to learn. But I really hate the fact that the app only runs on Android OS 5.0 or higher. What about people who don't have that? Futhermore, even the website doesn't work properly on my device. I can hear the lectureand read the text, but when I scroll to the video, the website gets blank. I rate it one star because I had a very unpleasant experience with the app.",
great courses that come from great universities.,
"this app help me to get new skill and better life. i can be more productive, because I can upgrade my skill everywhere and everytime.",
"Worst experience ever. Wanted a course , subscribed for a 7 day free trial , did not have the tome to cancel so practically 36 euros were out of my account for no reason . Then tried to cancel subscription but it was impossible. There were instructions but nothing like the described helped . I am still trying to find this gear ‚öôÔ∏è to find ""manage subscription "" settings. So far nothing. I wish I would never have used this app",
it's really a good learning platform,
"Very useful app for those who are eager to learn anything eg. Computer science, programming language, business studies, humanities, communication skills, languages, from the top professors from the best colleges and universities around the world. With this u can be independent learner all u need to do is to maintain the consistency and practice regularly whatever you learned.",
it's a good app for different courses,
Excellent platform to learn new skills,
This is a nice platform for enriching oneself with fantastic knowledge,
"The app is otherwise good, but the new video playing interface awful. They have now replaced the video quality options with Low High Auto. Another problem is the course interface are often confusing. A friend of mine had completely overlooked that there was 7 other parts to complete in a certificate course just because of that.",
"Useful app but the only thing that I didn't like is the way how the app download the course when I want to download the full week videos. It starts to download all the content at the same time and cause me some issues (all bandwidth used, I can not navigate any where on the internet, downloads failed), so please add the way how to configure that or make it to download one by one.",
So here's what's wrong with the latest update: 1. Viewing downloaded videos with internet connection still consumes my data. 2. My phone hangs whenever I start the app with internet connection. 3. The transcripts are somehow worse. It makes learning with the app a nightmare. Please this needs to be fixed as soon as possible.,
"This app is great, but am having problem with the videos. It kept the play button, and other buttons on the screen, even when I try to tap for it to disappear it kept appearing over and over again. I plead to the developers to address this issue. This happened with this recently updated version.",
"I need to use the 'Verify ID' feature on the app so I can earn my course certificate but I cannot use it because it requires a camera permission which isn't even listed for this app. I looked everywhere trying to find a way to enable the camera permission but no luck. The list of permissions for Coursera includes only Calendar, Contacts, and Storage. Very frustrating!",
"The courses provided are excellent with great resources, quality presentation and detailed explanation.",
one f the best online learning platforms I've ever known. their explanations are very details and it feels so real learning on coursera,
"Offline feature is important.. especially in third world countries like Nigeria, where streaming can be terrible. My scholarship is wasting away already ü§∑",
excellent learning and it's explanatory,
"Everything is great, but after the recent update, it has been glitching a lot. Videos tend to stutter a lot after playing the course for a few minutes, and this particularly makes it a really bad experience to learn.... Please look into the issue.!",
"It's not downloading videos for offline mode, bloody sucking... I'm not able to change the quality of videos as well ...",
The quizes that pop up in the middle of the videos are not synchronized with the moment in which the video makes the pause. The pop up quizes are always shown 5 seconds after the pause in the video. Also at least twice after finishing the pop up tests you are logged out of your coursera account and you have to log in again to resume your learning.,
"I was and still using Coursera on my PC. I couldn't get my PC everywhere and hence, I was sometimes unhappy because of my conditions. But the app is very much useful for me, because, we carry phones everywhere and hence, the goal is reached without regret. So, I thank Coursera for providing the app itself and I appreciate the interface which keeps updating and also, I would like to add the flexibility of the download option within the app which helped me save a lot of data. Ok, this is for full.",
Coursera courses are the best in terms of giving one in-depth understanding of the subject.,
"It is a great learning platform, where you can learn anything. and the instructor and Techer is so good they guide us perfectly. If you want to learn something new then it is a best platform. It is for all beginners, Intermediate, and Advanced level person.",
The worst app ever. I faced a problem related to playing videos then i contacted the support team n after following a lot of instructions the problem resolved but it recurred. Three times i faced the same problem and at the end the team tells me they don't know how long it's gonna take. That was so disappointing. N still the problem is there. Worst app,
"Terrible. Registered for a certificate with a 7-day free trial, but instead I got charged right away. The certificate I tried to enroll in doesn't show up in my purchases, instead it's some random ""specialization"". I can't access the other courses in the certificate, keep getting the ""enroll"" option. There is no customer service email or phone #, live chat is nowhere to be found. When you go to the ""help center"" and you click on log in, it just refreshes the page, with no option to sign in.",
When i want to review others assignments it cant load. Or pages refreshed again and again automatically. Please fix the problem,
Excellent course for helping you how to learn,
I have the Coursera app for years now and on the last update I did . I wanted to resume watching my videos but guess what the video interface is still in screen How am I to learn when I can't see the screen clearly. Y'all need to fix that it's so annoying . Coursera has been good but you just flipped with that ish . So please FIX IT. you are slowing my video progress,
"Awesome app for getting best courses! Best Content with Quizes, Assignment and other features! ‚ù§‚ù§",
So of course I was excited to download the app especially for the free courses. Only to find out the the first five recourses I looked into that were advertised on the first page we're actually 59.99 or more. How disappointing you're just like bait trap site with actually very limited free anyting how sad. Advertising free courses that be warned people they lie!,
"I've been using Coursera for awhile now and I really like how you can learn at your own pace and having the ability to reset any deadlines if you miss due dates for tests. My only concern is that some of the videos seem not to work (on mobile anyway) but other than that, Coursera is an amazing app to have for learning new things or upgrading existing skills",
"CLOWNS! I signed up for a marketing course, and halfway through I was unable to access the readings. Therefore I was unable to progress with the course. I asked for a refund of THE PREVIOUS MONTH ONLY, as I didnt want to pay for a lost month because of a technical problem that they were taking their time to fix. Now my entire course is marked ""inactive"" and I seemingly lost progress in my course. On top of that their support page is BROKEN, and their community page is also BROKEN, so their support team is inaccessible. CLOWNS",
"I've used the IOs version of this app and it worked wonderfully. Recently I've started using the android app and it's a complete opposite. Works horrible and the ""My Courses"" tab takes from 5 to 10 minutes to load on a 100 Mb connection (I've actually clocked this and hoped it was my internet speed but I've confirmed it's not the case). I hope you can fix this app as I had a wonderful experience learning in coursera. Please make it work!",
"Many different ways to learn reading, videos, Discussion boards, interactive help desk use this to better yourself",
"Love the app, I havent encountered any issues with it until now",
Great app for studying pretty much any topic that you like,
very convenient and comfortable to use,
"Coursera is such a good app. However, after the recent update, I cannot login into my account. After entering my email and password, the login button is just not working. It seems to register a click but nothing happens. I have to resort to using the web browser on my phone to use it. Please fix this issue!",
"I can't play the video, even I have updated the application.",
This is a great and seamless learning platform You'll love it,
One of the best beneficial applications in the world that help shape one's future through continuing learning for life learners.,
"App is build solid, the offered material is extremely good as well. Unfortunately it is not possible to finish classes ""in your own time"" as advertised. During my specialization class, i had to wait constantly because material was blocked. Now i have to wait 3 months (paying of course) to start my final project! Be aware when you plan something that contains more than one class! It might take way longer and be way more expensive than you think. You might want to change to a more honest supplier!",
"One star only for the institutions on their platform. Coursera really need to fix their app and website. I have finished 6 courses of Google UX Design but those courses do not reflect in 'completed'section. Therefore, i can't access them later. If I want to read something from the courses that i completed and paid for, i have to enroll in them again. This just shows how little Coursera cares about their actual users. Udemy is way better in terms of their services. Skip Coursera if you can.",
"The current version is disappointing. I can't watch one video on the app without it lagging. Works fine for the first 2 mins and then starts to lag, the voice breaks and becomes difficult to understand the content of the video. Poor app experience.",
"App is miles behind the service Hello dear developers. I have been using Coursera as my main mean of learning for about 8 months and most of it has been done through Coursera website. I decided to shift to my tablet and use the android app but I faced lots of bugs and problems, especially when it comes to common features like automatic rotation! I really cannot understand Why in some pages the app gets stuck in vertical mode and does not adopt the whole horizontal view.",
"great & very helpful course of coursera in my life..in this course proud to my self with hope and helping others from.,",
"wonderful platform for learning, I love it",
"love it, especially the testing system , labs, additional readings, makes it super interactive and fun",
Excellent platform to take any course online. User friendly and easy to navigate,
"BEWARE: the inadequate Coursera service could possibly ruin it for you. If you by chance have to update/change your payment method (because of credit card expiration, for example) like I did, then your subscription gets automatically Canceled and you lose Coursera Plus' current offer/price and then you are required to subscribe at higher/full price. If you don't do that, then all of your progress goes in vain and you can't get the certificate. It feels a bit like extortion.",
"Cool app, and designed to be very compatible for learning on mobile including taking quizzes.",
"5 star for Coursera itself, but I wish I could give a zero or even minus for video playback. This app won't allow the video to be played without the play gauge disappearing away like other similar apps. This results in a very low-light and inconvenient playback experience. Fix it please!",
"The video player keeps crashing, resulting in delays from achieving progress goals, and attaining my certificate :(",
"Cousera has been of tremendous help to me, I am glad I came in contact with cousera, if you can see this, THANK YOU.",
very good app to learn about code and this app is very usefull to all coder,
"I couldn't find where to send direct feedback to the team through the app so I'll drop my issue here. I've been getting the same ""Course summary"" in my mail for several weeks now; it doesn't update my progress, days I've learnt, time spent, nothing at all. It just sends the same static report over and over again thereby defeating the purpose totally. When I get a weekly summary from Duolingo for instance, my stats keep me accountable and planning into the next week. This one is just annoying",
The apps videos are no longer loading on my brand new Google pixel pro 7 which is stopping progress I could be having when not home,
"App itself is ok but the content marketing course ended upp being very disappointing and frustrating due to coursera practices. 1. heavy reliance on podcasts and videos which it did not provide within the course itself or links to 2. no way to contact presenter, ucdavis or coursersa and get a response or fix 3. peer grading is a nightmare. Will NEVER take a coursera course again! update. you can find the extra podcast and video downloads if you go through the browser instead of the app.",
"Doesn't work correct in my phone's dark mode (Realme UI). When there's a quiz in the middle of a video, sometimes the Submit button gets stuck with ""SUBMITTING..."" and there is no way to try submitting again. I end up skipping the quiz to continue watching the video, making the quiz lose its value. If Submit wasn't successful in few seconds, show an error notification and allow submitting again. Otherwise make quiz validation offline and asynchronously update my submission in background.",
The assignments and feedbacks add to the feel of taking an actual course. Nice App. Love from Nigeria,
Learning so much everyday. Credits to Coursera team,
"It pains me that the app is not optimized for the tablets. It is being around for, I dont know like 5 or 6 years, and yet when it comes to big screen the app disappoints. History of updates did nothing much to improve the experience with mobile phone either. While many apps out there got their dark mode ages ago, this app is still struggling with UI which makes me wonder what does these updates even doing? At this moment, the app looks like one from 2015. It need some serious overhaul.",
A perfect platform to learn new things ( courses) from top universities in the World.,
"something wierd happened. first i opened a download coursera video on my tablet. it crashed and went to the hundreds of lines screen with a loud buzz. i turned it off and now its not starting properly. on opening my cell phone the coursera app is just gone. it asks to install the app above. i think you guys have a virus or something. I'm not sure, but its very strange. update: i went to the setting apps and checked there. Coursera is still on my phone. but it says install above",
"This application is more reliable, and I haven't noticed any glitches or bugs yet ( been using it for 2 weeks now). The reason for 4 stars is that I tend to use this application more on my android tablet (Samsung tab s7+) so I would love to see landscape option to use the application, which will give more room for me to use splitscreen in a much better means.",
"I am unable to use the text input on the course work for Google UX accessible design, quite ironic. Instead, every time I type, it moves the cursor back to the start of the line. Other than that, I am enjoying the all immensely. 5 stars once I can complete my course work",
"I have one notable inconvenience with the app, I was just browsing courses and you have this big Enrol button in the bottom of the screen, while I was trying to press the Back button of my device it seems my finger pressed the Enrol button and with no confirmation what so ever I was fully enrolled, I find this unsatisfying there should be some kind of confirmation method, anyway I enjoy coursera it is an amazing platform keep up the good work !! üëåüèª thank you.",
"this coursera is best platform or I say a course, in the world üåéüåç",
Great learning and refreshing platform,
This is exceptionally one of the best online course study applications I have encountered. keep up the excellence Coursera!,
User friendly interface I enjoy this,
Most recent update broke autoplay next.,
very well designed courses.,
"awesome to learn tech languages,",
Great learning app. I love coursera,
This app is good overall. Just add DARK THEME.,
This course help me a lot to learn about UX/UI.,
very informative and useful,
The app is user friendly and helpful I think it's cool,
Best app for online learning,
I am really enjoying my study here and I must say I have improved in knowledge,
Coursera provide best education in all means of life.,
Nice platform to learn,
great way to learn anything thanks Coursera,
"Downloading videos for offline viewing no longer works. After downloading the video, the playback still streams off the Internet, consuming bandwidth. Despite reaching out to support, all they ever tell you is using the browser on desktop. It doesn't even solve the problem.",
I love y'all but please fix the video issues. It's annoying having to get on my laptop to use coursera because the app won't play any of the videos. Especially difficult to go through when you are not at home and want to study using the app but the videos are not working. Please fix this!,
"Apart from videos, nothing really. Lots of useless notifications. Eg. one comes with ""Your assignment has been reviewed"". Tap on it and nothing happens. When I tap on the assignment in the app, it is a video that starts. Not even possible to display certificates.",
"Great app for learning, I'd recommend Coursera again and again",
"App maybe ok, but coursera has no idea of education. Start a course and then good luck. Have been stuck with a programming assignment. My code looks good to me, many trials, shown to a high-profile dev friend, he also couldn't see an issue. Nobody would try to help, so there would be a learning effect. You were not able to solve the assignment, your problem. I might be too stupid, but that doesn't mean their educational approach is correct. 2 months paid, nothing learned. Only left to cancel.",
"Before the update, I could always access my downloaded vidoes even with my device connected the internet, now even with the videos downloaded I'll have to watch them online without the originally perfect transcripts- video sync. Only works like original if i disconnect my device, the update didn't make the experience better. Please fixing it would be nice. Thank you",
"The peer grading system which they have is pathetic. It's a complete waste of time, you work for hours on an assignment and some people just randomly grade you without even looking at your hard work and you have to keep resubmitting the assignments, otherwise the course will show incomplete. If I had known about this I wouldn't have opted a course through this platform.",
great place to get started on with your journey of learning new things,
The app is buggy. Very difficult to use. The progress is not updated on time. The videos suddenly stop in between. I really lost the motivation to complete the course. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it few times but still facing the same issue.,
"A super platform to learn whatever you wish. 4 stars for the coursera platform and the coursera support team. One star deducted for the fact that the app doesn't have any tool for note making/bookmarking/highlighting. Please add this feature as well. Except this, everything's perfect.",
"Coursera has made a number of improvements over the past year and hopefully this will continue. Unfortunately, with the last update i was logged out of the app and there is no way to log in again. As a reault none of my courses are available and i am forced to use the web to participate in my active courses. For such a critical error to be released i am giving the app a low rating.",
Very good app. Enjoy the courses,
"Improvement advices: - Add bottom for store note ( as in website). - Allow to have a dark theme reader for the textscript or for the entire app. But have a bottom for storing text is essential. I cannot spend 4 hours watching videos on my laptop, for this reason the app should have same functionality or even more of the website :)",
"Coursera is one of the best platforms to learn many things. Unfortunately, this app is horrible. It crashes frequently and have to wait minutes to get into home screen. Using this app with a mobile data is a nightmare.",
"When I complete a certain task (like watching a video or reading the given material) of the course through this app, it doesn't get marked as completed. I have to login through my PC and complete my tasks there in order to get it marked as completed. Fix this ASAP as I can't complete the course through my phone as long as this problem exists.",
"Good app for the most part. Some issues with items being marked incomplete in the app when they are actually completed if I look on the desktop site. Also, the experience of submitting assignments is jerky and can be improved (yes even though they recommend using the website)",
"I can't seem to download any lessons again, I've done everything possible to download the lesson so I can watch it offline but for some reason it doesn't seem to download , I've tried possible means like reinstalling the app , logging out and logging in back but all to no avail . I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing it but its quite frustrating. Pls coursera , kindly fix this problem",
Coursera is a huge part of my life. It is kind of baffling how the app version of it falling behind in portable space. The web version that I use on my phone via chrome has more options and functionalities such has taking notes or participating in surveys but the app version is so restrictive and limited that using it becomes very frustrating. We need a better app. Coursera deserves better.,
"What a waste of time Tried to take a course using a browser on Android and it was impossible to answer video popup questions. Downloaded the app and watched 3 videos on the prof's side hustle, prompted to buy a membership, pay for the course, blah blah, and now quiz questions won't even load. This is my second disappointing experience with Coursera I am done with this garbage. It reeks of time-share style tactics. Do not recommend!",
"REPLY ASAP I really used to like this app but since a while now, when i enroll in a course and then go access it, there is no content in any week. My network is great, and the search feature works too. When i went on to explore the status if the course has been removed, it wasn't, but just started. I am doing MOOC for my upcoming sem exam to be at equal grounds with my peers. So plz fix it fast if you can or i'll have to re-search a course that completely fits me all over again, another site.",
"Content videos are good, but still not economical. It is better to buy some good books, than spending money here. They don't offer flexible or unlimited packages. Some courses are open only after payment. This may be suitable for full time trainees and students.",
I learnt more from Coursera than I learnt in colleges. This app is revolutionizing the education field.,
"I don't like the recent update. In the previous version, the transcript automatically scrolls as the video plays and you can easily click on any part of the transcript to navigate the video. All these features have been removed. I really need to get the previous version.",
"Can't log in. I enter my email and password (made sure it's correct each time) and it always says ""Login error. Check network connection"". My connection is fine. No other app has an issue atm. I also see that this app hasn't been updated in a long time. So clearly the devs have abandoned this.",
"This is a really awesome edu app and has some really interesting courses with great hands on labs. The only problem that i have been facing is that the videos that i have downloaded are broken, I have to restart the app again and again to avoid those annoying stoppage.",
"Not able to log in after update. Our college mandates us to do a few courses in Coursera and getting to do it on the phone is so much easier, but after this new update. The app doesn't sign you in. I always sign in with Google and it used to sign me in before, now it asks for a password and even after entering the right password it loads for a while showing ""signing in"" and then again nothing.",
"The video player on the App fails to load the videos frequently, not all the subjects or contents are optimized for the App, so you need to use PC for the course. Sometimes some contents are not visible at all. So you will lost pace. They actually need to improve the app to works as good as the PC experience",
"I am not liking the new updates on Coursera. I have been using this app since 2020 after pandemic and really appreciate the efforts of Coursera team. But kindly please change the current updates , the older one was better. I have to search for my course and now it's getting difficult to find the course you left last time to continue it further. It goes to the end of the list. In addition to that I am not liking the features of suggeting courses from a university which I have opted for.",
"Not bad on laptop, but mobile app has a few glitches. The content feels watered down, plus you can only advance if you get other users on the app to grade you, which i think is both an auwful idea but also its used to avoid having real assessor's. There is a lot of potential but also i mostly just felt let down by the service. I tried the google project certificate. Once i completed courses it didnt show completed but just to reenroll.",
"This app is really well designed and the quality of the course i took was high as well with great content and relevant, useful exercises. I highly recommend the app for learning. Only gripe is some of the assignments need to be done on a computer as they don't display properly on the phone.",
examples and explanations are really good,
"Used to be able to use this app offline. I work at sea so a lot of the time I tend to have slow or no internet connection. Recent updates have meant I can't log in to use the app without an internet connection, and on a slow connection the reCaptcha session times out and I can't log in. This means I'm now paying for a course I can only do half the year when I'm at home. Please fix so it can be used offline again and on the move like at sea or on a plane.",
"Not sufficiently optimized app. i use this app on a tablet. displays videos in landscape mode, but tests in only portrait mode. cannot view certificates, pressing back button while doing test goes back without saving progress. needs a lot of work to be called tablet friendly.",
"Very Helpful. Free courses from up-to-date international unicversities with Notes and quiz facilities. Only certificates require payment. Splended. I would've given it 5 ‚òÜ if the deadline for multiple courses didn't started at once. Even thought missing deadlines do not affect my course progress, it should've been more managable like the Udemy.",
There is one annoying problem. I downloaded videos to watch them offline but when I try to watch them a pop up is shown saying ooops something went wrong. I have to temporarily turn the Internet on and then off again. Only after that videos are played normally. But it is annoying,
"Pointless. I couldn't remember my password from my account and trying to reset it within the app just gives you a constant loop without the ability to change it. Garbage design for a company that claims to be about learning or whatever. The service itself is good, but this app is an absolute mess. Just stick to their website.",
The BEST educational app in the world. PERIOD. Everyone should be appreciative of all the professor's from all over the world who make videos of their basic AND advanced college classes.. for FREE!!! I have been using this app for 8 YEARS!! I have learned SO much and felt like I was sitting in a classroom. I love this app and love that I always have the power to learn rich and powerful education right on my phone.,
"I only just started using it and there are two things that instantly bothered me, 1. Not being able to resize font when reading, which is an essential feature in any app that involves reading. 2. Media playing speed should have smaller step that .25, .5 step would be way better and efficient.",
"The app was fine and worked very well, but after this past update it keeps saying that I need an internet connection which I have via mobile data as well as wifi, I really hope this is fixed as I enjoy the app very much. UPDATE: Still not working due to false network connection error. PLEASE FIX.",
"I like this course app, free & easy to use. One thing that I think would be very useful is wishlist course feature. I like learn many things, but I can't take it all at the same time. So, there's a moment when I want to take that course but I'm not finish yet the other course that I enrolled in. Then I have to screenshot it so I can enrolled in it in the future. Wow this is my longest review on google play. But anyway, I hope you understand what I mean. Thank you for making this great app‚ù§Ô∏è",
"The ""Explore"" button on desktop version is super annoying as every time I hover over it opens an unavoidable and crazily wide menu that makes me accidently click on a random link almost every time. Just trying to finish a course here, don't force us to click on EVERY courses that you have. The courses are great, the menu is upsetting.",
"I joined Coursera to learn python. I took the Python For Everybody course last year and wanted to do it again. I did the paid course so I can get graded on the assignments. But IT informed me they could not clear my course history from the previous time, so I asked for and received a refund. However the next month I was charged again. Because apparently when they refunded my subscription was not removed? When I emailed them about this problem I got a reply saying they would not refund my money. the Python For Everybody course is excellent. Coursera is not. There are plenty of other programs out there that have better billing practices. I'm using dataquest.io right now, it is a great course.",
"Expensive, and worth EVERY penny. Best content for modern dev topics bar none right now.",
"If I download few videos to play later when the connection speed is less, it doesn't work well as expected. Looks like it tries to establish connection very frequently and waits for it. Even if you click on a downloaded video, it doesn't play immediately. What is the purpose of downloads then?",
"At first I thought this app is promising, and got myself enrolled in one of the courses (Business English : Networking) There is 1 video for the proficiency test that just kept loading no matter what, and only played the first 5 secs. they have download option available. tried that but nothing happened. I cant finish the video! hence I cant work on my proficiency test and cant continue the course :(",
"Courses missing (I have a bundle of 4 for Uni - only 3 show up). Cannot take all quizzes and assignements on the app. Has good sides (seeing % of progress through a long course, deadlines, etc), but, sincerely, it is good only to download your course and have it on the go.",
Love the convince of the app however frequently the video quiz answers will say they are incorrect and when showing me the correct answer it is in fact the one I selected. It's quite frustrating and I can't find any information about this problem online. Aside from retaking them on my computer I can't fix my quiz marks.,
"Just a suggestion, I'd recommend creating a favorite/bookmarks button or folder for saving courses one is interested in but not ready to enroll in the interim. For example I had to 'enroll' in certain courses even though I'm just trying to save them for a later period.",
"Can't disable Subtitles in a Chromecast cast at all. Remote control media keys like Play/Pause, Forward, Backward, Scroll Up/Down/Left/Right are not supported. Missing options to enable/disable Autoplay of a next video, Autostart of a current video. No option to start finished course from the beginning without without incredible efforts",
it is almost useless because the videos always crash. I can be watching a lesson and it will crash at a certain point and if I go back to the same lesson it will crash again and again at the same spot. it already got me frustrated and irritated and dont want to use it anymore.,
"There is no section on the course page where prerequisites and corequisites are mentioned..... I had to drop out of two courses I enrolled in because they were too advanced. Please add such section. Also add a Black theme for utilising the AMOLED screen in the best way. It's a must have feature in 2022 (even the Dark theme isn't available, have low hopes for Black theme). Other than that, everything is awesome. Perhaps it is better than any other MOOC platforms out there in my opinion.",
nice and easy to use,
"I'm having a great time learning and the videos are always annotated with updated information. However, I'm having issues taking the quizzes. I retake them and the answers I selected are NOT what I initially marked after they are graded. Tested a few times and happens each time.",
One of the Best app to learn something about your career.,
"I think app runs very slow not able to take the user input . The videos in the app are also lagging for every 2 seconds and it takes another 2 seconds to resume , it takes 3times more time than the actual length of the video , website also have same problem , It takes more time to load and takes very much time to respond after clicking. Plz solve the problem we are not able to see the videos , it will cause our education",
Keeps breaking. Not as detailed and smooth as the browser version. Wanted to learn on the go but well. Probably this app needs more learning than i do. Completed 3 modules and app told me to enrol like i have never taken the module. For a moment i thought my records are all gone! Unacceptable for an app to have all these bugs in this era.,
The video buffering is a lot even in good speed. The course topics should be visible somehow from the video view as well. It is impossible to do the exercises in mobile if even 2 lines of code needs to be written. Ui needs fixing for the right amount of space.,
"This app misses several things that are present in the website, but what I miss most is the option to pay a course with PayPal - I can do it from the website but not in the app. This is a major issue for people like me, uncomfortable with credit cards. However, as long as I can use both I can live with this",
"The app was working fine, But suddenly one day I opened it and it says unable to refresh.",
"Great course content however the support is equally bad. There are multiple glitches a student faces while submission of assignments, accessing content and there is no one to turn to. The troubleshooting data exists but it is what it is data..no support no technical guidance. The platform doesn't do justice to the content the professors have put in and the efforts students are doing.",
"Cousera has been instrumental in changing my perceptions about an online class. It is just as engaging as a real class room environment. The course models are flexible and the forums give you an opportunity to share knowledge and engage other course mates. In addition, you can apply for some courses for free.. Great learning tool.",
"I've been using Coursera for years and recently it has become really weird. While EdX is transparent, Coursera is like it wouldn't tell how much you'll be needing to pay to earn a certificate. I recently enrolled on a course bundle/specialisation and paid for it thinking the courses included are all been ""paid"". But I could complete just 1 course from the bundle! Then why a collective enroll button? The charges say ""per month"". They NEVER said ""per course"". I feel cheated.",
"Hello Team, using Coursera app on Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus. Facing a problem with fullscreen landscape video, as the videos along the edge are out of view by half an inch or so. In case of vids with technical demos, this is a major issue missing out full view of important details. This is not a problem in portrait mode on the same device, or in any of orientation on a phone device. Great if you can please fix this one issue, everything else works as expected.",
Since I cannot delete my previous review. I take back what I said. Their customer support really helped me out this time. Just a warning to new users to always check your assignment as one of your peers (in whatever course you're enrolled in) will copy your work. It happened to me multiple times but Coursera is quick to get to the bottom of it and really assisted me with this issue.,
"The app was great until few months ago. I can't watch any video for more than 5 mins without the video starting to sound weird. I can neither download more than 1GB video material nor I can download again after deleting that 1GB video material that I previously downloaded. So I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to download new videos. This app was amazing, please do something to fix the issue.",
very useful for my self development and also in my knowledge üòâ,
"i would give a five star. for sake of learning, please fix the video player! it's super buggy, makes the phone hot; after some time watching download video(not a internet speed issue), the player start to zzzzz, like riding in bumpy road :( or just implement vlc open source player. edit: v3.13.0, u guys did not fix the video player.",
"I tried the app once and the experience was good and bad at the same time. Good in the sense that I have the chance to watch offline videos in places with poor Internet connection. On the other hand, the app is quite terrible because all the lessons I've completed is still unmarked on the app. Hence, restricting me from receiving my certificate. Please fix this issue. Thanks",
The Best Platform to Learn New Skills.,
it's a very good platform for learning,
"This app has to improve a lot. Very unsatisfied. Course material doesn't appear even on fastest internet. If weekly goals are set, only that appears in place of lessons and assignments. NO VIDEO APPEARS IF WEEKLY GOALS ARE SET. Slow, sluggish app, unintuitive interface. I love Coursera, but this app is unusable.",
"Really good app, big number of quality courses, works really good. The only issue is that when doing quizes, the playground of code is totally black, cant see the code at all, I can only input. So it's kinda hard to know what the code looks like that we are suppose to fix if we cant see it.",
It is a very great app for online learning. I owe the speed of my upskilling journey to Coursera.,
"Really terrible UI with constant errors, most of which are false. In some cases I do not have access to my PC so I need to use the app. Almost impossible to complete tasks and lessons most of the time, unless I am passively watching a video.",
User friendly and very intuitive. You guys need to improve on some of the courses mobile interface. Restricting some capabilities sole to desktop or laptop computers is kinda awkward and primitive sort of. You have the capacity to change the UX for better learning experience,
"Coursera is a great for learning. The only problem I ever had was my peer assignment not being assigned a score, that really sucked considering its needed to complete a course. Everything else is really great, especially having access to a learning tools mostly free.",
This app is not working. When i open the app after downloading it is not loading the UI. I have checked my internet connection. I saw my connection is very good. Also download the app twice after uninstalling. I can't use it further. Please update the features of this app.,
"The app always shows that there is no connection (check your connection). However, the connection is superb, the speed Is up to 100 Mbps, and this is the only app where the problem appears. I had to uninstall it. Very disappointing!",
"Really a great online learning platform. For those who can't travel to another countries to learn such a great short term course, it's the platform for them. I really loved it I'm completing great courses from different universities of the world and the professors have really a great knowledge.",
The audio buttons don't match with the material in text at all üòÇ Learning a new language and I have to do an unprompted matching type to find the audio for a specific line because all audio buttons are scrambled at the bottom of the page instead of in the text lines as seen in the desktop version. App is plain bad.,
"When opening downloaded Readings offline, the pictures don't load. When trying to access quizzes, I get an error message saying ""Sorry! Error occured while accessing quiz. Please try again."" (Online and offline). When trying to open Programming Assignments, I get a page saying it works better on a bigger screen, with 3 buttons, none of which work. The Previous and Skip buttons give network availability errors (even when online with strong WiFi connection) and the Try button does not do anything",
"Very pleased, I'm actually taking a course on line that i was deciding on which I needed which helping me, the course is only 6 weeks, and truly enjoying the course. And this doesnt occupy my time which I can chunk size it, and still get other things done. I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to take a course in a time with a busy schedule.",
I'm using a Lenovo M10 HD tablet. Viewing videos on landscape mode crops the right and left side so some details are missing. I know that it's not a full HD tablet but in other apps I use videos adjusts automatically but the Coursera app doesn't. Please üôè fix it. Thank you. Great courses by the way.,
"Really disappointed with the payment system. I didn't know that a course fee is being charged every month. I didn't even want the subscribed course and got charged twice, atleast the team can set up a reminder system before charging an account.",
This app and Coursera are doing a great job,
"Excellent quality courses, excellent selections, never had any bugs or crashes - this and LinkedIn are the only two I use now (i take similar courses in conjunction, as sometimes one app has some information the other missed) This is by far my favorite platform to use through and I'm thankful to the State of Tennessee for providing its citizens free membership to allow us to evolve (Currently doing a complete career change myself)",
"There are many such apps. can't say whether have overall satisfaction with the courses n ui there, both free ones and paid ones. But I can say how satisfied I am with the app. The structure of the courses n UI.Quality Courses in public interest is really very good. Having freedom to pay for only certification not for course is also good.",
It's all a scam. Most of the courses are outdated like 5-8years old. They trick by saying for the beginners but one you started quizzes you'll never be able to solve. I have been trying to answer and some of the answers are never going to be get accepted. There are 8 possibilities in a question with 3 options and believe me I tried all but they won't accept.,
"Last update changed the video page now it can flip which is good BUT... i can't play the downloaded videos witgout buffering?!! Only when i switch off the network!!are you serious?? Then the Next bad thing is, its getting my phone VERY HOT! im not playing a game or something just watching a vidoe, why is my phone getting this hot??",
Not a review of course: course quality is great. The app bot web and mobile suck big time. My subscription was cancelled and course was saying inactive. When i payed again i was enrolled in wrong specialization. I had to go cancel the subscription now on my dashbord my correct subscription is showing. What a complete waste of 1.5 hours of time on a weekend. No customer care number to talk to. No trouble shooting method for typical issues. You are left alone with your issue. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé,
The best platform in online learning!,
Almost unusable when completing a course. Video player constantly overlays the control options which makes videos unwatchable. The app is okay for watching content a second time or just reviewing specific parts but the full version needs to be used to actually finish a course which is a shame.,
"Great value. Cannot find better information for the small monthly fee anywhere. Studyng at your own pace has been a tremendous benefit and, if you think about it, added to its already highly acclaimed position. Any time I need to refresh, or learn something new, I always start with Coursera and so should you!! Ok not sure what happened but I cannot connect or login. No updates were done until I get what I am paying for the rating goes to 1 star!",
It is a really good opportunity to learn topics we have always wanted and also things we actually need. The platform is easy to use and there is never a problem playing videos or listening audios. It is really easy to log in and it is not necessary to do it again and again which make it easier for practicing or studying when we have some time.,
"Issue on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9in, when playing video in landscape mode the aspect ratio doesn't fit the screen perfectly and content is sometimes cut off at the sides as result. Playing in portrait mode or mobile device are fine, but I wish there was an option to adjust how videos fit to screens.",
"Worst app...funny part is I realized that the app which has Google's ux design course is full of glitches and has a very bad user experience. I use desktop to access the course. But when I tried to access the course from Coursera app in my redmi note 7 pro, I cant read articles because of black screen and blinking text, the quiz page seems full of glitches, the discussion prompt dialog ui is worst and less accessible. No organised info/commands and seems like searching for a needle in sand.",
Amazing platform whos providing the best material to achieve career goals,
"I'm not able to login through the app, it says ""invalid email"" or ""sign in error"". Strangely enough I am able to login through the desktop website which means the email and pass I've been entering for my account is correct. I don't understand the issue with the app in that case, why won't it recognise my credentials when the website does let me in using the same ID and pass? I even tried resetting/changing my password but to no avail. Please fix.",
"Continents are awesome, but the App itself needs improvement. For example, the downloaded courses are not accessible due to the app stuck in the online content searching mode at start up. It needs to start with a WiFi or 4G connection before the offline contents can be viewed... please fix this bug and I'll fix my rating to the App.",
"Good app but with a very frustrating bugg. I can't watch videos on my tablet with landscape view, the app will automatically zoom in into the video and crop the sides out, so I can see basically 70% of what is actually on the video. Please fix it, I can provide my system log if that is helpful.",
Poor experience on tablet as does not autorotate content if in landscape mode. Also course content video should continue in full screen mode if the previous one had been in that mode to avoid having to keeping changing mode even when it spins up next content. Happy to be beta tester on app.,
"It's the most organised learning platform I've used for far, it's actually the best in my opinion. But just like the web platform allows me to highlight and save note while watch the lectures, I haven't seen that feature on mobile, the day I see that, I'll give it a 4 start. Please release it in your next updates. Also it will be really good if the video screen could remain the same place on the web platform just like the mobile while the text are still scrollable. Cheers ü•Ç",
Coursera app is really good but it has some stability issues.when we open the app it takes more time to load and sometimes may fail to load the forrums.The offline video availability should have subtitles added to it so that we can use it offline more conveniently. I hope the team would take concern about these issues.,
"App is extremely slow, while the internet connection is fast enough, the app is unable to load content normally. While YouTube videos of the similar quality load quickly, videos on the Coursera app load very slowly and at a lower quality. The app also crashes all the time. Coursera itself is a good source of education, but this app is really bad.",
"Courses might be from colleges, but they're not college level. I finished the 7-week chemistry course in 7 days. Even honors assignments use no math beyond 6th grade. Sometimes after I select my answers on the quiz/HW, the app erases them so I fail the test due to 'unanswered' questions. HW feedback is limited to correct or incorrect - can't learn if you don't know which answer is correct or why your answer was wrong. Needed other sources to augment this class, which is just videos to watch.",
Easy to use and navigate,
"Had a very great experience while using the app, everything is user friendly, there are a lot of courses which will help you improve your skills, the best part is that you don't learn the courses From local people, different professors from universities teach you.",
Hello there. This is a great initiative taken by the team to make an app and help learners across the world to study in a more easier manner. However the app takes a bit of time to open which is kinda hard to wait. So kindly do rectify it up. Kudos to your work apart from that!!,
"There should be a system to set up the video quality that I want to stream with. I mean there should be a option to set the quality in settings, and it will work automatically in every videos, and I won't have to change quality in starting of every videos. And videos don't rotate automatically while watching, hoping you would fix it too.",
"Once I've subscribed, they kept charging me 36 euro every month. There are no active subscriptions on my account and no purchases. There is no way to see the history of my payments, no way to stop them and no receipts are being issued (I found out after checking my bank transactions). Also, customer service is inexistent.",
This is one of the best app for online courses. This app provides you the views and understanding of professional people. So easy to understand. No annoying ads at all. Not much fee affordable and the best thing it let the people to enrol free who can't afford the fee. Totally love this app best helpful.,
"I can't go further than the introduction video the course! I keep getting a warning that my computer's timezone setting doesn't match my Coursera account's time setting of LA, USA. But even after I change the latter to match the former, I still get a warning that they don't match. There has to be a problem!",
"I liked so much, Thank you to this helpful and inspiring app although I hope to fix the problems of answering questions after every single lesson",
"The app is superb, though it has some bugs. You cannot use it to review peer assignments and you can't view peer comments on your own assignments. When reviewing, it occasionally shows HTML tags or the interface jumps. Of the online course apps, Coursera is still the best one.",
I'm very happy with the coursera app. It makes learning so easy.,
"I like coursera and what they stand for very much. The app is not great. The videos get stuck, even if I downloaded them. It takes a long time for the app to load. It is not clear why. They should support fast app loading and smooth video playback.",
"Five stars for the course content and variety it has in terms of courses! Quite a good app... Just one thing that could be improved is that the contents can be more organized. Me visiting it for the first time, had to search things here and there.",
"The app keeps having unexpected errors, can't get past it to take classes and learn. I reinstalled the app, same issue. Something is wrong with this thing and I'm not sure if coursera knows about it.",
"Like the app! And the idea of on-line education. PROBLEM: every time I open the app it wants me to log in, so in case I do not have Internet, I am not able to watch downloaded videos. PROPOSAL: when I complete steps offline they are not marked completed on the platform when device (where I have completed steps) becomes online. But it would be nice.",
"Well, the handoff is great but it's simply impossible to write down in the feedback steps of courses. The textarea is messed up, and the text is written starting by the last letter written. Really weird but. Just stop putting JS everywhere !!! Totally unusable to follow a course.",
Worst app ever. No proper customer support available. I had not verified my ID and name verification was doing great for a couple of certificates. I hadmy whole name on the certificates. I didn't fiddle with my Name verification and went for ID verification and automatically only my surname is getting printed on my certificate. I tried contacting the team via their contact us messaging feature but no replies yet. And they have mentioned that ID verification is permanent. I don't know why.,
"I've had a fairly decent experiences with this app in the past but now it is not even allowing me to download the course materials, particularly videos. Tried switching the video qualities, uninstalling & reinstalling but no use. The quality seems to have deteriorated.",
"All videos have a player overlay, so play, ff, rev, title, progress bar etc. This doesnt disappear, nor can be turned off by tapoing on the video. Also, main app viee has only badly formatted text, no graphics. Unable to watch videos as they are dimmed behind player interface. OnePlus 6T",
I love the new updates on the app. I almost can't find a bug. and I hope I don't. Cheers. Great Job guys,
"I got an email telling me my subscription would be cancelled. I immediately funded the account, woke up this morning to realise the subscription was still cancelled. The help center does absolutely nothing to help. The app doesn't even provide easy navigation for effecting payment myself or re-enrolling. I've been on this all day, and never have I been this frustrated with an app.",
"This application is full of bugs. Its been over four hours and I still can't access my courses. The application says to try again as it has error loading my data. Please fix this, its a very irritating experience. My internet access is good, signal strength is strong and still can't load my data. Please fix this.",
It has so many bugs. During some assignments it tries to relogin without any success after multiple attempts. It is slow. I download course to be able to use it without internet. And no I must observe all the lugs in application. Ask you engineers to watch some courses on your platform.,
The worry for me right now is if there's a special reason why I cannot access attachments under lecture videos on the app. I have downloaded all videos on my mobile. It doesn't make any sense for me to go on the web and load the videos again because I want access to the attachments.,
"It is a wonderful app and I am having a very good experience with it, but I would love you guys to add a feature like a cart were we can select some certain courses we plan to work on and keep them in a cart to help us remember easily as sometimes it's difficult to find all the courses u had in mind to work on",
"Love the app. But why does it pause the video on its own? There's no pop up question, it just pauses after playing for a few minutes... I was trying to listen to the video while my hands are occupied. Had to resume it from pausing many times throughout a video is frustrating.",
"After the first few days of installing it, I've not been able to use it again. You try to open it, you get the launch (splash) screen, that's where it stops, for reasons I can't explain, it just stays there until you're tired and just quite it. I resorted to using the browser to take my course, which the display isn't nice because it wasn't design for small screens. I hope they'll be able to check and correct this,",
"Very Good app, contains several courses of interest and relevance, but the only problem is that it doesn't have alot of courses on certain subjects, international law for instance. On the whole its a great app, but 5 stars if you add more courses on the same!",
"Love the app, however there's an error that needs to be addressed. In the questions with multiple selectable options, the app tells you that certain unselected options were correct or that you should have selected another, and cuts points for those. But when you reattempt the quiz, it says what you selected is incorrect. And only gets fixed in the 3rd attempt when you don't select the incorrect ones that the app asked you to select in the first place.",
"Overall helpful and mostly reliable. Plenty of interesting things to learn and some good instructors. Issue with losing my place. If I minimize the app even just for a moment, when I go back to it the lesson starts over from the beginning.",
"Originally I was using edx, but I think that the courses on here are MUCH better. I wasted so much time before since there was no rating system on the other app. You didnt know if the course was bad or not until you'd wasted hours or days on it. However, I'm not sure why they bothered making this an app though. A lot of the courses do not work at all.",
Cool colors. Easy to navigate. It should also include search option for forums as well as the downloadable materials that are associate with lectures. Those things are there in webpage but it would be more encompassing if those things were included.,
"This app and coursera page is sooo slow to load. Even more - A user doesn't land you on hers last course place, it lands on completely irrelevant page (which has some enrollment info or encorages her to edit her profile) The video even on Android have too much ""oops something went wrong"" ... I'm curious, who was the architect of this solution. (never to hire) I'm not sure why.it takes soo much longer then by other course providers. It is a pity.",
After the app changed to previous user interface again it takes a lot of time to navigate. It even fails to load the downloaded content sometimes. The app was working fine when it was updated to a new user interface which is shown in the images on playstore.,
"Terrible experience with this app. This app is poorly optimised. After I watch an offline video and move on to next video I'm experiencing heavy lag in the video. In order to fix this I have to close the app and open this again. After watching the 2nd video and moving on to 3rd video the same lag occurs. I have to repeat this process till my course is completed. Also, I'm experiencing EXTREME BATTERY DRAIN while using this app. Even PUBG Mobile does not drain this much battery in my device.",
App is pretty good. All the contents are very helpful but the reason behind the 2 stars is after recent update app is not working it takes lots n lots of time and then error. I can't even watch a single lecture. It's my request to developer please clear all the bugs and make it work properly. Please please!!!,
"In short: After 3+ years of usage, the app became useless for me. The reason is that the app requires internet connection every time the app is started. 3 stars for long journey with Coursera app. Long version: Used to be a big fan of the app. I used it watch videos offline when I don't have access to Internet, but now it's impossible. Every single time I start the app, I am asked to log in. Of course, log in requires Internet connection. No more use of offline videos.",
"Excellent platform. Here's why I am giving 4 stars and not 5. First of all it is very difficult‚Äîeven impossible in some cases‚Äîto find any attachments in a video. And secondly, after the discussion form there is no next button, we have to exit the current screen and then go to the next part.",
I really love the app and the courses provided. I have a passion for learning languages and thanks to this app I have done 6 diplomas in different languages. App is very easy to operate and I really enjoy using it. Been using this app for a long time and never had any problems. Just one suggestion. Is there any chance to add Korean language to the list please? I really recommend this app. Thank you.,
"Loved the latest update of UI. The courses can be navigated vertically as well as side-ways is really good. There is some problem with downloads. As I download a whole week of course video, some downloads get stuck in middle and never resumes. Is this the problem because I already have downloaded courses in GB's?",
"When i try logging in with my google account, it makes me input the password and then it simply returns to the login page. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, i've cleared all cached data, i've even checked my settings on the browser, but alas the application is not letting me log in. the browser is perfectly fine though but you see, not everyone can afford a PC or a laptop.",
"It's a great, useful application, especially downloading lectures, but when I saw the script of the lecture I discovered that The app does not support the translation as well as the website, which has made it very difficult for me to complete the course. Please fix this problem As soon as possible and I appreciate this great effort ,thanks",
"I subscribed to an IBM specialization, and after the second payment was debited from my account, I've not been able to access my account and continue from where i stopped. The course is not showing on my courses list, but when i searched for it it says ""enrolled"". I cant access my course materials, and my subscription has been counting since the 10th of April, today is the 18th. I have sent an email and i've not gotten a response from you. This is very disappointing and discouraging.",
"The mobile and web UI are bad. Video playback is buggy. The content is poor compared to other online courses and what is freely available elsewhere. The user experience is inconsistent across platforms. It's difficult to tell if you've enrolled in a free course, a trial, or a paid course and it's uncertain what you're going to be billed for. The FAQ pages seem years out of date.",
"The app is fine, but is not optimized for tablets. The screen is locked to portrait mode in the homepage of the app. But when a specific course is opened, the screen turns to landscape mode. Please make it more optized for tablet users.",
"Content download takes ages (I have a good Internet connection, but more than 2 days to try, yes try, downloading 250 mb?). Crashes more often than anyone want. Also if are reading some lecture, and block your phone or switch to other app and later unblock it or go back, the content is re-rendered, operation that take a lot of time :-(",
False advertisers. Tried for a couple days and was liking. Was going to subscribe. But once I seen the new pricing. 6x more expensive and locks you into a year contract. Don't bother with it. Can get free class at your local education institutions own MOOC systems. These are well put together but not worth it at price they are at. Won't ever use or recommend again without a monthly plan available again. 90% of users it will be 70% wasted money .,
"Works great and looks good, too. Would be 5 starts if some basic functions weren't missing like all the filter options for courses that are available via browser. An option to bookmark a course or putting it in some kind of selection list would be great",
"Excellent learning app ! But there are some things to improve like video lags after using the app only for 15-20 mins. Though the app isn't contains big files, I am facing heating issues with my device. While using other video apps, there are no heating issues even after using 3-4 hours. Thanks !",
"Absolutely horrible app. Taking tons of time to load the courses. Plus for certain courses you cannot take quizzes on the app. It is still designed for laptop usage rather than mobile usage. Wake up coursera, most people are learning using their phones nowdays.",
"Improving the video player is the worst thing that has happened in Coursera. I am no longer able to access the exams except by running the bad and slow video player. Please bring back the old version of the video player, it is much smoother",
"Had expected more from the Android app. No dark mode, overall the load time is slow - both exploring courses AND while doing the courses, and navigating between courses. It feels very laggy and unpolished. Some courses are designed to have certain segments done on a laptop. And when you are on a laptop you wonder exactly what and why this exercise could not be done on mobile...! Other absent functions e.g. minimise video so user can multitask on a phone... more video speed selection on desktop",
"I am sorry for this rate,but really the application got stupid when I start downloading lectures, it takes much time and sometimes it fails to download the videos! Two years ago, I've started using the app and I thought it is just a temporary software bug and it will be fixed, but till now it's the same. Please fix this problem, as Coursera is my best platform ‚ù§Ô∏è",
"Content on Coursera is the best, I really appreciate the content. But the App is too bad;). It's too heavy and in every 5-10 minutes it's being restart. Very hanging app. I would like if Coursera will consider this my feedback and make the app more familiar and light ASAP! THANKS COURSERA FOR SUCH A VALUABLE CONTENT . . The best content but the worst performance of app ever I have seen. Please improve its performance, specially while downloading the content ü§êü§ê",
"My rating for this organisation to be full star. I was fulfilled with the courses offering.But one thing with this app is that while watching videos , after 3 or 4 minutes the video becoming lagging and strucking each and every second and my mobile gets enormously heated . This made me to complete my videos very complected thing. So i request to fix this bug and i need solution for this issue. Thanking you.",
I've installed this app several times but either I can't figure out how to apply for financial aid or when I start a class it seems like the tests and the flow of the info comes too fast. But I've heard really good things for many years and it's incredibly easy to unenroll if I must or enroll again.,
"Using Android 11 on Note 10+, the audio sporadically freezes when the app is put into background by going to the lock screen. Basically this means that you can't listen to audio of a lecture while going for a walk without the audio jamming up after a few seconds or a few minutes. It's infuriating. Fix it Coursera.",
"This app has alot of good courses and would love to take benefit of this but, Each page a lot of time in uploading. Though my net is there it says please have your net connected. I cannot be a part of discussions of my course due to this. And most importantly it takes a lot for a page to get uploaded and comes with an error in the end asking to close/wait/refresh the app.",
"Terrible app, won't work. It won't load pages unless you click so many times on Retry. Keeps crashing all the time. I can't even make a search because it just simply doesn't load. Also keeps saying it needs network connection even though I'm connected. Just garbage",
"The app does not save your quiz answers (before submitting) , if you answered few questions and want to continue later you have to start again from scratch. Plus it has connection problems, I faced this issue few times where I answered all the questions in the quiz, hit submit to see that most of the questions that I answered were marked unsolved.",
"Coursera is really good for online learning. But the customer service so far is so terrible. I have problem with my activation of course after my payment, and I don't even find a place to submit my problems. I pay for the courses but unable to start the course right away?! No contact me button on the page when the instruction says you may use it to contact with service center?!",
I installed this app for korean learning and I was really enjoying the classes but when I reached 2nd module it stopped midway... videos won't load even if I have good internet connection..it says the check your internet connection and just keeps on buffering but won't start. Please fix this issue because I really want to continue learning on this app.,
"Coursera is the best. The way they teach, the assignments and quizzes are easily understood. My only issue at this time is the subscription. It pains me when I can't submit my assignments and test my knowledge of the subject because i audited the course. Asides my limitations, it's Coursera anytime.",
"The loading screen and the loading of courses take like for ever compared to the last update which was snappy, the downloaded content doesn't show up in downloads section, then whats to point of having an offline& downloads option. The new tweak to the ui feels really good and much appreciated.",
"I love this app, its generous to let learn without certification free. The conent is truly quality marked and diversified, just name it and there's a heavy chance you'll find what your looking for if not better. Only issue is it takes a lot data and is sometimes slow in loading.",
"very basic, you expect more from courcera particularly when you paying 40 quid a Month. play/ pause option is always visible on screen mean screen appears dull. video playback can't be locked mean unintended touch on screen stops the video, or fwd it revers it. can't see downloaded pdf resources.",
"I just love the app. It's very easy to use with excellent interface and user experience. What I will request Coursera to provide Search option in enrolled courses, because otherwise I have to scroll down to find the course out of many.",
"Very good extension for the website. It allows access to my courses when away from a computer. Most importantly, it works well on slow internet connections, and the offline mode is very helpful. I find the interface very simple and easy to use.",
"Such a bad customer service! There's no helpline number, neither they reply to your queries! I completed my course for a professional certificate, and after completing my course when I did the identity verification then they added my actual name plus 'AFEDOB' in the certificate, and now I don't have any option to change it! Majorly disappointed!",
"The app heats up my phone so much that it is uncomfortable to hold, and takes up so much of battery rapidly (when I'm using it with offline downloaded content, I'm not sure of online). Also, it freezes while seeking or switching videos.",
"Can someone pls help me with the situation?? I had enrolled in a subscription course of Google project management and had completed over 3 weeks of study in a weeks time. Everything was going well but suddenly after the free trial the course disappeared from my account. Even though I haven't cancelled tbe course, it shows to be cancelled. Now that I'm trying to repay to continue my study, I'm unable to make the payment, it shows that there's some error. Please guide me through this.",
"Great app, been doing course's on the go for the past month now I especially liked how the transcript went along with the video and you could click on a sentence and it will go back to that part of the video, but for some reason without notice you removed it please add it back.",
"Dear developer, I used to spent more time a day on coursera rather than any other application on my mobile device. I really enjoyed using this for a long time, After using this for many years now I realise it is missing one simple but essential functionality. Coursera doesn't support an auto rotate feature. Could you kindly bring this change on the coming update.",
"Great teacher & material, but people flood the user forum with requests for early peer grading instead of waiting their turn. Sadly as a result, users quickly give up using the forum to help each other with course questions - meaning if you get stuck there's no one to help you. Policy says they will remove repeat offenders but they didn't. I originally planned to take several other courses but changed my mind because this significantly impedes learning & diminishes the whole course experience.",
"The app used to run quite well on my MI A2 device. Yesterday, I updated my device. Thereafter, it crashes every time I launch it. I cannot figure out the issue. Tried restarting the device and uninstalling and re-installing the app several times.",
"Can you guys please introduce dark mode. And also, I'd like some better way of organizing my courses. Right now it seems like an infinite drag. Also, can the course progress for audit courses not include the assignments because it's annoying that my course progress is hindered at week 1 only because I don't do the paid assignments which are for the paid users. It would be nice if there was a separate progress for content and assignments so people auditing courses can check their progress.",
"Video player has been broken the last two days. I know it's not my device, I've tried clearing the app cache and data, uninstalling and reinstalling, and tried using the app on two different devices. Maybe fix the video player so I can actually finish my course!",
Terrible experience with the app. The videos do not download...they download at far lower speeds. Also while directly streaming the videos have breaks/lags all the time. I mean they are teaching so many courses but they can't make a proper app. What even!,
"Great course offerings. The app should also support landscape mode anywhere, not just only on some pages so that I don't need to keep rotating my tablet back and forth. It'd be great if this app also supports Save Note like the web app.",
"Needs Update. App not optimised for phones with Hole-punch displays, like Samsung galaxy s10. An additional black bar is added in the area of the camera-hole on top of the usual one(due to 16:9 video). This makes the video small and lays waste to the big displays phones have these days. Please update so that we don't face this problem when using Coursera on mobile.",
"Great site. Poor app. Skip it and just use your browser instead. Videos in the app regularly cut out regardless of connection. Text, especially math or programming languages, is often unreadable due to lack of rendering support. Special features like ID verification just don't work at all.",
buggy. Great material but at times the screen cuts of the information. keep getting unavailable notifications after each quiz and my response is not recorded. In order for me to complete each quiz I am forced todo this on the desktop browser. Please fix.,
"lots of relevant lessons to study from. Content and lessons are broken down easily. It's nice to learn at your own pace and saves your progress. there are quizzes after each section you have to pass, but you get a few attempts.",
"I'm unable to access course data on mobile data. The videos and the reading content fail to load. If I try to access the lecture video over Wi-Fi, the video controls don't disappear as the video starts playing making it difficult to watch.",
"This is the first interaction I've had with Coursera the mobile app. Nothing is loading, a number of course Ive looked at gives me a message that says ""error retreiving course"". Besides that, it takes way too long for the app to load. Coursera is a great source, and I would love to have it on my phone on the go.",
"I'm deleting this app cause it stressed me a lot. Everytime I imput my log in details, it tells me ""sign in failed, check your email and password"" and there's nothing wrong with them, they're very much correct cause I have them saved on google password and when I select forgot password, you don't give me a password reset link. The same thing everytime.",
"Loved it man, just loved it. It's really very easy to use. Coursera collaborates with top universities in the world to bring us world class knowledge to build up the skills and technical knowledge we want. And that too at very less cost. Take your time to complete the courses and you are good to go. Coursera is the best!!!!!üòä",
"I have had the priviledge of using this online learning platform and it has been eye opening thus far. I was a bit apprehensive as to how I would integrate it into my regular daily routine. However,it actually gave me more autonomy over the time I had because the courses were administered in such a way that one could do self paced learning and condition the brain to absorb information over a period of time.",
"I was doing the Google automation course which was great in the video department. But the actual questions are a pain to get through not because of difficulty but rather most of them are just ""fill in the blanks"" to get the right answer and leaves no room for creativity. Even if you get the same output as original code it still marks it as wrong. And for $40/month you get absolutely no costumer service I had to post this review just to have my grievances heard. Partial refund plz ü•∫",
"It overwhelmed me right from the beginning. As a paralyzed Disabled Veteran who also sustained a bad head injury, until I know something very well, time leads to pressure. Plus, this thing is trying to charge me right from the beginning. I've not been in school since 1985 and it wants to throw a huge load at me? I'll find a free one that will go at my own pace.",
"I fly often to other countries and need to use coursera offline. I watch videos and read all the materials on my phone, and after that when I use coursera on my laptop with internet connected, no lesson is synchronized between my phone and web version. Moreover, all the materials on my phone are ticked green no more, as if I haven't studied any lesson at all.",
The app was working very well before last the update my courses won't load it keep saying check your internet connection although i have pretty good internet connection (mobile data as well as wifi ) search option works in the app but can't load the course please fix this bug/issue as Soon as possible since we need complete the courses in time,
Having an error with assignments. Most of the questions are missing snippets and imaging so we basically cannot solve them at all. So it fails the test. There are a couple more features you can add to the app. But first if you could resolve this error.,
"URGENT! For some reason the app shows stories of The Creative Writing Course cutoff on the app... I went to the full site to be able to read, or else I was going to misjudge the assignment as incomplete. Please don't make excuse that you already put a warning about the big screens, you need to be specific and clear to tell people that texts may not be fully shown on the app. Inacceptable, I was going to upset someone maybe. Thanks God I have a mind.",
"Not optimized yet for tablets and sometimes buggy as hell. I found this hard when reading section and at home page only available in potrait, not landscape mode. Also, come on, I regard my tablets as Laptop subtitutes already as it comes with bigger screen and physical keyboard extension. So there's no reason the exams cannot be done in bigger screen tablets but still rather identify them mobile as phone does. I'm tired borrowing someone their laptops only for exam purpose.",
This is a superb app. It doesn't lag and works very smoothly. And the content is easily understandable and beneficial also. Anyone can learn very easily about their interest field. The one who wants to improve their professional as well as personal life should install this app.,
"I downloaded the videos .. But they were not played properly. When i saw the video , video was played for 3 to 4 seconds and stop for 5 to 6 seconds. So i can't understand the proper meaning of the sentences. In past time, i was also faced this problem. So i uninstalled the app and reinstall it . But i faced the same problem.",
"Really cool and easy to navigate and use, but when reading and the screen goes off, it returns back to the beginning of the reading.. the only negative I think I experience from the application, asides that It's a very wonderful app with good user interface and experience",
"Nothing more than website. There's no point in installing an app when it does its job worse than the website. It doesn't remember the video speed and, most importantly, doesn't allow me to take tests as the screen is ""too small"". I can do tests on the same device via website.",
"The App is wonderful and easy to use, i mean it works perfect on my simplest Phone, on one hand the download is so quick and i can access the contents offline an time i want, not to forget that the courses are such design in a special manner to make one one to fully understand. I am not just saying it, but i know what i am saying. So 5 Stars.",
"There are always problems with assignments, sometimes I don't get assigments, sometimes there are no assignments to review. Support team seems to be helpful, but they never really help me, they put me on other sessions, but usuallyit doesn't help. I'm tryingto finish the current specialization, but then I will look for another platform.",
"Coursera is my favourite MOOC site. But the app is annoying, it doesn't have full functionality like the webpage so when I switch to chrome it redirects me every time to the app which doesn't have that feature. I have to uninstall and reinstall everytime.",
"I wish this app allowed us to bookmark and compare courses/certificates we're interested in - it's really annoying to go back and forth and try to remember specific names. There are several I'm interested in taking, but I don't like having to search for them every time I want to reread the description.",
"I loved this app. Charges heavy amount(course fee) after trial period for certificates which are not much useful in career upgradation or job searching.. Anyway was a useful app for learning something new and to add something extra on cv. but now full off errors Tried many times but still showing as ""error loading enrollment data"" while i click upgrade to get a certificate. Please fix this soon",
Coursea is unarguably the best learning platform anytime any day. I had both platforms COURSEA AND EDX installed long before the lockdown but I started utilizing them properly during the lock down and I'm shocked at how much I've missed overtime. I'm overwhelmed at how much I can learn at my own pace from advanced schools still staying connected with my peers. All thanks to Coursera and technology ü§ù.,
"After the update last july 2022, the streaming has become more difficult to watch due to intermittent buffering. The problem started with new video player interface. Kindly revert back to original video player with smooth online streaming please. Will change my review once everything gets back to normal.",
The latest update made the whole online learning experience terrible. The tracker for transcript is gone. I can't navigate the video from the transcript anymore. I can't fast forward the video by double tapping anymore. Speeding up the video requires a few steps instead of one like how it was done. The video constantly buffers which almost never happened in the previous version! I hope this 'downgraded' upgrade is temporary and the useful features can be restored. Edit: The features are back.,
The courses are good. Straight forward and very clear. Understandable and you learn skills easily. I would like them to look into the complementary readings because most of them are not available or files are not opening,
"I used to do a few Udemy courses, these are completely different with a full course schedule. Courses are downloadable and from real universities, you only need to pay the app subscription or for your diploma IF you want one. A way to save courses to a wishlist would be useful as you currently have to remember or save the link.",
"Tried cancelling my subscription to content I hadn't and wasn't going to use, as there was supposedly a time frame I could cancel before it would charge. It then charged me days later, after the refund option was no longer available. I had decided not to join the course I had planned to, but I know now that I don't intend to use this service at all after this.",
"It's highly recommended that you add a section for free courses and paid courses. This way users will easily search whichever type of course they want. The current layout of the Coursera platform, both app and website, is a mess. It has changed dramatically. Why so?",
Love Coursera. But the app has a room for improvements. The simplest one is to make it save the current state of an activity. When i return to the app via a launcher after the pause of a video it displays the main screen with all my courses.,
"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! Won't allow me to log into my already existing Coursera account! Instead it keeps trying to make me create a new account and asking for a different email address because the one I'm trying to use is already in use! I know it's already in use, I'm trying to access my account via the app! I know it's not a case of wrong password either cause I can log in to my account just fine from the web browser. I will be deleting this app since it's utterly useless!",
Why do you offer an option to download content if you are still required to have a cell signal? I travel all the time and have bad service in many areas. I can't use the app if cell reception is bad. I have also noticed that the app uses data even when the content is downloaded to the phone.,
PLEASE FIX LAG BUG: This app is good but for streaming it's kind of get behind... I like its offline feature but when i used that after 4-5 weeks of lectures it started lagging for first 2-4 min it lags about 2 secs and after thta it lags about 4 secs which is horrible and not able to focus & the continuity disturbs. Also because of lag it kind of disturb the mood to learn through coursera please fix that bug.,
When I enter company url and login.. everytime initially it says sign in error. Please check network. I have 100mbps speed. Then second time it spins infinitely and does nothing. While doing it if I rotate screen signing in stops. Please test app thoroughly before releasing it. Very poor experience right at logging in. I was keen on extensively using this app for courses and I have got just 1 week to complete many courses.,
"App is not working properly, namely, course material and tests not loading right. Recently switched from iPhone, where the app worked almost perfectly. This is not even close. Surprisingly the one thing that was an issue on the iPhone app is the only thing that works right here on the Android app.",
"bug: when i watch a video and switch to other app and then switch back to coursera, the video is only playing in the background and i am not able to see the entire video panel anymore. also it does not support downloading pdf slides attached with the video.",
"The app is very good, easy to use and navigate. But my issue is that when my deadline arrives, even though I have completed everything from that week they keep asking me to reset deadlines, despite having done all the neccessary things. I'm confused, how can I stop this message",
Worst application because of bundle of bugs !! Course doesn't load; even post update situation are adverse !! Don't you people know how to update the bugs !! U can't imagine what time loss we are in !! Course content is excellent !! But bugs are horrible !! Fix it as early as possible !! This bugs brings the confidence and enthusiasm down !!,
"Can't open the graded quiz at all. When I press start, all it shows is a blank dialog box. When I tried to download the quiz, it didn't download either. Kindly look into this problem and please fix it as soon as possible.",
"The perfect app to learn about IT whenever and wherever I am. It even let's you take notes within app for you to review later and write down on paper if you'd like. Though, at times when using the app on my phone it does bug out sometimes and I'm not sure if it's my phone or the app itself, but other than that Good stuff.",
Excellent app for all students who want to learn many things which we cannot learn in our clg or university. The only which I want is please ensure you give all the resources of a course accessible in Mobile itself for some it requires desktop which has become a lot of trouble for many of the students of Coursera. Please take it seriously and Modify the app to suit all the things of course working on mobile also. Thankyou.,
I started using this app and I found it very useful for those who are interested in online education. It provides certificate for the course which we complete. And this is such a wonderful platform for e - learning. One of the special thing I found about this app is it is accessible for Android phones too. So easy to use and gain a valuable certificate. During the life long time we wouldn't be able to attend direct classes and this app is helpful for us to use a virtual class room.,
I love it. This is the second course I am taking with Coursera and literally is very good app and website too. I recomedent for everyone who want to change the career and doesn't have a chance to go to uni or college. Or even for people who has a degree already.,
"None of the features that I turned on in the setting works. No push notification on my phone, can't sync with calendar, don't delete automatically so I have to delete my materials manually. Lots of bugs. Please improve, thank you!",
"I love the download offline option a lot. It allows me to watch videos and continue learning even when I am not online. But there is one little problem. When I try to download a week's content, it downloads all the videos including those which I have already watched when I was online.",
"I would rate -5 if there was an option. Ridiculous application, you can't un-enroll from course in app or website login. All thanks to the developers who made me no choice but to switch to other platforms for learning. I tried deleting the account and start fresh but then it says password is wrong everytime. My suggestions to all those who want to install this app is that, the help article don't work either. Lol!",
This app is great when it comes to learning from top institutes of the world. But the bugs are really annoying. I have to restart my phone after watching a few videos everytime. I hope the developers will solve this problem soon.,
"This app honestly has the best courses in app development, and yet this app is so incompletely designed that it would make it difficult for you to learn it either. On a serious note, the download section of the app doesn't work, the financial aid application can't be filled and the ID verification doesn't work either. It would be great if you could look into these issues. Thanks",
"I love coursera itself but the app sucks. If you lost internet connection during quizzes, it does not save your answers, basically erasing your whole progress. If you accidentally rotate your screen during a peer-graded assignment, it automatically deletes your answers if you did not save it.",
"The app has some very useful and resourceful course, but the video player seems to be very much unstable and starts lagging after playing for 2-3 mins and I have to restart the app every time. This is getting very annoying at this point.",
"After the new update, coursera has become worst, everytime whenever i start a new lecture a new interface pop up and say ""there's something error in Playing the video please try again later"" something like this.....i don't understand why this is happening so restart the app and even i reinstalled it but the bug is not fixing. Please Coursera fix this thing coz i am having alot of difficulty using this app....",
"It's a very platform for you to learn and apply various technical and non technical skills in order to make your job profile strong. I have just one issue, and that is some of the videos are note playing on Android devices but same are playing on pc's and laptops. If this can be solved then it would be highly appreciated.",
"Navigating the app is a bit confusing. Also, when I download for offline use, after a while, the files will be deleted. This has happened severally. Please fix these glitches and maybe I can come back and give the app five stars.",
"The course content is good but be careful not to pay or leave any payment details. Regardless of advertised rates or promotions, their system will try to collect the maximum rate, or continue billing after cancellation. You'll need to resolve with your bank since customer support is unable to do anything helpful.",
"Overall worth courses, but one thing I like to remind to the team is that, the candidates need the option to view the correct answer of a question after he passed a particular weekly assignment (eg:if one's scoring 80% in one assignment he or she will make mistakes in some questions but not able to view the correct answers after passing), NEED THE FEEDBACK OF CORRECT ANSWERS AND WRONG ANSWERS FOR CROSS CHECKING.",
"Been using them for a couple weeks, the course is half in a diffrent language which online shows people have been having issues with for months and when you talk to there service team it takes 3 people to make it worse just for one person to finally help a little, iv been locked out of my courses because of them not knowing what there doing then one guy fixes it and I ask him a question some other dude answers and suddenly I'm no longer inrolled in a course I was more then half way done!",
Draw you in with self paced learning but not all courses are available and canceling is a hassle. Eventually after contact their support multiple times I was forced to reverse the charges on my credit card. Even then they continued to try and charge for a subscription.,
"I'm out $200 because these snakes changed the price on a class that I signed up to audit. I never sign up for trial classes, only ones that I can audit for free since I don't need certification, I just want knowledge. Well they changed it to a subscription of $50 a month with zero heads up. I just happened to log on and see it this morning, and even though it was within 12 hours of paying I can't get a refund. They also sold my phone number when I first made my account. It's disgusting.",
"I have been using the app since more than a year ago. But recently the quits by itself. I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Did not work, the problem is still there. It is funny that on new features of this version it says ""crash fixes"" and crashing is the problem that was created in this revision (at least for me)",
"When last year I started using this app I loved it but it's not working properly now. I tried to open my app, I waited for about 5 to 10 minutes but nothing happens. My screen goes blank. This happens with me almost everytime when I tried to open my app. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.",
"Brilliant. A very high Standard Courses. It's worth every minute of one's input into it. I suggest one should try coursera, then only one can really get the grasp of it. Coursera should provide digital certificates after completion of courses free of cost.",
"Hi app developer, is it possible to make sure all the slides that need to be opened on a bigger screen can also be displayed on portable devices? It's just quite annoying to switch from a smaller screen to a computer constantly in just one week of lesson.",
They have weird policies about refunding the subscription and yes I didn't get my $65 spent on course which was free and when I canceled the subscription it said non-refundable. And when I had doubt about that I was looking to contact them and these people don't even have a customer support numnber. Wow just wow! Very terrible experience and never coming again to you guys.,
"I rarely can view videos in the app. The error keeps occuring saying that ""Something went wrong. Please exit the player and start again"". It won't play after restart, won't play after I resume the course. Very annoying and disappointing üòû",
I can't use courses offline even though I have them downloaded and I'm on the right settings. I think there should be a redesigning so one can access the courses they're on first on the homepage and also there should be a bookmarking option to videos and articles so one can revisit with ease.,
"The app is good, overall experience is nice but most of the time it fails to sync the progress I've made offline. I like to download videos and watch them as I get time but most of the time it either fails to sync or it takes a long time.",
"Downloaded videos starts laging after 5 min of watching, and even this app takes to kuch time to actually display what courses i have subscribed and other pages. And this app most of the time crashes. But the on thing good about this app is it provides offline support but that feature is buggy and a bit of laggy too.",
"Coursera is an amazing platform for learners. People can literally learn so many different topics for free from here. And of course they can purchase a course to get peer review, do extra assignments and get a real certificate. Hats off to devs and mooc! Note for the devs: Faced two problems with the current app 1. The smartphone app wont synk with the web version, the progresses I've done with a browser will be shown as 'overdue' on the app. 2. Discussion forum is not as active as it should be.",
"Hello Guys !! I want to report a problem whenever i use this app first of all the video and overall UI is so glitchy i can't even properly scroll . Second thing after this is the video playback is also very glitchy and slow and after few seconds of playback i get this message "" Sorry the app stopped working "" . I am enrolled in a course so for me this is a big loss and i need support Asap . I want to rate 5 stars but please fix this issue . I'm using Lenovo K6 Note .",
Not sure what's wrong with this. Ideally all the apps on Android stops playing the moment you lock your screen. This app continue to play without showing any progress bar or popup. It's really frustrating.,
"The lecture videos are constantly deemed with progress bar when played. Touched the blank space but still deemed. Please fix. Edit: I talked to support chat and they told me to not use the app... I told him to just relay the issue to the developers but no, kept saying that I should use PC instead....... AND I AM A PAID USER.",
"It's simple and great app but need further development 1- you need to add ""Updates"" option button to be able to follow and check my updates on financial aid request 2- You need to add the wishlist option, so I can mark any desired course to my wishlist Because every time I need to see a certain course I check before I start to search for it from scratch and it's really annoying",
I have a good experience with Coursera except when I use it on my laptop. Since I am trying to try things out alongside the instructor I have to put my tab in split screen and the video usually starts from the beginning multiple times. Hope this can be corrected.,
Playback stops randomly when listening downloaded content with screen locked. An optional feature to automatically skip interactive content would be nice to have a non-stop listening mode. Currently the screen should be unlocked every time when playback stops or interactive content needs to be skipped. Speed setting resets when a lesson gets skipped so it needs to be re-adjusted every time.,
"When I signed in coursera app, immediately, I get an update pop-up. Neither could I dismiss the pop-up in the app nor could I successfully update the app in playstore. The pop-up took me to the playstore and when I clicked update, it did nothing but drain my battery. I waited for 30 mins for the update also. So I uninstalled the app but couldn't install it back even though I recently cleared all my mobile phone data and my internet speed is good. The website is better than the mobile app.",
"No doubts Coursera is the place to learn...but the video interface makes me give a terrible review...tools don't go away once video has started rather it stays there nd blur the main learning video, nd one can't learn at this condition...I noticed this almost 3weeks ago and reported to your support team yet nothing has been done about it, and that doesn't tell good about Coursera... pls fix your bug because the videos are useless if it continues to display like that and our time is being wasted.",
The latest updates doesn't play videos seemlessly even after downloading them. This is quite frustrating when you have downloaded videos so that you can learn while traveling. What's the use of downloading & wasting your data network then? Not the kind of result I expected from Coursera...,
"i would give a five star. for sake of learning, please fix the video player! it's super buggy, makes the phone hot; after some time watching download video(not a internet speed issue), the player start to zzzzz, like riding in bumpy road :( or just implement vlc open source player. edit: v3.13.0, u guys did not fix the video player.",
"The app is freezing alot when i open the my courses tab and try to take any quizzes. It takes forever to load the courses. Also there's some issue with the video player, when i try to watch a pre downloaded lecture it starts to freeze again.",
"Thank you for providing this coursera experience for mobile users, but why there's no dark mode available, I think it's a very important option. Also the video controls never disappear and this makes the experience very bad.",
"The grades tab on the android version of this application has disappeared after the last update. There's no way to keep track of individual assignment grades in consolidated form on the app, as in the browser version. Please put it back.",
"Strongly prefer using app over desktop, but discussion forums text box is broken - it types right to left and jumps around as I type, lately, making it impossible to finish my work on the phone. Update 5/30/21: text boxes still are broken two months later!",
"Nice app, but there are issues regarding activities and submission of assignment. I need to use browser to submit assignment, as the app is having issues. It shows not uploaded everytime I try to upload. It is also not getting updated. The browser data and app data of my completion of a course also don't match.",
"First, very slow when fetching course weeks. Second, can't show clearly what is the current resolution of videos. Third, video speed and resolution aren't saved so must be set every next video. Fourth, no easy way to save video snapshot in full screen.",
"Experience is intermediate. Screen sometimes stops rotation. But the most loved item is that you can get ""Financial Aid"" which is very helpful for the students. Unlike other educational platforms, it is Ad-Free for all users. Thanks you Coursera .",
"I advise creatives alike to stay away from this app. The interface is terrible on some devices, assignments are often full of unavoidable bugs. The courses are uninspiring & bland. Peer reviews are pointless waste of time that benefit nobody and sometimes non functional on certain devices which can softlock your PAID certificate at 98%.",
"Landscape mode doesn't work on the main page. Works everywhere else in the app. This makes it very frustrating to use this app on large tablets like the Galaxy Tab s8+, which are primarily used in landscape mode.",
"Overall a good experience. However, when I watch videos on my android tablet in full screen mode the edges of the videos are not visible, which is very annoying. I wish it could be fixed.",
the has been recently outfitted with a very warm and friendly look. I have always loved it and now it looks less clunky so yeah 5 stars. the upgraded membership is quite worth it for me. try it for a month It's not too much more and you can easily roll back to basic membership.,
"Coursera is an amazing platform.... almost everything about it is excellent; the courses, the search results, and algorithm but they should make their payments ""one-off"" instead of charging monthly or give users options to select their preference.",
"You made an app for a phone, we should be able to view content without the need for a desktop/laptop. And yes, we are able to open the Coursera quizzes on a web browser on our phones but the input bar for certain quizzes are buggy causing errors on answer submissions.",
"Great app, but there are a few issues with downloads. When we download, there is no clear option to stop download of a single video / reading. This is especially an issue when a download is waiting for network.",
The application is not responding correctly. The application and the web platform are not binding automatically. And the downloaded video can't be access offline. Hope you will publish a stable version asap. Thanks!,
Very useful app. I was able to complete my lectures while traveling a long distance from my residence to workplace. It helps me to fully utilise those ~3hr of time spent in daily commuting. Very user friendly way to complete the courses.,
"I love web version but the app has a lot of bugs. Sometimes I can't even watch the videos because app immediately get me out. I need to uninstall and install again but the problem persists most of the time. Plus, to write a comment on the discussion forum, it's impossible. Just let me put letters without sense.",
"The courses are great, but the tests are very unreliable. Submitting the results fails a lot of times and responses are not saved in the app, so you have to redo the whole thing. Please fix this.",
"Pros: great content, financial aid, free access through public libraries, wide variety of certificates available, option to audit courses, ability to download content Cons: transcript section became smaller in the last update, last update took away function to click on transcript to go to that part of video, some content that is required for certificates requires a laptop/desktop computer to complete I'd like to see the ability to save courses to a list to complete later",
"there are many awesome points for this app, just that some things require a bigger screen like a laptop, I can't pause at a certain point and return to it, it just goes back to the beginning of the page. But it's good points far out weigh the bad",
This is the best online learning platform I have ever attempted. The courses are not complex and just require some studying on your part. I love how much Coursera has helped me obtain new skills to change career paths. I am grateful! Thank you for offering such a wonderful platform! I can't afford to goto school and don't have family. This makes it simple to earn certifications for jobs in tech if you focus and do the work.,
"Awesome! They have done a really good job in making the app. Best learning experience -with offline mode, lectures and quizzes. Coursera app is the best courses' app. It has tons of features along with smooth experience and nice UI.",
"My only issue with this app is during the course, the discussion modules are not opening. Also, I cannot enroll to various specializations on the app. I have to use the Coursera website. Also, I'm having issues downloading PDF's. Hope these problems are resolved soon.",
"Coursera, the best online educational app. I have stated three weeks ago and I'm enjoying my learning on my mobile With the busy schedules I have, Coursera has helped me to learn data Analysis in an conviniert manner. Would love to recommend the app, since its very user friendly. Love the way it follows up with the subtitles in the videos as well. Graeat app.",
"Text fields are causing crashes, don't accept full words (on swipe keyboards) and prevent me from continuing the course on my mobile phone. I have to switch to a desktop computer every time there's a text field. Absolute rubbish.",
"I'm looking for a course. It offers several within a specialisation. But it's not in order. I start learning and the material says ""as we've seen in the previous course"" so clearly I'm in the wrong one. I spend 45 effing minutes trying to find out what's the effing order. Very poorly search results show nothing to help. Another effing 45 minutes trying to get a contact. Nothing. Effing nada. You cannot contact anyone at Coursera. Useless. I have no effing clue what to do.",
"I selected a career path in ""Recommended"" section to check courses for that particular career. But when I wanted to go back and select another career path, I couldn't remove the selected option. Please add a feature so that we can select or remove career paths according to our interest. Also I want to see all the courses for which I searched. But I can see only 3 courses at a time. Please consider handling this issue too.",
The reason I am giving 4 stars is that while pausing the video for taking notes and then start it after sometime it start lagging and offline mode doesn't work as expected. And rest is nice . Mentors are top-notch and materials too.,
"If you want to take classes from your phone or tablet think again, The quizzes do not play well with Android in a chrome browser or this app. keyboard does not work all the times and the question boxes format is messed up, you can't even see the question.",
"So many bugs with ID Verification page, it loads then suddenly goes blank, I have to close the app and open it again multiple times or be quick enough to click on verify my ID before it goes blank and even if I do, ID verification keeps on failing no matter how many times I try or different IDs, different lighting, different times of the day, different angles, nothing, and the same over the website as well, and technical support advice is to ""keep on trying please, you have unlimited attempts"".",
"It takes around 10 seconds to load My Courses every time I go there (i.e. not only the first time). Moreover, the videos are all slightly zoomed in and I miss bits of slides at the edges of the screen.",
how is this app coming across chromebook / chrome OS app store? app hasnt even been tested on such a device. it still has mobile display on a chromebook and wastes the display. notifications and interrupts are truncated on the screen. so went back to accessing via browser. what a waste of time and why the hell has this been released for public or atleast add a warning saying chrome OS isnt supported.,
I am doing a few courses like Grammar and Punctuation and Verb tenses. the course is better than what I expected with loads of interactive exercises and videos. Thank you for this wonderful app.,
"I've Enrolled myself in IE business School course- ""Positioning: What you need for a successful Marketing Strategy"" in the First module Introduction to Positioning, video 1.1 the audio is not audible also the subtitles are coming up with (inaudible)....that makes my learning experience very bad.... I've to struggle alot so as to understand the concept....I was planning to purchase the course for certificate and full access but In the very beginning I face such a bad experience that now I'm not.",
"The new update just killed the app. App is crashing for no reason. It is now slower than ever. And of course the my courses section, it is loading every time I go to other tabs. Roll back to the previous version please.",
"I like Coursera very much, it's a great service to humanity. I would like to suggest to have a ""night mode"" with blue light filter, it would be comfortable while using at night, see Opera browser as example. A ""dark mode"" would be a great too",
I enjoy using this app and all its learning possibilities. The only set back for me is not being able to take notes with it on my phone like you would with the computer version. I found a way around that by utilizing screen shots.,
"There are few bugs in this app .... First of all ... When I save any video offline and start watching it , the videos start lagging after ... say 15-20 mins ..... Also by that time my phone gets heated so badly that I have to wait for it to cool down for around 5 mins .... And at last .... It drains the battery at a very fast pace .... I mean ..... This heating and battery drain problem with Coursera app is more severe than when I play Pubg .... Is it a joke !!!!! Disappointed",
"This update version is showing ""installing"" since tonight but there is no output.It's never been installed!! I can't enter the previous version of this app before update.That's why I couldn‚Äôt take my enrolled course lecture and I failed to submit my Electrical course assignment in time!! It really hurts..!",
Great app but I can't watch the videos because of a bug. The time line stays on the whole time and the video gets darkened as if I was scrolling through the video in time. But I don't even touch the screen. Reinstall didn't work. Ussing a poco 3x pro phone,
"The app is really nice but i have noticed a small problem. In the website,there is an option of viewing the video in 1.75x but in this app that playback speed is not available. I hope the team fixes this issue...",
Overall its pretty good and load fast. Future suggestion to optimise the final quiz or assignment for smaller screen device and tablet too. This would make it easier and more efficient for me to work on the certificate on the go when I am on the train to school or work.,
"The customer service agents made this an absolute nightmare. I had signed up for the Google IT program, and went to verify my ID when all I get is error messages that it cannot verify my face. After more than like 40 attempts all the customer service agents have to say is, ""oh, try again, durrrrr.."" Save your sanity and money for a real course.",
It is extremely difficult to take notes (feature available in desktop site) on the app. Almost impossible to take while watching video. Please develop the feature or add a tutorial to easily access the feature,
"I had enrolled for IoT course and almost completed it. But now it is not showing my course on the app. I have completed my all the quizes as well as assignments. I was about to get certificate but that course is now not visible on the dashboard. I also tried to do it through browser, still it's not showing.",
"While reading the content, it started getting masked with some grey screen over the study material. I wish there was an option to share the screenshot. Because of this issue I am unable to pursue my classes further. Please fix it for good.",
the app is good. well organised features and colurs. a problem i have encountered is that it reaches a point it crashes continuously also the playback could not disappear from the screen. but after several updates it is working well.,
"The last update is so bad. There is no subtitle or caption in videos, transcription is good but I can't see it on the screen when I see a video in full screen.. You have to think about the people who know reading english and no hearing english very well. The rest is good but that issue make all harder for us.",
Very nice app for certification and skill learning it is easy to use have great video and quiz help you gain skill and doesn't waste time everything is accessable and can be use anytime required . The best feature of this app is that we can share our certificate directly with our linkedin profile which is very good for people who have no job experience but have skills I prefer this to everyone because there's no age for learning,
"Great platform to learn and grow, overall the best platform one can get but the app takes a bit more time than usual to open and operate, leading to bad experiences sometimes. I would encourage if this gets fix. Other than this Coursera has always been my favourite. Thank you Coursera for such amazing content and courses.",
The downloading feature was very buggy. The bug was fixed by the next update as soon as I reported it through app with the log files. The developers are keenly resolving issues. Great work!,
"The platform is excellent but the app hampers the learning speed as the downloaded videos keep on lagging and it's very irritating, it gets solved for sometime when is uninstall and reinstall the app but uninstalling the app also deletes teh downloaded videos so again those videos are needed to be downloaded. It frustrating üò†üò†üò†üò†üò† Plz, Fix this ASAP through a proper update .",
"Cousrera mobile app is good and can easily navigate through courses and stuffs.But the calendar sync and the custom course remainder(alarm) are not at all working,not even once. Please fix that as soon as possible.",
"I'd like addition of dark theme, and maybe a better video player, with gestures for volume, and zoom player like YouTube recently added. I love the app in the current state as well, lets me continue my courses on the fly, when I'm away from my PC",
"The mobile App is actually get, but the Bug in the latest updates is too much. You are watching a video on the app, it pauses on its own, and you can't continue till you exit the app and open it again. Really stressful, since the last update.",
Great courses but app is full of bug. I recently updated the app and it is now causing trouble. Video is continuously buffering. I tried downloading the video but it is not playing properly. It stucks every second.,
"It's such an amazing app, specially for those who are willing to learn something, and the best thing is along with learning, you get to do quizzes n assignments based on which a certificate is provided and the certificates are really useful when it comes to strengthen your linkedin profile.",
"One of the best learning application. With wonderful contents and the qualitative information. Coursera is the best online learning platform for every individual. It does not discriminate between poor or rich each of us have equal chances to learn from this application with or without paying money. It's a wonderful application, if I have to 100 star's it's well worth.",
App doesn't continuously play and stops after a while. Had to turn on the screen and resume three times before deciding to listen to music instead. And they wonder why people don't finish courses.,
Sometimes it runs perfectly but now I'm facing a problem that... it's showing an internet connection error. I don't know why it's showing that because others apps are running perfectly with the same internet. I hope coursera will fix the bug soon.,
After the latest update the app is crashing too much cannot do the course properly crashes in the mid of videos and video clarity is poor even after changing the video quality. Add an option to make the video start from the last position played if someone calls or if app crashes,
Hi This is a very good application with good interface. I am very happy to use course era application but only problem i am having is that i can't see the given code while doing the quiz. Given code does not show in the bar. Like some times we have to fill in the blanks. So i can't see the given code in which to fill blanks,
"course videos are always buffering, even though I have downloaded it. and also the transcript doesn't sync with the video anymore, which is a very useful feature so we can replay/review important messages or sentences. please fix it",
"The app is very good and easy to use. The course content also is in small bite easy to understand. Very indepth information this has really opened a new horizon for me into a new career. Thank you courser a team and all behind the seens for such a great course and valuable information you are giving us. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
"Serves its purpose. Downloading, quiz taking available in offline mode. It is great app. But it is very slow. Loads UI slowly. I love the website, though. Needs work in making it fast.",
"The app was working good before this new update. Now the video control buttons (Pause, Play) always stay on the screen. In other words, the buttons stay on screen and don't disappear. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.",
"Auditing a bunch of classes that interest me, gaining new skills, interests....i have about 100 specific courses that are on my to do list. Manditory for everyone is the media literacy course about being able to figure out what is mis/disinformation, taking the time to actually click on sources, verify information for yourself instead of taking someones word for it when their motive is to convince you of their way of thinking. Good stuff.",
"Cannot peer-review assignments despite wi-fi connection and more than enough internet service. It keeps saying ""try checking your internet connection and try again later"" when there's plenty of internet. Fix this already. Thank you.",
"DON'T RISK USING COURSERA If you have any problems with the payment, you can't reach them, my card expired so charged declined, updated my card but NO WAY TO PAY the due amount, they completely deleted ALL OF THE PROGRESS I had made. Wasted so much time, I was almost finished. I was on the coursera plus subscription for the GOOGLE PROJECT MANAGEMENT COURSE BEWARE, don't risk it!!!",
"Not like online. In the app, you can't make notes. It does not pick up where you left off. This means that you have to watch the same parts you've seen. It also doesn't reflect previously completed parts of the course. The downloads keep stopping. Just not great.",
Overall the app provides the best learning experience. The one thing that's really frustrating is the fixed VIDEO ORIENTATION. It's quite difficult to view video in left-landscape orientation while charging.,
"Unable to login. I have a Coursera account. And I am currently doing a course. But I use Google Chrome for it. I decided to install the app for better interface, but it wouldn't let me log in. I can't even create a new account from fb/other email. I think the problem is within the app. Please fix it.",
it keeps crashing a lot. many of the courses don't load at all. if I try to download then the app freezes. it has really good content so I'm a little dissapointed about its continuous crashing.,
"There are some problems in the app. If I try to filter my search, it shows 'something is wrong'. Can't save a course for later while browsing. And it sometimes hangs, so have to restart.",
This is a big sacm. Never be cheated by free trail or even a specific subscription. They will always charge hidden fees. Even if you pay the course fee you will not be allowed to withdraw you payment details.. othetwise your subscription will be cancelled. I found about 300 USD taken away for nothing while i susbcribed for 49 usd only..you will not be able to contact them to.discuss such issues because they use bots,
"I'm enjoying the app but i wish ti make a suggestion. Most times whe.i search for a topic and i see several courses, I wish to just start one of those courses but mark the some others so i can take them later. It oeoild make a lot of sense of you guys could include a feature where one could mark courses to be taken later",
"On multiple choice questions sometimes my answers aren't logged. Retook a test and answered a question I got correct previously. After submitting it, the answers I marked were not shown and was counted as incorrect. This has happened on multiple tests causing my scores to be lowered.",
Love it! This is my 2nd week using Coursera: First Step Korean. The course is provided by Yonsei University and the professor is great. She's a true professional at what she does. The lessons are very clear and concise. They also provide PDF forms to practice w/ea lesson. That's been very helpful as I practice Hangul. They have forums for students to ask questions and help each other out. I would definitely retake it in order to solidify what I'm learning now. Absolutely recommend this app.,
"This recent update does not make it at all. The video player which flows with the transcript features previously makes more sense than what we have now. Learning should be easy, not making life hard. Kindly bring previous features back. Thanks.",
The courses are nice and well instructed. But i have complaints about the app navigation. Tests don't work even in high speed net. Also syncing with the web version takes time.,
seems to stop (pause) a lot randomly during course videos. can't access autoplay options or turn off quizes. this reduces mobile usability also it doesn't remember where your are in a video. it defaults you back to the start.,
"I really resent the fact that they present these certificates (the paid ones) as a way for anyone to find a new career with low barriers, as if the certificate and what you're taught to earn it is all you need. What they don't tell you until you're into it is that there are prequisites for math to actually have a career and if you look at job postings for the field, it's very likely that you'll need a degree to ever actually land a job.",
No support for kitkat anymore. This is really disappointing and frustrating as I have a 10 inch kitkat tab which is amazing for study. I don't understand the need to drop support for legacy devices when plenty of other apps still support. Fix this soon!!,
"Coursera has been a good place to learn . Just that I have a challenge here. I started a course with my mobile phone for months now, I am stucked at the end of week 1 quiz. Coursera said my device is not compatible for the quiz. I don't have a laptop yet. Can coursera help to modify this quiz to fit for both android phone and laptop please.",
"The video player upon watching a video doesn't hide even after few seconds of video playing. The video plays in the background, while the foreground is covered by the video player controls that status visible all times.",
"There is a big in the website and also in the app that some financial aid application got submitted twice.And now the web is crashing and sometimes the buttons doesn't work. And view or download certificate buttons don't work.They look full in html likewise and does load even if I try refreshing or I clean cache,nor even I close the tabs.I even tried clicking the enroll button for a long time,still done take a action.Lots of error,when i was watching courses they say the web is under maintenance",
"Could be improved I can't stream correctly. When I watch a video, at some point, it stops buffering and freezes the application. I need to shut down the application and reopen it to continue where I was.",
"I urge you guys to reconsider payment options, for subscriptions atleast for Indian users, credit cards are the only mode of payment, every other transaction fails. Please give us an alternative mode of payment, as in lump sum which can be paid via debit card. It is very difficult for students and low income salaried employees to get access to credit cards here. I know many friends and colleagues who are unable to access your courses due to lack of credit cards. Please think about it.",
"I should have rate 5stars cause the app is just too perfect and good üëç easy to use the offline aspect is superb but recently alot of things change after the update no subtitles underneath under offline mode and the video icons like pause, next and others are showing throughout the video, thats really bad the developers should act fast.",
"They have done something wonderful here, you can download lessons, Iam on an old android phone. I just took a quiz and it went well. I am a full time working parent and I am hoping to finish multiple certifications with their site. I can't afford comptia or camps so what they have done here is wonderful. THIS is what I thought the internet would do a decade or more ago with a lot of education. Thank you for this platform Coursera.",
"PLEASE fix the video player. Everytime the pause screen disappears, it pops right back up and makes the screen flash. I'm on my last course for a certification program and this is halting my progress.",
"Buggy! even when I download content for offline use the app will not function properly without an internet connection. I was hoping the download feature would work better, I really want to study on my break and I get poor reception at work.",
"They clearly advertise their pricing ""per month"" but their ""month"" turns out to be 28 days. And if you cancel before the cycle ends (as everyone would do obviously) then the ending date isn't displayed anywhere in your account, you need to contact them to know it. Utterly ridiculous. The content can be great thought, but the experience is just stained by their shady business practices.",
"Offline mode is very buggy. It just lost most of my quiz submissions when I reconnected to internet when I landed in a plane. The internet wasn't great, so the app apparently gave up and just threw away all the quizzes. Frustrating!",
App courses are nice but support is very poor. I have tried almost 30 times verifying my ID but it us unable to read the details. I have completed my course but unable to get the certificate. I tried from laptop and from mobile. From laptop it is unable to read details and from mobile it says give permission to access camera although there is no camera permission for the app. I already allowed permissions for chrome and browser but still it says allow camera permission. It is so frustrating.,
The screen stucks anywhere in between while scrolling through video lectures and then takes to the home screen. So I have to go to my course again and again. This keeps on happening since I installed the app.,
"The app is very difficult too use. It does not recognise potrait vs landscape modes well. Sometimes the text boxes do not take the input, and the words get stuck on the box, but can't further type into it.",
"I'm in love with Coursera platform cause quizes, lectures and readings are very objectives and clear. Easy to use and it's like I'm not trying hard to study, but like reaching milestones as in a game or something. I wish traditional schools would have a similar platform",
"I like that there is an app to take courses, but it's basically useless as I am unable to play any audio. Sometimes a quiz question is nothing but audio so I have absolutely no way of answering. Please fix this issue.",
"with recent update, the transcript is not clickable and there is no mapping between video and the transcript below. Also the video occcupies more than half of the screen whereas earlier it was hardly 35 40 percent of screen, why update and downgrade the existing UX",
"This is an awesome app... You may earn your degree or certificate to help you launch your career. Sign up for their 7-day free trial. Then if you're looking to gain a skill try a Guided Project for just $10! If you're looking for a better job, try a Professional Certificate Program, starting at $39.99/month. They also have their yearly subscription, with unlimited access to over 7,000 courses for only $399/year! Learn what you want when you want from the comfort of your home! Thanks Coursera! <3",
"There is a vey annoying bug that shows up when playing video lectures which is the playing screen that normally shows up when I touch the screen, but now it always keeps showing up. although the website on desktop is agreat platform, but the mobile app is so so so so disappointing.",
"Video quality can't be controlled. When I try to change video quality the video player crashes and have to restart the video with the default quality option. Video is not playing smoothly always. Most of the time it drops frames, get stuck and lags.",
I don't think so you can find better study than this on entire internet. What i like about this app that if you are a valid student you can still access the course w/o certification. Certificate is important but skill is more imp. I can't emphasize enough that how you people are revolutionizing entire education system with providing courses from world's most leading institutes. Thanks again i would have given a six stars if that were possible.,
"Impossible to reach anyone in customer service, so I'm posting here. I did not use the app, but signed up online. I wanted to try the 7day trial, toyed around a bit and then didn't, signed up for 2 courses to get a taste then life blew up and I didnt think about it again because it was just a 7day free trial. Months later I realize I've been billed $240!!! And there's no way to get your money back once I looked into it, you had to refund within 2 weeks. I did not expect that they just auto",
"I was hacked, but support said it's not possible. I haven't use it for about 5 years. When I log in again, my name was changed to an Indian name. I changed it back, changed password and alerted support. They said it's impossible, and then told me change it back myself. These are 2 contradicting statements. I only use free courses, so they are not keen on offering help.",
Only thing I wish is for there to be a separate page for vocab of certificate subjects. E.G.: Data Analytics courses have terminology and vocab not common in use of avg persons daily life & there is so much repitition to try to help differentiate closely spelled vocabularies (e.g. Data Analytics vs Data Analysis) and attempt to ensure learner understands; however I feel actually seeing the terminology and vocabulary side by side/listed would allow for student to go back over them as needed.,
"Very thorough. I wish the captions were more accurate and that there was a mechanism to suggest a better phrase. I strongly wish there was more transparency with regards to payments, scholarships, certificates, and diplomas.",
"Why are the buttons constantly showing up and not going away to view the screen, how will I be able to learn if this is the case ? Please correct it. The pause and other buttons constantly show up all the time despite attempting to leave the screen for a while.",
"The new update wrecked the video player... it's the mainstream feature of the app and it's busted. The controls are constantly stuck over the video making it hard to read notes, see diagrams... please fix this!",
"I have been using coursera on and off for the past 10 years.Until a few weeks ago,all was fine,the videos could be played downloaded,but now none of the videos are working.They are just buffering and then there is OOPS.I want to be able to use the app.",
No option to download entire courses at once Coursera Android and Coursera Web are not in sync. Tapping on settings button shows a blank screen. Inspite of entering a properly spaced name the app is not entering my properly spaced name on certificates. Certificates are not available on DIGILOCKER. Search filters are broken. App does not notify when there is a new blog post or when new courses are online. Not optimised for horizontal use in tablets. Video not playing in app.,
Great learning platform with a ton of courses to choose from. Some of the voice over audio quality is not good and can be difficult to understand. The curriculum is provided by very reputable schools from around the world.,
"The app is great for learning and all. But I find it frustrating and quite disturbing that I cannot do weekly challenges and exams on my phone. It's purely computer based and my laptop is broken. Is there a way it can be designed for mobile phones, android and iOS inclusive?",
"The Coursera platform is good, but the app sucks. Improve it. 1. Videos can't be downloaded. 2. Now, with update.....it has become harder to read text properly and watch the video. Keep it as it was, like YouTube (when we watch a video)",
"Coursera has all the course you may wish to persue, or include in your career path and it's provide good and readable courses at your own time and pace. I will highly recommend it to everyone who may wish to add something to their studies or to improve their skills in their career.",
Coursera app has been fantastic so far. But now I am having problems watching the videos as the controls keep covering the screen. I believe this is something that should be looked into,
"The app generally works well, but when playing videos in fullscreen, it crops the sides off. Allowing users more control over aspect ratio when playing videos would be a major improvement.",
"I don't know why the option buttons didn't leave the screen while watching videos, they made my learning difficult. Also with the new update, the app keeps crashing every time I open.",
The app is great. I've had a great experience with this app so far but my problem with Coursera is the fact that I find it difficult to locate the subscribe or pay button for a course. Maybe I'm just dumb but so far I don't know how to subscribe to a course I'm already enrolled in. I hope this is fixed in the upcoming updates. Aside from this I'm loving the experience.,
"Video abruptly stops playing and also keeps throwing an error ""oops something went wrong. Please try again to play the video"" when it's reaching end of the video clip. I can't use this app at all.",
"After this update my Playback option is not removing from the screen,it is continuously popping on my screen in my app due to which i am not able to see the lectures properly. Kindly fix it ASAP as i can't see on laptop so frequently and my deadline will be over due to this.",
The best learning app I've used so far. It's easy to use and straightforward. the videos are short and precise and there are loads of resources and references for each course. And Thank you Coursera for Financial Aid.,
"It says free courses, it will tell you the courses are offered for free but nothing is free. Just because you can look at course materials doesn't mean anything to someone who believes it is free. You need to take the word free off the site, and out of the programs listed. If you actually offered free courses I might have been prompted to do more and pay for a few programs. But since financial aid is required for a free course, so no thanks. What I've said is Free. Your Welcome",
"A lot of bugs, sometimes the content appear duplicated and out of alignment, especially if there are audio clips. Some audio clips also can't show up in the quiz hence it's impossible to finish the quiz using the app.",
It is a good app for learning skill and helps a lot,
"Nice app on the phone, helping me when I on the trip. So, I dont have to bring and log in to my PC's.",
Overall application is good. It would be much better if dark mode is added to the app.,
this is the best app for studying. in this app almost all course is perfectly design and completely valuable.,
"Worst app in tablet always showing some weird error unable to load data, while playing video something went wrong...",
IT is just amazing!!! The quality of their contents and presentation gives a learner that confidence not to drop a course from start to finish. But they need to improve on their help desk support.,
"coursera is the best medium to enhance professional skills, it help to improve oneself and became globally employable.",
need to improve the app a lot. please include the ability to switch between accounts,
"The pause, forward and backward buttons on the app get stuck on the screen (they don't disappear anymore). I can't see the instructors' faces clearly. Please work on this.",
display is not good om Samsum A31. subtitle is overlap content,
Learning is simple with Coursera,
Coursera's really defining. I got simplification into something hard I already opted for in my career.,
you can have variety of courses almost in any discipline. Thank you coursera you're a life saver,
very good courses provided by legit university institutions. It's cheap and inexpensive too.,
"Buyers beware - customer service has sadly deteriorated. I registered for a few courses, which start charging after a week's trial. Hadn't noticed my card had expired. Coursera brutally deleted my registration & hard work, without allowing even a *single day* to feed a new card. To add insult to injury, the representative insisted that if I start over, I'd pay double (as it was originally on sale). Personally I've moved on to another platform, which I better trust with my work.",
"Samsung Tab S6 Lite: Screen overlay with the controls of pause, forward, next video etc. seems to stay while watching the videos. This happened after the latest update which I was forced to download on Oct 31, 2022. Kindly fix it.",
quite a great platform for learning,
"it has been the best so far that learning online can be productive like this I never really like online class but they made it easier to learn from for instance you can always go and continue from where you stop, jointing note etc. it's been wonderful",
There's a bug in the latest update that's making the video unable to play! The media player buttons are constantly obstructing the video. Please fix it ASAP. I am unable to watch videos!!!,
"The app is good but I can't help but feel it's not legit for me, especially for us South Africans. Whether it recognized by our country, registered and approved for use. All these things stems from the need of that. All these studies are from overseas and has no guarantee given as proof of an international approved subjects. There are subjects I wish to study for but nothing is listed there.",
"Have only been using for about five minutes. Everything looks fine so far except that the graphical video layover (video name, length, scroll tool, menu for speed and subtitles, etc) never disappears, even if I click around.",
"Smooth learning process, I'm able to learn progressively and attentively.",
The application overall experience is good. I have two issues when using on tablet 1. It doesn't support landscape mode in reading and quiz sections. 2. The mathematical equations doesn't display probably in quizes like it does on the web.,
Fantastic experience so far. But there's an issue I think should be worked on. I am a student on financial aid but each time I do a timed assignment on my system and want to submit a pop-up telling me to pay for the course comes up and that makes it impossible for me to submit on time and my time runs out. I feel since I am already on scholarship I shouldn't still be asked to pay for the course and thereby hindering me from submitting an assignment. Please address this issue.,
"the app is an absolute bummer. Most of the sections don't even support landscape. This is a killer for a usage on a tablet, which should be the device of choice for learning apps. What a pitty",
"I am just thrilled that I finally participating in taking this course, and I am loving every bit of it",
Overall the app is good and provides good courses but the lab feature is pathetic. It takes almost 40-50 minutes just to load the app. I have to sit idle doing nothing as it is a graded assignment. Please update it !,
"This is a diamond app, it has helped me to learn many courses and I like it so much. But my major problem now is all the courses that I have completed, all have lost . So please I beg in the name of God and the management to let me get back those courses so that I can download them and make revision, otherwise I have learned nothing.",
I'll give this more stars if you can fix the fullscreen cropping. The videos were cropped on the sides. I don't see the full width of the video while in full screen on landscape orientation. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab A.,
"Great app, amazing courses, and splendid resources. My only complaint is that if I wanted to mark as favorite or save for later a class that I'm not going to take right now, I can't do so like other similar apps (Domestika/Udemy). But a magnificent app all together. Would totally recommend",
I have downloaded 7 courses all videos.. When I try to start the video.... It stops for fraction of a second and starts again... And it happens in all the downloaded videos.. Fix that bug!! .. It's so annoying,
"Great idea. The mobile app is unreliable (keeps crashing/ doesn't load properly). The website is better though. The app stops responding sometimes and some other times, it loads pages on it's own",
"I love the app but the only and the biggest problem is that ""can't pay without having a credit card"" I've tried several time to pay the fee using my debit card but there is only one option to pay and i.e credit card. I wish there would any option to pay through internet banking or debit card.",
"The app is unbelievably limited; You can't take notes, can't watch videos in landscape mode while reading the text, and it doesn't support pop-up questions. It's somehow useless, specially on tablets üôÑ",
"App needs lot of improvement. Always lagging, dont refresh often and some time when i watch multiple videos one after another some videos are still shown as unwatched (even when i watch it again). Having a very bad experience.",
A wonderful platform however The only thing they should add is bookmarking or saving-for-later for their whole catalog of courses as its difficult to compare them or even find them later if you cant go through with them in your first go.. which is hardly possible.,
"The app is good. There's a huge study material but there's one problem, most of the course are outdated there. You should have to update those course every year.. We feel uncomfortable with such outdated course while studying in these rapid growing technology.",
"When the app works, it works fine, but usually it does not load My courses. They just stay blank. Sometimes they load very very slowly and then I can access them. They need to load in 1 millisecond. Should be easy.",
"App and site won't accept my card that works every time anywhere else. Many people are having the same issue and Coursera doesn't appear to be helpful. Tried to take a course on here before. It was silly, there were no videos to go with the coarse. Now it won't even accept as valid debid card.",
"I have an account already (facebook log in, succeed), but failed to log in to the app. It said that I have no internet connection. Then, I sign up to register another account, and the app always want me to check for my internet connection, and said that I don't have an internet connection. Please reconsider this, thanks. Bravo Coursera.",
"BE VERY CAREFUL about the subscription model if you are doing only a single course, it will continue to charge you after you have completed the course if you do not cancel the subscription. Good app to pick up skills and learn, just wish the payment model was clearer.",
"Hey Dev I'm unable to go through any of the course. Everytime I tap on a course video to play it crashes. Showing me the warning as ""Coursera app has stopped working"". Then I reported several times with log. But nothing seemed to work. Even with the course I already downloaded on my phone. My Device- Redmi note 8. Os - MIUI 12 build on top of Android 10. Running on security patch of January 01 2021. Please look at problem and fix ASAP.",
"""we had trouble loading your data"" all the time. Very slow. No filter (only on the website but that is unbeliveable slow). Also no option to save ""interesting"" courses. It is just not good. Can you take courses to make this app better?",
"I can't do anything with the app, when you click on a course it doesn't load at all, worst was when I forgot my password, I asked to reset my password, you still ask me to put old password before changing it, if I knew the password will I still need to reset it. It's actually annoying. And I've not been able to do anything again on the app.",
"The app is good ,the only issue i have on my phone is that if the title of any video is a bit lengthy we cannot see the full title even if click on it and the video starts playing , there's no way yet to see the title .Its i bit difficult to know what exactly we are going to learn .",
"Hey Coursera, can you help in fixing the issue where the video buttons do not disappear even when playing the video in full screen mode. It's rather a headache as i can't view the things properly while learning",
"I found it very easy to navigate and use. I couldn't help but notice it gets slow sometimes and even crashes. I've been using it for only 2 days by this point. Overall a great app for learning online, especially when you're on the move.",
"This recent update is seriously annoying. I've tried to submit my weekly assignment before the due date and it will not show that I've completed, instead it marks it as a draft, also the Grow with Google account does not show the %age of progress made. Please fix this bugs soon so that we can easen our learning.",
"The latest update is an absolute horror. Completed courses in specializations appear in the central page, which means I have to scroll to the right unnecessarily to find the course that I want to continue. Please roll back this update and re-introduce the previous layout!",
The app is great. The cloud download viewable offline is particularly helpful.,
One of the best apps from the one of the best learning websites coursera. Everything is good except when playing a video if the video is set at a higher speed then there's a lag in the subtitles. Hope you'll fix it soon,
"There is bug in the app. Whenever I use discussion prompts it overwrite whatever I write and while typing in shows a site breakdown window and I am not able to unenroll the course which I don't want to continue to learn, even I use website for unenrolling course but doesn't work. The app really need a updates with fix all the bugs which happen from few months",
Unable to logged in into app after creating account from web. In web i have successfully logged in with my credentials,
"As I am doing a grammar and punctuation course for free , so week 2,3,4 contains some quizzes which we had to submit for certificate but eveytime I try to submit, it shows an error in submitting and saves as a draft . That's why my course was yet incompleted . Kindly look at the prblm as soon as possible . Otherwise it is a good app.",
Best Platform for learning.,
"This new updates is very bad. I dislike it. Is very annoying wasting data to download all the lessons videos. After downloading, as you try to access the videos you downloaded, it will say ""an error had occured"" then when you check all the downloaded videos are deleted automatically. Very annoying. Waste of dataüò†üò†üò†",
you can learn so much and it's all at the top of your fingers,
"I'm a Coursera learner. So of course I find it good for my studies.. because there's offline learning system. And I think it's still needed to fix the bug..I face many problems like in exam, or discussion prompt, I can't write anything there it's showed me maintenance is ongoing,üòì every time I tried to write something...I want write.. 'Bangladesh'..but the writing is appear like..""hsedalgnab""...so it's really inconvenient for me",
Please make a feature of mark as completed on mobile too instead of default making reading articles as completed while user opens it. It's very inconvenient for user to make it as not completed if he doesn't have time to read it at that moment after finishing previous video in course.,
Worst app. I made payment and it showed error but money is deducted. But from my bank side it is a successful transaction. I have created 3 support tickets and Coursera people closed it without resolution. They are telling money is not credited. So I asked for the proof and guess what nobody is responding now... I highly recommend don't use this.. they don't have a proper support system.,
"The app/service has subscription bait! It offers you the first-month use of $1 and after that $59 monthly, but after you take the offer and check the subscription history/plan in the app's ""My subscription,"" it shows the second month's subscription is still $1 -- this is the bait! It should tell you the second month's subscription charge is $59 instead of $1 in the app before the first month's subscription expires. Coursera may tell you that is the app bug but then you pay for their bug/mistake.",
The app is been working so well ever since I started using it. My learning here has been a wonderful experience and I'm loving it.,
"Unable to login to organization account. Routing to the webpage for login, but not routing backing to app. Still asking to login",
"I'm sorry, love the app and the courses but why is it so difficult to download the videos? I already suffer from crappy network but I really can't download anything even when I have excellent network. So, I don't know, how does YouTube do it? Like, my data could be in a coma and YouTube still works. Soooo. Please and thank you for your hard work team.",
"One of the best platforms out there to gain new skills from the comfort of your home! Just a small request to the team, pls make more courses on language learning, especially Scandinavian ones.. One more things, the app would be great with a DARK THEME Toggler! cheers ‚ù§Ô∏èüë®üèª‚Äçüíª",
I keep having to log in every couple of days as the app automatically forgets the user profile for some reason. The screen layout for videos is also quite questionable with most of the screen taken up by the transcript.,
Interesting app for students.,
The main screen of the app does not have landscape version. It is very difficult to use it with tablet or large screen device. Would appreciate if it can be enhanced.,
"They absolutely ruined it by removing the live transcript feature. I actually really liked it before and would have rated 5 stars, but this feature was super helpful for me and not having it really ruins the experience for me.",
"I am having trouble accessing my camera to take a picture of my license to get verified and the app keeps telling me camera does not have permission. When I go into the app Permissions it only gives me the options of contacts, calendar and storage but not an option for camera! Any advice!?",
I really found great courses from it and I become able to understand the technology it is great platform to learn courses about technology.,
"the last update is full of bugs I had already downloaded the videos of a course and now everytime I open it, it needs an internet like I hadn't downloaded it! and in the last update the script on the video go with the it now It's faster than it and you can't read it most of the times",
"I think Coursera is the best platform to enhance your academic skills and Coursera is kind enough to accommodate poor students through its financial aid, which makes it unique among others.",
There is no way to contact any personnel in cousera. Even I haven't got any reply to the email I mailed to course some days ago. Please someone reply so that I can get any help regarding the issue I am facing in coursera.,
Some part of the course activities and exams can't be done using this app. Frustrating!,
It's an amazing platform to learn,
"The internet is not working well in this app. Slow consuming internet service, which is bad.",
very smart and user friendly,
"Thank you for providing us the best online courses. However, it is really hard for me to find a way to add a payment method in the app. I have tried logging in from the website (continuing with Google) but it won't log me in. I'll try to finish the course first and upgrade for the certificate later.",
"After downloading the week 1 and 2 of the course am doing, I have been unable to download week three and the rest because no matter how I try to download it it won't download, it's really frustrating. also, during quiz, the app don't load code on the editor, I have to go through browser before I can see the code am working on during quiz. I am still having issues downloading videos for offline learning.",
"New update is good but the video won't resume from the last point. All that's left is that, the option to upgrade course and a dark mode, then the app would be perfect.",
"Everything is best and I am fully satisfied with services and products offered by Coursera. For this, I am grateful to whole team of Coursera. But, as a learner I want to give some suggestions that might improve Coursera in future. First one, Dark Mode Fetaure should be included in order to keep the eyes of learners healthy.",
"It's not been working. I just rely on the website instead. I can log in and that's it. Nothing else works. Although I set play store to auto update, I frequently check for updates manually. So it's not an old version.",
Absolutely top notch Application!,
Quality content which makes my dream come true of studying with elite colleges and curriculum. My university gave me an acc for free and coursera is the best thing about my degree. Would love to see some Harvard courses too hopefully in the future.,
App is buggy after the last update. When playing a video the controls wont move away and always stay on the screen which makes me hard to concentrate on the task. Hope they'll fix it soon. Otherwise good app.,
Extremely good. I hope the outcomes for these courses are as nice as the testimonials say that they are. This is a very good experience regardless and I would recomend it to anyone who is interested in at least getting their foot in the door with something they are unfamiliar with.,
The video player is stuck with the navigation overlay (the dark shaded screen with start/pause/ff buttons) on my Android phone after some update. It's impossible to use it the way it is...,
"I love the desktop experience, but I am disappointed with the mobile app because I cannot take notes like I can with the desktop version. I rely on notes for taking quizes. Listening to course material alone does not meet my educational needs.",
"From last 2 updates the app is showing ""Something went wrong!! Pls check ur internet connection"". Well my internet connection is very much fine. it is working fine for other apps. Also it says ""error loading data"". Although coursera is a great learning platform, this kind of errors hinders the learning interest.",
I like how we can download every lecture videos along with subtitle and moreover almost every course is flexible and I dont have to worry about dead lines. This app is really great for freshers who are just entering the corporate world.,
"I started a class. I almost finished the class. Upgraded membership. Now can't submit assignment, which means no certificate. Contacted support. Told it was difficult to fix. They offered to refund my money. How does that help? I already gave them money for several months prior working on the same certificate. They won't say when it will be fixed. Really? Stay away, unless you don't mind wasting time and money.",
"Pros: streamlining lecture videos and quizzes. Cons: can't save notes, can't leave feedback (both of which are available on the web), UI is wonky (even moreso after a quiz).",
"I love coursera but they can do better with the App. Or at least remove it. No progress recorded, cannot see all of my courses and the search tool is awful. Ll stick with the website it is working perfect and features are amazing",
"Life changing! As an educator, the courses in Coursera equipped me with 21st century skills to become globally competitive. I was able to understand and assess my full potential. Great people, great platform. I am a proud Courserian for 8 years and I can't imagine my life without it!Thank you so much, Coursera!",
"Great app if you want to learn something. The best part is the quizes, they force you to pay attention to the video lectures and notes, otherwise you would get permanently un enrolled fron that course.",
Unable to process the payment even with irrespective no. Of trials and alternatives. No customer care service or support available to resolve the issue. The help center option on the app and website merely answer your queries. I really wish to pursue a few courses but this medium makes it extremely difficult and not user friendly.,
"Doesn't work in my Acer Chromebook with Chrome OS 83.0.4103.119. When the sign in/create new account dialog is displayed, the main window flickers and a second sign in dialog is displayed and it flickers as well. The only reason I gave it one star was to enable the post button in the review dialog.",
"Blessed to have such a mind blowing app. There are more than 1000 course from different fields taught by top experts. Moreover the material and resources provided herein this course are extremely helpful as well. You can get more than 40% of course to access for free as well. In my view, This is one of the best app which I've ever used in my life. I would rate it 50 out of 5 if it was made possible.",
Rather clunky and not so intuitive. Wish there's a way to mark a course as favorite so that I can go back and look later if I'm not ready to start something. So many I want to check out later but there's just no way to mark them.,
"Whenever we go to an activity from my courses list and come back, it loads all the courses from the beginning instead of saving the app state. It makes the app really slow and time consuming for users to navigate through different sections.",
"The app does not show the content. For other things like, overview and all it works well, but when it comes to content under weeks it takes a lot of time to open or it doesn't open even after 2-3 minutes of wait.",
"There is serious problem in downloading the videos, if I download complete week videos of course they never get downloaded complete, also it happens with a single video they just stuck on download but never get complete downloaded, this is ruining my course deadlines because I don't have wifi access where I want to give my free time to course but I am unable because I don't have videos.....",
"Not sure what happened during the latest update to the app but its very buggy. I can't unenroll from classes, enroll into classses, or access certificates that have been completed anymore. Sometimes I have trouble seeing the content.",
"Coursera is one of the best learning platforms, I've access to multiple courses in various subjetcs",
"I am a bit amazed at how much of a leap the final assessment is, but failing it twice taught me some realistic truths about data analysis. Miss one little detail (I somehow read ""insert a row"" as replace a row, TWICE) and it will ruin your numbers for every future calculation. Nothing fixes it except very careful attention to detail and checking your values. Hurt but I value it. These educators damn sure know what they're doing.",
The app is easy to use. Extremely convenient to take courses on the go.,
"I don't really like this new version. I can't rewatch the videos I downloaded earlier and also it's skipping. So awful, I think I will prefer the formal version because this new version is so annoying. Hope you find a solution to it.",
"After the latest update, chromecast no longer works for the lecture video, which I find really annoying. But the icon is shown on the test page and the lecture note page.",
It's really good application by Coursera as it provide some off good way to handled the courses rather going to site and login and start courses ... So why 3 stars ..it's really good app.. But sometimes it's causes run time exception that sometimes makes me really annoyed,
Great Course and help so far,
"I was using the old version seamlessly untill I updated because the update kept popping up. Since I updated, my app has been freezing. I've not been able to review assignments of peers. It's just keeping me stuck. Please help.",
quiz is well organized.,
"I was charged 41$ for a course which money was deducted from my card but it said ""unsuccessful payment"" money wasn't refunded neither was I allowed to take course",
"I'm having issues with my offline videos. It plays fine for a few minutes, then starts to break, and the app starts to freeze, and I have to restart it for normal operations to resume",
"Never met a more frustrating app in my entire life. It can't handle most of the links in the apps and everytime it tries to go off app, I have to sign into Coursera all over again with about 15 recaptchas each time. I have abandoned it, my blood pressure is too precious.",
"Coursera has been very good in getting quality online classes but of recent, when using the offline option with the videos downloaded, the videos still breaks and it could get frustrating. Please look into it.",
"Coursera is AMAZING on a PC bc it helps me advance further on my career by giving me on-hand knowledge for what is relevant to my career. I've been a faithful user of Coursera since 2019 and I've racked up 10 course certificates so far. Still, I'd appreciate it if the prices were cheaper for monthly subscriptions and specializations to make it more accessible. App-wise, stop unenrolling me from a course that I'm currently taking. This happens with one course everytime I use this app on my phone.",
"gives great information, and helps to reinforce what you learn thru quizzes, discussions and test",
"Auto-rotate mode has to struggle with larger tablets. I was using a mi pad5 and I can't choose or watch the courses (which is, when I minimize the video window) horizontally. should improve this function ASAP.",
An impressive platform for learners.,
I wanted to know why I cannot add a course to a wishlist. Sometimes what happens is that you can only do one course at a time but are interested in multiple. Only if there was a way to save these courses for later. Please do think about adding this function.,
Glad to see the latest visual improvements especially the landscape homescreen on tablets in the latest update. The only feature I miss is dark mode to help me use the app at night. Other than that it is perfect.,
a very awesome app and educational platform,
Great app for learning covering a vast amount of topics. I am very satisfied until recently when one of my classes did not show in my account. I tried to contact someone at coursera to get a quick solution. However coursera tries everything to keep you away from contacting them. The website leads you from FAQ to FAQ. It took me a nerve wrecking amount of time to finally find a small chat button hidden after various FAQs. For the price I pay there should be at least some call center. Poor service,
"Please improves the app. Its lags all the time experience was pathetic for mobile app instead content is impreressive.. App is there for mobility so that we can watch leactures on the go what is the use of app if its lagging and not reponding all the time. Developers have a look please, this kind of lagging in app is not expected from Giants like Coursera.",
"This is a horrible experience. Coursera app does not sync with laptop web version. Can log in on laptop, does not let me log in with exact same data on phone. There is no contact center or anyone to help you. The courses were good, but the app es execrable",
"1* for now, for marking two quiz correct answers as red ""X Incorrect"" and giving the below explanation as to why it is incorrect as if the answer was marked Correct, and thus being treated as incorrect for the final score. eg. ""Practice is important for any area in which you want to acquire expertise"" got marked ""X Incorrect"" and below with white(explaining why) was the text ""True."" :))",
Lots of interesting information in this module. Great learning experience!,
"Amazing concept and app in general, don't get me wrong! But recently the video player controls don't fade away, making lectures essentially unusable. I will happily rate this back at 5/5 once that's fixed.",
Excellent! The experience is superb. The interface is top notch,
it is the best learning platform,
This is a great app for learning relevant skills outside of school. I have been a user for years but recently have become obsessed with completing as many courses and gaining as much useful info as possible. Thank you Coursera!,
"Actually one of the best learning platforms existing. Top notch material, plenty of choice and fare prices. Also, they kindly provided me with financial aid needed for my career. I hope to stay in long relationships with my beloved Coursera. Thank you for the opportunity to get better with you! Always recommend you to friends who want to learn and develop.",
I thought it was just enticing advertising when Coursera mentioned that they provide financial aid to students who can't afford to pay for the certificate courses. But I just saw that I have been approved for financial aid! I can't express how much that means to me. The app and its services are certainly top notch. Can't wait to start my Indigenous Canada course with the University of Alberta! ‚ù§Ô∏è,
"Please fix the issues on player. Sometimes it gets stuck in a specific time, and just plays if you tap forward button. Additionally by tapping forward button, subtitle syncing gets wrong.",
"Everything is good about this app expect payment methods for india. Its horrible, I tried to pay from my debit card they reject this, I dont know why I also turned on internation transfer. Then I tried to pay from credit card but still I got error - sorry there was a problem proccessing your payment. I'm hopeless right now, its about 1 week I'm trying to pay for the course but there's no solution from there. I contact customer care too, still same issue.",
Every time when I try to watch offline material and I finish the video the app asks me to log in. And since then I cannot watch offline things because I need a connection to proceed. The materials and courses are the best but I am someone that travels the most day and I don't always have wifi.,
"This is best way to get educated , trained on different skills online that I have ever seen . I love this app . Thank you .",
"Progress not saved. Ever since the last update, I cannot save progress for watching video. The green ticks on videos after fully watching them are not available when done through app, but can be done through site",
"Redoing my rating. Coursera, awesome app, awesome colleges. Great courses, and great response time if u happen to have a problem with Coursera or the course you're taking through Coursera. Introduction to psychology, Yale university, and i got the certificate. Awesome course very intriguing. Great instructor. At some point I'm going to take another course i just don't know at what point. Thank you again Coursera and Yale university.",
really amazing platform for knowledge and developing and mastering skills in you,
Please add a feature where you are able to increase/decrease the font of the notes. Otherwise the interface isn't bad and the progress bar/status is great.,
"Best an application and learning sit, there are many skills that you can get , thanks Coursera for approving me üáæüá™",
Took a different course by Gary and found him to be a great teacher but I laid down after the course and focused on work and loss what I'd gain with the lack of practice. I'm retired now and feel I can give this course the attention it deserves.,
"In its browser version, Coursera has always been a free and high quality plataform. Thanks for that. Nonetheless its app is unstable, my courses content is unable to be shown and turns this app into a useless one.",
"Damn!! I could've rated it 5 stars.I graduated with highest scores [GPAs] but didn't get my Certificate, it is indeed a learning field with variety of modified, profound work. My professor [instructor] congratulated me upon my achievements and later told me to BUY THE CERTIFICATE. I'm so disappointed üôÅ asf. I mean, I thought it was ‚Äúfree‚Äù Maybe that word [free] has lost its meaning",
Truly an amazing collection of lessons and classes that are well organized and accessible. Helped me pick back up music theory to help me take another step closer to releasing my own music.,
"What a joke! At first I thought this app was amazing, $40 a month for as many IBM courses as I can take. Wrong. This rip-off of an app wants to church you $40 a month per course, even after you finish it. So if I wanted to take 3 courses through IBM then it's a $120 a month even after I finish them. Don't download this app!!!!!",
This course is really helpful for those who want to land a better job. Especially who speaks English as a second language.,
Very good app...needs more offline optimization,
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. They asked for my card information so I could start a free trial and then failed to notify me when it was ending. I never even used it but they still charged me. And they don't do refunds for mistakes like that. Do not use this app.,
"App freezing and hanging. Videos are too. Almost anything I interact with, in this app stutters. When the app is started, everything is smooth. But after 2-3 minutes, this issue kicks in.",
the best app in my whole life. I have learned so much at home and great certifications from high level universities,
Please check the below issue. After the latest update the video control overlay buttons are not disappearing automatically or even when you tap on the screen. Makes it difficult to watch the lectures.,
Selecting the low video quality mode but nothing happens. Trash Coursera.,
"Many of the courses have tests that are vague and unhelpful. Also the forums are full of people asking why their test case failed, and most responses amount to "" the real world wont help"", well I thought I signed up to be educated, not to learn how to guess my way around test cases. Also a red flag should be how often Coursera responds to user reviews(see below).",
"SCAMMING trick company alert!!! I paid to get my diploma but they never gave me that, instead they charged me again later because i was still ""enrolled"" on the course (that i paid after finished). Today i got charged again for the same reason... I never got a refund for the first one neither because even when is not my fault the site is designed to charge you and customer service representative blame you. I want to keep studying but also don't want to be scammed monthly.",
"the ""sync to my calendar"" feature doesn't work, please fix it. whenever i toggle thr switch on it automatically toggles back of within a second and i have to set it manually on Google calendar for every assignment and quiz",
"One of the best application for Inhancing your knowledge, best Teachers, best management and Commendable Response. One of the best application for getting skills ü•∞ü•∞",
"I'm working individual and having Coursera by my side gives me great confidence, as it keeps me updated with latest courses and most importantly its Free, so for an instance if i took a course and later realised its irrelevant to my use i can discontinue it without regrets which might be the case with the courses which i paid for.",
The main things the Coursera have is quiz and assignment submission which remind us everytime that we have to submit assignment within time. So in this way we have to understand all the things and complete the assignment and quiz. The best to learn something.,
"It doesn't work any more on my Mi A2 device, keeps crashing on launch itself, thus making the app totally unusable. I have tried cleaning app cache , uninstall then reinstall.. it just doesn't work. I have shared the crash logs also, please fix this as soon as possible.",
"Ur last update isnt working as the previous versions. I cant use it ofline. It fails to load the courses. And most of the time the text for the instructs speech is not available. Edited: "" ITS BETTER NOT TO UPDATE THE APP""",
Good app. Content loads a little slow even if it's already downloaded. Please add a setting to set the default video streaming quality instead of having to change it for every video.,
"My experience with the app is poor. It keeps existing whenever I am studying a course, the courses don't have English transcripts offline. It takes long time for the app to load course contents. The videos skip also when paused for a long time.",
"Facing issues with the few of the courses I registered. Can't reset the deadlines and not able to access course content. There is no option to write or chat to customer support. No where I found and details, no even an email to reach customer support. Didn't expected this at all.",
"I absolutely love coursera, but one star less for the app, I wanted to give three stars but thought wouldn't do justice for the content that coursera provides. Please improve the app performance! It lags a lot, and there are many things that are missing in the app that are present in the website. So improve that and I will make the rating to fiveüòÑ",
"I hate this company! I started a free trial and made sure I cancelled it, I even received the message saying I'll have certain percent off if I stay. I still cancelled it. Days later I get an email saying my subscription has been renewed and they won't issue a refund. I know for a FACT, I cancelled my free trial. This place is a fraud!",
I have enjoyed a free course on coursera on The Art And Science Of Relationship. Their teaching style is simple and easy to understand. A friendly talk is done. Real life problems and solutions are discussed. It helped me a lot to improve my relationships with everyone.,
I have been using the coursera app for about 3 years now. I found it a very good source of online learning. It is also very good for supplemental learning for face to face learning. I am heavily indebted to the developer(s) of this wonderful educational app.,
You can not get ahold of anyone for questions. They continued to take pay.ents out after I already canceled my subscription and I have no one to talk to about a refund for this. For 2 months this has been happening. I canceled twice. I am trying a third time but i am worried I may have to cancel my bank card.,
"I have learnt a lot through Coursera, the platform is easy to navigate and content easy to grasp",
"a lot of issue enrolling invto courses, issues withing course using the labs and more.",
One of the best online learning platforms with top-notch materials and outstanding tutors,
Need to log into the app every single time I use it. It refuses to remember my account.,
the course is well designed as wll as affordable and I'm more than happy to learn,
the UI/UX are really impressive and the app overall is quite easy to use,
it's a great platform to study and learn new and difficult things üòÑ,
A very good learning platform with alot of resources to study and excel the career,
Works perfectly. The UI navigation is super simple,
I am not financially well but by Coursera I didn't feel that. They helped me a lot . Thankyou Coursera üôèüôè,
coursera is great way to learn: at your own pace at the comfort of your home at any time of the day job focused certificates cost effective courses flexible payment plan,
"is a great apps for learning, improve the title, upgrade your CV.",
Several great courses for free. App is easy to use.,
it was the great cource. We lern to online as well without computer and laptop.,
This app is so helpful. It helps me learn new languages and new things.I love this appüòçüòç,
thank you Coursera to your effort to be learning is easier and enjoyable,
"Coursera is amazing, it delivers more. User friendly app",
"it's really helpful and great, I am learning lots of things related to UXD",
Coursera's delivery of educational materials for learners on the platform makes learning interesting and more in touch with the world we live in today.,
It is an excellent app. I love the learning platform. Keep up the good work.,
"good app for learning online, and some professional skills in IT and other technically domain",
It's a great place to empower learning ability of myself.,
"It's so amazing, I hope to see more interesting features and all",
very informative & learned best skills through different platforms & institution,
It is always loading even after you watch a single tutorial!,
Coursera is the best platform to learn a lot of things,
Thanks for free courses. Coursera is very helpful. Thanks Coursera‚ù§Ô∏è from üáßüá©.,
very useful has some great courses from across the world,
it is a great app with big potentials for everyone to learn anything with a big method,
Easy to learn course here very informative the learning module is depending on your phase,
great only thing is need feedback on our answers to questions you ask for a lesson.,
App is not good and better to use website. The Android app does not allow to take notes of the transcript while watching video. At least the mobile browser version can save notes but interface not as nice.,
"Used to be great- now just a money making machine!! There are plently of other free apps to learn. I used Courses for years, but never again. This used to be about helping people who were wanting to learn but couldn't afford to/able to learn elsewhere. Now it's just about a VERY costly profit machine.",
Good application. Please add font size adjustment and night/dark mode functions.,
I had enrolled to 11 courses at a time. When I reopened the app they just disappeared. Then I opened their website on Chrome. There is a section on their website called 'Updates'. I found my those enrolled cpurses there. But I don't know why they don't have 'Updates' feature on their app. And also don't understand why my courses disappeared from 'My Courses' section in the app. Also not having a 'Wish List' feature is also problematic. Needs lots of improvement.,
"The app is good, but the only option i think it should have is to like save the courses or add them to wish list for later so that I can access them later to instead of finding again and again by the title of the course.",
"One exceptional learning platform of our time, as far as time is concerned.",
"My app is not working. It doesn't load my course, shows no internet connection whereas the other apps are working fine.",
"The app is pissing me off and make want to unlearn. It takes long for the courses to load, the videos always exits, the quizzes and peer reviews often go error when submitting. If there is zero stars, I would rate 0.",
"It is a nice app , displaying easy features to Coursera",
I love Coursera it helps me to learning English perfect,
Why is this app so damn slow. It takes hours just to load.,
"We are living in Malaysia since 2013. In the beginning I wanted a job but I didn't have enough experience. I heard through unhcr about coursera. At first I didn't have any idea how it works, but after one week i felt that it's very useful and helpful for me. I have done 5 different English language courses. It's amazing, I got confidence and started a new life. Thank you so much coursera and unhcr for giving me that amazing opportunity. Love you all.",
The app version works very well. It helps to catch up with deadlines when one is on the move or access to computer is limited. I finished almost half of a 6 weeks long course through the app. Two thumbs up,
The application needs serious improvements to video player. It does not save the time at which playback stops and on return it starts from the beggining again. Screen rotation does not work also. Please take care to fix those bugs.,
"Variety of fields to choose from with different courses, sorted according to the level of difficulty. Great tutor and interactive forums. This is first time I am saying this it is fun learning with coursera. Thanks",
"The app was fine until recently, the dark overlay with the play/pause button does not go away when tapped. Edit: Overlay was fixed, however videos occasionally stop playing and won't load.",
"Best courses are available here with a great and interactive way of learning with financial aid available which is so helpful for a student like me, it couldn't be more perfect, thanks coursera.",
I have been having difficulty writing text in different text areas on the app. When trying to answer some questions the text box will just return error automatically and says they server is down and will return soon. Please fix this. I have just updated the version today,
Best app for those who are interested in learning. Great variate of courses I love it. I took a course for learning how to learn and music I have excelled and improved in these areas all because of this app great app.,
"There seems to be a glitch with the app. It does not synchronize with the website. I completed my assignment and peer graded some assignments, yet it shows overdue on the app.",
"Their is a problem in your app,that I want to change my password because I forgotten it. But the link given in email redirect directly into my account and from their to change my password ,I need to know the current password which I have forgotten.. And where is the feedback section in the app...üôÑ Although it's a good app with full of useful stuff üòâ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
this is an excellent app everyone should know about.,
I can't view assignment critiques (comments) on mobile. Coursera emails telling me I have feedback on an assignment I submitted direct me to the assignment submission page and my only option is to start the assignment. Assignments I turned in on my computer sometimes show as unsubmitted and overdue. Coursera is not well suited to the course I'm currently taking (script writing).,
"I can't participate in discussion forums because what I write would be shown from right to left. That is to say, if I want to write ""maybe"" it would be on the screen as ""ebyam""! Fix Another issue is that on the website from Chrome I can press the button ""Start"" and I would continue from where I stopped. Every time I update the app, I must login out and then login in through Facebook again!",
"Their is causing an error while verifying an ID. When I upload the picture of the document, it jumps to 1st page again. So please after it and please solve this problem as early as possible.",
The App is interesting and Educating. It gave me more exposure to dentistry. I love it.,
"The app is great , only a small problem , which is when i open a video in a course on the app and finish it, it doesn't update the website itself ( opening the video(s) on the mobile and finished the 8th week in a course and the change doesn't appear on the website )",
"Great app, but enjoy using it more of my handheld device, than my chromebook. Some courses are harder to find. The website tends to work better. Other than that, I enjoy everything about Coursera. Thanks for everything.",
Doesn't have proper functionality like web version,
"The material is great and the certificate seem to actually count for something so there's not much to complain about other than the fact that trying to get ahold of them feels dreadful and is EXTREMELY Complicated. In fact, it's the main reason for why I'm even leaving the review, so hopefully someone will finally get back to me as to why i paid hundreds and don't have access to what i paid for. They have fake #on google so yeah, help?? Please?!",
"Worst courses platform ever, I DO NOT recommend coursera to anyone, it's been 2 months trying to get my certificate and NO ONE OFFERS ANY HELP, I contacted them more than 15 different times and the problem is still there. It's a big regret that I decided to chose you for my professional development! Every time I send the msg they say they will escalate my problem and it's all just bullshiit.",
"This is the greatest concept I have ever come across. I've been in healthcare for years but recently my body just decided it can't run halls for 12-16 hours a night anymore. I was coming home vomiting and passing out, my wife begged me to find a new path. I researched and invested $39 into Coursera and $50 into the Comptia A+ book, hopefully I'll be able to find a work from home chat support job. I also just found out there's financial aid, thank you for giving me hope.",
"As stated by many other users too same is happening with me also ,video starts to stutter playing right after pausing in between and it's very irritating please do work on this issue ASAP , it's really frustrating even after having app you have to use browser on phone or pc to access video content properly.",
it's very much useful for to get certified,
"Since the recent update, the navigation controls no longer go off when a course video is played. This frustrates my effort to learn. Please rectify. Thank you.",
"Back then a year ago, Coursera used to offer lots of free powerful courses. Right now, the app is all about making money. Only a few boring lesson are now free. What is worse is the fact that all regions pay same subscription fees. Different regions should pay different fees because Per Capital Income (PCI) varies among Nations.",
The video player can and has to improve significantly as it is the most used part of the app. A button to jump forward 10sec just as the jump backward is essential.,
transcript jumps to the top with each new sentence,
"When will it be available the option of ""Save a note"" on Android? Would be excellent if I don't needed to checking my notes in the website, and save the new ones on the phone when I see the lectures on the app. Please, it's really need an update. For the rest, nice app.",
"The course page keeps on loading on my phone. After some time, I get a system warning that Coursera is not responding. Tried clearing the cache, re-logging in etc. Nothing works. Please fix this issue",
"At first I loved every single thing regarding the app. It had separate sections for scholarship programmes and non scholarship course. But now I'm sorry to say,the app has become the shitties ever. It took a long time to load, you have to wait a long to reset your deadlines. Also discussion forum has turned into a real mess as everytime you want to write, it bakcspaces the word and later say, sorry for maintenance problem. So I humbly request to fix this things Please.",
Coursera is an exceptional app for those who are seeking to study online courses.,
"I didn't even get a chance to use the app, because it was too bright for me. It would be nice if there was a dark mode option. As someone with sensory issues, I cannot tolerate looking at a screen, with a white background. I have to just use the website.",
It helps me study at a very fast pace.,
Wonderful Learning Platform,
"Very nice platform for online learning. whether it's for continuing education or skill acquisition, you could get it on coursera. The interface of the app is even more personalised and user-friendly.",
This app is among the best education app in the world,
Great platform!! They provided financial aid and I really learnt a lot of new skills,
"Dear Dev, pl improve the landscape orientation, as of now it works only clockwise. Also there is a glitch when u release the video after pushing it back 10 sec. The audio goes on but the video stucks there.",
I have found a wonderful learning App. Amazing!,
Excellent application for learning onlime courses. I have completed 3 courses and currently enroled in 2 courses. The teaching faculty was excellent and they give at most support to learn. Also to engage with other learners student duscussion forums are available.,
"i just started using, it feels great and different from other online learning App. i think i am going to like it here..",
"Terrible courses with terrible content that will not prepare you for any job. Leaving this here because trying to contact someone through the app was as I now know should have been expected. Just like trying to review courses after they are completed apparently isn't a thing either. I can see why, Google's Project Management Certificate was a enormous waste of time.",
Kind of slow on some devices,
Love the app! The best by far. Just have one problem and I would love to have a solution. I started a course as a free version no certificate though later when finished I could change and pay for one but that option apparently is not available :-( Please help üòÉ,
This app is pretty much useless. I was unable to use it to complete my courses as the app refused to save my completed exams. I had to redo everything through the original website as instructed by tech support. Hopefully the update will fix this.,
App doesn't load fast. It takes too much time though having good Internet connection. So many bugs! Using in browser is far better. Only helpful when you want to make videos offline and it also got many bugs. :(,
"Don't know about quality of teaching content it includes. Just downloaded and now will be uninstalling it as prices for basic courses are too high. And also, sorry but App is not that user friendly. I am happy with Udemy i was going to give try for coursera but seems it's out my paying capacity :/",
"The perfect way to learn online COUSERA, anywhere and anytime COUSERA got your back.",
"it works good but has a lot of mistakes in the learning material and the VM has glitches im also wondering how old the learning material is seems outdated,nice videos and good information given just old and a lot of mistakes, so some stuff your learning wrong!",
"This learning application provides free courses and trainings. Yes, you need to pay for certification But if you only need the skills I highly recommend this app for all who want to improve their technical skills, whether hard or soft skills in order to get a job easily Hats off! üëèüëèüëä",
This is the most frustrating app you click on a course then when it says financial aid available try to click on it to do application only for it to take me to a page that has nothing to do with financial aid. Tried using actual website but it has a enter the sentence to continue enter the sentence as it says and it keeps saying please enter the sentence correctly including capital letters and spaces still nothing,
"What's the point of an app if I'm forced to do a survey on PC... And it's a recurring survey too, even if I complete it it won't show ""completed"", so I can't get pass it in the app.",
"worst app, not showing that courses which are already we enrolled.",
superb and flexible to use,
Great courses from some of the best university in the world. Lately I use my phone a lot for the course. So i hope next update would give more ease to mobile devices with smaller data size and lighter performance.,
A dark theme would be even better,
"The is a great app for learning and acquiring new knowledges. I love and enjoyed the use of video lectures. It saves anyone the time to be reading boring texts. Good works, Coursera!",
"Nice interface for video playback but the download functionality is completely buggy. If a content is downloaded, the app starts being unresponsive and lagging. Please optimize the app's download functionality.",
Good application for learning courses,
very helpful for learning,
Learning is super easy,
very interesting learning platform,
Last 5 days I'm facing problem on Desktop site Coursera. I paid for Course class . But now Coursera website down üëéüëé bad experience,
Really very good app for MOOCS. Thanks for free certificate.,
great and very easy to use,
TILL YESTERDAY I HAD COMPLAINS THAT THIS APP DINT HAVE A BOOKMARK.... BUT NOW... AFTER THE LATEST UPDATE... IT HAS ONLY BECOME DISGUSTINGLY SICKER LIKE A ZOMBIE... NO CONTINUITY AFTER EVERY VIDEO...!!! WHO ALLOWS THESE HORRIBLE UPDATES WHEN NOBODY ASKED FOR IT... ??? .. EVERYTHING THAT WAS JUST SMOOTH SO FAR IS DEAD... THE VIDEO.. ITS OPTIONS.. JUST HALT DRY... ONLY HOPE IT DOESNT CATCH A CORONA & RECOVERS ITS PREVIOUS CONDOTION...,
it really nice learning here. I love it so far. it has just been a good ride all along,
This app makes me to learn my course easier,
Best online tool for online courses kudos,
excellent app for self learning,
"Self paced, easy to understand and hand's- on practice all checked. loving my learning journey here",
great learning platform,
gud platform to learning,
thank you for considering this beautiful lectures,
coursera help me for learn many tools for data analysis,
Coursera has been a gap closing platform between regular school curriculum and labor market.,
very easy to use,
sometimes can't watch offline,
"few substantial courses available these days, compared with what used to be offered. My quizzes completed while offline are not submitted when i get online. the data seems to have been lost. there is no way to submit feedback in the app.",
"New update is quite good but I have some problem with the certificate issuing. Some universities are not providing certificates even after the completion. It's been a month now Hopkins haven't provided the certificate for Covid-19 course, same with Toronto University for Mind Control. And please provide the locked courses on Mobile mode too. Last message of mine : I am highly disappointed. I am not able to complete my courses in time. It is getting irritating. I request to fix it.",
"this is probably the only famous app i tried that doesn't show you progression bar when you're downloading a video, i actually can't even tell if my videos are being downloaded or not, if there is a problem in my connection, or with the server in my country i wouldn't even know because the app doesn't even bother to show me something like ""25mp of 90mp"" when im downloading (there is some other issues with downloading but i can only write 500 letters here)",
"Rather than other platforms, Coursera have very good quality designed courses. And Learning experience is also great. Coursera have very good support team, they are always ready to help us in any situation and any scenario.",
"Bad technical support. Bad graphics on certificate. I used this app to complete a course on Biotechnology. After completing, I was given a certificate with disruptive logo of the university. It seemed fake. I have contacted the customer care twice . However, they have still not resolved the issue but always provide assurance. It's going to be 3 weeks and idk what to do with your assurance buddy?",
"Can't do payment by Debit Card. It doesn't show more options to do payment for course except Credit card. So, I request to slove this payment problem. By this payment problem I can't learn and do any course..So , hoping this problem can be cleared very soon..like by keeping more options for payment.",
"Coursera is one of the best learning platform i have ever come across, very simple and concise. The lecture series/modules are well structure and easily understandable. Kudus to the the team!!",
The new update is not working accurately. Because Navigation screen during video streaming never disappear. It's very irritating. One can not watch a video,
Please enable full screen view. It's time to redesign the app and fix the bugs. Consuming too much battery while running a video. Please fix all of these.,
Best platform to explore authentic courses for FREE.,
A Great app for Learning & Accessing courses from Leading University. The content is easily accessible and relevant. However the app is unable to optimize tests and course content on App. They should work on it.,
"All the positive reviews are paid reviews. All lectures are pre recorded and completely heavy very hard to understand. I chose the python course and it was like completely out of my league. I watched the videos for like 4 hours and after that i like ""what?????? "" But all are pre recorded. And that professor from Michigan University is the worst explainer. He doesn't care for the learners. All he cares for the payment after a super heavy lecture.",
Great app for learning. highly recommended. but needs to fix the issue of having to switch to bigger screens for some activities.,
"There is a huge problem in verification of government ID. it's overall good for learning. But I am very upset by the verification process, it always show not verifies, check if the letters are clearly visible.",
"This app really helped me learn korean fast by their courses. The reason why I rated 4 starts instead of 5, it's because when I left the video that I just watched, and I want to watch it again, I need to start from the beginning. I hope when I watch a video, it will resume. (sorry for my grammar, i hope you understand)",
Excellent I really apprecite this excellent work. But i have some proposal to improve app icon. The logo looks prettier than word. For instance initial logo looked bettee than the word coursera only. Rechanging words to logo i believe better. I hope your team will consider the situation. Wish you success,
"Can't watch videos properly in the app, as the overlay that shows the forward buttons and the like doesn't disappear. Therefore making any information on the screen impossible to see.",
Be careful with offline watching. Sometimes it won't sync with the website and you have nothing to do about it. If you accidentally logged out or uninstal the application you will lose the time you spent. I think this app need manual sync button.,
"It's really a very good app, because you can study any topic, from institutions from around the world. With certificate it charges some money which is reasonable too and you can even do without certificate, while you can study the whole course.",
"Number 1 the search kept on stalling out clearing my search while typing numerously which was a pain. Found only 1 course i was interested in & didn't say if it would be translated from Russian, took myself off the course after that cause i think it would be extremely difficult as this is photoshop cc. All i wanted was to learn where things were in cc since everything is different from cs4.",
"The app is great, but the last update has brought issues with visualizing the videos, the controls are now overlapping the video itself, which makes the watching experience not ideal!",
I cancelled my subscription and they have continued to charge me for the last 4 months. There is no way to cancel or contact them with this information. All online forums have recommended I dispute this with my bank and it's been a really horrible situation. Save yourself the headache and just don't do it...,
Even predownloaded lessons cannot be played smoothly. I redowload lessons to view with slow band width but it stops quite often as if it was waiting for stream from internet. I like previous version more.,
Very well organised and informative courses! Anyone needs to explore knowledge here....,
this app is one of the best apps i have come across so far. i installed it months ago last year 2019 and up to now its working very well on both my android phone and laptop too. i can choose any course i wish to do at any given time. i also get a chance to learn for free and do assignments and submit them for free and in case of graded exams i can purchase them at my own convenience and do them.well done google and the team.i can recommend this app to anybody who has an interest in further studies either by introduction to courses or research or more resources.,
Amazing Application. Everyone whom is interested in learning and progress should be using this application.,
"I love the app as it gives me another avenue to learn on the go, but one problem I have that forces me to switch back to my PC is that the app crashes when I attempt to type for a discussion prompt. I am using the Pixel 4 XL.",
"I've updated the app four times since my last review, where I was complaining about offline downloads not possible anymore and till now, problem still persists. What is the point of the updates if bugs aren't fixed? Please fix this, I've had to take a break from learning since October.",
"Addendum to my recent review: I'd like to see the same main user features in the app that are available on the website---highlighting, note taking, open responses, etc. The app is good, but overly simplistic, and lacking.",
"It's been a wonderful time learning and studying on Coursera, their instructors and course presenters are seasoned and thoughtful, the course contents are rich and impactful, assessments are structured to help you know more. Kudos to Coursera!!!",
"Nothing loads properly even in good internet connection, even answered has to be done multiple times to get the answer submitted, when downloading a course some videos don't get downloaded, all in all worst app to learn. Better go to udemy, better app and cheaper course.",
"Bad.....I signed Up for the IT course I had problems from the beginning. Tests were saying I failed when I passed you can't Fix it because they just constantly send you to most common problems......this is a 7 day free trial you think that they would want you to be completely satisfied. When I sent an email it clearly stated "" We have no idea when this will be fixed.' WHAT?? I already cancelled my free trial so I'm going to move on to another company",
I love to learning more and more about new courses and also coursera is a best online portal thank you coursera providing such facilities,
"Hey personally I really liked this coursera app but the problem is couldn't able to complete exam with in time because this app is not working in my android phone. When ever I tried to attend the weekly challenge exam its shows "" you can't complete this exam on this device "" . Unfortunately I don't have laptop. I know ,Without attending the exam I can't earn google certificate. So for me its waste of money . If this app suitable for android definitely its best app .",
A wonderful platform to learn,
Thank you so much courseea for uplifting me through your courses. I got a financial aid. I'm so grateful for you guys. love you. xoxo,
"When I used Coursera for University using my Google Chrome browser, everything was pretty fine. But when I started using Coursera for University using this app, nothing loads on that page. I can't see my accomplishments either. There are two pages- My Coursera page & My University Page. My Coursera page loads sometimes but My University Page didn't load even for once. However in the same page I can see the catalogue if I scroll right to left. Fix this problem quickly or you'll lose your customer",
"One of the perfect learning platforms, but I am encountering a problem since I am using this app in my Samsung tablet A, where the enrollment into a course shows an error saying ""Error loading enrollment data"", it would be great seeing this problem gotten fixed Thanks üòä",
I was not expecting such kind of bad speed from this app. It was not running proper in medium quality while YouTube is working with hd 720p without lagging. I watched a 10 minutes of coursera video in half 45 minutes. I was very disappointed from this service.,
"It's not about the app but the entire platform. I purchased a course on 10th of Dec. Made payment via UPI. Amount deducted from my account but it is not showing up in my purchase history. Irony is, there isno way to contact someone in Coursera. All they have is FAQs.",
Login impossible - Support Contact Form Crashing - Support Contact Email inexistent - Automatic Subscription Renewal PayPal escalation initiated,
When using dark mode in phone the app doesn't show titles and text description properly. This need to be taken care. Please have a look into it. My device is redmi note 7 pro.,
"It was good until I submitted an assignment. It repeatedly gave me a zero credit and asked for resubmission. Whenever I did that it showed an error saying zero credit, resubmit. But it doesn't submit at all even after redoing it several times.",
"I completed my entire course within the deadline but because there was an error in all the surveys I had to do, I missed my deadline. I have no idea who to contact and the app has no troubleshooting section.",
Coursera is a nice place to learn. Thanks for introducing this mighty app to make learning easy.,
"Hard to believe how bad they can make this app. None of the usual Android manoeuvres are possible. Cannot zoom in, select text, copy, share into dictionary, I'm trying to learn Chinese but I give up. Uninstalled",
"While the courses are very good, the app is buggy as hell. Downloading contents is like a game of chance, if you have good luck you can download a thing, otherwise it will be stuck as 'Waiting for connection"" for days.",
"When I try to watch videos in fullscreen mode on my tablet, Coursera app cuts the video, both right and left side of the frames. It's really annoying.",
"This is an app to try, a place to be, and a forum to upgrade one's knowledge. Coursera is really great.",
"It has lots of courses, and more options for me to choose from. The problem though, is that when I click on a new course I want to get more information on...I don't see the enroll or subscribe blue bar at the bottom of my screen. Why is it like that?! If there's anything I need to do or adjust, please reply this message. Gracias!",
it's simply the best. Am on the road map to becoming a certified IBM Full Stack Software Developer üëå. Thank you Coursera Team,
This app sucks ... They say that the certificate is provided and when you are done with your course it seems that you have wasted your precious time as you can not claim your certificate until you pay some cash üèß ...some don't have a credit card üí≥ or facilities to pay online ...it would be useful you don't download it.,
It's a great way of learning,
"The App is simply garbage, I am not able to download the content at all I tried to do it several times but it is not working even when it comes to watching online the application lags a lot. The content is amazing the app is trash",
"It was advertised online as being free. I thought that was farfetched, but figured to check it out anyways. To make the account is of no cost. But mostly, each course costs 50 dollars. Not bad, could have been worse of a price.",
"very good,we can learn from this app",
Good for future oriented learning,
Coursera is the future of best quality education. Best professors and high quality website along with great user interface make cousera the great platform to learn anywhere anytime. Android app of Coursera is not at par as website but still good enough to serve the purpose of portable learning. If you want to learn something then just give it a try. Well done Coursera.,
"The worst app ever seen...such a great platform Coursera is but they have not built a good application for android phone. It crashes a lot. To see 4 min video I have to turn on and off coursera application 2 times. Worst app , please try to cover this problem",
"Overall a stellar app but the 1 star is because of the download option. No matter how good is your Internet connection, the download suddenly stops and fails to reconnect afterwards both on mobile data and WiFi.",
Audio streaming isn't smooth when the app is running in the background. Very annoying. Please fix this! Edit: videos won't begin downloading. Please look into this.,
"I love that I can learn in my free time. Instead of pulling out solitaire to play, I pull up a usually 15-minute video and listen or mute it, and I can read. I have been able to learn at my own pace and dip my toe in different water to see what appeals to my interests. Thanks, Coursera, for being available to anyone.",
"I have enjoyed using this online education tool. The courses are comprehensive and not dumbed down. Still, my biggest problems are the tests and peer review grading system. The tests are noticeably computer generated, and others have also complained that tests answers are frequently wrong! Also their peer review system needs work. You submit your assignment on time, and you still wait months for a grade! If you're opting for a certificate this is problematic. No one to report this to either.",
"Provides Quality Courses, Thought by Reputed Professors from Top Colleges. Free Courses available through auditing without certificate, Free option to learn the Top Courses is the Best feature. Highly recommended to all who want to learn from the Top Colleges. Bugs are there in App. Answers get inverted and cannot edit it, Very difficult to Submit Answers in the Course. Web version is good.",
"I really don't drop comment, but I must say this app is the best, in terms of teaching, the videos don't stop, no Ads disturbance. a good app to recommend for anyone wanting to take a course",
Amazing courses. However the apps has alot of bugs. Not able to load data. Not able to download videos. Keeps stopping. Apps freezes much oftenly after the update.,
It's a great app for finding topics to learn and manage your interests. However one thing it would benefit from is something such as a wishlist where you could store courses you are interested in for later,
As you offer several courses all over the world please make payment option better I am not Able to make payment for my course from debit card which is powered by visa and you accept the visa cards. as a big organization its your responsibility to make payment option better I am trying to pay for my course by PayPal but it's not accepting any of the payment methods I request you to please fix this as soon as possible Thank you..!,
"Before i had good experience with this app ,but since your latest update it's now horrible. It's freezing, and immediately a pop-up message comes up labelled: ""App not responding"". I am no longer using mobile app.",
Coursera has a very rich content but in the newest app version there are some glitches. Please fix the video player! The video controls do not disapera and effectively makes the mobile app useless.,
The subtitle in video is not matching. When I skip a video for 10sec the subtitle not gets skipped and becomes mismatching and it becomes very hard to listen. Please kindly look into this issue.,
It's a great platform for learning the course of your choice,
"Good content, but needs some features. It would be nice to have the ability to save screenshots to notes with the ability to type in some notes if needed. It would be nice to have picture-in-picture as well.",
"Love this app, helped me prep for college courses and get certifications to better my career opporunities. Just wish the app was fully compatible with my tablet so I didnt miss out on multiple pieces of course work.",
I love coursera because I am given a wide range to study a lot of courses anytime I want and with a certificate and at an affordable rate,
very good learner app Appricate good working develop skills,
This app is good. It gives me the lectures that i wanted to understand or learn. But this app is not made for offline purpose. Yet i have downloaded some video lectures but my video is laggaing . And when i try to download more lectures the app getting slow . After some time the start to not respond.. My youtube channel is Critic Master One,
Where has the playback speed gone? Option no longer seems to be available.,
My internet connection is good still the app can't load my course . It's so irritating. Please fix the bug asap. The courses are really good and helpful but this bug problem consumes a lot of time.,
"My best study app. I don't need to go to college to be a professional! Please one more thing, quickly enable the feature so students can add courses they litw to a wishlist. Or maybe Star them while scanning through.",
"Coursera is a very helpful and fantastic app with multiple features. I think it's world biggest education platform. In this app I hope we can access each and every courses ,and the best part of this platform that I loved too much is facility of financial aid.",
"It's a great app, but I feel you should be able to bookmark courses/ specialization one plans on taking in the future. It'd save a lot of stress in searching",
"The new update is making it difficult to learn. Videos takes longer to load. Screen is blurry, making it difficult to see the instructor. Please fix these issues, we're trying to learn",
Worst app .It gives plagiarism for every peer assignment and even if you send your original work . I had sent my original work and they are giving me plagiarism and i changed my work twice but there is no change . I also sent mail to coursera about this but they didn't did anything. The information is also not clear in this app. Maximum courses are from foreign countries and they do not match our syllabus and what we want .,
The ap worked great when I started googles It course and I would have finished if the course would have worked on the mobile üì±phone instead of forcing me to go to desktop to go thru parts of the content. I was really enjoying it and need to be able to grab 5 minutes here or a half hour here to learn instead of being chained to my desktop. Its probably mostly google fault but with all the tech hoopla google and coursera could have made it so much easier to enhance the learning experience. Honest,
There was bug in applications. There when I was try to give specilization course quiz at that time all my ans show me wrong. work on it. XML can't load data in application so pls improve that bug and give update assa so user can easily improve them self.,
"Pathetic Support, Good Courses. They keep deducting money from my account and keep closing my cases. I have no other option to close my salary account since the cousera support team simply says there is no such transaction. I am so much frustrated that i can't even write. Please only use free courses, never ever share your credit card details with them. They have major technical bugs in their payment system.",
"Very bad, suddenly subscription cancelled without notice, and after a month again deduction from my account for the same course. Someday again subscription will be cancelled and you forget about the course and then suddenly deduction will be done Hell with this app, use other platform hate it.",
"This app sucks. Anytime I tap on my course to load it, it takes at least 5 minutes to load anything. Its takes several minutes to do anything. Freezes when I try to download anything.",
"It was really good till the day before yesterday, but yesterday it suddenly stopped working (It doesn't open at all) and I am in the middle of a course... Now I don't know what should I do... please help... I even once uninstalled and then installed it again, but the problem didn't fix...",
"I love Coursesa app. You can even set a time schedule if you are busy in your work. I've learned something new that helps me to improve my skills. You can download it and learn if you are offline. I recommend it to my sister and friends who wants to learn but for now, I can't see my profile picture in the app. Please help me to fix this problem.",
"When I used to sign in from browser, it gets signed it with an ease, using same email and same password, this app shows it invalid, I tried to change my password hundreds of time but it only shows your password is incorrect. I think this is a prank application.",
Amazing platform to increase your knowledge with easy and simple method.,
I have completed the course (Psychological First Aid) using a promotion but I still didn't get my certificate I would appreciate if you look into this matter and provide me a certificate ASAP. I got the required marks but I don't know why you people didn't showed a certificate at the end of the course.  I hope you look forward into this matter and meet my demands.. Thank you,

"I was getting through my lessons fine,after a while i had to take an exam and multiple attempts with different help agents,they could not help me get through this one exam..after countless attempts of time after time wasted waiting for them to figure it out they could not.Now my subscription was cancelled and cannot continue my studies. Help agents could not figure out what was wrong and they just cancelled my subscription on me.This is how they practice their business!",
"I heard about Coursera on a radio commercial for Google, so I got online to try it out, but every time I try to subscribe to the IT courses, I get a message saying ""error purchasing product"". The courses start today, so if this can be remedied, I will give 5 stars.",
Useless app. I am trying to enroll for Google Data Science Professional Certificate. Cannot at all do that. Updated payment information which led to charge of 1 dollar to my credit card and for no use. I still cannot enroll for the course. Sad they spend so much on advertisement but not on maintaining platform infra.,
My video lectures won't clear- where the pause symbol is no longer visible- it starts in the gray overlay position where the settings and buttons are visible and I can't see the video clearly?!?! So annoying please help!,
It is very good for learning new skills. I prefer this to in-person lectures,

"The video control buttons like play, pause, forward, etc are there on screen even when video is playing! Hence couldn't view the actual video. Please resolve this bug ASAP",
"App keeps telling me that there is no internet connection, but I connected to wifi and use other internet services normally. The refresh button is disabled somehow, not clickable. Edit: Have just uninstalled and downloaded again, still get error.",
APP needs help. Could not access well on a tablet or smartphone. Did not save progress or course notes. BEST IF RUN WITH A BROWSER and using a computer. Your app needs help if using a smaller device.,
"The player lags when i play offline video. I dont know why the downloaded video lag even having a good phone. Please solve this. I was completing ""Programming for everyone : python course"" by University of Michigan.",

This is real good my college is providing us coursera real good videos and short quiz to make you learn and the professors are real good they provide certificate which is just cherry on cake you get good explanation assignment in some courses to understand it better and be able to apply what learned basic quiz based on what you learned and then you're done so easy and good,
Really had a very bad experience You can't upload a file even if they says pdf only you can't even upload them then error will happen and and you can't have that assignment changed because it's already locked. Without any file the assignment will get uploaded.,
Great app to learn any skill. there are millions of courses and the ability to download courses and have it work offline is awesome. I love it. Tnx team Coursera you have done an amazing job.,
"Outstanding app (platform) for self-development, free from the physical position. It made me reinvigorated to pursue the path towards honing my skill set by learning it conveniently and at my pace. Self-assessment is up to the Mark in the course era.",
It is an awesome app. Coursera has made learning so much easy and productive. I would request the developer to please enable notes taking service in Android version. Just because of this I have to take written notes which is very time consuming,
"There's an issue with the lastest update, it's always showing ""No connection"" when I try to watch the course.",
"Very good app. Still waiting for the feature to bookmark courses or add them to cart or save for later. Also, there's no way to thumb up a course in the app as there is on the Web app",
"Since the recent App update, the transcript of videos isn't highlighted as the instructor talks. UPDATE JULY 28, 2022: I spoke to Support and this is a reporter bug at least for Android 12, which I use. We need to wait for a fix / update to resolve it.",
"Player is not up to mark, glitches are very common even on downloaded videos, sudden changes in audio. And slow, often prompt to close the application.",
My completed modules are not shown as completed after reopening the app. Enrolled courses and not enrolled anymore. Enrolling doesn't work. App is a mess and very frustrating to use.,
"It's functional, but loading the website through a web browser like Brave makes for a better overall experience. The courses are great, but the app could use some polish.",
I can't fully use this because their development won't offer access to coursework on small screens. I'm on a galaxy tab s7+ it's the only computer I have and for a tablet it has a big screen. But it's still not working. Make this accessible to people without computers or laptops. I don't understand why you can't,
"While all the courses are well made, the app experience is poor on tablets, with no landscape mode for users. This is a basic feature that needs to be implemented",
Best application for learning professional courses to get skills and knowledge. Which will be beneficial for life. Anyone who wants to learn professional courses and to get skills must visit coursera. I have learned a lot of thing from this application.,
"This Intro to psychology course is an amazing program! All the information is so detailed and informative the Professor Bloom was very clear and precise. They also have content in between lessons, that you can view for your own knowledge, benefit and experiences. I definitely plan to further my studies in this field.",
"Good improvement and the app is responsive. However, when I try to login with organization email, it takes me to browser and upon logging in, it keeps me in the browser and doesn't return back to the app",
"I kept all the optional honours assignments to complete it at the last but just after completing the last week's activities I got my certificate although there was a quiz (optional) left on the last week but I got my certificate . I just wanted to complete each and every activity given in the course . I think there should be an option for an individual to choose whether they want to complete the course ,when optional activities are still left but the compulsory week activities are done .",
"I decided to enroll in one of your courses but I picked a wrong one accidently. I tried to contact customer service because I was in doubts about the total price besides I was unable to unenroll of that one. Finally, I canceled as per policy and I didn't take the course since Coursera is a death place (there is no one to help on behalf of the company). I can not trust on this app since there is not a real human being attempting to resolve my doubts as a customer.",
Pros - good courses from good universities/institutes/corporations. I think Coursera is economical compared to other upcoming learning platforms. Allows checking course through 'audit' option before opting for certificate. Certificate can be shown online. Cons - The app keeps signing me out every week.,
"Love the app, easy to use and good on any device. But I wish it had a bit more diversity in courses, feels like courses are limited.",
"Positives : the plarform in general is good, and it has a lot of variant courses Negative: the test is unclever ex. In spanish language test it would not accept any synonym, what ever you try you wont have any certificate from this website and app they will keep pushing you back",
I hate new user interface and the old version i am using is always asking me for upgrade i loved the basic coursera app and i am still using it please do make the app as simple as it was please help.... it's really fuzzy user interface and the old interface version 2017-2018 was damn awesome,
Coursera is an excellent platform for the learners here you can find pretty much every specialisation course on almost fields of computer science (for me). Not only for computer science but here you can have Courses on many other topics. Over-all a great source of learning,
There are many bugs .... playing video.....it is stucking every second....... please give updates immediately.......,
Such a pathetic app. I have heard a lot of good things about the app so I decided to enroll in some online courses. I tried creating my account but it is not letting me creating an account and I am only getting error message. I have tried 50 times still no success. Such a pathetic app.,
"That is great , I loved it Keep it Good Work üíØ",
Continuously logs me out . If not used for a day or two I get logged out and downloaded files can't be accessed from the app . I love the app but it is getting frustrating ... Hope devolopers fix this issue asap,
"The service is excellent but the real issue is in the app, if anyone started an account by signing in with google, you'll miss out on using the app because that feature is not available, this is a mere request to coursera to add the option of signing in via Google.",
"Great app, but how do I turn off the subtitles when casting to my Chromecast? I tried tapping English because I thought it might be a toggle, but it isn't. And there's no option for none.",
This is a great place to learn any professional field it offers. I highly recommend it because it tests your knowledge of what you went through and does not bombard you with unnecessary information. It has a clear and easy to use interface.,
like it so much. I recommend this apps for anyone who wants to switch their careers,
"Coursera stole $50 from me, during a time like this when the world is still being affected by COVID and I am recently un-employed and I literally can't afford the $50 and you should not use this app, there is no support and a terrible/confusing UX... I was charged $49.99 USD for a course I am unable to access, and when I chat with a support agent they tell me they recommend I should cancel my subscription and sign up for the course again so that I am charged another $49.99",
"With the latest update, it hasn't been able to function well as it used to do. While, enrolling/subscribing for the course with every new tab which gets openey up it shows error.",

coursera is a wonderful learning platform ! it's a platform that helps one learn at their own pace. The platform also has a financial aid option for learners in third world countries who cannot afford the full payment for a course.,
a wonderful course to deepen your practice and delivered by someone who really knows his stuff and is great eye candy.,
"Screen chops. Every once in a while, while watching a video lecture, the screen chops many times. The experience is very bad to watch.",
"The old media player was way better. I'm currently pursuing Data Analytics Certificate. The app has it's subtitles out of sync, however the website works well. Please fix it",
"A well rounded, challenging course that gave me great insight into the Data Analytics field and its multitude of uses. I can't believe I waited so long to take this course but Im glad I did.",

I'm a software developer And I managed to finds UI UX bugs. First the correct check radio is still in red color. Second is that some videos lessons simply don't play.,
"This is an excellent program to end the global hunger, but the app should put an other method like pay with the balance of play store without need to put the credit or debit card for the people who want to help but doesn't have credit card.",
"The idea qnd the content are spectacular, but I guess the app could be designed in a better way that makes it easier to use. There is still some effort you can put in it guys.",
"This app crashes all the time. I always get ""could not load data"" and ""no connection"" errors when everything else is working. When it works it is a decent app.",

"Bad experience. Needed a certificate for a college assignment. Submitted the peer graded assignment and even after being graded by a peer, I'm unable to get my grades. My assignment is now overdue. This problem had not been fixed yet.",
App has become really laggy and heats up my phone in very short time. This specifically occurs when the internet connection is weak. But this wasn't the case a few months prior.,
Coursera is a good platform to learn.It's a platform which gives me the understanding of English language.,

"Great, Simply a perfect example of modern educational advancement",
"The Courses are great no doubt about it. But the price is too much high. Just see they got Monthly Subscription, not individual course fee. And these monthly Subscription price is set too high for middle class and poor people. The Middle class and Poor people who can't afford such Courses in normal life. So, they seek online courses and if a great platform like ""Coursera"" set its price too high. Many people can't afford it. Like seriously, Monthly Subscription starts RS-4000+ to Rs-5,700. Big 0",

I amaze by instructions channel and it's much easier to be understood,
"I got financial aid for a course, but I can't submit the assignment, and it keeps asking me to purchase it",
Hi. I am having issues with downloading lectures. Please address this. Thank you.,
"this is a best app to learn the courses, who can't afford.",
"Coursera is my school after school. It has helped me learn lots of skills for free. With the financial aid, there is no end to what I can learn. Thank you for this gift.",

Thank You Coursera. Thanks to you even people like me who has no access to International Credit cards can learn (audit) anything I want from the top educators of the world from the comfort of my home.,
"as I start to learn my courses, I find myself starting to apply the teaching to my life, such as: my goal & outcomes",
"great app so far, my only complaint is that their is no dark theme mode.",
Updated version doesn't allow me to sign in using Facebook login. Pls check.,
Coursera is an online Learning platform I will recommend to anyone who's willing to scale up higher in his or her career path,
"Very well built app, operates smoothly and works well.",
"i love Coursera, it has made so much easier to gain knowledge on multiple subjects",
smooth learning environment with suitable tutor's for each course.,
I've already paid the the course the amount has been deducted but the subscription has not activated.,
A better platform to learn and showcase one's programming dexterity. üëçüèΩ,
An amazing App if you want to change the course of your career and your life.,
a very wonderful and user friendly interface for education,
It's a great app. But it has been declining my credit card. Please can you work on that?,
"So much educative, effective, efficient and easy to use",
"The test is too difficult, qualitative as well, Thanks",
This course was successful in giving foundation information that is essential to knowing the impact of analog vs digital,
great platform to learn basic skills of communication üëè,
"Best teaching, and easy to learn .",
I love this app! it's very useful and easy to use. There's a lot of course to choose üñ§,
the app is more interactive and easy to use,
I absolutely LOVE Coursera. Life changing accomplishments straight from your phone or laptop.,
its a very good opportunity for learning and achievement of of goal,
A great learning platform with user friendly interphase,
it has still accessibility issues for visually impaired,
so far so good. let's see how helpful these certificate are at helping me land a better job,
wonderful app for learning! lots of free courses that I enjoyed . ü•∞üôè,
User control don't go away when you play the video lessons. It is very irritating to watch it with control as it dims the video quality. Expected better from coursera.,
Apps are okay but the latest update made it impossible to learn via the app as the navigator is blocking the screen and wouldn't go away. It has been more than a week and still no bug fix update released,
"It's good, but still web version is far better than app. And regarding search options, it would be better if you could add option to filter courses.",
"Canceled a subscription immediately after viewing the first video in the course, but was charged anyway after the free trial. As per their unfair refund policy, I can't refund the money they essentially stole so I'm basically screwed.",
Thanks very much for fixing the bug where the video player controls were appearing on top of the video. Now it's much easier to study on mobile.,
Thos apk is a most excellent APK. I never have any downtime crashes I never lost any data. it's streamline its linear and very functional as far as time efficiency. I highly recommend this app.,
Very bad experience till now I have enrolled for a course and added a credit card but after free trial my course has been unsubscribed and payment is not processing at all with any type of card. I have tried many credit card debit cards but the payment is not processing. I want to learn and earn certificate.,
"You guys are the worst in the world!!! Due to some issue, your platform couldn't process the payment, after updating my card twice still the payment didn't happen and that causes the removal of all my data of the course that I was pursuing!!! You guys have the worst UX application! Your web and mobile app suck and it's full of bugs!!! I am shocked why on earth #Google has partnered with you?! I am cursing myself for selecting such pathetic platform to study! Damit hire a QA team to fix bugs!!!",
"This App is wholesome... The teachings are communicated easily and beautifully, I have never had one single issue or complains so far... I just hope ALL of the tasks can be done without compulsorily having a system.",
Great for learning!,
"Actually this is a good app to learn. But i found a trouble with the review other's assignment, i cant do that. It said billions of times that my connection and network are in problem but actually they're great. Please solve this problem quickly.",
"It's a great platform for the real learners and those who are deserving. It's practical, object oriented and conceptual . It perfectly matches any check box fir everyone. Seriously recommend it. Good job developers and keep up the good work .",
I hope that there would be an update where we can take the quizzes from the app. Right now it always prompts me to use a desktop browser to do it. I can't see the reason why it can't be done within the app aside for the big project submissions.,
This is so inspiring and very simple to comprehend,
"This app is awful. Slow, clunky and absolutely horrible to use. Considering how good, efficient and easy to use their website is I highly recommend just to use their website to learn. Using this app is frustrating. It's a shame to see that there is no improvement is made to make this app better.",
"This app truly was a turning point in my life. Though others opinion is that the certificate is not worth to get into a job, I won't agree bcoz without something which doesn't give you a good understanding cannot make you a skilled or knowledgeable, rather the courses I've learnt through this are quality ones if you truly enjoy learning. Cheers Coursera team :)",
Many bugs and app not responding,
It is the most absurd app if you're asking for support. I can't verify my ID even after trying all the government ID I had. Though I have mailed customer support countless time it was utter failure. Now I'm stuck completing the course without any certificate without any support from them. Guys DON'T DO CERTIFICATE COURSE FROM THIS APP. Go on to edX or Udemy. They have a lot better courses and helpful support.,
"Just downloaded it, in the evening, and i noticed there's no dark theme, it's annoying, to get bright light in the evening. It means you can just study in the day.",
"I have enrolled for a course of content marketing and some videos have podcasts attached to it. But i cannot find the option of attachments in the app, even after i followed the given instructions. Please help me with this.",
The older version was much better than the latest versions. The screen buttons doesn't seem to go away and doesn't make learning fun or easy. Smh!!,
"I am experiencing an issue everytime I play a video in the app. Due to this, I am unable to watch any of the videos. It says- ""Oops, Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again."" Please resolve this issue.",
Very useful app.. Just rocking to develop our career.!!,
great learning experience and gain knowledge üòâüòâ,
It is an amazing experience for me to develop my skills through the courses provided,
"Hi,  I have enrolled for IT support in Coursera, but I'm having technical  issues from your side completing it. I have to contact you because I couldn't find other ways to reach you for help. Your learners helpdesk doesn't work. Shows the error (something went wrong) I'm having technical issues completing the Linux practice test, even I know how to do it i can't type any space in the command because it deletes the whole command whenever I type any space. Kindly complete my course as I've learnt",
Poor customer support. I subscribed for free trail and i tried to cancil it because it was useless to be as i had to pay again for my course enrolment. In my subscription segment there were no subscription visible i was also charged 1usd before trail as it clearly stated that it was free. Then today i recieve a payment messafe from my bank of 14 usd. What is this this is how you want to loot your customers and force them into paying for things they dont want to use please cancil my subscription,
"very good,It improve my mental taught",
good way to learn,
"New update has many bugs. It's not correctly loading. It's showing I have to reset my deadlines after I reset my deadlines. Please fix it, otherwise it has been an amazing experience",
This app is just excellent for learning & obtaining certificate.. But some of the surveys can only be done through computer.. Please fix this issue and try to make it more flexible so that we can do the task using mobile phone itself.. Please..,
I can't access my course on laptop for almost 24. Error I got is the site is on maintenance. Fix this please,
"This a great way to learn at your own convenient time, pace and comfort. The videos are very explanatory and can be downloaded for offline use, which make them available to be used for studies for as many times as required",
No doubt best courses for every topic is available but it sucks when we have to download couses offline. Its downloading intterupts in between & stops. Again have to put it on downloads & process repeats.,
Easy to understand and I like the practical aspect,
"The ""save note"" feature is only available on the web version. Hopefully the development Team will add it to the App. Overall, the App is extremely excellent üëç",
it is very easy to use and the user interface is very good and responsive.,
"really my niche, so glad to find the challenge and purpose I desire in my work üôå",
"It's amazing how we improve our education these days, I love it.",
it's easier to use,
"Seriously I was expecting a good app..the current app looks like designed by a novice. Guys pls engage a good UI/UX designer. Another issue is the error while enrolling into the course, keep throwing errors",
"Material is great, but overshadowed by video player issues. The options cannot be adjust and they never leave the screen. Its better to use the website",
"I think that it's very useful, but I don't give it five stars because the app doesn't have the course notes option, I can't save notes from the classes, and neither can't see the notes that I have taken on the desktop version. And it does not have the option to see the courses that I have saved for later",
"I used to complete my courses in coursera website through chrome, I didn't knew there was an app of it, all of a sudden I checked out on play store about it, and there it is... Once I opened and logged in I can easily directed towards the course like a life saver.",
"With the new app update, text no longer scrolls as the video plays. Not good. There should be a bookmark option to pin a course and come to enroll later. Also, the offline mode needs more work.",
"Great app. I love the idea of easy access to education for everyone. I would really like to see a feature in the app that allows you to ""Favorite"" and ""Save for later"" courses.",
EDITED: After a restart of my device logging in issues all went away and I was able to login. ‚Äî--‚Äî------------‚Äî----------‚Äî--- I too am unable to use the Google Login after installing the app. The overlay comes up though is not clickable. I must uninstall to continue the course in a browser where everything logs in just fine.,
I would say this is a good thing for underdeveloped countries because we don't often get a good education at home this will help a lot .one thing about the professional certificate courses offered is that you should at least try to connect us with an online job opportunities after completion.most people will benefit from it!,
This is the greatest learning platform in the universe ATM.üôÇ,
"lot of courses, essential in keeping with the latest knowledge",
No annual Coursera+ subscription option in the android app :( ... Also please consider local relative pricing based on each country's purchase power ... 6000EGP Per Year was the relative pricing in EGP before the latest series of depreciation ... So 1500EGP/mo is too expensive,
"When I try to do ID verification it just says ""There was a problem with the image you provided"" in the very beginning of the process. I didn't even take/upload any image. Fix the bug",
I like the app and features like offline download option. It would be better if TRANSCRIPT will work in offline. No subtitle during offline is quite unsatisfying. I also request you to available courses in Hinglish languagealso.Hope you will resolve my issues and language tips till than 5 stars from my side. thanks,
So far so good. We just need more courses!!!!,
"Recently i am unable to play any course videos i am encountering an error saying "" Oops Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again. OK"" Please fix this so i can continue with my course. Thanks",
"The videos don't load not one of the the reading material loads perfect, everything else works but the videos...and its been like that for quite some time. Please fix it",
"Wonderful Wonderful opportunities ü•∞ I am so greatful to this application! I have learned so many amazing and helpful things from this course it is unbelievably cheap to get these accredited certificates! ( financial aid available), plus you can audit most courses for free!! I have been approved 2ce for financial aid so far!) And I am extremely greatful to courera for that! If you want to know if this app is ligit....... YES DOWNLOAD IT NOW!! ‚ù§‚ù§Seriously Thank You So Much Coursera‚ù§‚ù§",
"I used to find this kinda helpful, but now, I can't even log in because it keeps saying that I need to check my internet connection, Although I have an internet connection, and it works perfectly in every other app, I think it's a bug that need to be fixed .",
Doesn't have enough courses. Lacks variety. Majority of courses are for engineering and business. Wanted architecture courses and didn't find a single good one out of the only 5 I found that to very remotely related to architecture.,
best platform ever love it,
"Thank you so much for this application. I find learning in it quite fun. The mobile application makes it quite personalised. I am not easily thrown off or on because if network issues too. I am exceptionally thankful for the audit section. Hopefully someday, I get to register for the business section and also get to teach too...Lolsü§ó",
"There was a time in my life where I would think of how stressful it will be for me to enroll in courses I picked interest in, considering time, physical strength and my comfort. All thanks to coursera for this wonderful initiative as all of these have been made easy.",
I tried your app (the course about Rome architey) and found that text fields work incorrectly. The text in them is oriented from right to left and change uppercase chars to lovercase and viseversa.,
"Courses are good , everything is great but I can't access to the course after opening the app . I have to clear the app data before opening the app to access the content . It's so frustrating",
"I'm using for minimum 5 year's from now, useful and great if two words to say.",
"Video and audio are not smooth. Audio breaks even between the word. Like ""regularization"" sounds as ""reg-ulariz-ation"". I hope you are getting my problem and you will reply me asap .",
It is an excellent and convenient way of learning. You can access to hundreds of courses on your smart devices and Laptops. Great work and I highly recommend you people to please enroll yourself.,
"This review is of the application password feature and not the content. The application has one major issue with passwords. If you forget the password and opt to reset it, coursera will send an email that will let you login through the browser and does not allow you to reset your password. So u cannot login through the app and everytime u want to login after that u have to click on the ""forget password"" which as mentioned will only let u login on the browser.",
"I am learning Data Analytics from by using Coursera. It has too many careers available for almost everyone & in the ever changing fast world, its need of the day. Moreover, I have request for Coursera Management to enhance increase scholarships especially for developing countries. It will have greater impact. Thanks",
Coursera is a great online platform for educating. The best have seen so far,
"The app is great...! It will too good if there can be feature of zoom to fill in large screen devices (like in youtube, etc).... & even an option for feedback for users for the application.",
I love this platform. Thank you for making learning appealing,
"As an educational service, it is great. As an app, needs improvement with loading course materials (still buggy, particularly for low-internet devices).",
Education is good but certificate system sucks.. I've completed 2 courses so far on and have applied for financial aid but I didn't get any reply back from them.. I like how the education is soo good on this app that my knowledge has significantly increased but what about certificate.. now even if I try to pay for the certificate there's no option after course completion..,
"I am extremely disappointed with this app. I tried a course which was ""free "" And then after a week it took 80$ from me, without my permission or agreement. I didn't even had a chance to cancel it, as it was impossible . Even though i tried it within the first week. I want my money back.",
Downloaded videos is laggy after 10 mins. Also it is overheating while playing the downloaded videos. So i am using the external players to watch the downloaded videos. Please fix this out.,
"After the last update on 2nd sept,I'm not able to download anything..The app loads..I can go to my course.. but I cannot download a thing.. it just stays there saying waiting for network but my network is fine.. I can willingly give u 5 stars if this is cleared.. and yes I've turned off download through wifi only",
This is very helpful platform for learning hi üëãüèª keep the good work üëç,
"Very very good, good support and courses",
"There is no un-enroll button. I have Coursera Plus and enrolled in multiple courses to check them, but now there is a BIG CLUTTER on my Dashboard with courses that I'll never be taking. Poor UI design. Will consider using other platforms for this very reason.",
It is the best app. It provides well platform for learning online. There is one issue which is that ofenly it doesn't provide subtitles during offline videos.,
"Cannot download lessons. I get the error ""Downloading failed due to insufficient space"" although I have 4GB of free space on my SD card. I can't download to my phone storage as well. It's just 3MB of standard video.",
Really made good use of idle time in quarantine by having access to great online courses that are relevant and individually tailored to suit needs and pace. Thank you! Great app!,
Coursera is a good platform for learning.,
"Absolutely love the app, it's interface and the content! Great platform to learn online...I learned a lot about psychology form this platform during lockdown.",
"Exceptionally brilliant software and the best learning platform ever stumbled upon. Coursera is the very best for novice, intermediate, or a professional.",
Unbelievable one of my favorite education app. I have so much from Coursera it is better than all it is no 1 online educational app in the world if anyone use Coursera they don't need to go university or college it is x100 better than this Thankyou Coursera and their team to provide world best content ‚ô•Ô∏èüòäüòä,
Very annoying. The subtitle fonts are too big compare to the old versions which are well placed with required fonts size.,
"Coursera is an unreliable & untrustworthy so-called online course provider. There's no customer support. Since I'm from India there's no presence of India or English (India) in their settings for country & lang. Give them money & get no support. Courses u search or want to revisit later if not purchased, there's no like or add to collection or bookmarks so you'll waste time again finding it. No dark theme. Anyways, I'll go with udemy but not with Coursera. Very costly no offers or discounts. üí©",
"There're lots of technical problems in this app, especially it troubleshoots a lot while answering the quizzes. One moment it's showing this answer correct, in another moment shows it wrong. Very disturbing",
"I like the app. The courses are very informative, however, it would be awesome if I could save courses that I would like to take in the future or courses I might be interested in taking after I get doing with the course I'm currently taking.",
Coursera is one of the best platforms to learn modern technology and skills. It has changed the way educations is being spread. Thanks to Andrew ng But the application is not working fine. It is not downloading the lectures.,
"Do companies actually read their own users request for assistance and investigate issues with their own systems? I don't think so, as they continue to give answers that had nothing to do with people request and claim users and not them have to do something. As I mentioned there are bugs as I had trouble opt out and Coursera support claim phone software does prevent some access to courses. Ah what has opt out of newsletters had to do with accessing courses? üò°üò°üò°",
"I love coursera, but this app is very buggy. I use it aon my Samsung galaxy Tab s8+ and it constantly keep crashing, does not property Show the video in full screen Mode, falls to loan tests, etc.",
"The app is too buggy. After scrolling down it keeps sending you back to the beginning of the page. Also, it's not compatible with dark mode on Xiaomi.",
"App stopped working, It says unable to refresh data please retry, why this is happening today",
"The app is amazing the UI is great. I'm a oneplus 7 pro user, when I use the app my phones starts to heat in normal room temperature. Though the other apps work fine, even apps like PUBG work fine. Would be greatful if you could help me out.",
very easy to answer,
"I love this app and how smoothly it works which allows me to complete my course and learn on the go. However, I cannot save notes from the video modules like how I can on a CPU/Laptop.",
"Great course but video sometimes are blurry, that can be substituted with written text. Downloading of videos has some issues. There is nothing to restart download.",
Nice applications I'm so excited to complete this course,
"Some great content. App looks to work well at first, but the sheer amount of bugs while trying to learn makes it unusable.",
An amazing and unique learning environment,
The app does have a lot of online courses and is one of the best e-learning platform. But the customer support is the worst. Have to wait for hours to get a reply for your query. and the assistants are not supportive.,
"While playing video, the control buttons like forward,backword button,start button and the progress bar are not hiding manually as well as automatically. So I couldn't able to see clear screen.",
I haven't been able to sign into the app after the latest update. Not sure why. This was done over multiple days with the same result- no reaction from the app. It was perfect for use earlier but it seems to be having issues now.,
Everything is fine here except sync. If I use it to study and then switch to web app to continue and then again switch to mobile app it doesn't show me last lecture I studied on wep app as completed.,
"Coursera offline doesn't work properly. What's the point of offline mode if you first turn off Wi-Fi, access the app just to find out you can't even load into the app? That just renders everything pointless about offline mode.",
Waste of time/money. Test is in a different language. Reached out to support. Waited over a month for it to be fixed while being charged. Support ended up telling me to cancel my membership. Would give negative stars if possible.,
"After the recent update, I cannot play any of the videos. It says to close the player and try again. When I even did that, and even reinstalled the app, still the problem didn't resolved",
amazing application. my favourite part is coursera accepting and allowing financial aids to the needy students. I request to extend the same for degree purposes as well. thanks for letting us learn and bringing us together with the best instructors.,
"My last review was deleted,idk how but I won't stop. The app is really bad, logs off a lot automatically, the download video option is extremely glitchy, at times I can't participate or submit assignments",
Thank you for the opportunity to learn from such great teachers!!!,
App keeps crashing before I can log in. Sometimes it crashes immediately after I open it. I can't use it at all PS: I've deleted and re-downloaded it and it still crashes.,
Cousera makes learning easy for every kind of student,
"Since the update, the app seems to be lagging a lot. The scrolling and interfacing is not that fluid. I am using a Samsung Galaxy M31s (6GB RAM, 128 GB internal storage).",
I like the courses on Coursera. But I can't watch the videos from my phone app. Keeps saying the video player is not working. Please fix.,
Coursera has helped me improve a lot in understanding fundraising and expanding my knowledge in the Non Profit Organisation field.,
"It's really good to have classes in our mobile anytime anywhere but here what some of the issues i have faced , it's start buffering which is a kind of irritating even though I've downloaded that video it's buffering while playing pl check through this , thank you",
Good and easy accessing but please take care that app contains lots of bugs even after completing the qa once again it shows that it was not done its happening more than 3 times that I'm fed up and unenrolled after completing 78 percent of the course,
The best thing on the Internet. Best way to learn free or paid way. The knowledge given by experts is very useful and on the point. No bugs and great interface and processing.,
It's the best learning platform available in the market . If you only want to learn and certificate is not necessary for you nearly all the courses are available for free . So if you really want to learn coursera if for you :),
"I earn certificates of completion for most Coursera courses, which can be added to resumes and LinkedIn profiles to demonstrate new skills and knowledge.Coursera is a great option for anyone looking to expand their knowledge and skills in a convenient and accessible way.This allows learners to find courses that align with my interests and goals",
The video player is broken. The controls never go away. I can't see the info graphics. Because the controls cover everything. Please fix this.,
Ended up using it only for offline video. Hate that it doesn't fully support landscape mode. Every other week quizzes are not possible to do in the app.,
Excellent Learning App.Learn Every Day with Coursera to enhance skills.,
one of the best learning app,
Good lectures and good communications. Thanks.,
"The course library is quite good but what is the use of having knowledge when the path of delivering them to the learner's is like the lunar surface it's just crashes every single time you have courses to develop apps also please use them and make a better app, and first of all atleast open your app yourself and see how chaotic it is it's just a blunder, peace every one. I am using a phone to learn which is not a flagship but A Snapdragon 712 is good enough it can run PUBG with out hiccups.",
Can you kindly move the next and previous buttons to the middle on the app I have been hitting them accidentally while fasting forward and keep moving to the next and next video Also about navigating the videos it will be good to just go back to the certain part i left of,
I love the easiness in this online learning platform.,
"This is really helpful, thank you so much for this great app, Coursera!!",
I am unable ro enrol in any of the courses as they show the message error loading .Please Fix this,
"Coursera is a very easy, practical, down to earth and step by step way to learn and understand a very difficult subject. It is highly recommended. Kudos!",
"The old version please, the video subtle, I hate it. In the old version the subtitle was scrolling along with the video and you could navigate using the subtitle. Please take it back before upgrading any further asomblief tog",
practical n user friendly,
Great app! I learned a lot and got many certificates.,
The app is amazing. It has good quality of courses. You can download courses after enrollment. Watch at your own pace. Great app to enhance your skills.,
"The Coursera website is the best online learning platform I have ever seen. App has good functionality, but the performance is not good. Does not load the courses I enrolled on the home view.",
"Cousera to me has to be one of the best, if not the best, online learning platforms. Their courses are simple to understand and very insightful with real-world examples.",
"A typical Indian user can't pay for subscriptions using any of the payment options except credit cards. Given that primary user base is teen students in their college life, how can they possibly have a credit card...!? This makes enrollment into specialisations a tedious task..pls consider accepting PayPal payments in India for subscriptions. Besides that the app is great üíì",
App always trouble to load your data or something went wrong check your connection and website ip address not found when browsing it. Even all are works sometimes the transcript of videos not available and cannot prompt the subtitle,
"The course content are really great but if u talk about app it really lags so much , very slow as comparing to edx , even while downloading it stops like 4-5 times while downloading a full course , a bit disappointed",
"Reading is essential activity for the user of this app. So... Where is font size selection? Where is landscape orientation? Where is preventing device from screen turning off? Please watch some of UX courses available on Coursera, probably you'll begin to empathize your users a bit better. Thanks!",
The Mobile version sometimes shows the answers options in percentage...,
"I gave 1 star but I don't even wanna give that. Worst experience using this app I can't purchase or subscribe the courses , it's been a week since am trying doing that , just able to use the free ones. Why so ?? I don't wanna waste time and lag behind. Please do something to solve this ASAP.",
"Coursera has amazing wide courses from beginners to advanced level learning, it also has inbuilt projects which help student understand better amd work on it. I highly recommend coursera for anyone who are really interested in learning.",
Just a mess Really slow hangs out Alot it is fine on browser Coursera has the best courses online if you want to study study it on its own web page bcz this app will make you hate Coursera very slow loading of pages very poor downloading and hangs Alot this app is really slow and has a very bad user Experience,
Great app. But it needs the 'Go back 10 secs' feature. Because many times I want to go back and relisten. The drag back function takes you back way too long,
You have a block on viewing content on the mobile phone. Why did you create this app? To literally gaslight your members. Then try to locate customer support. Contact email is buried deep in a forest of useless FAQS. I had to email the privacy team to reach a human. I do not expect to remain with this service unless some things change pretty quickly.,
"They literally just read a screen, no explanation, no Interactive learning. I enrolled in Blockchain basics, the teacher is just reading the the screen like a BOOK , no explanation nothing. Pure line wise reading",
"The app is user friendly, but I didn't find dark mode or night mood in any settings. When I need to read it at night I really required this option and to save some battery also.",
very well educated platform,
Can you do a wishlist feature for the courses that I want to take. Both for the site and the app. I think that would be a really good feature and I believe that everyone will agree with me on that.,
"Worst platform ever!!! You will wait for weeks to receive a grade. Also, they charge you a day before the renewal date they mention in your account settings. I don't recommend to use Coursera Never! Don't waste your money please!!!!!!",
"An excellent learning experience through Coursera App. It helps me a lot to save time by utilizing the availability of study material both online and offline. So, whether I am connected to Coursera through Internet or not I can continue my learning plan without any unforeseen hindrance.",
so far i am really enjoying this and learning a lot more than i thought i would!!!,
"Many many ""bugs"". Several bugs when I tried to login, then none of enrolled courses were shown, really slow app and responses, and my quiz didn't shown anything - leading me to have a 0.",
This app is pointless. You can't even take tests in the app that are apart of the course program. So you have to stop and change devices in the middle of the lesson. Lame and not worth it,
I am unable to reset my course progress. It is one of the most important feature of any educational app. I strongly need an option to reset my course progress.,
This app just make people fool I have completed one course with 91% but they still didn't issue me any certificate they are asking me to buy certificate. Before starting the they said the course is completely free of cost and certificate will be provided freely after completion. I have mailed Coursera but I didn't get any response from them.,
Why does the android version of coursera lack basic features such as saving notes from the text and dark mode vs its iOS app. Way to favor one ecosystem over another. Got the samsung note 20 and its a noticeable different vs the iPhone 11 pro.,
Often crash when resume watching. Doesn't remember last watched position. Ask me to entoll courses I already completed. Seriously expect a much better app from a platform teaching people to create apps.,
why does it take much time to load any thing,
Is there any option to rate this app for half star? Such a worse ui/ux design... The app gets hang for every 2 mins of use and have to close n open for smooth experience... Prefer UDEMY over this worst learning app... Paying money is worth to learn in udemy instead of enrolling in coursera!!! Please fix the bug if possible... The download option in this app is the worst of all... Wont properly function at all and uses lots of data for downloading nothing! Such a pathetic app!!!! Prefer UDEMY pls,
I am currently taking the course Introduction to Personal Branding and in that course there's some places to write my name and opinion and when I try to write it shows letters in backwards and it's annoying. I can't fully get involved in this course just because of that. Please make it right.,
Content does not download. Neither it shows how much time is left. What % of individual videos have downloaded. Very poorly built app. Not expected from those who teach these things.,
This is awful. Never actual took one of the classes. I have been trying to cancel this for a few months now to no avail. It's still charging me!,
"Shittiest ux. Tried to reset my password 4/5 times . But got no mail to reset my password, even not in spam folder. Tried to log in an account, enters to another(my friend's) account from which i logged out some moment ago. Even when i changed my mail, it shows the same mail which was before Lots of Problems. Highly not recommended",
"The app is mostly OK, but has problems loading questions of quizzes, especially involving mathematical formulas. And often, after replying to a quiz question, ""could not submit the answer"". That is quite annoying",
It is the best app to take online courses.I have taken some of the courses and completed them.The teaching method is really good. It has the facility of financial aid for those who is not capable of paying the course fee.Highly recommended this app.,
"There is a major issue with the app. I installed it 3 days ago and wanted to start my 2nd course alongside the first one but it gives an error no matter what course I choose to enroll. When I hit the enroll, it says ""error loading enrollment data"" :/ Now I cannot choose any course",
Coursera is a great platform am learning alot here thank you so much Coursera,
"This is a very good platform to help and give back to the community by helping to be able to achieve more with the free online courses being offered. This does not only promotes itself, but also giving a chance and helping people, like me who does not have that extra budget to enroll in paid online courses. Thank you for this great opportunity.",
This app is really slow and sometimes crashers on its own. But the content is really awesome but what is the use if it is slow. So use the website on your pc/laptop rather than using this app. Thank you.,
I love Coursera and its platform,
I absolutely love this course!,
"it's a nice app, it has the features that enhances good user experience",
coursera is the best educational platform. great Jobüëç,

"I used to hate Coursera Mobile App. But after the last update, now it's working really well. Now I like the app and easily revise whenever I am away from my PC. Thank you very much Coursera for best quality course and an amazing app for Android OS.",
"This app is easy to use, works smoothly and has really good data optimization. I prefer watching the lecture videos on app and solving assignments on their website.",
"I could never ever imagine, that Coursera will be very close to scammers! In short - I choose to enroll in course ""Promote your Scientific Results"" (i.e., my emplyer payed for the course). I submitted all the needed assignments, BUT... I can't get my final grade and certificate, because it depends on other students, who have paid for the course and who have reviewed my submissions! The Coursera's support team keep answering the same thing over and over - just wait. Month, year?",
The app starts lagging after one I watch one video. And then it crashes after about 20 minutes after this recent update. Please fix this as soon as possible.,
"Everything is great so far and I have got my 2nd certificate course completed. My 2022 new year wish to make my learning more wonderful will be a new function ""My Favorites"" to add new courses to my list for next learning. Cheers!",
This app is absolute trash. It never works. If you apply from a financial aid to do the. Course you are a jerk because they will make you so so much mad that you will not be able to find your certificate. As for me when I completed my certification they were like congrats you have achieved your certificate and blah blah blah .. the tech stuff . But the day after when I completed my course I tried my best to obtain certificate it drive me mad because they use a third party üéâ trash app persona.,
"I like the website, hate the app. After the recent update, the video player stops every 5 minutes whether it's on 5g or wifi, and I've never been able to download videos.",

"It was the best app for learning. But recently the videos are getting stucked ,app is crashing continously. I can't continue my courses... Please solve this issue asap. Thank you",
Good app to improve our knowledge,
If I could give a 10star I'd give it to coursera app. It is neatly designed and very interactive with all it's built in features. Easy to use and light weight. Awesome app,
"It has so many problems 1. It suddenly stopped many times 2.Phone hanged while opening it. 3.After the completion of project, it doesn't show any improvements. 4. Takes so much time",
I really appreciate it apps and is helpful.,
So I was in the middle of my course & suddenly it stopped by saying that they are having trouble to load my data. They told me to check my internet connection which was completely working. Still they are showing error.,
"This is one of the best online learning platform. I have no words for it to describe it's importance. It provides wings to fly in this world. Anyone can learn anywhere, anytime, and anything from this platform with affordable prices. Thanks Coursera!!!!",
"Everytime I want to login or sign up ,it always says no internet connection,when I actually do have internet connection. I can play TED ,browsing,but always can't connected in Coursera. It's a shame. I really love this app before,I wish you can fix it soon.",
Great app for free online courses. I'm trying to take my food handlers card Certification online and I like that these courses are friendly for someone who has learning disabilities. I'll be taking more courses until my school opens back up,
"Rectify recent playback issue. Please provide for stacks/lists( as per the default categories of the enrolled courses ) option in MY COURSES section of tha app( as well as web ) to arrange the enrolled courses in different categories for better navigation . Also provide an option for sorting the same by different methods( alphabetical, added etc ) and customizing the stacks/lists( by creating new one, naming, priortising etc ). In short try to make MY COURSES section less hecting and appealing.",
Best platform to learn new things apart from the syllabus,
I can cast my screen to my Android TV. Highly recommended. Is like a free source of knowledge. Also paid courses available. Subtitles in many languages depending on the course.,
"Course her are good , but I am unable to open this app.........& even my downloaded videos & content not opening, it comes "" Coursera not responding"" and closes automatically everytime.... Worst! Kindly fix the problems...",
"there is a problem in the app. when i open an assignment, a suggestion tells me that i should do it on a bigger screen. then when i choose the try on this device option, an error occurs and i can't access the assignment. i don't have a laptop, so i need to do the assignment on the phone",

I enjoy learning Korean it is a pity that I can't do it regularly,

Had subscribed to a course which supposed to have 7 days trial. But it costs $53.34. Content quality was very poor. Even the course teacher said in one lecture that do not expect much from that course as it was free! That's mean they are selling those poor free content for $48.99 to $53.34 . Did not expect such * business model.,
"Great online learning application due to it's amazing content quality and worldwide recognition. Also, they provide financial aid which is very helpful if you cannot afford their courses. Cousera is truly revolutionary in online learning space!",
"Poorly optimized app. It takes a lot of time to load, and crashes a lot as well. Bute please do keep up the great content!",
A really great app for learning courses I previously learnt IT on their web before now downloading the app.,
Add Bookmark functions to the courses.,
I love learning.Coursera is offering some free courses..i was learning new things thanks for that.. But everything was ok before the update.Now I recently updated the app I was in the final week of learning how to learn.But after update every data was gone.when i try to Login with my mail I'd which i already given but I was forgot the password there is no option to recover my account. Hope Coursera team will read this...,
"It has stopped suddenly and is showing connectivity issues when my connection is totally stable. I am already enrolled in courses but it's not showing, neither the courses nor my certificates!",
This app is the best for online learners,
I did an easy course on coursera. I was promised $150 if I finished it. So far I have not heard anything about them giving it to me. I was billed again even after finishing the coarse even though I'm struggling financially because of the pandemic. I never asked to do another course but I was billed anyway. Everytime I go to the help center they say they are experiencing high volume of chats so they can't help me. So I can't get refunded. And they won't give me the $150 they said they would,
The app has become incredibly slow. Each time I open a course the app hangs and stops working. It has become unusable.,
App crashes a lot on low end phones.,
Can't see the screen when paused.,
I love this Coursera because after completing the topics then complete assignment..,
"Stole my fb account and said it was an error. It says it doesn't work on Lolipop below but downloadable in KitKat!? Edit: Always doesn't work, I logged in my Google instead but it would seem the downloading always getting halted and doesn't get downloaded... Enrolled but it is always so slow.",
"Used to be way better. Most courses can't even be completed on the mobile app, you have to use Firefox for some assignments and that has bugs too.",
Coursera is a great app for use,
"Hi. There's some technical issue that I've come across, while reviewing peer assignment it tells me to check my connection despite havin good internet connection. I have updated it uninstalled it, yet nothingseems to work. Seems like the others are also facing the same issue. Please check upon the issue.",
"I haven't taken the course so I can not rate it. It sounds promising. First I would like Botany, Basic German, and Basic Spanish. One at atime as I can afford the courses. These are. Also after these studies I would like to study how to use internet better and a nother vocation on line. Rate you as promising.",
"No architecture? I'm really surprised that there is absolutely nothing (zero courses) on the topic of architecture. Meanwhile there are no less than 100 courses on anything related to a computer, software, or data. Just a thought. Add architecture courses.",
The courses are very helpful for the students who are looking for the courses in their field.,
"This app has been very instrumental to my career growth and it works well. I also like the fact that it allows download course materials so you don't have to get stuck. However, can it stop logging out my account often?",
great learning platform i enjoy and get a lot knowledge.,
This app has helped me learn a lot of courses really easily. It is convenient and informative. The availability of courses is infinte. I would recommend it to everyone I know.,
Opens browser for SSO then continues to work on browser. whats the use of this app then ?,
Coursera really helped me a lot in my career. The only problem with this is the video lagging when I'm watching the videos in offline or online also. Please fix that issue with the next upgrade. üôèüíïüôèüíïüôèüíïüôèüíï,
amazing and worth it!,
Coursera is one of the best learning platform I've come across and I really appreciate the MOOC intiative to reach on a global scale. I wish if I just knew about it before that would have been great. I'm very thankful to all the people who made existence of such courses available.,
Best app for having best courses from leading Universities....,

It's an affordable and user-friendly app. Course presentation and study materials are very up-to-date. Here every course is like a palatable dish!,
"It's true that Coursera is the best online platform. however, the app keeps on crashing, and it's really frustrating when one uses it on the phone.",

I subscribed to it with payment card details entered, completed first course and started with its first assignment on IBM cloud, I didn't receive any notifications, but after 7 day free trial nothing deducted from my card and I my subscription was inactivated without notice.

Easy to navigate interface,
This is the best learning environment so far. Coursera thanks for giving me another chance.,
"The course content, way of teaching, very impressive. Best learning opportunities if you want to learn about lean tools and it's implementation.",

"Dear team! Something went wront with transcription after the update of app. The transcription was independent of language of device and now isn't it, and it doesn't follow the video! (Android)",
"Thank you for the aid packages, and in the future try to integrate a virtual practical working environment.",
"very useful app for me. i have been using this for quite a long time, easy to navigate through my courses and downloading of videos for offline view are fast and easier",
The latest update just won't allow the lesson video to play. Something to do with the video player. Kindly fix this bug asap. Thanks,
"Previous versions had the cast option/button directly on the videos. That changes in the recent updates, which makes it less user friendly.",
"I am not able to verify my ID, in browser login it is not capturing image after clicking on ""take picture"" and in app it is showing ""couldn't access camera"" even though i had given permission to access the camera in app permission.",
"App is not mobile friendly...every time i try to access videos, it will automatically minimise. Also, i had many difficulties while submitting assignments. but in laptop, everthing works fine",
"Very good platform to learn , either on mobile or on Desktop. They have good client services and offer financial aid for certain courses to help others learn and develop themselves. Speaking of services , I appreciate their quick response when contacting for help .",
"We need more options in coursera inbuilt video player like 1.75 X speed and more audio quality options and the sound of every videos is that not much loud please work on these, I will change my ratings if the next update will resolve my all issues. Thank you",
"To the following, your app does not let me login: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign MCS Onboarding Discussion Board. Your app does not accept my Facebook login or my Coursera-associated email. More recently, today, I could not maximize my accessible Coursera video because it is breaking split screen without split screen even being on, and forcing inclusion into split screen, but I uninstalled this app.",
What's the point of allowing to download course videos if I want to watch them the video player tries to stream the videos anyway??? The only way is to put airplane mode so the app thinks I'm offline. That's awful programming in every way...,
"I am having difficulty loading a page in the discussion prompt with the course I'm doing the screen just has a circle appearing and disappearing , there is a printer icon on the page I clicked on it but there is nothing . Help please.",
quality courses. great app for learning,
This update seems better for me. It has reduced or solved the problem of hanging. Improved interface and easy to navigate. Thanks for the update üëçüëçüëç,
"Looks nice, but constant ""Oops something went wrong"" when trying to watch video lectures or ""retry can't load your data"" on courses makes this pretty annoying to use.",
You are awesome. Learnt so much from this. Flexible schedule and auditing the courses are really helping a lot (even though if you can't afford the course) Thanks a lot Coursera ‚ô•Ô∏è,
"Cant use the Verify My ID settings in both the web and mobile app. 1. Can't detect my camera in both mobile and laptop 2. After uploading my driving licence, it requested face detection/photos, and since it can't detect my laptop camera, it provides qr code, but when i scan the qr code, the mobile browser started process to upload by driving licence again 3.

Coursera is best platform to learn alot of skills which will help us in our career to achieve our goal. it's interface is good and it's faculty are quit good. over experience great. thank you Coursera for providing such knowledgeable and skillful courses.,
love it can easily switch from mobile to laptop and resume the course I am currently on,
"Best course app. At 1st, I was like... NO cuz I saw the price is $50 but it's also FREE to learn if u don't want a certificate. Very organized, easy to search for stuff",
"I have been using the app for about 3 years now and honestly, I enjoyed it at first but now, it does not load my courses. I have to wait minutes and minutes before my courses will load. It was not like this before. It was swift and very comfortable at first but not anymore",
Very pathetic very slow even in fast internet. Other apps work fine but Coursera keep loading to start when mobile locked and course loaded it start again loading. Coursera takes 10 mints to start which is really annoying. Slower than üê¢,
I must say it's really a great but It helped me a lot in my English and Korean of course at first I will I use this for Korean but later this app give me e Recommendation of other learning other languages other degrees except really like it and the teacher is so my associate professor teacher's awesome I also recommend to all the people who want to learn Korean English or any other language or degree subject I am really thankful to this app. I improved a loootttt.,

"I don't have any issue with the app but FREE COURSES ARE NOT FREE. At the end, exactly at the last submission of your quest the Coursera will demand dollars and if you won't pay your answers will not be submitted and the course will not end. So, you WON'T EVEN GET A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE. I just wasted 4 hours of my precious day.",
I'm grateful for having known coursera. I get to learn everything I put in mind,
"This app has made my learning very easy, I spend 12 hours at work and I have no access to a computer, however, with the help of this app I am able to push myself. I learn at work and write tests at work. I LOVE THE APP",
"In the middle of second course, my course is not showing in coursera app, I had write mail today but show server error symbol. I have to finish this course before september and you are delaying to complete this course before time. Please üôè solve my problem and give my course back. Thank you",
"After the last update I am not able to login to my account on this app. Where is the login page? I am trying to continue with my google account which is under my college administration but it says ""Google login error: the third party account is already linked with coursera account."" Does that even mean something?? And if it is linked than why am I not logged in ? I am regretting so much about updating this appüò¢",
"this is a very wonderful app to use, it is definitely making a difference in my career.",
Can't play videos on tablet. Just says oops can't play media player,
Really convenient and easy to use,
it contains a useful course which you could pay later. but it need to fix some issues in the app for example you couldn't find podcast which recommends you to listen to ot.,
Videos will not play without the play pause overlay. it's very annoying and makes it so you can barely see the video. Samsung Galaxy ZFold 4.,
I love how easy it is to navigate. And you don't have to do much to get where you wanna go. Ads are always a problem in anybodies eyes. The experience has been great though. So no complains from me. Good work guys,
"The new UI is pretty good, but why can't we rotate the screen to both sides in landscape mode. It would be much easier for me, to hold my mobile other way around.",
perfect studying style,
"If you want to unenroll from a course but can't, they do not tell you why you can't. Even after googling and using desktop I still had to deal with customer service until I was able to find out why. (I took a free course by the way).",
Sometimes the orientation changes from landscape to portrait by itself as we move to some tabs of app. Otherwise it is great to use.,
"The offline in app very good, I can learn when I need to learn without internet, Thank you Cousera ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíú",
I really don't have any problems with any of the course it's just some of them are really not up-to-date but that's not the fault of coursera. So great app and great interface.,
"The app is not optimised at all many features are available only on web and the worst part is in app downloading courses they never work it just gets stuck while downloading and never completes, please fix!",
"As a beginner, with no previous experience in the field of IT, I feel that I'm learning at a really good pace. the app is easy to navigate and the material that I've gone over in the beginning isn't daunting and it's very informative.",
"I'm not sure that whether this app can download courses I enrolled before or not ‚Ä¶ There is a new course I enrolled. Sadly, I found that the videos it contains can't be downloaded while reading materials were saved to my phone successfully. üò•",
Improve login and landscape mode. Sometimes I need to login into app again and again. Except videos rest of content doesn't go in landscape mode making hard to use on tablets. Plz resolve the issues,
"When I play the videos the setting layout doesn't disappear no matter what I do... Cleared the catch, tried to change video quality, Uninstalled and re-installed the app... And it is the same... Frustrated; please help.",
"One of the best MOOC platform so far. Great learning experience with great app features. Courses are free with paid certificates but one can audit for free learning opportunity. Just one suggestion, please add wishlist so one can enroll later if they want to without being searching for it.",
I just wanna say thank you üíù for seeing my aid application i am so happy i can't even describe it's just amazing. I wish you became one the best companies in the world thank you for changing my world.,
"Keeps exiting me out of courses I was looking at, difficult to find related courses when you've selected one, almost nothing is free and you cant even preview anything for free.",
Really good app for learning from basic to advance i hope new topic will be added more thank you.,
The app is great overall. For paid subscriptions can you plzzzzzzzz add Google pay. It will be soo helpful bcz along of people don't have a credit card or they don't want to share their credit card details.,
"The content is nice, but the videos had major lag & kept closing. I would like it more if I could bookmark courses or add them to my list to enroll later.",
Very good resource! üíØ,
Good ux tha helps you acquire useful skills with ease. and great free content to further your career. I liked the recommendations algorithm because it gives you relevant content to complement what you have studied.,
audio and certain volume levels / language translation of numerous professors is / are horrible. Sometimes captions do not match either. app also has tendency to continue logging out user,
it's not free it doesn't caption for all languages,
App has some serious problem. I can't start a video from where I left. Settings are also not get saved like in website. Also syncing between website and app is not good.,
Python console does not work completely on my app . I am unable to complete any quizzes due to that. I have to use the a browser for that which also provides challenges... I also feel that no one from Coursera even cares to respond which is quite unfortunate,
"App is wonderful. But it really need a ""wishlist/favourite"" tab when I want to save any course to do later. It will be more useful than that ""recommend"" tab you provide.",
I was billed after my 7 day trial had expired without notification and couldn't even get a refund. I didn't complete any course during this time or commit to taking a course. I wouldn't recommend this service.,
Incredibly slow and like an obstacle to learning. Worse yet it doesn't recognize tablets so have fun in portrait mode using a website designed for landscape. Really stunned by the Jank. Sticking with the website for now,
"One star. I cannot even use the app. Doesn't download the course, if choose ""Download course for offline Coursera use"" the whole app doesn't use internet because I turn on the function even if I enter with internet. My University do partnership with you but I cannot even use it.",
I am highly disappointed with this app this time . Out of nowhere i am logged out of my account and if i try to login the password is coming incorrect for that i tried to send a reset password email but then also i am unable to do so and eventually i am not able to log in my account .. This is very wrong ... Please help asap i need to log in my account immediately .,
"I liked the previous UI. This new UI reloades all cards each time I back to ""Learn"" tab which is very annoying. The previous Round shapes with course number was better.",
This new update has a lot of bugs. Completed courses would not be reflected. Resetting of deadlines are now resetting of courses as it wipes away previous accomplishments. Some videos do not load also,
It's the best platform for learning but somewhere I felt like there should be a extra faculty when the assignment is submitted to review that completely we have to depend on the other participants over there and assignment doesn't get reviewed for days and days and days and we have to wait just for single assignment which we already submitted and it has not been reviewed it is a very bad thing which I can tell that is lagging behind that is the reason I am giving a one star overall it's good,
"The app is great and is user friendly. I would give 5 stars if it also includes the ""save note"" option, that is present in the desktop version. Please include that soon. Otherwise, this app is great.",
"Good for learning on the go. But when I download lesson videos for offline viewing, my course summary does not update my progress since I watched the videos offline. would be great if students can update their progress after watching lessons offline",
"For me,one of the greatest features of coursera is the forums. The mentors are really active and they reply within a day. Also, the instructors are highly educated and they are the best in their field,whatever might be the course. Truly this is the best app in my phone",
"The app is very laggy. Certificates don't show. It logs out automatically and i have to log in each time, esp of i open the app after a few days. Kindly fix.",
Great overall. Give four cause issues. Though when colliding with them such as earlier reported delete all data from device settings and indeed reinstall from gplay. Their server mainly keeps the progresses saved.,
Please add notes to the app like the website. It helps a lot. Also make it not intuitive maybe? Like specifying the start and end easily.,
The app does not work properly on low speeds. It hangs a lot. Downloaded videos takes time to open. It sucks on lower speeds!,
Coursera is the best online learning platform that walks you through the steps to upskilling and acquiring new skills from the very beginning of a course in simple terms (baby steps) to a more complex concept . Thereby engendering a consolidated knowledge of the subject matter. Enroll today!,
"With the recent update, the video controls stays permanently on the screen. Pls adresss this fast its annoying and distracting as well. Thanks",
It's good.... But in the quizzes the option were not clearly visible. Only some few words are visible. We can't able to find the correct answer.,
"This app helped me relieve my post covid lockdown stress a lot! I could get a variety of standardised knowledge from all over the world through this platform. I got acquainted with some of the scholars, teachers, instructors etc.from the top ranking universities! Thank you Coursera !",
it a great platform that will help you improve your skills.,
Hello there I can not verify my ID and I tried several times and every time it tells me the photos are not clear and I made sure they are clear with good lighting and you are not letting me upload a scanned photo of it plus the security page says it expires in 1 hour but ot expires waay earlier than that .. I have no idea what to do now after I finished my courses to verify my cerftificate and I am very frustrated,
"It's completely awful, i can't update the latest version of it.",
"App works great on phone, but some component needs a bigger screen. Coursera Plus great value if you have the time to make the most of it.",
"Coursera it's an amazing app for learning online because it allows you to move at your own pace even if am not having that time to meet my studies,I still love the way they allow the students to practice some of the practical",
"This app is easy to use, includes many areas of study, and the price for classes is very manageable. It has also improved its features over time.",
the platform is beginner friendly and concepts are explicitly explained. Thank you for creating the enabling environment for learning new skills that are desirous of the global workforce.,
I wish I had known earlier. The best online learning app that I have used thus far. Easy to understand and exciting. short videos which is often straight to the point,
Cousera wouldn't rotate to landscape mode for reading lessons on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. And for video lessons some area on the left hand edge isn't visible on landscape mode. Please fix this!!,
Coursera is a great App. I encourage any postgraduate student like me should try to explore it. The learning experience is very exciting.,
I love the fact that even though you don't have enough funds to pay for a course you can apply for financial aid and you will be given the opportunity to study the course. Also the teachers try to make the teachings clear and always aim to bring it to the understanding of the students,
"I had delete the app as I wasnt able to access my cousrses, I hope there'll as I reinstall. Still having this issue, I'm unable to access my courses on my phone...üòë",
The courses are very good. I have the premium version also. But just because I don't have a surname they are not providing me with the certificates with my name. This is very sad.,
This is the only best place to learn . I thank the community as a whole. But app is currently not working on Android device in enrolling new courses. Pls üôèü•∫ do your best to working it out. Thanks Josey,
I am just one month late to complete my course.. for which i payed.... Now i have to pay more than i payed earlier to complete ... Like seriously ??? It's a way for you to make money ... ??. Please refund my old money ..i wasn't even half way through. Really bad experience with y'all,
it's amazing and you get to learn at your pace,
The app is amazing and each course is different. I like how it's separated into short lessons followed by quiz or pop up questions throughout lectures.,
"I have been stuck in my course because the images in one of my quiz is not displaying. I have been using the app and the website with recommended browser, however nothing has changed.",
"Hi developer, please add feature to download individual course videos just like you can on laptop. I'm the current app state we must download an entire week at once. Thanks. Great work",
"kept saying ""sth went wrong when playing the video"" n thus video can't even be played on the app the pdf provided also cannot be opened but content was gd tho(access via website)! pls fix the app issue thnks! problems have been occurring over 2 months now.....",
This app is so erritating us.because teachers are giving so many works in this app because for that we are so sad and we are going suiside attempt so don't download this app otherwise your life will Be in dead box. So don't download this app and spoil your life thankyou.,
"the playback controls cover the video and i cannot see anything, there is no tech support or anything to fix this, even the settings are not clear..",
Downloaded readings are saved without pictures. It is a major issue as I mostly use this app on commute. Also the picture quality isn't enough sometimes.,
"Very nice app, but because i couldnt do what I needed without i paying for the service, i decided to uninstall it. Sadly, after uninstalling it, it's blocked all my apps from being updated. Its uninstalled but still wants to update itself first in line and prevents all my other apps from updating. Please work on this!",
Being able to take my courses aisle free is amazing. Just one thing needs to be improved on: Allow assessments to be taken on the mobile app too. Thank you.,
Best App for professional online courses!,
"one of the best app you can ever find for learning new skills or for improving your skills. however,after updating the app i got some serious issue regarding login and i can not even login to my own account.The ridiculous thing is that i can not even change my password by ""forget password"" option from their link provided via gmail.They updated app to improve security and bug fix.So, i wonder how you improve your security?",
"I just updated the app and I'm getting this prompt ""We had trouble loading your data. Retry"". My internet connection is stable and before the update, I had been on the app without any problems.",
Its a great app for learning from top universities even by staying within your own country. It has a verywide range of study materials and choices. It really is a good educational app.,
"Since latest update, quizzes no longer work on mobile. Basically, the app is only good for viewing videos and text while other work needs to be done via browser.",
"Loving the multiple platforms capability. Videos are clear, love the text that goes along with the videos. Convenient enough to use around my busy work schedule",
Very nice edtech platform,
This app is really good for wanting to learn short courses and prove it with a certificate after completing and passing so i can add it on my resume. Im taking online vet tech classes through penn foster 2 year program but i want to work some where relevant to animals until i finish this 2 year degree and courseras free animal welfare and animal behavior class gives me that extra knowledge to apply to jobs with a little more experiance relevant to the job i want until im finished with school.,
This is irritating when I choose video quality to low sound quality is also reduced. Sometimes can't even understand as sound quality is so disturbing. Please fix this.,
Everything worked until your latest update. The video keeps lagging behind the voice and its not working properly. Please make it usable.,
I loved the idea behind this app and was really happy to get a hold of it but I dont know why it keeps on crashing. I have started a course but it started crashing after just 5 mins,
Currently the progress done on the mobile app is not in sync with the web application. I completed a week excercise on mobile but they are not showing completed on PC(web application).,
This is the best app for anyone keen to learn new things,
"Worst Dont waste a single penny in this app, Coursera is worst of the teaching platform in the whole internet. Even udemy worst courses are far better that courseras best course. They dont teach U anything they give exersises and say u to figure out at ur own. I wished i had given my money to charity or somewhere else before spending it on this course. Just waste of my Time and Money",
good understanding of topics.. it's really helpful,
Kindly Help on This issues... I updated my application Now. All my records of week 1 to week 4 has been wiped out... All the way from program 2 which I have reached 80+ % I'm only seeing 4%. I don't know what to do.,
"I updated this app today and it's been terrible so far. It's the only app that stops midway, loads till eternity and just unresponsive.i was trying to download a course and it stopped midway. The old one was way better",
Great platform for learning.,
The best online platform to learn something new!,
Interesting way to learn and build professional knowledge,
"The app has stopped working in Android 4.4 Kitkat. My tablet can't be upgraded to a newer Android version. Also, it is not possible for me to purchase a new device every time for Apps to run.",
"Love The AUDIT COURSE option & That's The BEST USP for this App. ThankYou So MUCH for Providing an Option to Freely LEARN. Also, The QUALITY of APP (UI Design) & Content QUALITY is MUCH MORE Appreciated & It's The BEST Learning App . (Better than UDAMY or SkillShire) I think that YOU MUST add the 144p or 240p Option as MOST People WANT to Use Limited Data (Especially INDIANS like ME). So, We Spend MOST of Time on YouTube. I'M saying That Do It ONLY If Possible.Thanks AGAIN for the Audit OPTION.",
"it would be too good if every course in it go free or require a little amount of money... anyways, it is really a good platform to learn something at its very best .... thank you coursera family .....",
"After upgrading, Videos on app always have the navigation buttons displayed. I can't remove them and hence cannot watch the video properly. Mobile is Huawei P30.",
Technical issue: Some text in some courses is out of the page. Some questions in quizes are only showing one line and the rest of the question is hidden! Please solve ASAP.,
Customer service is appallingly nonexistent. I don't like shady dealings like this. I tried canceling my subscription and they keep billing me.,
"The app is very good and the courses on this app are very nice, but since from last few days means since last update my assignments are not getting uploaded so lots of time is wasted. So please fix it as soon as possible.",
I love the app. It is great. But I would like to suggest a feature of addidng courses I like in favorite section. And there were minor bugs. But everything else is fine.,
Learning so much from Coursera.,
I am liking every bit of the course material and classes,
"I love the app but it has issues with syncing my offline progress with my online progress. So when I watch some videos offline and I go online, it tells me that I haven't watched the videos yet. Please fix this",
Those s one of the best apps I came across the only issue is I am not able to unenroll from a course I applied for through financial aid. I couldn't find the option to unenroll either on webpage or app. And Thank you for providing so my people such wonderful opportunity.,
"My experience with Coursera so far has been splendid! But I gave 4 stars because of one feature that's always requesting to use a laptop (larger screen). Aside from that, they're really good üëç",
I would like to give minus 5 stars. This is a huge rip-off and a giant scam. They fraudulently charged me membership fees with no way to contact them or get help. Absolutely distressed trying to reach them for days. Don't even think of downloading this app.,
"Video pauses to buffer making for a frustrating experience. Some sections rotate into portrait mode, which is undesirable on tablets!",
New update is not eazy to use. I must change language in my mobile for this app to show transcription but transcription is not the same previously update. It's hard to see and know that where I am. Please bring back the previous version.,
A excellent App to learn concepts clearly..,
Good course for fundamental peocess,
It would be nice if in sharing this information that it could lead to networking or a jo offer,
"Whenever I used to watch the online lessons, the app would suddenly start to pop things out of nowhere due to which it is impossible to concentrate on the lesson. Please try to fix this asap.",
"I am doing a course in coursera and it has some quizzes in between whenever i am trying to submit it , its asking me to upgrade and once i am clicking on upgrade ,it is showing error due to which my course is incomplete Kindly help",
mobile friendly app,
The problem when I open flash files is that you can't really see the file clearly. It looks like the photos are highligthed and the main texts are to dim or blurry to see.,
"It's actually great but for almost a month now I'm having an ANNOYING problem with POSTING MY ASSIGNMENTS. No matter if I write my assignment on the COURSERA PLATFORM or write it somewhere else and PASTE it there, it uploads as a LONG LIST of words WITHOUT any PARAGRAPH BREAKS. It's getting FRUSTRATING as people AREN'T INTERESTED in giving REVIEWS now. Even if I post a Google Doc link of my assignment, it's NOT ACCESSIBLE.... I've tried to reach you many times. PLEASE HELP!!!!",
"I'v been using this app for a few weeks now but suddenly today, it's not loading my data. Every time I try to load my data, it says there was an error loading my data. Plz fix this as soon as possible.",
"Wow i'm having a fantastic time in here. learning Digital Marketing in Coursera is the best way to start this year 2023. I'm super excited. The courses are not difficult to navigate, well simplified. Thanks Google and Coursera",
One of the best ways to upskill myself. I love Coursera!,
Great app for effective online learning.,
"After today updating my app , download are not seen.",

really very excellence for learning English,
A remarkable experience at Coursera!,
"Awesome app to learn online courses specially google cloud associate engineer track. And I could not notice which video quality range(144p/360p/480p/720p) is playing, please highlight or add radio button in selected video quality option(Auto/Low/Medium/HD/).",
I signed up for the Coursera Plus for a year on 30th Sept 2022. I went to cancel the auto renewal in case I forget to do it in the future. Coursera decided to remove my Coursera plus subscription! Hello! I've paid for the whole year already!,
I am applying for financial and mail is recieved that your submission is accepted. But after that when I check in the app the course didn't show,
amazing for learning,
The Google courses on this platform are absolutely amazing!,
good platform to learn emerging skills and upgrade your career,
Excellent team and the app. Helpful team of Coursera. The customer support is excellent that they helped me by removing bugs on app quickly by responding via emails. Thank you.,
This is undoubtedly the best self learning platform.,
App is very nice for learning new skills With diffrent courses. From our college we got subscription of Coursera for three months that's really beneficial for us to join course free of cost. That's amazing,
"has always been great, an awesome experience and great learning all around. the platform is excellently designed and easy to use. 10 stars.",
"I cannot open my coursera, my wifi is blocked. Turned off the wifi and tried using cellular data and i can open. I dont know why my IP is getting blocked by coursera. Currently enrolling to a course and need to finish immediately, and cant even cancel subs since i cannot log in to the coursera.",
It was a really great app before the last updating. But now it almost doesn't work. I can't review my peers' works and the app freezes all the time.,
This a very helpful app for learning new things including new languages. It may take some time but at last your very fluent in the language you are learning. I recommend installing this app as you can pass your time in learning something new instead of doing nothing. üòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú‚åö‚åöüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú,
"The downloaded courses (audit) keep hanging , I means the videos . Pls do something about it. That's has been happening since you changed the colour option of ""GO TO COURSE"" from green to blue.",
"Not full experience with the apps Sadly there are key functions not available in the app but only in the web version, first of all the possibility to take notes",
I cant even get student support for problems with completion marks there is no easy to find support chat. And apparently if you complete your stuff to fast to save money they push the next series of courses start date back to keep you paying more.,
I already purchased 1 course and as I was not able to do it for some time and now when I am trying to start it they are again asking to purchase. I tried to contact on help centre but they are not even taking my complaint I did course before as well it wasn't like this ever turning in to bad service.,
"Coursera provides a wonderful opportunity to learn relevant knowledge in a well designed course format.Many of these courses ,can be completed free of cost or the learner can pay a small fee and get the certificate of completion.New skills can be learnt, which can increase the employability of the learner just by using the internet for education instead of depending on it for entertainment.",
One of the best online certification and educational site with best faculties and courses.,
This is the best app for learning. Thank you coursera.,
very informative..I learned a lot,
Hii... I was doing three courses of three weeks in this app. The courses are really very good. But the problem is after completing three weeks course. I'm not able to submit the last answer page's it's not able to enroll it... Because of that I'm not able to get my certificate. So what is the use of doing this course. I'm will not suggest it's to other's. I'm sorry for this üòîüòîüòî,
Excellent to use for professional courses,
Great way to earn certification for something that you want a career in. Easy way to learn on your own time. No major wait for classes to start. Peer learning as well. Support is there if needed as well.,
High educative app. Hope more people can trust that the knowledge gotten here is not undervalued,
Always get errors when starting to play video. Still get errors after exit or reload. Stop playing videos half way without any touch. Some contents are not available.,
"Great app , download for better future",
I am currently just downloading this app and I hope I will not be disappointed but I just wanted to leave a comment to those people who are complaining that there is no where to write notes. Have they never heard of a pen and paper. If you are watching videos for 4 hours why would you not have a pen and paper ready just in case u do need to take notes. Would u not take a pen and paper into a classroom or lecture hall for a lesson that takes longer than half an hour. Simple but effective solution,
SCAM COMPANY. READ THIS BEFORE DOWNLOADING. They tell you that you are paying for 3 months and then they stop the access to the course 2 days earlier. You have to pay 1 month fee again to access the course to get your hard earned certificate.,
Coursera simplify teaching.....,
"Love Coursera, hate the app. There's so many bugs in it that make it completely unusable at times or at the very least incredibly irritating.",
"Cannot Enroll. I have used the app for a while now ,and am unable to enroll in a course as the loading button ,does not allow me to enroll making it frustrating to use . I have updated my device and the app and there has been no difference in the issue .",
Coursera is the best place to learn relearn and unlearn anything that cross your mind. one can easily gain a certificate from renown University without physically visiting the campuses.,
best platform to learn high value skills.thank you Coursera,
"After updating to the latest version, I can not log into my account with my mail address. Login button does not seem to work!!! I keep pressing it but no effect. Is this your ""more secure login"" system?",
"I thought I could watch my lectures on this, and they work, but i can't do any if my tests cuz it cuts off the screen and doesn't show all the questions. Major bummer.",
"Great and exceptional app!! The instructors and videos are easy to understand. Coursera is full of knowledge and am glad to be a partaker, courtesy ingressive for good network.",
"Since I downloaded about two weeks ago, I haven't been able to use this app. Always saying offline and check your internet connection. Every app on my phone works just fine, only this app.",
"No longer views me as online. Doesn't matter if I'm on Wifi, or 5G.. Doesn't matter if I'm on my Phone, or using the Chromebook app. And your Contact US page sucks for trying to get a hold of anyone to actually fix a problem.. Not very user friendly for stuff like that I'm disappointed.",
The app is very slow and frustrating I've been using it for a short period and all of a sudden it stops loading my courses. Its so annoying,
"I'm being charged for something that I haven't even used! I can't cancel the subscription, nor can I speak with anyone! The worst! Run! Don't bother with this.",
"this is a very great app, I love it and would recommend it.",
"Just perfect, but I would recommend to fix the issue related when you are through a downloaded video which has a Quiz on it, since it doesn't appear.",
I entered payment options and started the course but received only the trial version. The subscription didn't automatically start after the trial period. I'm unable to complete the course,
It is convenient for staying on mobile,
awesome. learning on the app is a lot more cool than the web browser,
"I was learning MATLAB programme. Recently before 2 days, it went offline .. I could not able to prepare for this week .. kindly make sure you get online back. All around - Coursera has a beautiful platform for Digital learning :))",
The worst UI to ever exist. Isn't in sync with with the website. Absolute pain to navigate. It has great courses but the UI is very bad,
The app has crashed and was showing errors since yesterday. I uninstalled it and tried to install again but failed to do till now. This has affected my on going course progress.,
"This is an incredibly buggy app. It crashes frequently, doesn't allow the user to perform actions they should be able to do, and makes it impossible to complete some assignments.",
"Horrible refund policy.  My state requires a 30 day refund for payments, but I can't even contact them to raise the issue. Let it slip a day and they will not offer a refund, you can't even find a contact to ask.  It is impossible to find a contact for help on the site or in the app.",
"Using Coursera is very advantageous and beneficial for anyone with a growth and value mindset. It has enhanced greatly the need to gain knowledge flexibly, effectively and efficiently.",
Not able to login. I am trying since last 2. Always show error (accountlinkedtosocialaccount) I have tried by Facebook and e-mail but same error. Please update the app or do something. Works well in web.,
it's really helpful to learn and grow,
"All is good except peer graded assignment system......Some peers do not even know the topic and give less marks....Some students really work hard to prepare assignments, but after submitting that assignment if illiterate peers give less marks, it really becomes frustrating for them. Assignments should be graded by respective professionals, why peers ?? I did not expect this from coursera.",
"Coursera is the best application for online teaching and better than any offline classes in my opinion.One of the best content in form of videos,reading and lab is provided here.Teachers are extraordinary and teaches very well.Courses are very informative and teaches you from scratch..Best wishes and start learning right now with talented teachers Thank you coursera!",

"I'm very glad to this application how it help my knowledge, this give me a chance to be self learner",
"nice job, very nice but can be better. will send in suggestion later",
Best to learn about the subject which you want to learn,
Very helpful so as to sink even more deeper what you have learned,
"i was not interested in any of the course's i was just trying a course ""python for everybody"" . It asked for a transaction method i added my mom's debit card. But after 3days of classes i didn't like them. But today i get a message saying that i have bought the ""python for everybody"" for inr 3515 and i can't get a refund. please kindly refund the money.",
easy to follow and very informative,
"Great learning app, I highly recommend",
This app is amazing. i learn alot from it,
"It's better if you use it on a regular laptop or desktop computer but using it on a tablet or iPad or any mobile device you won't get the same satisfaction you would get on a laptop or desktop computer. I have had my share of issues using it from my Android app on my tablet. If you can, use it on a computer.",
I love learning from coursera.,
Th platform is quite efficient and seamless,
"Coursera is a criminal organization. Took a course for which the lab tool broke half way through (going on 2 weeks now and not fixed yet). They refuse to refund my money or credit me time due to the delay. The course is 90% labs and they keep telling me to do what I can until the tool is fixed. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. The fact is Coursera cares about profit, you learning or not learning is of no concern to them as long as you pay.",
Best courses ever ‚ù§Ô∏è,

Its the best app for learning.,
Paid for a course and it doesn't work! I can't move past the practice quiz because when I do. It says it's locked. I can't do the practice quiz. Because of faulty template or link. THIS APP IS A SCAM TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!,
Excellent Application I have learned more & more things from coursera,
best educational app ever,
it's a great learning app,
Great courses- but dreadful indexing and search engine prevents you from finding them! I've spent a day trying to find Russian language courses. Filters are not explained. If I select 'Russian language' is that the language of delivery or the topic?,
this is usefull for learning English speaking and many more things thank you Coursera aap,
"ReWi app for The Science of Well Being not working. The Science Of Well Being has now disappeared from my Coursera app. I've received no acknowledgement about completing the course. I paid for a certificate. I want it. I'm in India in a small village. Laptop NOT available. If pre/post happiness assessments are so important, fix your tech problem. I took them both. I now know not to pay Coursera a dime. No support. No reply emails are useless.",
amazing...learning core principles at free or subsidized rates.,

"Absolutely pathetic! I cannot view my assignment. I cannot view the peer reviews I received. The app SUGGESTS that it will be better to use a big screen device. But, if I cannot access my course, can't proceed further through this app, what good is the app for ?",
This is cool. Helping me learn project management basic.,
"The application worked perfectly until new update. After update 3.14.0 version, the videos are playing buggy. So annoying. Continuously stopping.",
It is a very good app however i find difficulties specifically when i go thru the pre downloaded content some images √†re not visible and have to reconnect with the server.,
Coursera helps you to boost your career with additional valuable skills.,
No difference between medium and high quality when playing lecture videos on my tablet. I can watch them perfectly on my laptop or smartphone but on my Lenovo tab m10 plus (FHD resolution & widevine L1) videos seem to be on SD.,
This app is a trash! Multiple times it's asking for relogin and also showing tons of never ending recapcha. This is most annoying app ever. Didn't expected such a trash from coursera.,
Slow to load even on fast connections. Crashes frequently. Slow to update completion status. Has great potential though.,
"The app was all fine, but I updated and now there's a glitch in videos, they are not smooth anymore and this sucks. I hope this problem is solved soon.",
This app doesn't have an option to access the runestone features like daily practice and all. It redirects In a browser which always says you are not logged in even though I have. Pls rectify this bug ASAP,
it's quite easy to use and very helpful as well,
Very good platform to learn. Please introduce dark theme. It would be amazing if we could take the graded quiz on the app.,
"coursera is one of my fav website for learning but its android app is not working on my smartphone. whenever i download the app and opens it, then it always shows network error, even if my internet is working properly. please fix this issue",
Couldn't send a request to change my password due to some error so I tried to log in with different passwords several times. When I opened the web verion it turned out that I'm temporarily banned because of the amount of requests...,
I would highly recommend this app because it's really useful for every each student in whichever stream. It's makes you feel confident to study hard and put you to study more to gain your knowledge.,
Hey!! Coursera uses a very low standard face recognition 3rd party app. And also the article about the problem which I'm facing of not verifiying is missing in help centre. If anyone in coursera read this please resolve my this issue. Thanks,
Please fix the app! I'm paying good $$$ for the quality content but every time I'm looking at videos on my phone I have issues where they suddenly stop playing and I can't resome.,
I am very disappointed. Ui/ux course content was not worth paying my money. Both phases had irrelevant data.,
Just love the content. Especially machine learning by Andrew NG it's just the best course for a beginner in the field. The best part is it's free of cost and the content is of high quality.,
"It's a wonderful opportunity for learners not only for a part of a world but for the entire people, those are interested to learn at any place, anytime and any areas of professions they want to learn. amazing!",
"Well, an accredited master degree opportunity, as advertised, is worth the chance at its investment cost, even if failure. I am unsure if one can get the experience thats needed in just an online level, but stand by for official review.",
"Many times the Courses activity shows that I have not enrolled in any course although searching and going to the course shows that I am enrolled. And, maths expressions do not load at all in the assignments.",
"I just finished a course and when I got back to the app a few hours later , it is starting right from the first . All that I completed is vanished. Very disappointed",
"love the app, but i've been constantly getting ""error occurred while accessing quiz"" when trying to submit my quiz answers. (currently enrolled to only one course - not sure if error's present in other courses!)",
"Not able to open the application. Crashes as soon as it opens again and again. Tried clearing cache, uninstalling it everything.",
Please don't waste your time downloading this nonsense app. I tried to do a course for free and they were trying to force me into buying the course by saying that of I want to get the results of my Quiz I will have to pay for it. Please fix this issue and make the app better.,
"The app not properly work. When it take my ID then a message appear rotate my device, I rotate but it was not detect my device rotated. Overall software feature is worth.",
I just downloaded it and l put my details but once l tick the boxes in regards to T&C and email l press continue and nothing happends. It doesnt open at all. I tried various time but doesnt work!!,

Not able to login through organization account. Issue is when select login via organization. It is routing to browser to give company credentials. Login is success but it is not returning to app to browse course. Still asking to login. Fix this issue,
The experience and versatility of this app is exactly the same as the website. Oh and i love how all the progress and data sync on actual time both in the website & the app,
the app is so nice.. you can study at any time and anywhere,

Great! You can complete most of your courses using the mobile app if we're talking about lectures and simple quizzes.,
The app is indeed very good but one major problem in this app is that the course mates don't take the review to peers assignment seriously They do not review it correctly and many of my assignments is left unchecked....due to which I lost my interest,
"I am not able to download for offline view. Whenever I start it, it stops in the middle and then doesn't resume. Please fix as I have unstable internet connection!!",
"I love coursera but the app is terrible. Won't load the courses I am currently enrolled in, can't type in the text box for discussion post. Won't load videos without crashing the app.",
best way of learning,
It's been a smooth experience until this month. I've not been able to submit my Quiz. It keeps showing error.. and my due date is 23 March. Please is there any advise the technical team can help me with...,
"Recommend everyone this app. This made my studying easy. I can download lecture videos, notes through this app. And I can mark deadlines of quizzes and assignments.",
"For an educational app, it has a very poor user experience. No accessible contact support and the prices keep showing in $ and not in my local currency (Naira). Poor user experience!",
easy to do my courses on my phone while I'm away from home.,
After the recent update videos are not playing smoothly. I can't watch them with my focus. It's very irritating. Please solve this problem asap.,
It's good learning app. Kindly allow the feature to pause/play the video along with Bluetooth headset.,
Great app and opportunity,
this is very nice for learning new things,
Can't sign up at all. It keeps telling me to check my connection but even after I changed my internet provider i still can't sign up. Clearly there is something wrong with this app.,
"Please give the feature of downloading subtitles in the application. You've it on the website. Once we download the course, we need subtitles to watch a course video. Thank you",
"I lost all my enrolled courses. It shows you have not enrolled any course yet. Also, it is showing we had troubling opening your data when I'm exploring new courses. Please fix this issue ASAP.",
Answer options in quizzes can't be properly seen when using the app. A big disappointment as it's my only way to complete courses on Coursera right now.,
I love their concept! Specially the provision of getting a financial aid if someone is keen to learn but can't afford. This purely proves that the idea behind is simply more than just making money. Kudos!,
"While playing video the intials in video player (backward, play pause , forward)initials are not removing and full screen with only video and subtitles is not coming.",
"Really disappointing, lots of videos are not working, they just keep repeating around the first 8 seconds and just go in a loop till eventually I give up and go to the laptop to proceed with my course",
"Great app, really works well with the course material, and the captions that are displayed beneath videos are very user friendly.",
very effective learning,
This is a very good app for learning no doubt about it. The battery is drained like a bullet train if any download content is being played. Otherwise one of best if not the best.,
The app keeps glitching every time. The videos glitch too after every 3 seconds. It is terrible for someone trying to learn. Worst experience.,
Really really disappointing 1) Web version show the course is free and when i check in app it's not 2) web version has badge free but now both apo and web version don't have that badge 3) now they are charging fir everything like for enrolling in any course . .... They are not what they used to be sad ü§ê,
Video position should be saved including of videos from the completed course. In fact I should be able to continue watching from where I left from any course what so ever.,
The video starts breaking if it is paused and then played again. Makes it impossible to watch videos properly.,
Quizzes in the courses are not opening. It keeps loading and the main quiz shows error message on opening even though the Internet connection is good. How to fix this issue?,
"Video control overlay does is permanent. It used to automatically fadeout with seconds but since the new update, the overlay stays permanently.",
The leadership course is so rich and impactful.,
"I can't update the app, tried everything but useless. I don't want to uninstall it because I downloaded some courses and I don't want to lose them and download again ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it was working fine before the update üôÑ",
"The layout is broken. The course titles of recommendation and the line ""you can join the course whenever you're ready"" overlap.",
I'm Not able to verify my ID as its button is irresponsive in the website and in the application it just goes onto a blank screen which loads nothing more. Kindly sort out this issue soon.,
"Turning off the video subtitles must be an option. They're mostly wrong, and obscure the content like equations.",
"Love Coursera, but the android app on my Tablet doesn't feature the transcript for my class when I am on the material. Please add this. Thank you so much for your valuable time and service. Keep up the great work",
"Once you click in Login page , the application begins to display double blinking images. This is a bug. Please resolve. Thanks.",
Superb experience with the app.,
"I downloaded videos to watch offline. Unfortunately, when I logged in again after few minutes, I couldn't find downloads anymore. Useless app, defeats the purpose.",
I am no able to login with organization.. Everytime it shows that signin failed because of network error.. Even i have full speed data network in my phone. Kindly do the needfull.,
"I love it, it is very helpfull and knowledgeable. Thank you so much! God Bless.üíúü•∞üôÇ",
"The app is easy to use but after the last updating, there is a problem in showing the multible answer , the answer is not showing fully, just a few words available so I can't choose the right one.",
I like the fact that this app show explainations in video and writing . wish it also had audio in writing.,
The app isn't optimised for tablet use AT ALL. Can you please at least make sure it can work 100% of the time in landscape mode?,
Doesn't work properly with tablets. Hard to locate courses already in the middle of on the website. Updated 6 months later. 1-star rating remains due to app having issues on tablets,
this is good for learning,
"I'm using this app since 2019.It's really awesome.When I tried to open some video by searching on Google for online course, due to some technical problem in my phone I didn‚Äôt open it,but using this app,I overcome the problems successfully.",
I downloaded the app then discovered a warning that it can make phone calls without my permission which may result in charges. I couldn't find a way to prevent that so I uninstalled it. Pity as I was looking forward to using it.,
This is one of the best apps I have ever seen. I really like the financial aid system. If you do not have much money to pay for the course then you can apply on financial aid system. They will allow you to do the courses freely. SO I highly recommend this app :),
"Capturing photo to verifiy ID is not working properly. Capturing is always blurred and has no option to focus. When app is used, the camera is not working and the permission to camera is not available.",
"very bad payment procedure, I subscribed for free trial. After one week without my notice and any information amount has been suddenly debited. Finally the worst thing is not even a proper channel to enquire about. I lost my amount.",
"You should add more landscape orientation to the app. And when tuning the video, the subtitle seems to mismatch with the content.",
Learning is a gradual process and Coursera is determined to teach everyone ready to learn. That's brilliant,
I signed up on my phone. My laptop wouldn't let me use it there. There is no way to get that straightened out. There is no way to contact them about app problems. I had to drop the course. Coursera gets a zero in my book.,
The new update is terribly bad.The video lags like anything and there is hardly any sync between the subtitles and the video. Please fix this soon team!,
"It is has many advantage for both students and non students,it is an awesome app to use it is quite educative in every field. Also it should be 1 top free education on play store.",
"Since I had updated my app, it constantly showing error while solving the assignments. It's getting so inconvenient that I have to use laptop just to do my assignments. Plz resolve it asap. Otherwise it's a best app, easy to use.",
Total waste of time. There is no button to purchase or start the course. I can view all course titles.,
This app has really been helpful to me in many ways. Also I have learnt a lot more through Coursera than in school and college. Really thankful for the team of Coursera and all the universities aligned with them üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè,
This most recent update made it so the app no longer could play offline downloaded classes. The only time I can study is during my commute - so this effectively means I can no longer use Coursera :(,
I'm facing terrible issues of broken links for ID verification. My certificate is pending to be downloaded and the verify my id option keeps restarting itself rather than accepting the documents. Absolutely terrible...,
clean ui. dark mode support is needed,
helping my course especially now that I'm in uni philosophy is a dream come true üò≠üò≠üò≠,
Its player crashes.it is inconsistent when playing the media. Even teh downloaded content keeps buffering. This was not the issue in previous versions.please resolve this .,
"I didn't have experience i except from coursera app. It has many errors and bugs. Not loading videos, quizes in the right way, and even that your browser not support, but im using the app...",
"Love the courses offered because they don't feel like recycled material that you could find elsewhere, too... and also encountered excellent customer service from them! Highly recommended.",
"Very well made application. Well thought out, not just a ripoff of the desktop version. Things flow really well in the mobile version.",
"They give oudated lessons. For example, in git, they give instructions that it is not there anymore and you get lost and can't keep up with the lessons.",
The courses would be great but many features don't work on the app and you need a computer to access which makes the app pointless.,
"While the app is free, and some of the courses are free, you need an account just to access it all... and accounts cost $40 USD every month. Very misleading.",
The contents offered are awesome. Instructors are really good at teaching making things easier to understand.One of the best platform to learn new skills...,
The app is amazing and I was really enjoying it but now there's some type of problem and I can't play any of the videos anymore. Or open anything on the courses,
i finished a course on this app and i submit it for five times without being rating. it happend tp me the fist time and i couldn't solve the problem i send so many reports and i didnt get any answer so i used another email the problem is the same i submitted all the quiz but i can't get my certificate,
App is very user friendly for browsing and selecting course. It should have contain feature of add to favourate or wishlist option so that after completing one course we wont be searching for other,
"Even after update, extremely frequent crashes. Midway watching videos it throws me back to the home screen of the app. Really frustrated.",
"I like the quality of the videos. Also, the reading materials are very understandable and simple. It's a good way to spend my work from home, more effectively and fun.",
The last update has messed up the interface. Shows error every time i try to open quizzes. Cannot skip to next video directly. Was working fine till last update,
The app is very useful and very good. However speaking from the app perspective... The app heats up my phone really bad and drains my battery easily. You guys must do something about this issue,
The formulas in the assignment section arw not at all readable. I installed this App after trying all 4 major browsers. Here also they are not legible. There is no way to get help also!,
Love the app! A suggestion though: I hope Coursera puts a favorite button so we can save courses we like. I want to keep tabs on topics I'd like to enroll in later.,
Application is full of bugs. I wrote a huge paragraph for some assignment and when the screen auto rotated all of my typing disappeared. Had to type it all over again.,
Nice platform but too expensive even with monthly. I liked the old pay model where I could purchase a course without having to pay monthly or yearly.,
Literally not possible to write in the text box in discussion prompts. Doesn't work with embedded audio files of the course material to play through the app too.,
"The application isn't functioning, it keeps saying there isn't an internet connection. I tried many connections but it's still the same. Please fix it ASAP. My phone is Xiaomi Redmi Note7.",
Fantastic course selection that will amaze you with it's diversity and ability to take your favorite classes for free if you don't want to be grad ed or get a certificate.,
"Nice, however I've seen a lot of courses for other languages and yet German it's not one of them. Would be nice to have a German course for beginners for free.Dispite that it's a nice and fine app.",
Your app freezes more than liquid nitrogen. Very bad and stupidly sticky. Spend more than 5 minutes just to scroll through courses because the app is freezing up and super frustrating. So annoying and frustrating.,
"The app seems to have problems with uploading the assignment section and also the peer review is not updated after its completion, missed my failing grade of a course that was 100 percent done.",
The coursera app made it easy to access the course from any where. I finished many modules while travelling. The app interface is great as well. Thanks Coursera !,
I can't access the podcasts. It's really frustrating. I search for the download button meant to be attached to each video and there's none. Otherwise it's a great learning app.,
"Really a superb app during quarantine, with lots of free courses...but i am sad that certificates or a bit costly and unable to afford...but really the true fact is I enjoy learning with coursera..Thank you for free courses",
Useful app. Cannot bookmark courses & progress don't upgrade real-time. Overall experience isn't as good as using desktop version.,
Oops something went please check your network connection. i face this constant issue inspite of giving all permissions and turning on data connection with full speed. Please fix it,
"I m having a good time with Coursera, as most of the content is available for free, you just need to pay for certificate, that too if u want to have one. Their prices are absolutely reasonable.",
"Great app for learning. lecture are awesome, clear and to the point . But faced issue after downloading video . They start lagging. Please resolve this issue.",
"While Coursera as a platform itself is good, the app sucks. Half of my finished courses don't show up in achievements, same with the ongoing courses I'm enrolled in. Always a pain to use the app",
"Not good. The app malfunctions sometimes, and it delays to synchronize with the course development. It needs more development.",
"Other things r OK. But , in Quiz , there is no scroll bar in options of some questions , so the full text is not visible. I lost marks due to that üòë",
It has performance issues i am doing a course and i have completed from my sight i have completed the peer review assignment but in grades tab it shows assignment not submitted when i open the assignment to check it says assignment submitted it is happening only in mobile not on web or not on laptop and also I can't attempt discussion prompt in any course if I am on android I am typing what and its showing hawt seriously? kindly fix these issues also mobile app is slower than web version,
"I started a course, the video player is looping video and sometimes not playing properly. cannot go through a course video.",
Progress (green tick) is not saved after a lesson is completed. I have to use browser version instead. Fix it please.,
Doesn't work. Input email and password then to login but the login button isn't working. Every other button on the screen works except for login... The most important one.,
I have signed for some coureses on coursera app but when it comes to assign my work in workshop there is some error shown every time and i cant upload my assignment file please fix the issue because of that i am not able to complete my course and get grades thank you.,
"Coursera is an excellent app, easy to use and efficient. Coursera has been immensely beneficial to my personal and professional development.",
Well the point is why have an app when a lot of courses when you click on them just opens the browser on my phone... SERIOUSLY SO THE RESULT OF A WORLDWIDE collection of universities cannot make a good app out of their app! Yea I do claim I am smarter than all their logic combined since that logic is just beyond stupid.,
Crashes too often. Even after downloading content it doesn't work well when offline. Disappointing.,
I have been doing a module for a week and found the app very easy to use and come in and out of different exercises and videos. It is a great learning platform.,
Very helpful app. I have done many courses and it has helped me with my Minor Specialization. I have benefitted a lot from this app and have learnt a lot of skills and knowledge. Thank you so much for this app. Worth everything. Thank you,
"My app is lagging during playing the videos of a course, whether online or dowloaded. Please fix the lag of the videos. Phone also gets heated up quickly.",
The app is great but they are many issues on the app such as Certificates not appearing on the achievements eventhough I have cometed multiple courses and only 1 certificate appears on the app. Hope this will get fix,
it seems you cant save notes on the videos as with the regular desktop version. therefore it is useless to me as i rely on these notes for study.,
Unstable. I can't take quizzes because the app keeps freezing and crashing. Video works fine though.,
Please put in a way to bookmark/wishlist courses/specialisations that one is interested in. It is ridiculous that one has to audit or subscribe to a course before having it show somewhere easier to go back to,
"I could select text in transcript and video will jump to that point but unfortunately this feature has been removed , and even it doesn't highlights where it's reading",
"Tried playing the video for a lot of times for days already but same message popped up ""something went wrong while playing this video blablabla"". If you can fix this, I'll give this app 5 stars. I just wanna learn lol.",
The app is very good.but there is a bug in the app that completed courses does not update...and i just want a favorite button.üòäBTW this is the one of the best platform.,
"Everything was great up to the point when I changed my password. Now, it does not recognise my account anymore and i have to use a desktopp version on my mobile.... A pity. Will have to move to udemy or somewhere else as majority of my learning happens on the go :(",
This app is an absolute distress . I had signed up for Google data analytics and suddenly I got out of it even though I did nothing and it showed I had to sign up again for the course . R u ready to give money again for other's nonscence ? And payment method suddenly said error and help Cantre . Please don't get me started on the help centre . Worst help centre I have come across. None to talk or message to . Do you people think that the customers are dumb sheep or what ?,
Can't see lecture when Dark Mode (Dark Theme) is active. Text color is black and background is black too. Please fix it. Thanks,
I have just installed this application on cell phone. There are Google and Facebook options available to log in. I have tried many times to log in to this application with my Google account. But it doesn't log in. What's reason behind not to be log in with Google account?,
The downloaded videos are not deleted from memory after deleting it in the app. It just stops showing it in the downloaded contents. Please fix this bug.,
"The only issue I have with the app is that pictures included in readings are not downloaded with it. Other than that, excellent place to learn!",
"ID verification is a mess and broken after few attempts without any indication. Have already contacted to ""tech support"" yet NO adequate response to help solving the problem. This platform is a mess, has no respect to the hard work and time we invest in. SO DEMOTIVATING.",
There is problem in submitting assignments.. all answer was wrong in that.. and also there are some difficulties in playing a video lecture ten out off 1 or 2..,
took a few classes already.. and my instructor was amazing. (Dr. Silverman) & I plan on taking more on the subject if they become available.,
I would have definitely given it a four star but I have given it a four only because it does not allow me to sinc the deadlines to my calender...... Please help me out..... Other than this everything is perfectly fine and good going.......,
I have taken an online course on Digital Marketing offered by University of Illinois.In the first Module I was asked to submit an assignment but I can't enter into that tab to write my assignment and I dont know why it happens.I want that to be fixed asap because I dont like things to be incomplete and that technological error makes me lose my interest in the course.,
After the update the captions are not matching the video speed. The captions are faster than the video.,
"Same Problem, even though I have checked my internet connection which is working properly still unable to view my courses. Now I'm realising that I have made a mistake on spending money to such irresponsible app! Please fix the problem so that I can finish my project before deadline!",
"Very slow app and web, spammy (and hard to unsub), horrible free content (makes you lose hope (stop looking for meaningful reasons to enroll) in universities from the content of courses provided/available).",
Unmatchable!! Undisputed!! User-friendly So far Coursera has been the best online learning content provider. Only competition to Udacity (in some cases better than udacity but lacks only thing which is career services & support),
Certification courses are excellent in this app. I thank the app developer and all other faculties involved in explaining and teaching the courses. Thank you so much üíñ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ Coursera!!!,
"This App is as awesome as contents of Coursera. Loving the app, it truly provides the learning on the go experience. After using this app chances of my course completion has been increased.",
courses are good and guides are also good without the certificate giving process... If u will complete all the recruitment for the certificate of a course but at end u will always hamper for not getting the certificate.....,
"In the new update, sign-in for students using app through college administration needs to be done through the ""login with email"" option instead of ""continue with google"" as we are logging in with our already registered coursera account. It worked for me.",
"Only for me to update this application and i started getting all sort of errors. Cant load your whatever, access error and all sorts. If i had known, i wouldn't have updated the app",
Great app. Unfortunately too many bugs and at some point the videos start lagging in which case you need to reset the app again.,
"I want to say why coursera don't have any course on German language??? I want to learn german and I am looking for it from past 2 years but I could not found any. The experience was good, for the courses I have done on coursera. Pls add specialization for German as well.",
Needs fixing! A lot of the quizzes shows as blank and totally inaccessible or cannot finish. Both Android and Ios have this issue!,
The app was fine a 6 months ago. Now the downloaded videos are lagging while playing. Its very much difficult to watch such Laggy videos. Please fix this. And make the app a bit more optimised.,
The app stop several times and shows too many requests as I am using from mobile and laptop. Also wasting a lot of time. Solve the issue quickly as possible,
The best digital education platform apprently serving the enhancement of humanity. I like the way they always let the courses audit. This function is very beneficial for educators like us who are living in an LCD country. Thank you team coursera. :-),
i took a free course ( certificate not included). it is vedio based. very interesting and useful. I recommend this app to anyone interested in online learning.,
"Having difficulties logging in. Keeps saying that I should check my network connection. Crashes, when I try to login with Facebook, which is the alternative.",
Total waste .. you cannot do some particular things on the phone app .you cannot review your peers through phone. The app developer needs to find a course on coursera first .,
"Even download videos aren't smoothly watchable getting distorted in between. Got notification, Coursera runtime exception, Coursera responding slowly.",
"Coursera is one of the best platform to learn new skills, technologies, languages,etc from experts. It also have tough questions in assignments which needs high thinking ability.",
The courses here are amazing but it glitches a lot. It doesn't show the courses tour doing sometimes. Please fix it,
"Downloaded course gets struck (lag) sometimes, and it works even worse sometimes. I dont know why it is happening, but please fix it as soon as possible.",
The videos lag a lot when I save them offline. It's really an unpleasant experience. Please solve this problem.,
"Without any intimation I was charged for subscription. At least you should give a proper notice for the charge. I was not at all happy with the course and now on top of it, I am getting charged. Worst ever experience.",
"For some weird reason this app drains my battery very fast. I uninstalled it and my battery is working fine now. Other than that, its a fine app with a lot to explore.",
New update have a problem 1.It's good it shows the cousres which are in specialization but I am not inroll But it also shows which I have completed. 2.The new features for time period for inrollment is not good.,
"Nice to have an app, but text entry is completely broken. Being able to download the videos/lessons is particularly nice.",
UI can be made smoother and user friendly and some options which are perfectly working in website or in a desktop isn't available in mobile app although if available doesn't function properly.,
They don't provide Bachelor or master level degree but still ppl can pay to get certified and learn a few things. So in some ways it's alright not fabulous.,
"The best apps among the all online educational courses. Most of the coursers offered are free of cost. Helps you gain a lot of knowledge regarding any subject, be it tech or non-tech. Adds value to you CV :)",
"I have downloaded some course videos , but when I play them the audio of the videos starts lagging very much which is very annoying . Pls fix it",
"Coursera is a great app. However, I keep losing saved course videos once I close the app, which is quite awful.",
"Highly recommend. I'm university student. This app makes me feel awesome. I can learn many things by using this app. All the features are super cool. Organization, management well. Love this application. It's very useful.",
"This app is no where near my expectations! Everything is slow, from buffering to downloading. Even readings are slow to load. I can't complete q songle course on this app.",
"By far one of the best apps I've ever used for educational purposes, Coursera Plus especially. Excellent job, no complaint, no discrepancy, keep up the great work! God's blessings!",
"Recommendation: If one has finished a course, it should be marked as completed and not enrolled. Also, would love a search option in My Courses and Achievements.",
Great way to widen your knowledge as you don't need to do the actual degrees. There are so many courses from so many universities. Coursera is excellent.,
Annoying assessment locks... I have finished a module but I have to wait for 20 dayum days in order to actually finish the assessment. Please look after this.... This locking of assessment is really not needed. Today is 2Jul I have finished with week 3 of a module but I still have to wait for Week 2 assessment to be unlocked which is due on 20 July. This will only make students lose interest for learning if what they want to do is simply locked.,
Great app! Just having issues typing on the discussion boards. Gave one star to get your attention. Whenever I try typing the cursor doesn't move. Reach out to me if you need recording,
The Cast function needs serious work. It crashes every time a video finishes or every 2 videos if you get really lucky.,
Only one thing that is missing from this app is the landscape mode that would bring a huge leap in the usage of this app. One star less for absence of landscape mode.,
"I think, as least I know I would, appreciate it if I could get access to my notes I take during the course through the application, and not have them only accessible through the computer.",
This one of the best educational app to try a best person in this journey and a human . if you try to make a parfect person than install it. no other educational app try to beat this next 10 years.,
Downloaded videos from course aren't appeared in the downloads. For starting downloaded lectures the app wants to go online/internet connectivity and then only i can watch offline videos. Please help me for how downloaded videos will appeared in download section.,
Really good courses. Some are free with the option to pay for certificate. But other are neither free nor cheap.,
Can't browse other courses! Did the same search on the coursera website and its working well but application is not working properly! Fix the explore option in application,
"Foe the current version, it is telling me that my credentials are not correct. I used the same set of info to login on my web browser pc and android.",
Course can't load itself. Stopping every second. I know it might be temporary issue. That's why giving 3 stars. Solve it and get 5 stars.,
"Distance learning has never been that much better than on this app. Very experimental and good educational app. Everyone who want better education at the highest level, wants to boost his/her resume, further career should choose this app. From professional certificate level, deploma, degree to Masters or phd should school here.",
"I love this app and website. It's non-intrusive, the courses and lessons are well-designed and engaging, and the instructors are top-notch!",
Why is there no option of keeping notes while watching the video which is available in desktop browser mode?? Developers should add this feature in coming update....,
"The courses are really nice but the peer reviewed assignments are not reviewed even after 3 weeks, I don't know if I will get a certificate even after completing my tasks beforehand. Very very disappointed.",
This app is very helpful for me . Online courses video quality are also good and manageble. Resources are also provided and transcript of video can ve downloaded as well.....üòäüôÇ,
It's a great idea. I found that was working too much to use it. And then the flood came. An alternate name for this app might be Spamera. What ever happened to simple common-sense? Perhaps someone should offer a class in that.,
"I can't upload my ID, it's a requirement for my certificate. I have tried multiple platforms and devices, and browsers. Nada. There also is no actual phone number for coursera.",
"Even if I input my mail and password correctly, the log in button is not working. It's unresponsive. I have tried clearing cashe and reinstalling but to no success.",
"App is not working properly, continuous breaking of video contents... It's difficult to complete the course with these issues.. Very much time consuming",
Video keeps lagging even after high speed internet connection. Also the videos don't download even on wi-fi connection. Please make improvements in this app,
"Splashscreen lasts for over 10 seconds, although their content is nice, using the app with low internet speeds is pathetic.",
"It is a great way to learn no matter what age group you are in! one suggestion I have, though, is having a save for later feature. Other than that, I'm happy with the app!",
"Good app. One suggestion, there are some surveys and tests that can only be attended using a computer kindly update to a form that it can also be performed in phone. Thank you. Hope you guys consider it.",
"I am very happy with Coursera courses from various Top universities. I found some related topics of Mechanical and Metallurgical engineering so i choose those courses, and they are very good in terms of knowledge but you have to go through books then it will complete your knowledge.........",
"Provides Wide variety of courses. But app doesn't function properly, it started hanging all the time.",
"Good but getting some issues. if I played a topic from any courses, the video will run smoothly... But it will getting stuck over and over again",
Just horrible. Couldn't complete my course due to too many errors/ problems / glitches within the course. I'm extremely disappointed. So I am about to unenroll. Hopefully that won't be a problem :(,
This is the worst learning app I ever seen. They mainly focused on hogging money only. Courses are loading very very slowly and in quizz section only white page is show. Please try to fix the bugs,
"it's great app and platform, can you please make an option that allow me to copy the subtitles from under the video because there's some words it's hard to understand and i need to translate it, thank you for your efforts.",
Very useful app for self learning. However I am having trouble in opening the quiz section. It just doesn't opens up.,
"I tried to register for Sports Analytics course from University of Michigan. It will show approx 10000 fees, very affordable fees..but when I click on enroll now ,it will show choose payment options with dead link. I add my card.. Then also dead link, can't make payment and enroll. Try to get email or chat support but nothing all I got is some stupid unwanted FAQ section. This app just spoiled my day",
"Really struggling to log in, I can reset my password on desktop but when I use the app, not recognised. Even uninstalled and tried again, no joy. Don't know who to contact for help re the app.",
I didn't know this app exist. I ALWAYS OPEN ON MOBILE BROWSER HOW I WISH I KNEW IT YEAR AGO. NOT TO MENTION you can download and even cast it on tv for bigger screen LITERAL no need for pc. I been missing out alot. Not their fault they are not advertising the app on every popup.,
Best app ever It teaches you many certified courses with best teachers. It even offers free course with good classes It gives the quizes on how we understood and gives chance to correct us. I am learning psychology and English for career development at its best in COURSERA LOVE FROM INDIA üáÆüá≥ COURSERA,
"Not good. My android phone version is 6. But whenever i try to create an account or login, it tells me login error! No mobile network. Pls work on this, because it is reall frustrating!",
"Good site to learn skills but the big probelm is the app, it is not smooth initial loading time is too long and the app environment is kind of laggy. That is the reason i gave 3 stars.",
It's a good app and good experience but when I download videos and later when I start to watch it offline it shows there is a error (network problem ) plss tell how to solve it and if there is a problem plss solve it!,
"When using the app on a 16:10 device, the app stretches the video so that the height of the video matches the height of the device, causing the video to be cropped, which is the absolute WRONG thing to do",
In my M10 tab the video doesn't fit. Video goes out of screen. Now uninstalled this useless app and using browser instead. The feedback seems useless,
"Hi, despite resetting my password carefully twice the app will still not let me log into my account. It just says problem with email or password. Please help. Thanks.",
0 customer support.. Pathetic experience.. Courses are also not up to the mark. Many modules take you through online reading and book discussion.. Waste of time.. I experienced that the content they are offering can easily be learnt through you tube unless you need a certificate to show on your table.. I don't recommend it to anyone..,
"Coursera has come a long way from what it used to be, from the time when I would say psss to most of the courses to finding courses taught by creditable sources. I gotta give this org a 5 star for its app.",
Dear Coursera its really a cheap way to take others people money by making the auto subscription on default! I am really pissed off that was the last money that I had and now I am completely broke! Thanks to you who only teaches ethics but not apply it!,
Personally recommend for any course. this app has great UI download feature and clear after you complete week and synced reminder overall simple but great learning experience,
"No doubt, Coursera is very useful. I just want the highlighting of transcripts (making notes) to be present in App Version.",

Cousera is very good for learning and easy to navigate. But uploading some assignment through it is just impossible.,

This app makes me rage bcoz there no free programming courses for me. I want to make games and write my own program. Unity 3d is a free engine i need a free course to develop my games. The courses were free in December 2019 but they are not free anymore. Why? You are taking advantage of the people bcoz of this pandemic.,
"Coursera as a platform is great but the app is bad. Full of bugs, lack of proper tracking and difficult to submit assignments and review peers.",
"Love Coursera but this app does not work. I tried signing up for courses and ended up with endless ""could not retrieve your data"" messages. I uninstalled.",

"I just want you to solve the problem of assignments that are corrected by other students,......... because in reality... students do not correct them... and the deadline spent without correcting so,... we will not get the certificate of the course, please lookat those assignments.",
"Bad but don't know the whole thing is a fraud ;the whole point is, I subscribed to the 7 day free trial and entered my room card üí≥ information, after that I got deducted 3 times and later sent a mail subscription failed. And you have to refund me what you have deducted or to court and if in case I get deducted without informing me , my knowledge then all your works will run into the drain.",
"I did a course on ""Using Databases With Python"" and it's been 3days, and I've not got my certificate, though I've completed it fully n properly. Also the help section of the application is not working.",

I can't sign in with our organization info recently so can't see my process in the courses. Especially I'm using Windows login option with our company but application gives an authentication error.,
Terrible experience. DO NOT USE. TOTAL RIP OFF. Tried to cancel my subscription then when I demanded a refund they told me my subscription had been cancelled because I demanded a refund. I can't believe Google and other companies do business with these frauds.,
"Best learning site. Yet i wish i can continue on where I left off. On both laptop and mobile app I have to ""guess"" the resume point if I havent learned for a few days, which is frustrating.",
"This app is very useful but today I come up with a problem . In assignment reviewing section, I can't review others assignment.It says ""something went wrong check ur internet connection."" But I got no network issuse. Kindly fix this bug",

It did not provide me certificate for my course (When I enrolled, they said enroll for free and get a certificate at the end). As the course completed, they sent me a congratulations mail but no certificate. How can they cheat those who are its main income source? You have wasted my 14 weeks. Without any certificate it will be useless. Please don't cheat with your customers or soon your site will be closed.",
"I can't enroll into any course from here, and at the same time I can't login on the website, because ""your device or network is sending automated queries"". This is just wasting the time I could have used to actually learn something.",
"For me the app doesn't work most of the time. Nonenof the course gets loaded; I cannot enroll from mobile. ultimately, cannot learn on the go unless I use it on my desktop.",
App and website take too much time to load. We are not able to submit our Assignments due to this glitch. And make an improvement for submiting all assignment through mobile app. Please resolve this issue overall good experience.,

Amazing App! Love the courses! But it would be better if they could decrease the prices a little. More & more people will join..,
Courses and study materials are very good. But android Coursera app is worst. It's got frozen many times without any reason.,
App is Good but even though there is strong network it shows ' No internet connection. Please try again later ' While opening Assignment. So Annoying. Please fix this as soon as possible.,
Slowest sloth. The latest update almost froze coursera app. I can't play course videos even downloaded ones. Please take action. It's horrible!,
I have difficulty in accessing course videos. It ends up saying Coursera isn't responding! Kindly fix this. Thank you,
"An awesome app, had no problem using this app before. But recently I can't open or sign up. I've tried to reinstall, but didn't help either. What's going on? Am I the only one who has the log in problem?",
This app is fantastic. learningis made easy with the videos and follow-up prints. it's so enjoyable and straightforward. love using it. impactful and educative,
this is the worst app i have ever seen when i was working in peer grading my work has jot been graded and i was asked to wait for sometime to be updated but there no result then they told that my work is wrong and it cannot be graded but for others who did the same work was been graded.Because of one peergrading exercise i was not given the certificate waste of money and time worst app.and the supporting team responses are really worst which are like computer based responses they say the same,
"it's nice learning with the app but I wish the design can be improved on, more responsive to mobile users. So I can access all parts of the course on my mobile device.",
I really like the interface of the app but what's the point of giving an app when it asks to open desktop or laptop for certain contents.,
It gives a first class online learning experience and is simple to use. No ad's pop up that's an additional value,
"HATE this app!!! Besides the app being glitchy and slow, I'm completely disappointed in Coursera anymore. You better hope everything goes perfectly because if you have any issues you're on your own. Customer service is a joke.",
"It is not movile frendly at all (same as the website) I can¬¥t study on my tabet as it won¬¥t work on landscape mode, you can¬¥t save notes either on tabet and mobile. Is unsusable",
It has a good or appreciable content bt at the last moment when i m performing the test or review of the chapter it is not submitting the ans and that problem is happening since last 2 weeks Good for learning bt at the time of cerificate it just bluffs,
The app is fairly okay and user friendly but a dark mode/interface (for night use) needs to be integrated for a great user experience.,
"the video player is horrible...the control options are overlapping, making it very distracting to focus on the content",
"Those who are writing like deductions from credit account or anything like that, i want to say that dont apply from free trial, apply for financial aid or audit option, you can have all the content with all assignments. Thanks coursera for this wonderful initiative.",
Not enough practice or learning materials . Everything is so confusing . There is no specific book to follow . Teachers mist of the time talk about anything but the main topic .,
Very Nice and intuitive..First experience properly with an online course study and its dtoo detailed lengthy but overall options nice all I can say now.,
"Worst user experience in this app,when I'm trying to watch a video,it is being paused automatically,it is still continuing even I tried to play it,totally disappointed üòî",
"Love this app, it's nice to listen to the videos as I'm making my long commute daily. Very smooth playback, no issues",
Its the very good app and will make life easier but there is a drowback of this app that we cant our assingment through this app thats why i am giving 4 star for its drowback hope that in future it will improve. The content of the app is available in English. There are NO drceptive ads and I am spending more time in this app than expected. You can Download your content and watch and read it offline wherever and whenever you want.,
It is useful for learning. Espicall all course are prepared by University Departement. Only Video does not start that User stop. Also sometimes I need to translate some words. connection by dictionary should be helpfull,
"I tried downloading the videos of a course of week 2 which was 189mb with storage set to sd card. Despite having 1.5gb free space, it shows insufficient storage!! What am i supposed to do???",
"I downgraded my version of the app. Please don't install this update. It will freeze your phones. It's not stable. Coursera, this update isn't stable. Thank you.",
Courses are nicely structured and are easy to navigate. Even the content is very good,
The new update broke so much. Videos keep buffering and the transcripts don't flow either and math formulas are not displaying.,
"Was a great app, but last update removed Chromecast support and the video player is unstable. Will go back to 5 stars once this is fixed",
App is not working properly in my phone (Samsung M31). Its actually keep loading and not loads fully at the end. Tried reinstalling it but not worked.,
Great App. Though after the recent update I've not been able to download some of the courses. Downloads halfway then suddenly halts. What can I do?,
App is not up to mark to use. Please study the course in this app and make it user friendly. It is hanging up too much and annoying me. Worst app design ever. Pls listen to some course and update it.,
Verry bad!! The app is not supported on my device! They notify me after i have installed itüòëüòë! Then it says it is not available for my device!! You should say thid before i download and install!,
Coursera i just my best online learning platform but i am an offline learner due to a lot of things and i now find it impossible to download the course material especially the videos. Please Coursera inc. should rectify this issue as soon as possible.,
"Love this app, it would be nice if you could disable subtitles while casting to screen since it sometimes interfere with the lecture material",
"they're the best. Graphics, audio, translation, etc. They've made learning so easy and better. Thank you Coursera!",
"ID VERIFICATION, CAMERA PERMISSION Please do something , hire more programmers, take a course about programming I'm finishing the course and can't reach my certificate because of id verification is not working I don't delete this app ,but with this situation I have to",
"The app on the phone will not work with videos. Excellent, on the computer, program. Phone app, not so excellent...",
"I cant pay for the specialization, when I want pay to see my quiz grade the app shows me a pop-up message (error loading enrollment data) I dod everything I cleared cache and app data, also I reinstalled Coursera app, but I still face the same problem",
I have issues paying for the course I was studying (Google IT support) and I was locked out. I made many attempts to contact someone from Coursera to no avail. I eventually abandoned the couse.,
Absolutely the worst app ever. Doesn't load or takes ages to load. I wish the quality of this horrible app can match the otherwise great content.,
"Performance can be slow and buggy sometimes, but overall it is a good app for learning on the go.",
app is much better than web browser it is also very intuitive and kind of encourages you to learn and keeps you engaged in the course,
Pathetic. The app is too slow. It is just irritating sometimes. Even the downloaded contents are not accessible.üòî,
"The app is great, but it was really frustrating for me to realize one can't save notes there. I hope you'll add this tool, I've got so much used to it on my PC.",
Last update locked overlay controls on the video. Makes it very difficult to use coursera on android.,
Excellent App! Gives users a very smooth experience. It would be even better if you provide a method to download course materials through the app.,
App is so useful. While sleeping and randomly while getting bored I watch the courses on my cell. These are useful for many courses that don't reuqire a book and pen.,
Trying to restart a course. First run was amazing. Great lecture on Audio Engineering. I'll be coming back in immediately. Within the next few hours. Big Ups,
Completed multiple courses. Minor bugs are present but it's very stable and reliable.,
"The fact that all couses have time constraints is really frustrating. Other apps like Udemy offers life long access after purchase. Being a US initiative, this is very costly as well for people in India.",
The course on medieval magic and the 'nonjudgemental' examination of the subject is definitely very narrowly focused on placing blame on Christianity for it being thought of as different or evil. There are hebraic laws which are much older than the arrival of Jesus and the rise of Christianity. It seems that this course is biased and shortsighted without mentioning that 'magick' practices have always been seen in this way according to ancient scripture.,
This is the best app for remote learning. You can signup for any course and learn for free. But have to pay gor certifications. Financial aid is also available.,
"I'm learning Japanese for begginers Course, I'm in 5th week. There's some problem with the tests. Whatever answer I select it shows it wrong. Please fix this problem as soon as possible.",
Grading system is quite frustrating. No response for given feedbacks in app. You keep learning hours and hours and end up with awful grading system.,
"Very good app. We can gain huge knowledge using this app. As the instructors are from reputed universities, we obviously don't need to worry about the lectures delivered.",
The courses are great but in the new update I can't log in. Facebook login for an embedded browser is disabled. Please fix.,
When watching videos offline its lagging too much and consuming too much ram... I have to exit every 3 minutes and clear cache to watch videos properly... Please fix this,
No customer service. Turned off auto renew to try out the free trial. Got charged twice. States no refund and no easy place to locate customer service.,
Cancellation and un-enrollment issues on the site and application. Given help email is not working. And the review has been deleted for the 3rd time instead of acknowledging the issues.,
Appealing and easy to use interface. The app has made it very easy to cover the courses even if I am not at home,
The app hasn't been able to connect to the internet for 2 days. I can't submit graded assignments or search for content because it's not loading. Please help because I am stuck.,
"It's hooking , the teaching is very nice but it just started to hook, it'll be like a pause but its not supposed to be there, it is very annoying . I don't just understand what is going on.",
For an app that teaches user experience I think it's pretty messed up how sh!tty this app's user experience is. What's the use of a mobile app if I have to do literally everything in the web on a laptop,
"An attractively learning program is crucial for achieving a sufficient resourceful knowledge, capacity, skills and experience to stand out of crowd successful. thank God, I found Coursera, as a useful platform through which I know my prospect and potential.",
"Awesome app, you will feel so comfortable and confident after completing specialization of courses. Thanks to Coursera teams",
"It is a very flexible, interactive and user friendly platform, with so many amazing courses and also a social platform to meet with new people and solve problems together.",
"What the heck is going with the video player settings overlapping with the content, this is beyond annoying. Please fix ASAP.",
"Really it's the best app in the world its better than gold. thanks god üôè because there are a good people's made this app. It's easy ,rich , enough,professional and a lot of variety. also I need to thank the guy who shared his app experience with me in YouTube. (I don't know the guy name but his channel name is technawy) I'm happy to found this app.",
Wonderful learning app. Easy to navigate. Clear videos and text. It's a wonderful learning tools. I love it.,
"Since i've selected personal development category from the recommended topics, i'm not able to adjust it again neither from the app or from the web page, i don't know how they didn't notice this behaviour in the app",
"It's frustrating, I cannot able to pay for subscription. Everytime it shows problem processing your payment.",
They depreciated there api and bricked there own app. Not only that but other apps that use the api stopped working. How do you change your api and only give developers a 2 week notice? So unprofessional. Plus now your own app won't down download your videos. And it's near impossible to get any documentation.,
Coursera is one of the best thing that hs ever happened to me in terms of online teaching. Coursera pieces everything you need to know about online marketing. Enrol fast and understand things you don't know.,
First it wad so easy to access but..going on further..cant able to access it properly and on top of that now..when i downloaded the app again i can't able to login..it shows network error.. Please fix it,
I needed a refund for something I did not subscribe to. They do not give refunds. Because of this my rent cheque bounced. I owe $100 to bank and my landlord because of them. This is the worst customer service EVER! DO NOT PURCHASE AS YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF!!!!!,
Someone help me with Coursera contact(mail or contact) I was wrongly charged and there is no way to contact for refund inspire of cancelling the course well in advance. Worst online portal I have ever seen in my life!!!!,
Really should be zero star. I signed up for free trial and canceled on 12/30. Charge 41.00 on Jan 8th. Many complaints of charging canceled subscriptions. Don't fall for it!!!!,
"I learned a lot from these various courses very informative, knowledgeable and refreshing it really helps and I enrolled some course that I gained my confidence.",
I am loging through my organization credentials on app but it is opening on the browser not the app. The login page is opening on the browser and when i go back to app its asking me for credentials.,
I like the course so far but.. is it possible to add a feature for taking notes like the desktop version? It's a very important feature for me.,
It's a moment of learning new things. I am grateful for the opportunity and privilege received so far for me to be able to access myriad of information that is useful to enhance my skills and prepare me as a qualified data analyst. once again THANK YOU.,
"One of the best apps for online courses. Video is a little unstable at times but overall, it's a success.",
"There is a bug in the app,When you minimize the app while watching the lecture and reopen the app again the video will not play.",
I love it. But I will appreciate it more if some activities that require system compatibility can be redesigned to work perfectly on this app.,
Great tool for educational and career development plus it is free. It provides so much from global colleges for so little. That's why I like it.,
coursera is a great source of knowledge and a holistic window of opportunities to the world! i'm much grateful really for the opportunity given to me Coursera! i look forward to seeing me achieve more in the recent time.,
I enjoy every bit of the course ..it is very easy to understand and packed with vital information to help gain the necessary skills.,
"I have use it on my android phone,but i have major issue when i write in activity portion for discussion at end of week of the course the alphabets mixed up with each other kindly resolve this issue in new update. thank you",
Great for self developement and education... Haven't experienced anything as good as Coursera.... I do prefer the use on laptop instead of phone though..,
I can't even sign in with my Gmail account via website. I'm signing into the app and I can't do that due to the email format. I can't also log into my account via the web too as it requires two way authentication number from the app. So what can I do?,
"I love it . Actually I'm a paramedic student ,I love it coz the app has lots of medical science course that are more informative than my academia and very much useful for my clinical knowledge. Thank you Coursera and the universities.",
The worst Thing is Payment option in India is very disapoited.Only accepts Credit cards. No other option.We cont able to do payment without Credit card. Please enable all Wallet and Internet banking Payment methods in India.,
Video not working properly on levenvo M10 3rd gen tab. Navigation controls keep showing up and no way to turn them off.,
Excellent App for Learning. The UI is not as great as the website one but that shouldn't stop you from learning.,
It's best Online learning platform i have gone through. It has a huge collection of high quality courses in nearly all streams.,
"Highly disappointing to not find any medium to communicate for help. When there is payments involved it makes it difficult to be always directed to FAQ, there should at least be an email ID for any concern",
"Excellent course information and video quality. Timeously completed all my courses with minimal effort. Thanks, great work.",
Having trouble with my subscription. The programs are great but since I started the IT courses it Coursera not letting me pay and I can't contribute with the course.,
"Cousera is over all a very good and helpful app *plus its free lol* so that makes it 10x better in my opinion,i am homeschooled and i just love to use this app throughout my free time or if i dont feel like doing my normal work.",
It gives me wings... I always want to study in top universities although somehow I failed to get admission in them. Butnow through coursera I can learn anything from top universities even in free...,
I couldn't open the app. It crashes every time I launch the app. My device is under Android 9,
The courses are really good actually it is best but my device is a little slow so is there anything developer can do to make the app faster on slow devices,
Site is good but app is terrible. Why would your app not support notes and only videos? Kinda weird to bar out half the content from your site.,
"I love using this app, but it does not transmit well to the website. If you do some of yourceork on the website it doesn't show on the app without a delay",
have mixed feelings about the app i updated it and my downloaded offline line videos stopped playing but new downloaded ones work apart from that excellent just having issues with the limitations of the app,
Paid $39 to start a subscription and cannot access anything. App crashes every time I attempt to open it.,
Learning with Coursera app is better. it's very easy to navigate even for a novice. I highly recommend to anyone learning to use this app.,
"After the update, its showing too much lags. I cannot even complete my assignment. It says not responding so quit. Seriously!!",
Whats the point of downloading for offline mode if the app doesnt work if you're not logged in. Couldn't get pass the log in screen on my flight.,
"one of the best apps for online courses easy to use , easy to understand but the offline mode is a little bugged overall i would give it a 4 stars",
"Bug, new update had the 'play and pause' button stay on screen for the rest of the video. Please fix.",
"video often error when playing and it is very often. I took a google cloud course and that's what happened, even though on my PC it's fine",
"First and the biggest problem is that if i am facing any problem related to course then there is no one to one communication for help,you can't find anyone to make your problem solved. Just like me i am not geting my certificates as there are issues with my id verification and no one is there to help me regarding this. Worst featured .",
Exploring the rapid changing world with Coursera is the foreward step for the personal development. I suggest Coursera to give a free course for the first time user so that you can gain many worth-of-mouth.,
Your app contents bug... Please fix it. When i am solving assessment...your app starts lag. And after i solve 90% of exam then the app starts show not responding..close the app etc.,
I AM NOT ABLE TO REVIEW ASSIGNMENTS OF OTHER STUDENTS. IT TELLS ME TO CHECK MY INTERNET CONNECTION. ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALREADY RE INSTALLED THE APP AND MY NETWORK IS PERFECT STILL NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK. PLEASE FIX THIS GLITCH IN YOUR APP ASAP.,
it is well built and a great platform for learners. I feel I would stay on it more if breaks to recall and rest weren't necessary.,
Constant battery drain warnings. UI is a bit lumpy but still better than the truly appalling mobile site.,
"It shows ""We had trouble loading your data"" from the moment I logged in for the first time. Everything works fine on the browser",
awesome üëç I must admit. Simple the best platform for studying. The most important thing is that financial aids are available for those who can not pay for the course. Thanks Coursera for giving me the opportunity to develop new skills.,
"I can't download my course offline on my phone, I have a lot of storage space and good internet connectivity, however the videos for my courses won't download due to reasons I don't understand.",
It is a good application but normally expected features like screen rotation when in full screen mode are not available that disappoints me,
"while watching a videolecture, there is no opportunity to turn over the picture, which sometimes would be very useful",
Extremely good application is one of the best for education at any time at any age at any cost you apply yourself and the results are great.,
I love this app as it lets me learn my favorite subjects on the go plus the courses are free which I love plus I can set a schedule that works for me.,
"Offiline videos stutters after sometime and the app becomes ""not responding"".I have to force close and start again every five minutes.",
I couldn't verify my ID even though I granted permission for camera and media. I need my certificate to be submitted. Please kindly fix the bug. Thank you!,
"The questions in the assignment are vanished and now I'm unable to submit them. I'm trying for last 3 days and despite of having a good internet connection, I'm still unable to view the questions.",
The app is not easy to use. The information are not updated. In mobile the courses done by me is not appearing but in laptop it shows.,
"App randomly logs you out while watching downloaded courses offline, this makes app totally useless if you dont have internet access to login back again to continue watching your downloaded content.",
"Videos aren't playing on the app. Getting an error - something went wrong while playing the video, please exit the app and try again. Been trying for days now...",
"Could not download videos, and videos playing experience is too irritating, after some time.",
Can't use a tablet do some of the course. Can't find any way of contacting Coursera to fix or advise. That's really frustrating because I'm paying for nothing right now,
"It works offline, but keeps pausing videos, and resuming a video often starts from beginning instead of resuming...",
"I just downloaded the app.The first time I tried to open it,it said that I'm offline. I tried to refresh the page but still no difference.Please try to fix this!",
"The best app to learn, I am learning Korean through this app without any fee , it is a very useful app with simple and efficient teaching system , that everyone can understand.üíúüíú",
I'm enjoying the courses but it's really annoying that no matter how far I am into a course it always opens up in week 1.,
"The courses are definitely good but I hope that Coursera will provide free courses with certification, this will really change our society and all people around the world will have access to this great content.",
"I am facing a problem whenever I trying to submit the assignments . The assignments submit page is showing something like "" error loading enrollment data"" . Please help me out. I am enrolled in ""machine learning specialization"" course",
Coursera has very great resources but this app is completely mess. Why they can't provide a good interface. It's just keep loading. It's irritating. Every single comment is criticising this app still they don't do anything why ?,
Pray you don't get an error in the course that stops progress because trying to get assistance is impossible. Total waste of money for a course you can't use.,
sync course bettwen laptop and app. can even download lesson of offline usage. Good certification is another big plus.,
The app is soo slow and couldn't get into the page we left once we left the app. Its reloading frequently.,
"There are many problems. 1.) don't mention they need an account (not a kill but bad) 2.)They demand you give a full name(not a killer but bad) 3.)They don't allow longin with Google (only Facebook, In my opinion a really bad thing) 4.) i could not try anything(the thing that made me uninstall)",
"Finally! This works better than the last update. There are no glitches at all, the videos are clear and I can now enjoy my classes. Kudos.",
very easy to use. the font size is also easier on the eyes then going online to access the course.,
I love this platform. The quality of content is commendable. The fact that it comes from one of the best sources is promising for beginners. The app and websites are user friendlyüòç,
This app is great. My comment is just add the accomplishment interface and a down button that prompts learners to download the video.,
I'm a software engineer and I learn casually on Coursera to acquire more knowledge in my area of expertise as well as other fields. Latest course I finished is fundamentals of microeconomics. Really great app.,
Very handy and easy to use!! Works smooth and nicely and has good features. Very well built....!!üëçüëçüëåüëå,
Too much lag in applications as well as in video. Unable to watch lectures properly.,
One of the best apps!! Some great courses are paid and expensive!! Thats why 4 stars!! Otherwise would've been 5!,
"This is a great place to be on the internet, you would learn alot,like I can't imagine myself learning with ease this is so awesome.The app is user friendly too.Intersting teachers wow!!!",
The platform is nice for learning and also the UI is easy to use but this app is extremely slow which makes it boring and time consuming,
"The videos don't play, I keep getting a ""something went wrong while trying to play this video"" error, I'm on an Android with android 10 build",
The app keeps stopping and lagging after the new update.. Even I can't resume the vidoes where I stop if I get off the app It's fustrating and I have lot of lectures and assignments to attend to I just updated it today and this makes me feel sad about your mobile app,
"Wonderful learning tool to build and learn new skills. But one key feature that should be included is ""Dark Theme"" kindly add it too.",
"The app was Working fine until today, i have no idea what to do! Its not opening, wifi connection is strong but the problem is with app, i tried uninstalling and re installing again, no luck, phone model: Huawei 20i",
"The video player can not be controlled by Bluetooth buttons, for pausing, resuming, jumping 10 sec forward and backward, etc",
"No permission camera Hey pls update youre apps, i need to verify id. I cant use it on browser so i think with it will work well with the apps. But the app doesnt include permission camera when it needed. :(",
"Great content, easy to use and top draw customer service. If you're looking to grow your skills and improve your career this is the place.",
Coursera app is quite okay. But I am giving them a 3 star because I had done 2 weeks into a course and there was no record of it and now I have to start all over.,
It's rare that i have given ratings to any app ever but this app's phenomenal. I would happily give 6 stars if it was there. Absolutely amazing app with amazing load speed. This called the innovation. Iam proud of y'll folks.,
I would have appreciated a dark mode in the app. Very informative and interesting courses.,
"Coursera gives me a great access to courses not even taught in school but, a must know before setting into the working world. This indeed has given me an upper hand to be in prime a position at the work place.",
It's a good app but there are slightly problems . Can't even upgrade to submit my assignment whenever I click update it's says error enrollment please fix the problem,
All full of bugs. Dont pay any money for the certification guys. You need to submit the Govt ID to get the certificate. It will not take any if your ID and your money is gone. You cannot contact them as well. I'm suffering and lost my money time everything.,
It's the best app used for learning. It offers a wide range of courses and makes you consistent in learning,
The app is good but on desktop when i try to make the payment through paypal it shows that paypal is not available. Please solve the problem or i might miss my assignment due date.,
"I completed my course, submitted every assignment and project but I was not given my certificate before my subscription expired. Even till date I am yet to receive it. The help desk have no solution for problems like mine. Its telling me to resubscribe again. üòñ",
the course structures and the visual way of tracking your progress helps me immensely in completing training and keeping focused on my goal,
It's great to be able to take the courses mobile. It works even smoother than the desktop version.,
App lags too much. Cannot complete single video without lags and freezes every 2 seconds.,
I wanna learn may things from here but.....the discussion forum is causing a lot of trouble it has become a stress for me.... whenever i try to write something it shuffles the letter and is really very problematic....even in the coursera website also this issue is being faced everywhereüòë plz it's my request plz fix it ...i really want to learn from here.,
Excellent application for the one who loves learning Video lectures are provided so that understand becomes easy Performed by highly qualified personalities Useful for every field,
I cant sign in to the app For many days everytime i try to sign it says there is a problem with your connection ... there is no problrm with my network the problem maybe is with your backend work,
"The ""My Courses"" page doesn't load. It was fine before. Now I have to go to ""catalog"" page, search for my enrolled course and resume from there instead.",
Slow to use ... doesn't load data in the mobile app... moreover there is no point of contact ... unsatisfactory experience... diminishing the quality and accessibility to the good courses in the website therefore.,
I don't even know what to call this. I have been unable to access my course all day. I had to uninstall and reinstall tand yet nothing's change this is really frustrating.,
"can't use this application with ease anymore, Can't open the quiz and reading materials asap, please fix the problems quickly......BTW these bugs were introduced by the new update on 23 july.plz make it better for android as well .... ‚úå‚úå‚úå",
This new update is horrible unable to watch the videos as they are stopping in between the videos are not running smoothly,
Best application for online education. One of the best feature i.e Financial Aid service that help the needy students to enhance their skill to build up their career without taking any amount of money. Good Service by Coursera,
I have so many problems with this app . Not properly videos Play and lading data . So much bugs occurs while using this app. Please slove all these types of issues.,
"Awesome app, albeit on my Samsung Galaxy S21-FE, It's consuming more power than expected i.e. ~45% per hour. It's to be noted that on my old Huawei device that's not the case and it works normally.",
A functional coursera app would make the huge difference. Right now thw web version is a million times better than this isaw you call an app. It is unresponsive and basically useless.,
So many glitches in between the videos after the last update. That's kinda became frustrating.,
"While playing the video, the play/pause overlay wont disappear.. which makes it useless to watch the lectures.",
Excellent way to study online at a low price and very effective. check them out and have an experience for yourself! Thank you Coursera,
Coursera is very helpful and useful platform for those who can not physically attend the formal institutions due to many reasons and can't afford the fee due to many restrictions. I am very much thankful to Coursera team for providing me this precious opportunity of learning and growing.,
"There is no option to study German among the language courses. Besides that, its a really nice app.",
"I am trying to purchase a course, but it keep saying error purchasing product. Seems that you haven't updated the payment request process as per RBI guidelines. Please reolve it. Don't see any option to contact customer care",
Very bad experience with this time waste app.I am unable to sign in. The app robot verification system is very poor.I think this is a fake app in name of coursera to take your e mails and passwords. I don't recommend you to download this waste app,
"Reconnect issue....I am logged in to my account but the main screen says reconnect and won't let me see my courses or search for new ones, so I cant do anything.",
It's a fantastic platform for learning online from World's top most Institutions. Words are insufficient to describe this awesome platform... Thanks Coursera .... Due to your innovative operation we are able to get a chance to learn from world.....,
I left a review about the mobile apps courses not working on my mobile devices and it was deleted. The courses still don't work through the app for any of my devices.,
I like Coursera ...but despite strong wifi i am not able to download any videos...the server just goes on and on.. despite reinstalling the problem remains.. please fix it ...,
"I just installed this application and I just can't login to my account. When ever I try, it shows network problems however, every other app on my phone is working well",
"it doesn't even work, I think it's not suitable with my mobile but WHY IS IT ALLOWED TO BE INSTALLED IF IT DOESN'T SUIT?! when I log in it stops and give me a sign that the app unfortunately stopped",

"This is the worst adult education product I have ever encountered. Particularly the 3-4 years outdated IBM cybersecurity course. They charge you for the product, offer no support, and have stopped monitoring forums for most of their courses past the 3rd week. It is so difficult to reach support, then they say to post, then wait...they will see what they can do - meanwhile support closes off your case and you have to go through the extensive rabbit hole process of how to lodge feedback again.",

This app works so fine but some of the lessons are not made for mobile phones. You got to have a laptop/tablet and mobile phones you study throw the app.‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæ,
New update: only works on Android 5 or higher; there's no previous version to download? Wonderful. Whatever the developers values are - universal education isn't among them.,
I love having access to a ton of classes. It is super easy to navigate ans empowers me to grow daily.,
Poor small screen experience on android smartphone - unable to use full screen while watching or stream videos to chromecast.,
using this app is the best thing that happened to me for longtime. it helps me manage my time and learn all the time and everywhere i get internet access. thanks to the team,

Very Useful and easy interface. Recommended for those who want to learn anything professional to advance career,
"App is not really functional - it does not let you view most course content, or do any work, on a mobile device.",
For a $400 a year service the app should be way better than it is. Casting to a TV is so buggy they might as well not even have it as a feature.,
Great app. My one concern is the lack of responses from support. Finished a course but haven't been able to verify my ID for months,
"it's kinda slow to load and the course reminder just won't appear (i already set the notification to high importance, but still didn't work)",

It's giving problems with loading data. I can't access any courses or enrolled courses. I need to use laptop. How can I fix this bug?,
The app lags. Coursera should review this peer graded assignments in Google Certificates. It slows progress and marking criteria isn't followed as well.,
this is really a good platform for students as i am to so i experience good course and it really help me to get more knowledge about ux design and fashion design and there all lots of different courses you can do,
"I wish some courses allowed some tests to be taken on cell phones. Overall, this is a great app. Using it for my Google Career Certificate in Data Analytics.",

Excellent Coursera app for number 1 digital learning platform for online users with end number of free courses. User friendly interface. Very informative study material & World's best online courses on one platform.,
This app is really great for the peoples who want to learn but they don't have any resources or money I can say. That's appreciate able. love this app seriously. it's really amazing.,
very satisfied with the app however some quizzes require me to transfer to laptop. hopefully all tasks can be done in the mobile app.,
An amazing app actually much more than just an app. Can actuall make you a better person .the resources it is providing with the quality is simply admirable. You can learn anything you want on this app.,
The Id verification system is absolutely rubbish. I tried 100 of times and each time it shows try again.,

"I studied a lot in this application, the teachers come from great universities but in some lesson I can not finish the test due to some error so I can not answer the test.",
Very bad ui and the customer service is the worst i have ever seen. Its been more than a week since i asked them to fix my id verification error which is their fault but till now theres no response.,
I appreciate the vast array of resources that coursera provides. I have so many skills to master at my fingertips. It's overwhelming and exciting to me.,
Coursera is a great online learning community. I learnt more and enjoyed every course i took. Its a great learning experience.,
I have started to audit the immunology class and watched 6 sessions. When I attempted to return to the course I was unable to continue.,
It was alright until last update. Now I can only see english subtitles even though I can see they're available in Spanish as well on my PC.,
"One of the best customer service I have ever experienced. However, the UI could use some changes. Its not intuitive enough.",
Coursera is a better option for the students who are all looking to learn new skills via internet. The knowledge that they providing us is rare to find in any other fields. Thank you.,
"In the quiz , where I need to type , it's not visible. Which means I can't use the app offline even though video can be downloaded offline.",
"Your courses, even those you are only auditing, available offline, and can save them on external storage. What's not to like?",
Application is good but in somewhere in coding assessment it is not working as like in desktop it is not showing properly to write the code. I'm really disappointed with this point. Make it as early as possible,
"Really good platform for learning. However, it lacks flexibility and creativity.",
"It is so educative and entertaining. But the App is tooo laggy, I can't imagine how sluggish the App is. It can even lead you to broke your phone!ü•∫üò©üòµ",
Most of the times videos crash with message saying there is an error with video playback please try restarting the player.,
The peer assessment section is really annoying like i already submitted my assignment and successfully reviewed other assignments but it's still not completed. Please reply!,
No words to say as such since it is been person who saved us when in the middle of water. I learnt more from this app and even they support the learners with profound care.,
Please introduce amoled dark mode in your app. Absence of dark mode discourages me to use the app at night. Please ensure the widget also gets dark. Thanks. Keep it up.,
Awesome learning platform... Has lots of in demand courses... and you can still learn even when you don't have money to pay.,
"this was a very good application that I used before, but unfortunately, now it is not working on my Android 4.4.2 platform. and also please make it available again to see how many reviews we got in peer review assignments before our grade is ready",
What is wrong with video player?? Why does is it starts feeling as if my mobile can't play the video properly? Still haven't fixed the problem...,

Thank You Coursera. It is a great experience for me to be a learner at coursera platform. I truly say that this platform help me a lot in my study.,
Extremely Buggy. Crashed a couple of times. Please look into it. Thank you. Will change my review depending on improvements.,

Really like the courses and the app. I just wish there was a way to favorite courses that you want to take in the future.,
"DON'T PURCHASE ANY COURSE I have purchased a course after a month they told me its monthly subscription & all , but still course shows on my course page and the due date is still not gone They are making fool to get payment.",
I would have liked to complete. Does not look bad visually it jyst looks w/simple it is not. Just basic and kinda grafficless,
The courses here are very good and mostly are even for free. numerous courses are taught by professors in prestigious university across the globe.highly recommended,
"The application displays seamlessly, with efficient functionality, and be sure you would have to worry about ads bugging your learning process",
Recently I started C language course. If I'm doing practice tests it shows the answer I submitted in double quotes but I didn't give those quotes and displays your answer was incorrect even though the answer was right,
"Exceptionnel experience, with affordable courses with reputable universities along with financial aid for those in need. I really recommend it. Thank you üíñ",
They will steal your money! I completed a course on coursera and they have continued to bill me for 2 months past my completion date and refuse to refund me. How can you charge me for a course I completed months ago?! Stay away from this scam!,

How do I stream the lecture video on my smart TV? It has streaming icon on the top right corner of the video but I can't tap on it. Please help.,
Poor app. Your app is unable to download videos over wifi. Pathetic and poor experience. Edx is far more better than this app. Tried all possible solutions but no help.,
amazing it is a solid learning app and it's great and very knowledgeable! I had troubles being taught in school and this training nailed it so far!!!!,
Please make improvements in submitting assignments. It tells me that I have submitted the assignment successfully when really there is no file uploaded how the hell is that happening,
Very despicable and heavy and always goes out for no reason I really feel angry when I learn programming from an application programmed in a childish and stupid way and you call it professional development! And thanks for nothing!,
Some of the tasks are not available in app. I have shared the issue with screenshots with the devs via email. But they didn't respond,

The new update is bad. The transcript does not keep pace with the video. Older version was much better. Please fix this.,
This app provides financial aid option which is very helpful for people like us who haven't enough money to purchase these courses as the courses price for us(middle class Indian students) and the quality of the courses is up to mark.,
"Needs improvement, the app doesn't show as much details about courses and subscriptions as the Coursera website, which can create misunderstandings.",
"This design of this application makes it easy to grasp concepts, you can listen and always pull back or ahead for better understanding.",
"Everything is good in it.. I've done many courses from coursera till now.But the only the problm is that Financial aid approval process is toooo lengthy..it takes 15days to aprrove a financial aid which I think is too long. If it can be lessoned to 5-7 days, i feel its ok, then we can start the course earlier, otherwise we have to simply wait for its approval for 15 days!!",
This app is very useful for learning. But I am not able to un enroll from courses despite of following instructions given in help center page.,
"Amazing platform, great teacher's and even greater lesson's, although the certificate's aren't free, they are between 58$per cours or 64$per motnh, thats is to much for me as every dollar equal 10 dirhams, to someone from the US OR EU that price is amazing",

Great app. Don't need access to your laptop to complete some parts of coursework while you're away from your home.,
Good app to learn new knowledge and sharpen our skills. But i hope the mobile app version can be viewed as well as the website version.,
There is glitch in videos even after I downloaded them. Course content is really good and everyone should try this. Coursera must remove this glitch in next update,
Amazing app yet.. There is a problem with the ID verification.. I can't find a permission to the camera in the app. Please try to fix it,
Excellent application to learn new things and polish your knowledge. The lectures and courses from recognised universities help you to gain the best of the experience in learning.,

"Exceptional application. Andrew Ng and his team do a fantastic job of converting unused down time into progress towards a new skill, especially for life-long learners.",
"Has a lot of bugs, also they don't tell you that you need to upload your id and other personal paperwork inorder to the completion uploaded on your Linkin account. So the day I finished and they day posted are not the same. When you don't have a college degree the speed matters and they refuse to be accurate. Unless your using this to finish college you still won't get a job in the tech field. The poster board people were already picked and now most companies are still only accepting BA-BS",
"I got notifications regarding over due of my course when I opened Coursera on desktop, and not from my mobile app. Please fix this problem. I should get notifications from mobile app..",

Coursera is one of the Best Online Technical Courses platform who Teaching thousand of people around the world üåé üëç,
Will install on Android 4 but then tells you on first run that it wont work! Needs Android 5... Feel abandoned by coursera after following them on a few courses. Not willing to invest in a new tablet!,
"Every time when i try to sign in it shows ""Sign in failed; Network error, plz check our Internet connection"" but my connection is always okay. what the hell is going on!!!!!",
This app is really great for learning but as the new update rolled in all of my subscriptions suddenly vanished and now I don't know what to do.,
Login is awful. The whole prove you're not a robot is ridiculously long and difficult. Then after I did that it made me login again. Uninstalled.,
Love the app! Love the concept behind this. Much better than others in the same market. You can even apply for financial aid to help you learn. THE BEST.,
It is an amazing plate form for learners I have gained much knowledge from Coursera,
It's great app ... But I can't verify my national ID or driver licence .. grab more and more ... I need to get my certificate ... Help center is FAQ only .. not help from human all help are bots ... Plz need help urgently,
"Generally good app but it ""forgets"" the user all the time. I have to log in again every few days. Very unnecessary.",
Every time i go to this app it shows you have no network connection. But i have a good connection in my area. So please fix this,
Worst help centre ever seen and after ID verification I have completed 2 cousre but after ID verification my name on certificate is wrong after complainting 3 to 4 times aslo they arre not replying or giving help support they are so back dated that they dont have email address or proper people's to solve query,

I didn't understand yet that why video got break pause for second after every 4-5 seconds..? This problem still exists even if you download the video.,
It was ok until it's last update but now it has started lagging while playing videos or reading lecture slides. Not a very great experience,

It's an amazing app. It has all kinds of courses and it's very informative. Thank u coursera for educating a lot of people,

Offline feature saves the day. Search could use some cache for history. Nice UI.,
"Following message keeps on apprearing ""We had trouble loading your data"". This is happening since I updated the app.",
"App isnt a substitute for its website, but compliments it greatly. One can still learn and study with the app. GREAT ONE!!!",
The class progress on the mobile app is not sync-ed with the class progress on desktop... That's the annoying part,
"The completed course should show completed instead of enroll. Didn't show current course in the specialization, it always show from the first course. Cannot contact support or send request on web. the course should show the time it release or what and when it is updated. Thanks.",

I turned out that my IP was stopping me from accessing coursera. I don't know if it's because of the regulation of my country (because they blocked some other ie. reddit etc) or something else. Now i can only access coursera and continue my courses through VPN. I think other people may experienced this same issue too.",

Perfect platform for career development,
Payment options for India website and India app are horrible. Payments are accepted only through cards even though the website advertises net banking as payment option.None of the card gets verified inspite of entering all correct details.,
great place to learn,
"This is just amazing , thank you coursera team to make it possible to learn new skill without spending money or having moneh in this first place .. Thanks a lot :)",

"The worst app which gives you login issues and the payment is debited unknowingly, careful my fellow buddies who download this app. Best is not to enroll and subscribe it.",
Have to keep un-installing & re-installing in order to have update information. It also never let's me open anything in coursera in my browser.,
The app works in general but it feels like a slimmed down and buggier version of the desktop web experience.,
I David Holaman will recommend anyone who gets the chance to do a course like this online to go for it because it is worth it at the end of the day Coursera thank you all for this opportunity I highly appreciated I also recommend other coworkers to get involved thank you once again,
I don't understand what's going on with the login via Facebook. I have to use coursera via browser before i can login. The app just won't login via Facebook.,
Excellent app for learning. Unparalleled. Just hoping for newer courses in physics.,
The App is perfect. If you are having any issues with it do your troubleshooting it may be your system not the App,

Please change the UI to smoother experience and feel looking good to learn more in pleasant mode.,
The 'sync to my calendar' feature is broken now. Tapping the button does nothing. Please fix it.,
"Do NOT do it. They know perfectly well the failure rate for students is high and their certificates hold no real life value, unlike your real life money, wasted here. Idk where all the money they get from gullible students goes, but it isn't toward creating a successful learning platform, aside from successfully making it three times more difficult than it has to be to delete your account. Walk away and go cancel your gym membership. If you do what you love you won't procrastinate.",
"Wonderful. I cannot thank enough. Unbelievably great content, courses and structure of courses.",
It's a very good app but at times it takes long to respond and it keeps stopping. It's kinda frustrating,

"App is crashing in ux design week 1 course. Feel embarrassed. Need to fix asps this issue, so will resume the course again.",
"This would have been a 5-star rating but, the controls on the video playback stay on, thereby blocking the lessons.",

"The certificates are quite hard and time consuming to get only to see that they aren't any actual certificate, they contradict themselves saying that your identity is confirmed then that its not. It's a genuine certificate, yes, but it also says that its value is so low it's actually a joke. Don't waste your time and money in here. The certificates say that they are by no means a real certificate. It's like a game, only that's paid, boring and has no real use when trying to get a job.",

"Coursera banned the one school I was attending (HSE University), derailing my plans to earn a specialization and subsequent masters degree. These were huge selling points to me, and now I can't even complete the course I was in. I couldn't get a grade on the final assignment because it was ""peer reviewed"" (commie nonsense), and now I can't even complete the course because it has been deleted. $300 in subscription fees down the drain. Will revise my review if Coursera gives me a refund.",

Easy to learn and understand.,
I'm very disappointed! I enrolled in a Mental Health course and paid $50.00 for it and now the app is acting like it doesn't know me. It had me sign up for an account all over again. So now what? How do I get a refund if it doesn't have any record of me? My guess is that I will have to call my bank and handle it that way unless you have a better idea.,

The current update has become better because of its simplicity.But in the future I hope the developer to make it easy in the download section too.,

This app is amazing! I'm very self aware that it take me longer to learn. But coursera is helping a lot with it.,

While I try to download the courses mobile becomes too hot and while watching videos of j charge the videos the video lags. Using redmi k20 pro.,
"The latest update won't allow logging in. It keeps asking to check internet connection, I wouldn't be able to post this review if I had no internet",
Thanks Coursera Which helped me attend the courses that I was't suppose to study them in university. Thanks for financial Aid which helped student with poor background to achieve their gouls.,
Scamming. They promised me 7days free for try and then I need pay. My card was charged immediately ü§¨ Nobody want review my work. I paid for it. I hate the class but I can't cancel it because they will never return my money. I paid for certificate and I can't send any messages in week group chat. They promised group chat but I don't have it so nobody know that I need review my work. So I was just scammed for 50$ and I can't go to group chat and I wasn't able to have 7days free for try.,
it is wonderful platform for students and professional. they must take maximum benefits from it.,
It looks like we can cast this app to screen if we have chromecast. But is it possible to do the same to a fire stick also?,
After recent update mostly it shows you are not connected to internet many times app got logout by itself before update app was running smooth,
"Worst App When I started my course, after 20 minutes watching. Audio Automatically starts puase/beeping which took me 20 minutes to complete 7 minutes video Worst Quality Assurance",
The worst I have seen. It says learn new courses. And it doesn't have maths and logic part at all. Disappointed.,
"a great learning platform, but constantly crash my phone when i exit course video. would give 5 star if fixed. üòä",
"It's amazing but I have something to keep in mind, It would be nice if there is a button for the night vision or dark mood",
App is good. one feature of adding notes during video lectures that is available on website should be added here.,
Great app. There is a bug with dark mode - the text is not showing up and stays dark. Please fix it,
Coursera is so far the best app to follow courses. It is organized and can be well understood by users and FREE TOO,
"so far this app is super well made, allows me to follow my courses with ease, change my deadlines, and keep me on track",
I have taken seven courses already. Very learning tool indeed. It will help me to enhance my knowledge and skill.,
Learning is never exhaust! Thank you Coursera to making a great app to learning and exploring the newest technology.,
"On every run this app looked like I was logging out, and dashboard refreshes for a couple of minutes after loggin in. It would be great to keep users logged in.",
please urgently add dark mode and pinch to zoom in the reading materials... these are fundamental functionalities!,

Since the last update the progress is not saved...I am logging in from my pc again to get the tasks done and to mark my progress,
"Whenever i try to log in, there is no response whatsoever when i click the login button. Please address this issue.",
The app is crashing again and again,
Uses up atleast 500mb of RAM still it lags for offline videos....uses up so much battery that even games are better than this app for battery optimization.Resolve these problems.,
The app is draining the battery like hell and thus heating abnormally. Don't know if it is the case with all the mobiles but mine is OnePlus 6T,
good app financial aid opportunities helped me a lot in my career,
Useful courses are available.,

Coursera offers good courses but the app is full of bugs. Making it unusable.,
sometimes lagging when showing video progress (which I watched and which no) after watching but courses are great!,
"I have not had any problems with this, ""app."" Was able to restart my, ""Course "" without any problems .""",
The app hangs again and again while starting....i have to uninstall it everytime....it just suck...can the developer make it right....i really got irritated,
"Really good, but video watched sometimes does not mark as completed on the web version of the app.",
Please add a bookmark option. Bookmarking a course that i cant do yet but will do in future is best. Please provide that. It won't be that difficult i guess.,
I loved this app. And the courses are amazing totally worth it and helpful to increase my knowledge.,
I wish the app has a separate theme of its own instead of just adapting to the phone's theme which reduced the readability.,
"Top notch information, uses real course outlines, and easy to follow along.",
"This app could be so useful, but it doesn't even show me all of the courses I am enrolled in.",

This is a good platform to improve your skill,
Cannot continue any courses after disabling flight mode. The app just asks you to check your connection.,
It's the new learning planet to become a professional.,
This application is wondeful but the problem behind this application is when we used to see ofline videos the video lags which quite sometimes make you annoying and anger.,
The app is great! I just want to have the save note feature in there as well same as the website version,
It helps you learn.. I wish they had language courses as well.. Otherwise it's well oreanted,

"The content is awesome but the recent interface is quite glitchy and inconvenient, please work on it",
"Freezes on downloads, cant cancel download, cant download offline content. Isn't it the purpose of mobile app? Plenty of 1 Star reviews, Google showing just one and all reviews good.",
Can we have Continue button on Courses. Its TDS to find the Video from where I need to do continue especially when there are many weeks in a Course.,
you are doing great üëç work üëè,
It has been a very great learning journey. I hope more quality courses show up.,
"When I load Coursera it's saying , connect and retry. I have stable net connection.how can I resolve this? I tried refreshing it but nothing's happening.",

"Self learning is important in today's VUCA world. Coursera offers a really comprehensive, methodical and genuinely helpful Learning Ecosystem. Wide variety of topics and quite a number of universities.",
No one has reviewed my assignment. It's not my fault. But how the task could be overdue for me. Don't ask me to send a mail in this regard. Copy the text and share it within your organization.,
"Except some limitations, this app is awesome. It's easy to complete lessons with this app than computer.",
I've completed around 8 courses from this app and it has been an amazing experience! Thank you!,
This is still best app for coursing.. Hope there's another payment method for certification. Coz not everyone have cc.. Google play payment will be awesome.,
"I will give this app one star, because since, I downloaded the app the course video doesn't play. Please I will like Coursera to work on it.",
Makes It easier to learn üòä,
"Good, but it doesn't recognize when an assignment has been submitted, it keeps getting flagged as overdue.",
My app's interface keeps getting dark even though I've tried really hard to find a way to fix it. This has had a huge impact on my experience. How do I restore it?,
After the recent update a half of my paid course do not apper anymore in this app; have to access them on my desktop only; bizarre and highly irritating,
"not optimized for the large screen on the S10+, surprisingly, as this is the most popular android phone right now",
"I applied in HTML course and video are not downloading, it is stuck on one point after that downloading is not completed in whole day.",

I hope you are familiar with the conditions of CE students regarding the campus selection in comparison of CSE, IT, ECE so i request you to provide more and more courses for Civil engineering students",
I think the app should have a wishlist so that one can list the courses that they want to enroll later.,

Absolute trash platform with 0 customer support. Big data course is so outdated half the tutorials don't work.,
very good tool to learn something at comfort of your home and at your own time... truly a miracle of modern technology,
Good quality courses but pathetic doubt clearing. The 'so-called mentors' reply to the doubts after 2-3 days. If you have any cross question then wait for 2-3 days again. It significantly drops the overall experience.,

Some Bugs are not fixed yet. On python (automation by Google)quiz python snippets aren't displayed.,
"The app continuously saying 'please connect and retry. How am I writing this if I am not connected? Fix this bug, please.",
This app sucks. It doesn't allow to cancel the account and I don't want they have my data however they don't want to unenroll me. Is awful,

Lot of knowledge we can get through this platform,
I would appreciate if the app has auto rotate functions. Not everyone using the phone one way only.,
Doesn't cast on Chromecast devices. What a scam. Can't cast on smart TV and many other devices.,
it is fantastic way of learning with comfortable time duration of every course and strong rules for doing work,
Bring back the old version!! Watching videos became really hard with the last update!!,
Easy to use. The free option is available but only if you go directly to the individual lessons.,
Not loading course. We paid you to learn. Fix the problem please. Do you realize how many 1 star you received. This APP is like a zombie now.,
"I tried opening my course, it says it can't open your courses and the app shuts down. Kindly fix this problem",

Amazing for open learning,
Good learning platform,
I rate it one star because I am Mining Engineering student and I want to grow my skills and knowledge to this field but in this application there is very few topics that are related to mining engineering....,
Can't disable subtitles when casting. They are in the way of important information.,
One of the best educational sites. The application is very easy to use and keep track of your courses and progress.,
It's helps me manage my courses on coursera effectively. I especially love the download feature,
It is Providing a very good opportunity for curious students. I am just loving this app.But I have one concern please reduce time for 15 days,
"Not working. Everytime I open it, without loading it close automatically and also close other apps",
Good for Course,
Cannot delete my card it made an payment. And for the same price we can do 5-6 courses in some other application.,
Too costly. All the course and every material is way too expensive. Waste of money.,
The app is crashing and when doing assignment it tell that there is no internet connection when it is connected to internet pls make an updated version of the app pls make the app stable,

When i try the app it seems broken. I could not even copy the assignment to review hopefully please fix it.,
Works well with Chromecast. Running transcript stays synced as well which is appreciated,
"after the last update, the navigation bar (I don't know what it called acctually but the buttons play, seek, next video, etc...) doesn't hide even if I press on the playing video",
Coursera facilitates learning by giving learners the avenue to master concepts through a flexible platform for learning.,
It's great but it was better if you didn't perform a limitation for korean and Iranian.... Sharing knowledge is totally separate of politics.,
"The earlier you learn about it, the better it becomes. Blow the horn and start the race today. Coursera is the best you won't regret putting it a go.",
"Woow I hadn't seen any app to learn whatever stuffs like coursera, so if you're searching for knowledge this is your best choice. I love this app, I don't change it for anything.",
Horrible app for customer service. They make it very difficult to cancel subscription and delete account.,
I faced problems with my courses I started as soon as my financial aid had approved and when I finished the course I didn't receive any certificate also I can't do any change in my profile through this app,
"Exceptional app for learning, thank a lot for providing so much great content. Love from India , thank you.",

"This is a great platform to learn skills , especially it provides Financial Aid option for selected courses so everyone can learn .",
the video is so buggy please fix it. I've heard this platform is good so I've been using it but the recent glitches in the app is really disappointing me,
This is the best online learning app. The thing I like best in this app is I can download online class and can use offline.,
"Facing media player issue ,always stops working. If I go back or switch between apps",
"the payment of subscription of the course Google IT Support is being denied to process from your end.this is causing problem's to me as I am not able to pursue that Course,Same problem has occurred during my ongoing course of Python For Everybody by University of Michigan.Please look into this matter and do the needful to process the payment as soon as possible to avail my subscription",

I'm really surprised by the quality of the courses. I could not believe that there are free ( at least most of them). Thank you Coursera!,
New update is sucks.i can't close navigation options in a video.this app always keep my phone at high temperature.,
"Numerous helpful online courses offer on this platform, good for self-studying and part-time learners.",
Coursera is a great learning platform. Their financial aid is awesome also. Everyone needs to be here!,
Since i updated the app i am experiencing problems to get my courses and take assignments. I wish I didn't updated it.,
My learning on Coursera is not comparable with other platforms Coursera has done well by providing an interactive virtual learning environment that is almost in the picture of real life environment,
doesn't work. internet and device work fine. the app is just not working.,
Excellent Leaning Environment!!!,
My phone starts heating like crazy whenever I start Coursera app since last update please fix this issue asap ! (I am using OnePlus 7),
Why coursera is promoting certain banking & payment institutions/methods. Kindly make it universal as I felt challenging. If need any consultancy do tell.,
Good and interactive but sometimes it takes time to respond or courses take time to load in specializations under My learning section,
"I am able to stream on YouTube at 720p But coursera application is saying no internet connection. Worst possible application ever, i felt",
User friendly. Makes it easy to complete courses faster.,
"It is showing sorry, error. And so I am unable to complete my assignment and thus course. Please help",
"The downloaded video are lagging and the lag time continues to increase, And to fix it you have to restart the app",
"Hi, the app worked brilliantly initially but is now blank. All the course information is no longer there.",
very good platform to show who you are!,
"Coursera is a great platform for learning, the application is particularly easy to use.",
The courses are from major universities from across the world. But too costly for college students.,
Specialization courses are brilliantly packed with good information..but payment service is bad not an easy payment mode to make transaction from India.,
This is very helpful and we also got many opportunities to build our skills and learn different course.,
Best learning platform. The best thing I loved about it is it's arrangement of course structure.,
Application very nice ‚ù§Ô∏è,
To much bugs. The main feature it needs to be added is to view assignment doc/pdf/pptx file using the app not the browser üòí.,
"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE. My daughter registered for a 11 week course and we made payment. After 3 weeks, she was unable to see the course progress and her Id is disabled and we have lost our money. No way to reach people who manage the application and site. I suggest everyone to please beware of this app and site.",
The app isn't displaying content. It is showing retry even after I have cleared cache.,
"Excellent app, a very educative and necessary tool for anyone that is willing to learn something new everyday regardless",
Coursera courses are good. I wish i should have had such online courses during my student days.,
"App crashes, i cant log in. Also the website is the same. Can you tell us what is happening. Nothing is work, plz explain",
Will be great if you can integrate dark mode to the app. It's too bright for me.,
Totally useless! I can't download courses through my data .This asks for wifi connection all the time,
Very nice and easy to use,
Very insightful learning app. Coursera is a goal. I suggest you recommend to your loved ones.,
"the ""save note"" option which is essential for online courses and is available in the web-based coursera is missing.",
I love this app,
Troubleshooting in contact with help center... It do not subscribe selected couse n shows another course subscribed. Very bad service,
They changed me for two months but my account is inactive and not registered or taking any course. it is shame.,
"Pretty much better in browser than the app, I'm using tablet and the landscape mode of the screen isn't stable at all",
Please add dark theme to android,
At the beginning it was perfect but now its starting to crash and slow down a lot and load slowly.,
it would be nice to know what the prices are before enrolling. It makes it difficult to know if you can afford to do a course without initial costs,
coursera is a great platform to learn different courses through online at reasonable pay which is helpful to many students all over the world,
I love Coursera. It is an excellent way to pick up knowledge in different fields.,
Amazing and very helpful.,
How is that possible?? This app shows same account for two registration IDs and then shows error!!!,
"I have been trying to buy certificate for completed course, but with no success yet.there is no guidance available from customer support.",
You can learn many things in free without certificate.. If you want certificate then good to go with fee.,
So far so good. Works just like the web version just more compact. Love it for when I am on the go.,
All I get from this app is messages saying the course can not be completed with the app. Pointless.,
It is very user friendly as well as interactive techniques very important aspect.,
"1 star for the app developer, can't log in. It shows ""account linked to social account"" error while trying to log in with Google.",
I really like this program so far it is amazing. I'm learning this information really quickly. Thank you so much for having a app like this.,
"no words, just a master piece",
I would've given it a 5 star but the video player is buggy and I can't install older version as it keeps auto updating üòë,
Coursera you're a life changer. You don't know how much my life has turned around in the last 3 years. Invaluable knowledge üôåüôå,
"Content is super exciting, but the app is a big fail. Never opens quickly. Hung often.",
Provide dark mode for night time listening to lectures. Provide a option to add courses to favourites.,
Cousera is a wonderful platform with a great app. i just wish they could add windows app to their app collections,
this makes getting my certificate class on the fly so easy,
An amazing intellectual platform! One of the seven best things I have been enjoying in the past decade!,
"Keeps logging me out everytime you update, very inconvenient. Udemy is much better, never requires me to login everytime I launch their app.",
I expected to be able to highlight and save notes like on the web version. Can you please fix this?,
Really good educational app. Thankyou for creating the free access during the lockdown period. User-friendly app:),
I love this appüòä,
Learning has never been so great than this...i love this app even though it forces me to use a desktop for some assignments....,
Downloaded videos seems not being played but still using online streaming. Quite bad user experience.,
Scammers. They take your money and you would never be able to contact them. It had happened to me so trying to make everyone aware.,
best courses for career growth. they provide financial aid for needy students.,
This app is still getting crash in my device. Please try to fix it soon I'm learning something from Coursera..,
why the app has such a great insistence to put the delete button in places that there's a high possibility that you touch it accidentally?,
Why is the video loading so glitchy and then it stops bothering to load video after a few minutes . My internet is fine,
Provide excellent learning resource,
Video hangs in between after using the aop for 5minutes so i have to see it on browser. It is not my phone problem it is app problem,
App keeps crashing my tablet. Seems from the other review that this is not an isolated thing.,
great experience for coursera thank you,
This app can help you build your life ...... It contains every subject you need to build your career . I recommend it .,
Asks to login when offline. Defeats the whole purpose of downloading videos to view offline. Fix this by allowing access to downloaded videos when offline instead of asking to login.,
Terrible service. There is no 800# or chat support. Good luck getting customer service. I'm telling everyone how terrible it is. DO NOT USE!!!,
The best app for learning even if you dont have money you can learn through COURSERA very very thankfull to coursera.,
good app buy when you're taking some courses they talk of podcasts being part of the lesson but the podcasts are nowhere to be found,

I found some errors while reproducing videos from one of the courses I've taken.,
After Updating... Video and Subtitles are not matching with each other. Fix it out.,
3 stars because I really hate the system of being reviewed by other students. First of all we have to wait a lot for our reviews and secondly the reviews might not be reliable.,
"!Discrimination Why here isn't option for auditing. In describtion of courses there are (mostly) option using materials for free.But when you choose to enroll or subscribe for a courses there are only one option, to pay. Where is poor people's like me Right for Education?",
it's really very good platform to learn new skills and develop our knowledge in our career.we can boost our career with new skills.,
Been a long time user of this app. The download feature is useful especially when you travel.,
I recommend multiple install for example to have an app on the phone at the same time on my PC using the same account detail.,

Good Platform for learn,

Very disappointing. I've canceled the subscription but it renewed it all by itself.,
unbeatable online app and online education. superb content. supportive to learner. just excellent.,
Everything else is good except that the progress in the app and web is not synchronized!,
Love Coursera! For someone who wants to learn but can't afford going back to school this is amazing!,

Every payment option I have used gives an error on the app as well as the website. Very poorly made app.,

There is no option to download assignments in the mobile app which is a big disadvantage in my opinion,
"Online courses, very useful, lot of learnings.",
Coursera needs to let us block discussion post notifications without also blocking deadline notifications. There is like thousands of people taking this course so the discussion post notification goes off every hour.,
I have found some certs that will help me start my new career but I don't see a button to enroll in them.,
It becomes awful...good bye coursera. Moving to other platforms.,

Clear and easy way to learn and detailed explanation,
Did you know that course readings don't appear correctly when the phone is on dark mode?,
the way they tie up with stakeholders like google and make the courses easy to learn and also the benefit of the certificate having significant benefits in your CV makes it a complete package,
This app is terribly slow. Learn tab keeps loading forever.,
App is trash. Charged me 49 bucks doesn't work on top of that you can't get a hold of a rep or any support you get a 1800 number that isn't affiliated with Coursera or has any idea what they are. Aviod this scam.,

"It has come to my attention that there are other learners on this website who think that it's OK to give other people bad grades and leave zero feedback to support it. I have personally been victim of this for my first assignment. When I see this happening, I will report you. Has any of this happened to any other learners here? Before you resubmit an assignment after such horrible feedback, I would personally recommend that you report the other learner for their violation of the Honor Code. "" You may not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve your results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others."" Upon relaying this information off the the ""support"" team, I was basically told they aren't going to do ANYTHING about it. I ended my email with these two statements: ""I repeat, this is a violation of the Honor Code. If you don't make any reciprocation's for this learner's actions, I'm no longer going to continue using this site and I will make sure that other people don't fall victim to utilizing it either."" ""It is my duty to report these violations and it is your duty to make reciprocation's for these actions."" Don't spend any money through this website or app unless you know for sure that your courses aren't subject to this highly flawed grading system.",

By banning the Russian courses and discriminating against the students who live there you are punishing many for the actions of a few. You give the anti-western propaganda machine in Russia the arguments to justify their position and literally act Russophobic yourself. Your decision is a shame for anyone who truly cares about education.,

To join Coursera,
Is this free,
L{'~you guzzling,
i loove soo much,
Stupid ui ux,
This app is the best. I'm learning so much in the smallest time and lot's of the courses are very compehensive.,
This is a very great platform to learn any course of choice even with no prior knowledge on the course,
"It is wonderful learning platform, long live Coursera.",
Wonderful app that serves the purpose for which it was created for.,
just starting. learning is taking place,
Revolutionary!,
nice,
"I am a regular user of coursera. I mainly use Web Version on desktop but I use this app to keep Track of my progress. Suggestion : ‚ù§Ô∏è Hey developers, I really love having the Course progress UI in the ""Learn"" page but I feel the Widget that can be added to Homescreen has next to no insights.It just opens Learn, Explore and Search tab. It would be so engaging and useful if you can add another widget to this app which we, as learners, can add to our homescreen and Course Name with Progress Bar.",
"Horrific app, poor design, unorganized, unintuitive and bad to navigate - very bad UI; better to use Udemy if course is available there",
"It's a great application when it comes to being able to download videos and be able to watch offline, although the downside is that there are fewer filter options when searching for something and it takes a while to load the data and though a desktop version would be great it still has needs a few updates in order for it to function at its fullest abilities.",
Really appreciate Coursera for being the only one in the space where anyone could get a course/certificate regardless of their financial situation thanks to the the financial aid program. Keep up the good work!,
this is most important thing in your live.. thanks Coursera,
"It's recommended for everyone to explore,learn and grow in life.",
the app is a game changer for me. I can listen to the videos while I clean or grocery shop.,
the best online teaching experience I have ever had,
Coursera is the best online platform to learn different courses.,
Superb platform to learn all the courses,
Amazing stuff. Lessons and resources are superb.,
very nice and simple learning app,

Careful with Coursera. They will find ways to keep charging your credit card. Sign up at your own peril. You can't sort the courses by date of creation. In fact you can't see the date of creation of a course anywhere. You can't bookmark courses.,

If you want to download the course materials then you need this app, unfortunately. The app also does not download all the course materials such as notebooks etc., so it's a bit of a pain if you want to archive anything offline for reference as you still need to get these manually even though you've clicked to download everything for a particular week.",

"The video once paused on the app, doesn't start again. It glitches as in starts for a second and then pauses again. It's a faulty media player I guess.",
"EDX is better. Coursera is just a money-grab now, selling subscriptions rather than promoting education. The app is just a sales platform for subscriptions now.",
Great app but missing essential features like: 1. Video rotation 2. Mini player 3. Lock screen 4. Forward/Rewind X seconds,

I have been using Coursera for several weeks now, but am only just trying the app. The only things I wish it had are (1) a wishlist function to save courses you'd like to take later and (2) a way to take and save notes (or even better, use the notes function built into the website). Other than that, great work!",

Reducing my original rating. Great platform but app is really bad. Content watched offline and quizzes taken won't sync properly once you're back online. And even offline contents won't load properly. Had to manually go to airplane mode to get it working.,
"I love this application very much. One problem is when using android tablets, ""this app may not be optimized for your device!""... but it works... The other problem is that when opening the app in landscape mode, it doesn't display nicely, it displays horizontally... which is annoying, but once in the course, it display in landscape mode.... could this be repaired?  This app should be designed to be shown in tablets (horizontally) and not only vertical.",
"I can't access video lectures and assignments anymore, it just shows me blank pages for each week and nothing loads. Please fix",
"Wow, the designers did a superb job on this UI! A year ago it wasn't as good. Great job designers!",
the app is really good for learning many things but I have a problem viewing the videos on my smart TV. how can I fix that?,

"Coursera is great online, but this app has several annoying bugs. For example, the web version shows the ""Suggested Reading"" chapters correctly, but the Android and iOS versions don't; optional assignments aren't counted as unfinished work on web or iOS, but they do on the Android version; etc. Uninstalling, will come back in a few months to see if it's any better. UPDATE: a year later: all bugs fixed! Excellent app now, thanks.",
"Some of the resources and options available on the desktop site is unavailable on the app, or not as easily visible as on the site. Apart from that, the app has been a great help!",
"This app has been great but needs some update. My main issue is that the app doesn't open in offline mode. After downloading and saving the videos for offline mode, I expect the app to open without internet so one can view the videos offline.",
"The app is causing the phone to vibrate continuously when I click on save 
offline. It just doesn't stop and the battery is draining rapidly. I don't 
know what is triggering the vibration motor of the ohone to vibrate 
continuously. But please fix it ASAP.",
"Best ever Online learning experience on coursera. But compartively edX have more features than Coursera. edX have courses from worlds top universities like Harvard, Columbia and MIT etc but Coursera only have courses of Stanford etc. Hope More improvements in future.",
"Please make it adaptable to landscape view. Some pages, like the home page, opens and stays in potrait view.",
Edit: thanks for fixing the issue.,

"Old version worked very well.New one does not allow me to login a pops a network error message. PLEASE fix this , I am falling behind with my progress. Same goes for certification these are no longer available online views on LinkedIn but rather a Coursera home page opens",
"Some videos won't load, but this can be fixed by deleting all data. The download option for videos disappeared. Would like the option to change speed on videos. As is it seems difficult to complete a course using only the app, which is all I can use as my computer time is extremely limited.",
Although the online marerial for study is good. The app should improve downloading for offline study . . .,
I'm really inspired by there hardwork,
Good job!!!!!!,
I love it,
Simply Fantastic,

Appreciated that the new app now support rotation while viewing the coruse. Hopefully screen rotation could be supported on other screen as well.,
nice app,
"Nice UI, very easy to navigate throughout course content on the go. However there seems to me a bit of an issue in playing animations in the course as it is displayed as a plain image. I've signed up for a networking course and it's important for me to understand animations on how message gets transmitted and etc. If u could fix that it'd be nice",
"Very sluggish performance, even on high-end phones. Keeps hanging while accessing downloaded content also.",
Just installed the app on my Samsung Tablet and when I try to log in after putting my password an error pops up saying to check my internet connection when I actually connected. Uninstalled it ad reinstalled and error still comes up. Please fix,
"I have created an account with Facebook.My phone was hard reseted and when 
I download it again and when I try to login its saying unable to find 
profile.please help",
Though I have completed five weeks.It shows network error when I log in.I tried many times. Pls do something to stop this issue.,
"Just installed this. Unable to login. Keeps telling me there is a network error and that I'm not connected to the internet, even though I am. Most frustrating, hope they fix whatever the issue is.",
Coursera used to be great. You could study for free and if you need a certificate than you pay. Now all the lectures and courses are behind the pay wall.,
"Tried multiple times to login, every time it is showing network error, although my internet is fully operational. Tried reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, rebooting the device. None of it works. Tried to use on mipad.",
It is n0t l0ging me in 0n app with my acc0unt... Net is available all the apps are w0rking pr0perly but when i l0gin t0 this app.. It sh0ws internet err0r check ur c0nnecti0n üò£ frustrating meüò£,
5 Sept 2018. The latest update has effectively destroyed offline use. It used to work very nicely but now it is impossible. I am a longterm Coursera user and i depend on offline for study while on the train. Plesse fix it ASAP,
Sir I am not able to log in via any means using Facebook or Gmail . It shows error check email or could not found Facebook Id Please help,
"So apparently almost everyone, including me can't login to the app because it keeps showing ""no internet connection"" while I can stream videos on YouTube with ""no connection"". Funny thing is the whole Coursera team is turning a blind eye to this issue. I hope you don't open your eyes to see half of your users gone. Please fix this issue.",
It is failing to get sign in. After uninstalling and reinstalling several times it still not working. My network is perfectly fine but still it is showing network error.,
"Coursera is great. With MOOC's becoming popular, it's platform is rising as top guru of similar platforms. I've been using coursera for over two years now, taking many courses and Specializations. I added the achievements to my resume and LinkedIn, and was able to score a promotion. I strongly advise trying Coursera out.",
"Great platform for learning, the app makes it easy and mobile. Update broke it I think it does not support older android versions but updates should be blocked for incompatible devices.",
The app is always saying error connection it's not working I got a good internet connection,
"lot of revenue, and all this time the app still crashes in video play",
I am not able to sign in my profil. there is a problem with network.,
I love Barbara Oaklay's course learning how to learn and mindshift. Thank you so much.,
The app is not getting logged in to. I am getting the Check your internet connection error despite having hi-speed internet connected. Please update the app soon.,
Everytime i try to login it shows network error...its frustratingüëé,
Not able to login in after I reinstalled it. Please help,
can't log in can't create a new account just rubbish,
Cant login please fix it.,
"Good app for learning, hope this helps your AI engine. you guys rock.",
You can't even creat an account because it says no internet connection and that is not even right..,
It gives you lots of skills sets for like business management.,
Very slow and unresponsive in Offline mode,
Almost impossible to find the delete account button.,
Excellent experience with coursera by interacting with world standard professors.,
Best app for learning and improving your skills.,
Just tried to delete my account it wouldn't take my password I set. And the courses are not free .,
I am feeling confident. üòç,
This application can't let me to access my account coursera even i try 3G & wifi,
I not use Facebook .and this app not open without fb,

"Permissions for calendar: no more updates for me.i am not sure if the previous issues have been fixed. I could not access the program without being connected to the internet. So that is a failed start. I do appreciate the program and what they do is great, but this app with no internet access is garbage.cannot use without internet, even though I have gigs downloaded for offline use. Major fail. This is not a new issue and is on multiple devices.",
"Installed and reinstalled on my galaxy tab. It does not let me login 
complaining about network connection. Courses a is a great service but this 
apps's quality is very low. I have it on my android phone and it works 
there but even on a working instance the interface is not easy to work 
with. Hope it gets improved.",
"The videos have stopped working properly, they get to a point and the sub 
titles continue on the bottom but video and audio just stop working. I 
thought maybe it was my connection but it's both wifi and cellular data so 
it is a problem.with the app itself, please fix it and I will improve 
rating.",
Taking a course in this app helped me to have a better looking resume which allowed me to get the job I've always dreamed of. I recommend it a lot.,
"The app fine for me until I fill up a answer then clicking ""Next"" button 
and if u come back the input box is filled with hash strings. I don't why 
but if u submit I pretty sure u will get fails in the test",
"It just keep loading. Only working in offline mode. Even after giving all 
the permissions it is not able to connect to internet.",
"Don't ever install this app.. I'd paid my fee once , next time they 
credited from my account without my permission. I don't know how they done 
that, they're not replying for that. When I enquired about it in bank , 
bank authority said that they're kinda doing fraud activity. They took cash 
even without a OTP... Please be careful..",
"Great app overall. I love how you can take your courses on the go and 
offline. Really helpful for those pesky data caps.it's great and the dev 
team is super supportive. Keep up the good work",
"According to their support (which is laughable), there's issues with 
submitting assignments and performing peer reviews, and their staff is 
aware of this. Honestly, if there's issues and you're aware, but unwilling 
to resolve them, disable those ""features"" and simply have this app be for 
watching/reading the coursework and have the app itself direct us to the 
website to do the rest; I'm astounded that I needed to have a pointless 
chat because I got an error while attempting to submit a support ticket, 
all just to find out that they're aware of the issue, and without telling 
you directly, simply direct you to the website rather than address the 
issue. I Suppose you'll get what you pay for, seeing as how you get an 
abridged course from a higher education institution that you may otherwise 
not have been able to afford. The quality of the content varies wildly, 
even across tertiary classes of the same course from the same college, just 
presented by a different professor. (The subtitles on one actually said 
""[inaudible]"" in my first class!!) The faculty should really just write the 
content and let professional presenters deliver it, every class I took 
started with something to the effect of ""I'm used to being in a classroom 
so being in front of a camera is making me nervous, sorry."" Please take a 
page out of PBS-Digital's book and have presenters in front of the camera. 
It works for Craah Course and all of PBSD's other YouTube shows. TL;DR: 
Coursera is a great concept, but is being implemented... ok. Just ok. They 
could definitely do worse, but there's absolutely room for improvement.",
"Updated to latest version, showing offline mode only, cant browse anything, 
I have tried via both cellular and WiFi, no change. Reinstalled still same 
issue. There was no issue till previous version.",
"The feature where audio comes without the phone screen on is the one makes 
this app standout with the other of this kind of apps. :)",
"This is a great app for the student like me and also for other to enhance 
and develop their potential in their interested field. Thank you so much 
for helping us ‚ù§‚ù§",
"I would strongly recommend every learner to download this app to benifit 
the most of its useful courses ... Many thanks AHMAD",
"App says network error. I am not able to login using the same password 
which i am using on my desktop. Tried re installing the app but error 
stayed. Password reset not working.",
"With the new update, I have to login again and again, every time I go back 
to changing to the next or previous video of the course. This was not the 
case earlier. And it was a great app.",
"The app works for some courses. The customer service for the company is 
godawful. Always keep in the back of your mind that you CANNOT get your 
money back for any subscription course, even if it is broken on their end. 
A shady business practice.",
"After an update I can't log in with a network error, though my credentials

"I downloaded the app to be able to watch the videos and read the course 
content on the go, because that's when I have time to do it. however, 
although I can watch the videos, the course reading materials don't show 
any links (which are visible on laptop), so it's not possible to read any 
of that if you don't have your laptop. this is very annoying because my 
course has only few videos but quite a few readings. it doesn't help to 
progress as quick as I'd like to!! please, this needs fixing!",
"Hi, I'm having an issue with enrolling in courses. It seems that even 
though I've chosen to enroll I can't access any of the course material 
without clicking the enroll button every single time. It doesn't show up in 
my courses after that and I have to directly search for it and re-enroll 
every time. I love your app and would love to be able to use it but it's 
really turned into a hot mess and I can't see myself doing anything with it 
until it's user friendly again.",
"The earlier versions of app used to syn with google calendar. So it was 
very easy to complete all assignments in time. Please enable this again",
"I like the new design of this app, but there's one thing you need to

There should be an option to increase size of fonts.",
"Thank you coursera team im speechless, u helped me so much actually, thanks

"It's a great app, generally, except it keeps freezing my phone from time to 
time when used in offline mode, requiring me to take out and replace the 
battery of the phone. I updated to the latest version, and it's still 
happening. That's just frustrating, cos one could lose important stuff that 
one is working on because of this behavior. Then it's just frustrating on 
its own.",
"Wow, great example of taking a working, usable app and messing it up 
completely. I can see courses for which I'm not enrolled in my courses, but 
not the ones for which I am enrolled. When I did manage to get to lectures 
I wanted to watch (fortunately I'm redoing a course, otherwise there's no 
way to get to the lectures), downloading a lecture results in the scroll 
position bouncing around so I keep having to scroll to the lectures I want 
to download.",
"Constantly seeing messages ""Error loading forums"" and ""There was an error 
loading the course content"" even with stable connection. Poor 
synchronization with the web app, works only with wi-fi. Videos ticked off 
as watched randomly turn back into unwatched the next session. If a course 
has text post with images, the app only downloads the text (even on wi-fi), 
so the images are missing when reading offline. Can't force the images to 
load through the mobile network, even with all the settings allowing mobile 
downloads.",
"I cannot access any of the course. I keep getting ""error"" messages anytime 
i try to enroll in courses material.",
"On web browser I can just press ‚Üí on keyboard to skip unnecessary content.

courses! Perfect for anyone who loves space and/or mythology as they offer 
quite a wide selection.",

of the videos on sd card ..",

much better than Edx for example",
"surprised that the downloaded videos are not available when there is no

folders, or bookmark courses of interest.",

"Its an awesome app to dive in knowledge from academic sources. Well 
organized. I am in Love with this app. Thank you very much @coursera.",

"This used to be a very good app, but the new user interface took all the 
fun away. Startup is now very slow and depends heavily on Internet 
connection, otherwise some downloads can't be accessed. I also find it less 
usable than before, and support has never been able to solve my technical 
problems (they always tell to reinstall the app, which of course is not a 
solution if that app is bad in first place).",

working.... White screen... Or bug fixing issue .....app is good but the

studying from professors of great colleges like Stanford,cit etc ...these 
are 10 points bcz of which i love Coursera over others and love this app a 
lot",

can't download video lectures. Progress bar just hangs near the end and 
after some time resets. It drastically decreases it's usefulness.",
"App doesnt notify you when your free trial is ending or whenever payment is 
automatically made.",
Courses used to be free. Now everything is $50-80 per month.,

Best one in the playstore..!!,
Amazing!,

Great learning app,
"EDIT: I said I would change my rating if they fixed it, and they have. 5 
stars. I love coursera, especially as a writer, because I can learn a great 
deal about a multitude of subjects. PLEASE fix your app. I used to LOVE 
this app. Now, every time I try to enroll in a course, I get ""error loading 
enrollment data."" If you fix this is can change the rating I gave it.",
"There's no way i can get the ID verification done, tried their customer 
support twice but they too couldn't help! It feels really bad when I 
finished my whole course and I now can't buy the certificate, please fix 
this",
"The deadlines need to sync to Google calendar. The app lacks a lot of the 
functionality of the website limiting how much of the coursework can be 
done from mobile.",
"I think this is the best idea anyone ever come up with. Self paced learning 
plus financial aid for some of the courses",
"the new design looks OK but the responsiveness of the app is not 
good.scrolling within a course content suffers a lot, breaking up every 2 
items.switching between weeks is extremely slow.when the app starts and I 
am offline even with downloaded courses, most of the pages are empty and 
content is missing.needs a lot of work.",
"This app is good. But in my device when video is not start In actual size 
after I pause the video and play again then the video fit my screen.",
"Weird that their coding modules don't work on the app. Makes it pretty 
useless in my case",
"Having this app is crucial for me. I've been able to complete courses 
because if the reminders I've set up and the ease of access to the content 
from my courses.",
"The worst Education App ever..They Deduct Money from your account without 
your consent,no pre notification nothing..Don't use this app or else they 
will steal all your money from your personal accounts Guys. Totally bunch 
of crooks.",
"Hard to navigate and browse the courses, doesn't provide contextual 
navigation (you go back and need to start again)",
"The new update design is not nice. However would like to report a bug. the 
course defaults to week one when I press back button on any lesson as 
against earlier when it would take you to the current weeks list of lessons.",
"One of the best app on playstore. Only thing which bothers me is while 
watching lectures is really difficult to move it forward or backward.",

it. Fix that and youve got your 5 stars",

Excellent App....works fluidly and was very easy to access all the content,
It is very easy to understand But certificate fees is very high,

specialisation.",

Good app,

Superb App,
Very useful,
Nice,
awesome,

Good,
"Great app! I loved the new design but the performance of the offline 
feature should improve. Also, when I audit the courses, those graded 
assignments should be excluded from the requirement of ""completing"" an 
audited course. It's annoying to have the app tell me to join the next 
class when I've already viewed the materials (lectures, practice questions 
etc.) of the audited course.",
Gave you 5 stars because I've never had the urge to use this app and always worked on desktop. There is no way to bookmark to the Google Play my favorite apps and I have to remove apps to get storage space. Keep the good work!,
"Is a good app, but doesn't load unless connected to the internet, even if 
you download the content, only videos and some text appears, math doesn't. 
Would be nice to have personal list of favorite courses (my favorites/wish 
list).",
"Would like to put 1 star, but i like content. New version is totally 
disguisting!!! Offline doesnt work interface not good, even after 4 days 
cant get how its works. How i can get previous one ? Opt out automatic 
updates ...",
I use coursera on PC but videos on app are of dramatic quality. Other videos o my computer are ok. Content is great here and it's the only reason I don't give 1 star...,
"This app is really fantastic, it's let you learn quickly, many free 
courses, questions in between of videos, the sync between website and aap 
content, I am too software developer and it's one of the best application I 
have ever used in my life.",
App was not optimized for tablet to begin with. Now they discontinued support for older android versions.,
"Excelente la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n!! Es f√°cil seguir las clases en idioma 
ingl√©s ya que aparece el texto en la parte inferior y, en general es mucho 
mejor la app con la nueva actualizaci√≥n.",
New update is slow and cannot download lectures for offline anymore. I would like to give 5 stars if it has the offline capabilities of the old version,
"I was registered at Coursera on a course how to speak, the teachers are 
awesome. And clear related stff",
Really love this app. But my country is Viet Nam (not Viet Name),
"The service was better before they started charging a monthly fee. Check 
out EdX",
In quize simbols < ‚â§ ‚â• ‚â• not always visible. Imposible to answer correct.,
"The Coursera app keeps running on the background even without starting the 
app. Is it violating the rules?! Removing the app, since their policy 
really annoys me. Stop ""spying""!",
Knowledge may be key but preparedness is the catalyst,
Has helped a shut in very much,
"Could you please add login with corporate credentials in the app similar to 
website.",
The new ux looks great,
It has many bug's in offline mode,
The new look is absolutely amazing!! Great job!!!,
The best. I love it,
It's suck.text isn't clear,
Wonderful so far,
Awesome,
Impressive,
Great,
Nice,
Teacher,
"It takes long time to open the course and show the downloaded videos when there is no internet connection. It also does not mark videos as watched when they were watched offline. When a video is Chromecast, then paused and Chromecast disconnected, it starts to play all videos watched in this session simultaneously.",
Issues with aspect ratio from last two updates. Both 16:9 and 18:9 settings are not working with full screen.,
I do not give 5 stars just becoz ithe freq update is super annoying. In true I never use any app more often just becoz it appears in the update list.,
Over the years this app has developed into an extraordinary platform for learning. Really like the experience in whole. Keep up the good work!,
"I have been using this app for few years now, learned a lot from it and highly recommended for learners of all ages.",
"great app, but user cannot save courses can't view the saved courses either.",
"Good app, but doesn't allow me to see the courses I'd saved. I'd love to change the rating to a 5 once that's fixed.",
Great! Having the Coursera app on my phone saves me so much time.,
Really great app! Runs smooth and having the ability to study while on the go is so nice.,
This amazing app. All time uses users and sharp mind.,
"Very nice give opportunity to learn something new for free option ,thanks",
Great app for studying but Could you add more free courses,
Good for today not for future; content and app.,
Best free courses on the whole internet,
No certificate or degree diploma here.,
"Awesome , elite resources",
Great work...,

Must have for geeks....,
good,
Like it,
Some times it doesn't response Like considering assignments undone,
Great course app,
Superb,
good,
Love the app and courses available. Please add an autoplay feature for the off-line  lectures.,
pls add 2.5x and 3x speed function,
Nice!!,
"While Coursera is a great platform and I love the resources, the app itself is a PITA to use, at least on my pixel.   The full screen button on videos doesn't seem to work in landscape, and is completely offscreen when in portrait mode. The controls do not lay themselves out according to screen size very well.   Further, the pull down menu doesn't seem to go away when using the back button, which is unintuitive as someone who has used Android for some time, since that would be expected behavior.   However, I can't give too bad a rating as the app at least does work to some extent and I'm very pleased with Coursera as a whole, especially their normal web interface. The app just needs some work.",
"Bad experience. Assignment submissions, grading, and Quicklabs buggy. After 3 straight weeks of chat assurances that my assignments were received with ""A"" grades, all automated assignment submission and tracking failed. 6 weeks of work for nothing, and they barely approved a refund. So disappointed.",
"I downloaded this app for the first time about 3 years ago, but deleted it because it still had so many bugs. So it has been great to see the improvements made. It certain functions the application is more user friendly that the website. A shortcoming however is seeing assignements results and comments in the application.",
Great app and great content. Something small you might have forgotten:player  icons in notification bar is a bit low resolution,
There are unknown errors keeping me from submitting my assignments. This is very inconvenient and time-consuming.,
"Used to work fine but cannot now watch the course videos through the app , very frustrating",
"Amazing UX and design, really responsive customer support, courses are all very well structured and recorded.",
In love with the new interface. It's quite simplified and amazing. Easy to navigate through the course and easy to find new courses.,
Still unable to access quizzes more than once on the app after update.,
This app is well organized and keeps me on track with everything. I cant see my self with out this app!,
Not worth it...too much error occuring and too slow,
"Useful but need improve, app is worse than website",
Great app! I've been recommending it to all my friends!,
New format for your current courses is a PITA to navigate,
Downloaded courses don't work,
If it was possible to read the results from the reviews. It wold help a lot,
Thanks for this app... i can continue my course even if m not at my office.,
Unexpected changes in controls layout when swiping,
It is very useful to this generation to smart our mind,
"Great app,  should be sponsored globally.",
Best site for learning computer skill and development,
Everything is fine but i wish something was for free!,
"Bad, ..everytime.it says..error retrieving course",
Good learning app.,
It's great! :),
Great app for everyone!,
I guess education isn't free either...,
This finest way of learning,
Great!,
It is soo nice,
Good for lifelong learning,
Useful and interesting for me,
Useful,
Grt,
"I think the former user interface is way better than the new one..  Then I'm unable to take tests..  I do this know when classes are to start even from app unlike before..  Lastly,  I can't download for offline purposes.. It's now difficult",
"Pls add the ability to sort between paid and free courses. Secondly,add the ability to search via university name along with Courses. Thirdly, on search when we select the course and then press the back button it takes us to the homescreen. Rather it should take back to the search result",
Don't sign up for free courses. They never start. They just use your email to spam you with advertising. Avoid!,
After the last update it keeps loading or just shows errors repeatedly...,
"It would be better if you provide subtitle file(.vtt) file in app to 
download:)",
Now can carry my course in mobile and any time I can view them. Nice,
Is there any option to give fees via debit card,
This is a million dollar app as far as online learning is concerned.,
Get to learn many technologies,
"The service is good but the app is broken in a few crucial ways. Like quizzes, which will let you start, work on, and finish a quiz before telling you there was a connection error at the end, it doesn't save your results and you don't get feedback. Waste of time and effort to attempt quizzes on mobile. Making the app just a little bit pointless.",
"Assignment submited through this app, doesn't store in an accessible way. It's a major bug. Plse check",
Excellent,
It is a very cool way to learn new things from your phone without having to go to a real school anymore. Just the greatest idea. I just hope there wouldn't be any ads and any glitches to this app as I am going to change the ratings if it has such. Thank you for your help you guys.,
"Coursera for Android looks and works great but I have one gripe, when I uploaded my photo from my laptop it displays my photo in the wrong orientation with in the app.",
"When taking quizzes, the app fails to submit them,  saying""an error has occurred"" on android 7.0 on galaxy s7 edge",
I downloaded the videos so I can view them offline in my Android phone. But it's not working offline. Very disappointed,
"Awesome platform, but android app is not following Can not access to videos offline, courses enrolled vanish from learning yet are marked ""enrolled"" when searching for them in New courses. Whole user experience is poor",
The basic disadvantage that an indian cannot pay the course fee to earn a certificate though the price is given in INR. Not many of us have international debit or credit card. Must need improvement here.,
App regularly fails to upload course content ... Better off just using website,
The course home screen does not work on Android. Also have tried to reinstall the app and access a different course,
App is heavy load even i am using 820 snapdragon processer and high speed network.but the website is load free and fast.,
"I am an engineering student of textile chemistry .I need to some textile courses .Kindly request to coursera teem. Clothes (febric) is most essential for all humen being ,so arrange the textile courses in the your app. Plz... think it",
With the last update there are some issues with captions out of synch,
One of the best learning apps I have come across. From the liveChat to the layout. Wonderful!,
I'm not able to log in or sign up. Please fix it.,
A place where great educators great courses and great learning mixed up,
Thanks a lot for helping people to improve and expand their knowledge,
I liked it since it provides the quality study material...,
Can't even access the course now.,
Coursera is a best platform to learn from top most University Teachers.,
Perfect app. offers good learning and career improving plans,
Great Platform to learn in today's world,
Very good app üòä,
"The assignments never open, it always says I need to check my internet connection no matter what. I'm uninstalling.",
I love this up,
Fantastic design overhaul,
Amazing,
good,
nice,
Add a way to download Assignments,
"This app would have 5 stars if it wasn't plagued with  really annoying bugs. To boot, the app fails miserably to realize when you are offline. The whole point of downloading videos on your phone is to watch them when you are on the go. This app will show an hourglass for literally minutes and minutes, before eventually realizing it's not connected to the net and try at last to read the stored videos. This is really annoying and should be fixed.  The second really annoying bug is losing track of where you were in your videos. If you stop your videos for whatever reason, next time you re-open the app, the video restart from the beginning instead of restarting where you last stopped. Again, really annoying.  If these 2 problems could be fixed, I'd give a 5 stars",
"I am unhappy, Is there anyone to listen. Issue to continue a course.I completed the assignment in apprenet video app but it is not showing my completion in course era app.tbus i am feeling stuck.Please help",
"It doesn't have Iran, in the list of countries for ID verification. Discrimination at its finest moment. Disappointed.",
"Taking 5 (yes, 5!) courses at once, fav has to be Paradoxes of War. Very interesting and easy & fun. I say ""fun"" because the instructor gets very into it & grabs your attn.. I have suggested this app to friends already, an at least 1 signed up.. I love that you have the option of taking the courses for free! There is nothing I don't like about this app, thank you so much for making it!!!",
This is an awesome app overall. Here i have stucked with an issue here... This app is suddenly logout.. in between and now i am unable to login even through Facebook login option... N UI of the login page is looking wiered too... Please look into it,
"It gave a lot of support for my further education than my school works. I LOVE THIS and I share this with my friends, then they also. &lt; 3",
"Quite good app, but there are some problems with peer review (radio buttons for rates became not visible on the second problem when I tried to make one)",
After the update it did not load my course. Very unhappy,
It's a nice app but It would be better if the assignments assignments were marked  for who were not ready to pay for the certificate yet,
Full of bugs! Video playback is horrible and app crashes very frequently.,
Pretty basic app. All it does is open the website in a browser. Fullscreens doesn't work on videos. Needs work.,

I can't access my offline content unless I open the app online first. Bit of a bummer if I want to use it on the tube,
"As at today, January 23rd, the latest version doesn't complete video download for offline use. Please hold on to what you have for now.",
it stopped play video on last update. I hard to reinstall it to make it work. Seems this is an update issue only.,
I couldn't download videos again for offline use in this updated version. Please fix this malfunction.,
"The app doesn't update with what I have done online, it's telling me I haven't submitted an assignment when I have and that I've only reviewed three peers when I've done 5",
"Videos does not load, hangs, freezes there. I have also send feedback multiple times. Not able to use app to continue learning",
Great site. Bad app. Can't view videos because it says oops something went wrong check your network connection,
"I'm taking my education on to a higher level and Coursera is making my part a whole lot easier, faster and economical. A total win win situation",
If i can't look into the course content then why download it? It is amusing how coursera is ridiculing itself. Thanks for helping me waste my time.,
A very adequate app that's surely gonna get a lot of popularity once the people get used to the digital era.,
"It makes learning easy and accessible for people with hectic schedules, anytime, anywhere.",
"This is not stable at all, I can't even load the video",
"Courses used to be free... Maybe it's just the app versions? If I'm playing 50+ bucks for a class it's not going to be on a smartphone or tab. I was mainly looking for a Spanish app.  There is much better out there for much less or  even free, but lot's choices for other classes are here.",
Very interactive and customer care service is the best I have never seen such friendly and supportive employees,
I am thankful for Google team . It is like the pathfinder for rural talents.,
Doesn't load course materials,
Really loved this update . New UI Is just awesome ... Deserved 5 star,
New app set up! So much better. So happy ty.,
Useful application but most courses aren't free & materials aren't available,
More useful for those who are living in village I love this app too thanks Google team,

"In love with coursera online, but app was kinda disappointed. In previous version, download coursera for offline study was not available, contacted customer service, and wait for a month to get solution that did not solve my problem... Uninstalled and installed this new version, now problem is not able to download course on SD card which always showed there's error when download to SD card, don't wanna wait another month, I chose cellphone internal storage for now, please fix this problem ASAP. Thanks, appreciated.",
"You guys have a great website but the app needs improvement.. on a galaxy tablet n8010 it takes up a lot of RAM and keeps freezing. The videos are impossible to play without a download even if there is a good wifi connection and you don't get any notes/tutorial , aterials on the app - basically coursera is great but you can only get the full experience on chrome instead of the app",
"I love Coursera because I've learned useful things there, but their app, though great because it tries to squeeze Coursera's system into my phone, often distresses me. Everyone who went to college suffers from a post-scholastic stress syndrome manifest in dreams of being handed an exam in an unknown language or dreams of getting to class and realizing they forgot to dress. The Coursera app recreates that anxiety by reporting as incomplete lessons I turned in weeks ago, so every time I use the app I then have to rush to my laptop to see if something I completed a week ago is really incomplete. It's nerve-wracking and seriously detracts from what otherwise would make a great University of Phone.",
I use this app with chromecast & there seems to be no way to disable close-captions in the app. This makes watching a lecture very distracting. Please fix this.,
1. There are some technical glitches in the app. 2. The app stores your payment information and subscription is renewed without any prior intimation.,
"Great app but has an issue. It doesn't show up in recent apps. So when I leave the app, I have to start the app from the icon again. Get that fixed and I'd be back with 5üåü",
"I love this app, this app contains a variety of courses and any one can join them .But the price is more please make it cheap .But over all this app is is very use full .Give you knowledge about any thing you want and the professor's are also good and higly qualifyed I recommend this app to everyone .If you want to learn any thing just install this app.",
"Content of some courses is beyond Superiority.... Thanks Coursera, Thanks Faculties   If Video Player is improved with features like in YouTube,...then it will b the best thing",
"Two stars is an average rating between 5 stars for functionality and -1 stars for crashing my system four times within three days! Once it starts to run smoothly, five starts guaranteed.",
"Video player is not working perfectly, I am unable to see complete video, seeing partial video. Video is zoomed in üò£üòïüòî",
I am having problem while downloading videos. It just shows that the video is being downloaded but nothing happens. I am using Moto C plus with Android 7.0,
The website and content are great but since the update I can't watch the videos through the app at all so I'm having to access it on a web browser.,
"The app is really bad, it's laggy and every time it hangs my device to a restart point. Not compatible with android versions older than android 6",
"The service is great, but the app still does not cast the videos on Chromecast. If this feature was available, it would be 5 stars",
I want to go for a certification course but unable to pay from my debit card. Please tell me any solution..,
"In android (tab S2) videos viewed are not checked as viewed, so no update of learned lessons on desktop PC.",
Warning! Overpermissioned app. Permission creep in updates. Explain your need and use of privacy sensitive perms CONTACTS/ACCOUNTS and PHONE.,
"Works pretty well on my phone and it's simple and functional. There is no option to switch sessions in a course,which makes it necessary to do through the website.",
"It crashes a lot; it's a major problem, and a pity since otherwise the app is overall easy to use, well designed, and the content is great",
I need to enroll a course everytime I login the app. It doesn't show up in the enrolled courses section. I'm trying to enroll Machine Learning by Stanford University. Please check for the issue.,
"I liked the idea of this app but I was expecting more actually free certificate courses since that's what I searched for on Google when I found this, granted the price of certificate courses is pretty low or affordable for most it is not for all. Also would recommend they add a save course option so u can review and compare courses",
The app doesn't load the contents properly. * lyrics and video don't play simultaneously * the test questions during video doesn't load and is incomplete and had to skip * the documents provided for understanding after each video doesn't load completely and some contents are missing Otherwise for the wonderful courses the app is good,
"Real concise, but filled with pearls of information which are beneficial for the current generation. Thank you Coursera for making education better. A suggestion though:    Remembering course names which I may do in the future is a challenge. It would serve better if there is a 'Bookmark this course' option to refer in the future. Hope this arrives :)",
You get 1 star because it is one of the most annoying things to have half of the course not being able to see in landscape view :X All parts of the courses have to be also in landscape view..If I'm working on something and write info from the course and then click backspace I can't keep up because I have to turn my tablet in profile view to see that part of the course..,
"Great Big update, I love it. I think one important thing is missing in the app; the integration between the reminders user set for the courses with the user's calender app, in my case Oulook ;)",
"The app was wonderful in general except that after i updated my device to nougat android system, i am no longer able to sign in using my E-mail, i am using samsung galaxy j5 2016, please advice if there anything to solve this problem",
"Can't load content despite working internet connection it states that tgere is none - Overly complex, hard to find the content for enrolled courses at all.",
Please include option to disable subtitles. Subs cover important information displayed in the video like graph labels,
It will be better if there is an option to choose how many lessons to download if you've a slow connection you want'em all to be downloaded,
Greatly recommended. I have been using Coursera for 3 years. It offers a variety of courses from many universities. They have peer-reviewed assignments and you can even download the videos.,
"Good features, clear gui. However downloading course material does not work well. I can watch videos but I can't download them for later use.. sometimes.. On multiple devices.",
"Incredibly slow. Does not allow to download to external storage. Many taps required to enter a video. Sometimes it requires to be online, even to access already-downloaded content.",
"I'm all about more education.  Study, learn something new, add to ur basic skills, or upgrade to a more advanced grade.",
"Monthly subscription is extremely high. So I definitely will be uninstalling as there are other course institutions who offer the same courses for free or at a fraction of your monthly fee with accredited certification. Check out Udemy, Reeds or Vision2learn for example.",
I think it would be more useful if there's the possibility of recording video and voice.,
It's so hard for me to downloaded materials... So unreliable when downloading things,
Hi. None of the videos can be played. It shows an error. Please fix this fast.,
In the middle of the course the video lectures are not playing an error massage saying something want wrong is showing,
Most recent update lost my class I was taking.  Weird.,
New UI is good n all but the browsing is much slower than before,
"Subtitles are carelessly out of sync, at times worse than nothing at all.",
"App is very poor, having difficulty in downloading content for offline use.",
"Devs at Coursera should take some development classes, cause Chromecast support sucks incredibly.",
Knowledge is good and free but app works very very very slow even after download of the contents,

The app shows..  Oops  Something is wrong with the downloaded video file. would you like to re-download  the file?  after some time while playing offline videos... Please fix this,
"Thanks to the recurring subscription, I lost multiple hundred dollars",
"Can't login or signup using both Facebook/Email options. Without logging in , how can i use this app? Device: Huawei Honor 6x, Android N",
Nice educational app helped me through many topics loved it ...,
The scrolling is not proper whhile viewing resources.,
Why it is asking for fb/email password . üò®üò®..so they can hack into our account,
Latest update will not play classes streaming. Also will not play classes previously downloaded. Totally useless. How can I roll back?,
In my opinion this is the Best app for self learning. Thank you,
Excellent App and opportunity to learn. Some courses are laid out better than others.,
Thanks for this wonderful app i use it whenever i got some time and i start learning.,
"With this app, studying is just so easy and fun. Love it.",
New UI is too laggy. How could you enable it for me with that low QUALITY? Bad.,
Unstable. App keeps hanging and closing.,
Excellent app.  Good alternative to Laptop but recommend actual lectures on laptop,
Great app providing required amount of knowledge to make you a virtuoso,
Its amazing but it should be  less prize some online courses,
"subtitles for each language please, or auto-generated. thanks",
next gen educational platform alternatives to universities,
Please make other formats of payment available apart from using international Credit Cards.,
It's a very good app .plz utilise it,
"I love the app, its easy to navigate through",
I really got good learning from few courses in Coursera.,
Fantastic idea to have so much knowledge online,
It does the best of all and I  really  like it.,
It is way better how we taught in college loved it,

Yaar.......it's an amazing thing Everyone should try this.,
Great app. Great work!,
Its a great app and im highly appreciative of the maker but there are some small errors which can be fixed for e.g. the files and for the courses take a huge amount of time to be downloaded and some dont even download but except for that its a wonderful app,
It's awesome. I love this app.  It is really helpful.,
Is certification through this will help me to get job? or is this certification is acceptable by MNCs? any experience please share?,
The most of courses are not free. It has a price,
I couldn't find anything related to mechanical softwares,

"The new UI is really wonderful, but affecting the performance. Also, please add speed control for the Chromecast.",
Been over 2 years since opting out and emails still come once a week. No way to contact.,
App being slow after updated,
This is amazing.,
"Giving 5 star as finally the playback speed feature has been added to the mobile app as well. I generally used to watch the videos at 1.25x or 1.5x on desktop. But desperately missed this functionality  while watching lectures on my phone while in bus. Not to mention, the content is great. And I have learnt from coursera, more than any other similar source.",
"Feature request: there isn't an intuitive way for me to share a course I all enrolled in, to my contacts in the mobile app.",
"Really good for the student, or just about anyone, that want's to expand their knowledge about any theme. I would highly recommend it.",
"Great variety of courses, from digital currency to big history. No cost if you don't need/want a certificate of completion.",
Your card can be declined and the Contact support link gets you nowhere. Disgusting level of service.,
"Allows you to follow your courses on the go, for the most part.  What's really annoying is that the fibrin for speeding the video doesn't work. Images indeed go faster, but the audio remains at normal speed.",
"When playback speed is increased, video and audio lose synchronisation. So does the subtitle track and the audio track. Fix this please.",
"Courses are great. The app is terrible. You cannot review assignment feedback in the app. Also if courses use podcasts these can only be downloaded via the Web.  Was really looking forward to learning on the go, but not with this.",
"Good, unfortunately does not manage the multi windows on the Samsung note pro which will allow to take some notes. But really good app",
"I have a problem in the videos resolution, and the voice is not clear.",
The app is terrible The peer review assignments are a task as there's always some error,
I've completed two courses with two awaiting. The videos are clear and the courses are explicit. Though a few course work can be frustrating as peer support is poor.,
The course English for journalism is Very useful but it's volume is very very  low  so I don't use it,
This app is cool but doesn't offer any recovery feature for when the user submits a quiz and a nerwork error occurs. All the quiz answers will be lost.,
"I signed up and enrolled a nutrition course and it does not work I don't know why, I really want to be able to take this course.",
The courses. Is OK. But I am struggling with assignments,
That's great opportunity for continuing or staring some classes or course's you want or was interrupted,
Thanks Coursera,
I can't see the enroll button when I browse courses,
Would be great if Switch Session option is also added for courses.,
The app consistently won't cast to Chromecast correctly.,
I'd appreciate it even further if you'd release a Lite version of the app.,
Coursera is great.  I have learned so much from awesome people,
"Just an amazing app , Simple Active and make arval mark in your Life",
I have just signed in using the app and neither of the two courses that I an currently enrolled in are showing up.,
For android 8 complete disaster,
I can't login through Facebook.,
For offline. It's deleted my backup.,
Consistent problems with quizzes failing to submit.,
Excellent app. It shows and guide what we are looking for.,
Great opportunity open to those who want to advance themselves,
It's a useful online learning application.,
"NOT FREE. I'm fine with paying for the courses but DON'T CALL IT FREE if, AFTER you choose the courses...You drop the bill!",
Easier then searching for course on site.,
Best app for ppl who are looking for education apportunities.,
Every thing is good but costly,
App can be made more useful.,
Downloading courses take forever !,
this app has changed my life,
PLEASE ADD OTHER PAYMENT METHOD!,
Good informative easy to use app,
Not worth the price.,
It's a bug updated. Please fix the bug.,
Brilliant app brilliant courses.,
It helps me when ever I need help :'-),
"It's very helpfull, i love it!!",
It's just awesome‚ò∫Ô∏è,

Only 3 payment mode given that to  only one payment mode is  working in India that is International Credit Card.... I had to leave my course without certification...,
Please add a wish list,
It's learnie,
Works in backround,
"The video is sometimes delayed opposed to the sound. Sometimes when skipping to another part of the video, a frame will stay frozen.",
Very good app for online learning. Works very well and it is easy to use and also its design is best in all available mooc apps.,
"Some of the links are broken. When I browse the listings of courses, I can't click on some of them to check them out. Disappointing.",
Something went wrong. Please check your Internet connection and try again. On every video,
I took a class on cloud computing.  I got tested on material that was not covered by the videos and printed material. Not recommended.,
I am unable to access any courses via the app. There was no problem before until today,
"The video player keeps on crashing. Msg says: ""Oops Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again.                                                   OK"".  Once this happens you can't play any cost video until you uninstall and reinstall the app.",
Great courses are offered by them and very useful app to learn new things so happy with this app I love it....,
The facility of downloading video lectures has helped a lot. I can download at wi fi and watch it as per my time. Also if slides or lecture notes are made available offline it would help much. Overall an excellent app.,
One of the best app for motivator to achieve self development to continue‚Äã learn everyday from their mobile while they are offline.,
Seems to be working fine. Will edit my review after I've done the course for a bit.,
Cannot turn off subtitles. Can't see bottom of screen.,
"Value courses, ton of courses available for audit or with completion certificates and it has offline capacity just wow",
"Earlier it performed well. But, for past few days, no video in playing on the app.",
It's good but where we can know how long will a certain course take? Time period of courses? Each day lecture timings and all?,
Lectures are really good .....but the worst part is that there is NO  assignment pdf files as they say in the video .....and the videos are not clear,
It is the best educational app I've ever downloaded.,
Perfect for those who wish to upgrade their knowledge,
"I Like it, love it and recommend u to use it.",
Can't access the enterprise mode. Please fix it,
Very helpful service and very stable and useful app!,
Best app for online education and knowledge,
Its short to the point and affordable..,
Unable to play or download videos,

Very usefull app....,
Very helpful and good,
Best course material,
Great app,
Good all,
Amazing,

"Convenient app for accessing Coursera courses. However, there is one bug that annoys me. I often set my video speed to 1.5 or 2 times faster. Everytime I close a course video and rewatch it again, the app still remembers to set the video speed to my last setting, which is good. However, the video and audio becomes out of sync. The audio speed still follows normal speed, but the video follows the set speed (e.g. 2x speed). Please fix this bug.",
Pictures during quizzes often fail to load. Explanations for completed quiz answers are not shown. There is no ability to rate or provide feedback via the app. It's basically just lacking some key features on the desktop site.,
"I keep getting an ""error retrieving course"" in every single course. I am not sure what's wrong. I have a galaxy s8.",
The best way to learn things you liked but never got an opportunity to do it in life.,
Best app for MOOC.  Could have given 5 stars if the download can resume from where it stopped. It cancels the download when there is a problem in cellular network and then starts from beginning.,
"It would have been better, if it had all the features that are present in the coursera website",
This is the best app I have been ever used for online study,
"This app is just too good, even more organized than the web version",
Can you please make adjustable the side of subtitles in videos? On tablets its very difficult top read,
Broadens ones capacity  to know more. Very helpful,
It's a good apps for the professional development.,
The best online courses ever,
Great educational app for education.,
Great content... Free as well as purchased.,
It loads each page so slowly...,
Works well for course modules but where are the discussion forums which I see on the web page?,
Very useful,
Loved it,

Help to student and research person,
All corses are paid ...,
Keep getting error loading enrollment data. Any1 help!,
Why location,
"01/09/17 downloading lectures is still unreliable, eventually they stop working and no amount of deleting and reinstalling the app helps. As a commuter app, it is very limited. Whilst you can download lectures, you can still only access the list of downloads whilst connected to the internet, so it's hopeless for a commute without signal. The support team also treat you like a moron.  Older review:  Latest version still has all the same problems. Downloaded videos stop working every time the app updates, so you have to download them again. Incredibly annoying!   Downloading materiay ls does not work well at all. It seems to require a network connection to load the page that lists your downloads, making it pretty pointless, and it also frequently somehow loses downloads so they don't appear as downloaded in the course page despite the files being present. This is very basic functionality that is unreliable at best.",
"While the option to download videos for offline use is wonderful, it would be even more wonderful if it worked reliably.  Too often, when it's time to access the videos, I get ""Something is wrong with the downloaded video file.  Would you like to re-download the file?"" I'm usually not in a good downloading place (unlimited internet data) and a good studying place (quiet, few distractions) at the same time.  It's frustrating to have my study schedule disrupted because the app doesn't check its own downloads for integrity.",
"An extra star for the app interface, but Coursera has changed in recent years away from being a free site. A lot of course content isn't available without paying, and without completing this content Coursera continually marks you as behind and overdue. Could be better if there was an option to manually mark each week as complete and not be made to feel bad for the assignments that aren't available.",
"It's been 30 years since I made any attempt at an education so this was a long shot to begin with. Unfortunately I've pretty much gone through any patience with this program already and the books haven't even arrived yet. I have issues with PayPal so I went to change the payment method and all I got was caught in a loop, like in the twilight zone. It's got a link which clearly says, UPDATE PAYMENT METHOD, but when you click it, the best it would let me do was deactivate the account, confusing, but that's what I did. Instead of trying for the certificate it might be best if I just look over the material and not take some silly certificate so serious. I've made it 43 year's with a 7th grade education I'm pretty I can die with one and it'll be okay too. Thanks for making me feel worse than when I started, again, Coursera.",
"I tried using the app on an Android tablet because I don't have Wi-Fi for my computer. The app won't let my tablet download or watch videos. I've used Coursera in the past and loved it and was so glad when they made the app, but until they fix the app it will remain a one for not functioning properly.",
"A good verity in courses. Heard good things about this company. However, did not expect them to have such bad payment options.",
Wasn't able to login to even try the app. I press log in with facebook and nothing happens. Same with sign up with facebook.,
"Nice app but it stopped downloading video for off-line viewing and that pretty much killed it for me. It just say ""please try downloading again""",
"Many bugs when using play speeds other than 1: asynchronous A/V (when watching more than one video per session), quizzes popping up at the wrong time. These problems have been going on for a while, disappointing that they haven't been fixed yet",
"I'm not able to submit the answers to my quizzes on the app (even after making the payment for the specialization). When I tap on ""Submit"" and then ""Continue"", the app asks me to ""Purchase"" before I can submit and I have purchased already. It works on the web though. Also, if I accidentally exit the app while watching a video, the video starts from the beginning when I go back to it. Please fix the app!",
"Notice a problem, that pictures in summary or the test in video are always having trouble to fully load.",
"I like it. It's really easy to use and convenient. Now, if only I could get my schedule to match a full class schedule...",
It's better now. I can watch my offline video without any error. Keep it up buddy!!,
"Great app, great courses. Informative and professional - everything TED talks is not.",
amazing app but they don't allow you to take test if you have taken free courses...üôÑüôÑüò∂,
Great app got a certification done through it and its valued in the market,
Please add a feature to shortlist and add courses to favorites so that I can shortlist courses and then decide on what I want to do!,
Wonderful app please make app available for amazon firsestick,
I just want to clarify if enrolling in a certain lecture is totally free?,

"I will gladly change this rating with the improvement of the app. It's been extremely difficult submitting my work through the app, which does not reflect my submission. It says it's overdue. I literally wore myself out trying to submit over & over again. I'm taking a break out of pure frustration, but will try again tomorrow.",
Coursera is great but this app is frustrating.  My main issue is that the page for submitting written assignments never loads correctly.  I get a spinning wheel in the middle of the page which never goes away and there is a 5-10 second lag time between pushing a key and the letter actually appearing.  This is truly maddening when you're trying to complete your assignments.,
"Great app with interesting courses, BUT please fix errors in Android version! 1) When you enter answer to some question in quiz and then after sometime you return to it the text in answer field breaks, displayed answer is the same , but in field there some code(maybe latex), and if you press submit it will submit these wrong text  and answer will be wrong. It's really annoying when you check your answers and they breaks so you need to re-enter them.",
The Courses are great but the app is rediculous... It refuses to let me download the videos for offline and the app is ALWAYS crashing when you are actually trying to watch your courses which you paid for. I have tested mutiple devices and different internet venues... Nothing works. Very very dissapointed.,
"It worked the first week, now every time I try to resume the course it says ""downloading"" and stays there forever.",
"Since the new update and every thing I downloaded was removed , and when I try to download it again the download don't continue the process and I get ""couldn't download"" although I have an enough space for those videos , please fix that üò≠üò≠",
Couldn't view individual courses. Even my browsers redirected to the broken app each time. Unacceptable.,
"While the classes may be good, I wouldn't know. Every single course I wanted to take required a monthly subscription of $50 or more. They should tell you up front that the courses are not free.",
Needs improvement. Is slow and crashes sometimes. Needs to be optimised for faster performance. Cast does not perform well.,
"Deletes downloaded lections on sd on application update. You have to disable autoupdate to work with the app. Otherwise, quite useful",
"Can't log in with email/password, it says network error but I was able to download and rate this app with the same network. Multiple attempts, no success. I'm not going to use Facebook. Coursera is great though. I'm only not satisfied with this app.",
It is not as user friendly as needs be - won't mark some tasks as finished and keeps shutting down,
This takes mobile learning to a whole new level. Clean UI as well and information is easily accessible anytime. Love the storage option support as well as no lags when viewing videos.,
This is one of the best app for learners . Through this app you are able to acquire knowledge as well as earn certificate from any corner of world . It has various courses and can choose according to your interest. A must app for students.,
Course are good but app is not good... I am not able to download the courses,
Enables one to watch video lecture on phone. Well built with features better than any other edu app.,
"Tried again after a long break. This time app rendered near-useless as images won't show (Nexus 5) in questionnaires, mid-video or graded ones. Too bad.",
Best ever learning App...Great way to learn on the go...user friendly interface and the good news is you earn certificates as well!!,
"Awesome app, but should include topics and information which continues to be omitted from the educational system in place.",
"This message is shown every time I play a video  ""Oops, Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again"" I reinstalled it many times and installed another video player but didn't work! HOW TO SOLVE IT !?",
"Great app, easy to use and well designed.",
App is even more friendly than the desktop,
One of the best online course provider with a wide range of courses.,
Best learning experience with interactive lectures ...,
This is an amazing app. Do try.,
It's a very useful resource for learning,
Can't login  It says check network connection But I obviously can access the internet,
Great App to complement the life-changing Coursera website platform.What's not to like?Kudos Coursera!!!,
It's very important app for me tenx,
Excellent design and interaction of app to course presentation.,
Learn more every day. Great tool,
I liked it and all but can I download videos using mobile data?,

Great app. I can't login into my account with the last version but I can sign up with a new account.  Hope you solve this issue,
"Emails are impossible to turn off, even after the app is deleted and you dont want it any more. Very annoying. &gt;:(",
"Really annoying when the only login support is Facebook. Please at least add Google accounts. Really good course range but, can't recommend the app with such a poor mobile implementation.",
"It's the best app I could have in my phone! But I'm having a problem with the synchronization of the videos, the audio and the subtitles, if you could work in that it would be amazing! Thanks",
I'm not able to download anything please help me.dell venue 8 hspa+,
"Very nice app with structured e learning courses, daily and weekly schedules, assignments, study materials and most important being learning under one of the great lecturers who inspires you and brings motivation in your life.",
"Playback speed is desirable to be more than 2x for skimming. Please make it up to 4x, or support playing the video through external player. Currently many video players support 4x.",
You should be a little lenient towards the students who don't pay a certificate.,
"After update , all the Downloads become useless. Again download to play with app!!!",
I am forever grateful for this service. The app is well designed,
Lets find out more about it together. So far so good.,
A great way to learn and develop without paying high tuition.,
Se volvi√≥ una aplicaci√≥n de contenido lucrativo,
It is nice way of learning but it can be improved.,
Great for people who like to expressed themself with knowledges,
It doesn't let me use it cause I'm in Iran (Racism!!!!),
Helpful to get an additional degree.,
Brilliant... Because of this app... M going to achieve great career path,
Great source of knowledge!,
Nice app for my studies,
Do these courses provide certificates???,
Good one,
Great resource,
Improved,
Great,
the best,
How to use offline mode,
Login not working at all,
Coursera is extremely useful. The app is seamless.,
Last destination for those who want to learn,
"I LOVE this app...This app is appsolutely incredible. I'm no longer going to college because this app teaches me everything. My family is supportive of my stance about the fact that college is irrelevant. Coursera is my bae, my everything. I've already gotten job opportunities in places like Morgan Stanley, Pearson Hardman, iyengar bakery , to name a few.. DOWNLOAD IT NOW FOR A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE PATH",
"So far I have been very satisfied with the courses I am taking, and mostly happy with the app. The audio can get a bit fuzzy at times but for the most part everything has run smoothly. Thankfully the subtitles work fine so if I can't hear it, I usually just read the transcript.",
Coursera is not dedicated to providing quality education and its high time they step down as an MOOC with others showing up better online students no longer need them. Udmey provides cheaper courses as low as $10 and triple the free courses with certificates than coursera. My conclusion is that if you offer something offer it properly or not at all.,
I love the access to free courses and the app works very well. My only wish for the app (and website) would be a way to favorite or save a course we might be interested in in the future. I have multiple draft emails to myself of links to courses I find interesting so I don't have to keep scrolling and searching to find them.,
"While Coursera is excellent, the developers of this app should go through some app development courses again.  A basic point- the app can't quickly switch to mobile data when WiFi gets out of range.  The download function is as if written by a beginner. For a simple network change from one WiFi to other, the app ditches 90% complete video and starts downloading from the beginning...",
"Very good content. Many free courses. But still it's difficult to learn a different and complex thing on your own, just by video lectures.",
The course selections are great. And able to download and view offline are nice features. But i keep losing my downloaded files randomly. I don't know why that keeps happening.,
"Hi, I ve been trying to enroll for digital marketing course, but I am getting an error screen which says ""error fetching enrolment details"". Pls help",
"It would be nice if the app would let you see peer reviews of assignments you've submitted. As it is you have to log in to the website via browser to do so, which is a pain.",
Beside the great quality content app is pretty smooth and works seamlessly. Good that they don't rely on youtube unlike udacity,
Charged me $40 monthly for some kind of specialization subscription without any value and now won't refund. Scam.,
Oops something went wrong with player try again... constantly getting this error while trying online as well as offline,
"Now, all the videos are getting downloaded to internal storage inspite of selecting external sdcard for downloads.. Thats called GREAT UPDATE.. Thanks for broking my favourite app on playstore",
Either the search algorithm or the courses are garbage. Couldn't find any algebra classes in English or any sort of ACT Prep whatsoever. It just suggests completely unrelated courses like Robotics... Useless.,
"Some functionalities don't work (for example you can't see replies to thread in the forum; the buttons for ""upvote"" and reply sometimes work and sometimes don't), the application loads new pages very slow (tried with three different networks).",
Really primitive UI as compared to the web-based one. Please improve it.,
"Needs a ""save for later"" or Favorite button so I don't have to write down or remember the many courses I have interest in",
App keeps sending alerts even after I unenrolled from a course. So annoying.,
"Great stuff although the quizz on the modern history course could only be completed with payment. I did it this time but never again, ¬£37 is a lot of money for watching videos that are similar to free ones on YouTube...",
Would like if there was a built-in function to request a course you would like to take that isn't available yet.,
Very bad interface...things are good on desktop...gets worse when using app on mobile or tab,
No videos for offline couple of days after downloading everything. This is the third time I downloaded whole the videos and lost everything. Are you guys even bothering to look into this? Because this is my second review on this problem but didn't get a feedback from the developers. This is so bad.,
I just started because my daughter tried it and the class was a secession for her thank you i just love the online class,
Why doesn't it work properly I have to use it from my browser,
"I love the app, as it's mobile friendly!  Tasted and trusted!",
It's amazing how you are doing and what you are doing is the best way to get a hold of valuable  information,
The only app i would recommend to anyone without hesitation,
If I have to write a short review I would say this is perfect app,
Very useful but would be great to have a section where you can write notes,
Best app completed 2 course and waiting for the certificate!! Hurray hiippp hippp huray,
Offline and transcription handling are brilliant. A really excellent resource for anyone.,
It's a great app for leaning specially an offline feature.,
please  add the function of adding the certificate directly without typing the details again in linkedin app,
Nice collection of useful course with great curriculum,
Cannot enroll any course,
"Video not playing after update.  ""ooops, something went wrong.. "" Nexus 4 android 5.1.1",
Nice to keep you updated through online learning,
Best app for free education on the market.,
I love open source learning.,
Perfect for the bus ride into work!,
"Can't sign into the app? No prerequisites or anything. Just won't sign in, so I can't give a real review",
Knowledge  does not have barriers,
Amazing Courses Thank You Andrew Ng,
Can't get past the sign in screen - can't even finish entering my username before screen resets...,
Vary useful app for learning about new things,
So much knowledge for free is really awesome.,
"To pay for something I can find for free on internet, no thanks.",
i hope that you'll make it possible to save offline tp external storage.,
It's a good chance to creativity,
Nothing's been loading recently ):,
Best App on the Earth. Seriously.,
Please add playback rate option on mobile platform as well!,
Let's your download videos for offline mode. It does NOT let you view the videos that are downloaded onto your phone.,
World-class knowledge just at your convenience....,
Thanks for this great app.,
I really love it!!!,
It's better..,

Video doesn't save to sd card as I selected. I left it downloading the course video to use when I have no wifi and it filled up my phone instead of downloading to the sd card.,
Study where ever üëç,
Education Method,
Buggy app,
"Cannot login,  it says network error. But connected to working network. I have used 2 different broadband and one mobile operator internet connection, but same happens every time. Also tried reinstalling several times. Nothing works",
Unusable. Every screen takes over 30 seconds to load. Videos won't play. Supplementary material takes you back to the browser. Whole units error out and won't load.,
I'm complaining that the app doesn't work well the course home doesn't load and i can't open my courses,
"I was glad I could adjust the playback speed of videos with the new update, but it just leads to the audio and video being out of sync. Pretty good app otherwise.",
I can't log in. It says a 'Network Error'. But my connection is ok. I can log in with the browser on the same device.,
Please tell me if I could get a job in USA after doing cyber security course from coursera.,
Facebook log in doesn't work.  I can't access my profile,
Error occurred while accessing quiz. Please try again. Twice.,
It was Mind bellowing applications. I liked everything.,
This app is absolutely rubbish. Total waste of time,
I am able to attend some of the top universities in the country and take my classes on the go period I love this app,
The app is simply awesome for bringing effective learning right in your palm,
App concept is good but needs to be more smooth in transition,
Hangs sometimes but otherwise good,
Cannot login after installing ...its saying network error.....pllzz help,
Not many free courses.,
Thanks for bridging the educational gap for us in the developing countries,
I loved coursera when i used it on web. . . Now I love it even more on app :),
It's more comfortable than using browser,
What did even happen to the app? It's just filled with tonnes of bugs! Can't open anything!,
Please make the offline downloads faster and stable.,
Very useful app... Can learn of lots of things... Love this app...,
"Can't view already downloaded  video, need Internet connection  for downloaded  video",
Discussions are visible on the course web pages but not the app? Where do I look for them?,
"Why can't I download those study materials, available on web but not on app?",
This is absolutely amazing.,
Pretty  good application.,
Very useful for study from anywhere‚Äã,
MOOC is awesome!,
Why are the downloaded videos getting deleted automatically?,
It is best learning app,

Learning is fun,
I love it,
One of a kind,
Superb,
Good,
Love it,
Wow,
"Nice and easy to use. I really like feature to watch videos offline. The only problem is, that when I run application without internet connection, it will not load my courses so I will not be able to watch even offline videos. To take benefit of offline videos, I have to start the application early, when I have Internet and go to my course and list of videos. Then I can go offline and watch them.",
"I had issues retrieving courses after the update. Nothing was showing. I uninstall then reinstalled it again, everything back on list now. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
Great app. Easy to use and efficient because i can save online video tutorials and watch them later without internet access.,
"Unable to sign in, network error, whereas I am able to login through the normal browser, then whats the problem with the app",
"Keep receiving an error when trying to access a course (""error retrieving the course""), cannot see the latest one I added to the list, plus I also receive an error when trying to submit a support request! Used to work fine, what did you do? :(",
Education has to be free.  Everybody here is finding faults on download and other issues which do not count.  End of the day you folks are plane awesome.,
"Latest update doesn't let me access courses. Keeps showing ""Error retrieving the course"". Please fix this.",
"Asks me to switch course sessions for ""more time"" when I am actually up to date on the course. Won't let me submit peer reviews because I need to ""fill out fields"" that are already filled out. Difficult to use.",
"Overall a useful app, but it needs bug fix: downloaded video occasionally disappeared (the course page shows *** MB downloaded, and I have watched some of them, but after a few days all the video disappeared)",
"The idea is just great, but I have have some stabillity issues related with the offline mode",
The latest update has many problems. Can't download videos anymore.,
It really awesome app for learning but one problem is in lecture quizzes are not able to displayed in app but it will work in website so plz...  Update the app...,
"Maybe not the best as an app,but really just amazing for courses.It helped a lot",
Disappointed to see courses are no longer free. This used to be a great resource.,
"Videos are not playing. Error says ""something went wrong..."" And, tech support guy name Archer told me not to use the app. Use the browser on my computer instead he said. What a joke!",
App stopped working. Now cannot use it.,
Even though the app may be a bit buggy the support team is just awesome.,
The transcript the slides and video doesn't sync ..please help ..I have tried on high bandwidth also,
"Would be great to bookmark courses I want to take next to develop a ""to do"" list.",
not able to save videos . please fix the issue ASAP.,
"D app is great but ,education should b free so everybody can access it",
Doesn't sync well with website.... doesn't show courses I've access to on the website. Just use website,
not free for a lot of the courses...you gotta pay 50 for each certificate if you want it.,
I am getting problems when downloading an entire week material but its fine when I download videos one by one.What Should I do ?,
Great learning app with impressive courses,
Quick way to add learning on the go,
Awesome app. Very useful and easy to use,
The courses seem to be substandard,

Good secondary source of education,
Great app,

So amazing to be able to take free online courses. I downloaded the app just to learn some new things and it is truly amazing. The courses are great,
"Excellent app. Offline mode is a fantastic feature. But I find some times the saved videos go missing. I have downloaded certain videos again and again. Please look into that. But for this small glitch, it is excellent. Thanks a lot.",
Fake app everything is paid nothing is  free,
The idea is great and the app works really well,
The best MOOC education portal.,

Kkk,
I love platform provided by Coursera for learning. I have taken 4 course certificates. I was enjoying using it till payments could be made through Paytm wallet or Debit card or Paypal through the mobile application. Now I'm unable to pay for a course though the application by any payment method other than Credit Card. Please fix this!,
Works smooth.Earlier was struggling with the web interface in mobile.The app made it much simpler and awesome. Awesome and user friendly app interface up until now at least.,
"Bad refund policy. First the want your credit cards for free trail, after that press you in a regularly payment process. No options to talk to a real person. Just a chat bot. No recommendation!",
Latest update keeps crashing the video on my lg g4. Not sure if others have this issue.,
"I used to enjoy this app a lot but now I am unable to enroll in any course now the enroll button remains on ""loading"" now matter how long I wait. It is not an issue with my Internet connection  as no other app using the Internet experiences these issues.",
It's sad that you don't provide Honor Code Certificates anymore. RIP free education.,
"Actually, there is one minor bug or your app has issue that it can't cast vedios to my LG smart Tv thorough DLNA.So please fix soon as possible",
I made mi first  course  ofthe specialization in my laptop. I just installed the app and I think it' awesome.,
The app is a huge battery drain while downloading offline videos. Also the phone gets heated up unusually.  It's a good platform. The app can be optimized for better battery life.,
"I love it, easy UI, the ability to control play speed, clear subtitles and convenient method to show and submit questions, just perfffect",
"Great app... Sadly, Course team is turning this entrepreneur out of a global learning üò∂",
"Coursera is a great idea and helped me a lot in the past. But one major issue I had with this app is that it keeps removing the offline videos I downloaded, which prevents me from using this app while commuting.",
Slow. Latest version crashes TouchWiz very often on Samsung s5 active,
"Everything is great but for one thing. What is the point of making downloadable course materials if you can't access them without the Internet? There is a nice course ""Introduction to Logic"")",
No option for selecting the quality of the video.The video keeps on fluctuating to low and high quality based on the internet speed which is  quite irritating.,
"Its a very authentic app,,,really offers great deal of clarity and  relevance. M glad to earn knowledge through this app...has links to world class universities. definately recommended for those who truly wish to pursue authentic learning.",
"For goodness' sake, make the uploads work! If not, what is the point of making an app if I have to login on the browser to update the essays!",
I think that this app will help me to support my family and I can learn something from it.üòÉ,
"I m really thankful for creating this app, really helped me in improving my skills from the comfort for my home.",
"Nothing free, first step is to pay , nothing on trial.",
Nice work guys! The playback speed feature was the most needed and happy to hear its available. üëçüëçüëç,
Courserais awesome but the one thing that I don't like is that the subtitles are not coming at the time and there is not also the option to adjust the subtitles so please updated as I am facing many problems because of subtitles not coming on time,
Its one of  the Best educational app I have come across ... Go for it,
Appreciate this type of apps that makes you have learning tools handy.,
Coursera provide a best platform for people  who love to learn without any restrictions.,
I like to learn and the lectures are all very helpful and interesting. There's a subject for everyone.,
It is impossible to use the app. Gets hang always,
It is really help to improve my self. One of the biggest investment in the life,
Coursera is an amazing tool for the 21st century. Lots of specialisation courses to improve your personal  development.,
Just really like learning or thinking Ian doing such,
Subtitles doesn't work.,
Great app Contains some useful courses Try Edx also,
A nice application for all of us who find hard to go to a particular area for learning.,
Can't play videos properly.,
The topic that it's present is very good!,
Very useful and user friendly. They provide what an individual need,
I cannot enroll using the app. It just says loading at the bottom of the screen,
I love this app. But lately it's crashing a lot. Can you guys fix it?,
This app is awesome as it is very much advantageous for students.,
"Very helpful, easy to use and great for developing your skills",
Best online course apps ever !,

"Poor Professor behavior Name:Aric Rindfleisch Course: Marketing in the Digital World  Mocks Students,if you express your displeasure towards his teaching  Coursera Completely Silent on this issue.   Prefer Edx ,udemy,udacity Don't pay for courses in coursera Poor Professor would be teaching in this platforms",
"Thank goodness the content of Coursera isn't as bad as this app.  You can't use this offline unless you are at certain points, and then if you have to restart the app (because the video becomes a white screen) then you have to get internet again.  This is such a lackluster app, it borders on completely unusable.",
"Unenrolling to a course can only be done on a desktop site and it is time consuming. It would save time if we could access it within the application. Keeping the above aside, the application has been very useful and friendly.",
The latest update is very buggy. I can' even successfully save all the videos for one course! Installed and reinstalled over and over but still won't let me. I hope they just didn't update it. It was working perfectly the past 2 months that I started taking MOOCs.,
Best online education application. Soft and easy to use.,
Great app for learners,
"I love everything about coursera! I stumbled across coursera years ago and I'm happy to see they are growing.  Offering a plethora of classes from a variety of prestigious schools, there's a huge selection of interesting subjects to choose from, conveniently accessible from the palm of your hand! Learn something new or sharpen your skills. Keep up the amazing work!",
I feel lucky to live in a Era bcs of Mooc's where I can learn endlessly from the universities and teachers that I can't even dream of in real life. Thanx aton,
"I started a music course, which I liked and want to purchase it, but there are glitches in the exercises and  quizzes. There are few questions whose options are audio clip based and I was not able to listen to the audio of the options ! Leading to the failure in that course.  please correct the glitch then I will buy the course plss",
Unable to access the videos or do the quizzes on my phone even though I've already updated it :(,
Good app for learning. Only downside is the app sometimes freezes my HTC m8 mobile. This is the only app that freeze my mob and I use lots of apps.,
I would recomend to add a filtering feature that allows the user to filter the courses based on their price ( if the course is free or not),
Great initiative for distance learning. Helpful for students in under developed countries. Keep the new courses coming. Thanks to Coursera team :),
Can't sign in with Gmail account. Getting network error after long time. Very critical error. Should be fixed ASAP,
"a whole lot of bugs, unable to get grades after finishing a quiz. the app frequently crashes...",
Brilliant app with awesome content. The offline videos yet seems to be corrupted after each update and I should download some of them again.,
Videos are not loading properly.always show 'no internet connection' but when run in browser it runs smoothly this is Issue with app,
"This used to be a pretty good app for a great site. Now I can't even seem to sign up so any new courses, or download videos. Really dissapointed.",
Unable to watch video at different speeds. It keeps blocking. Also sound varies and image varies in quality,
"Amazing self-drive courses to advance ones mind for future or just self-fullfilment.  Option for certificates  is excellent benefit, as well.",
"Awesome app content courses but , I have to give you whopping 3000-5000 Rs per month for your courses , please don't be such merciless. I know it's business for you people but I see this is medium to learn something.",
"sorry to say, but the app troubled me so much. IT often crashes.",
I like how the app seamlessly updates my progress so I can switch platforms and carry on learning without worrying about my records not being updated.,
"Offline mode is excellent,  allows me to continue working without internet. Videos are high quality as well.",
"No one can rival what the people on coursera have been doing, you guys are truly geniuses",
This is a must have app for any wants to learn from world's top universities and colleges at their own facility.,
Well constructed courses. Various interesting topics. Very thankful for this platform. I have done a few certificate courses as well.,
"Very slow interface. Does it pull all data for all courses each time? If you have a slow internet connection and if you click 5 times  ""Next item"" link in a quiz - it will open it 5 times in the end. Tends to loose previously saved videos without a reason. I don't think Coursera can afford such application.",
Good app. Status sinking after being offline fails quite often,
"To learn More, TO share knowledge,  to save Mother Earth,  to keep creator's Creations",
Performance is slow after updating the app....    App is hanging too much... Low performance while submitting assignments,
"Nice app but rated low since... it's the only App that frequently crashes and freezes on my HTC ! (Better lately) Forces a need to reboot... Also, sync of viewed lessons does not always work... (still an issue)",
"Strange new permissions. Device id, call info.",
An amazing app to learn anything on finger tips. I love coursera.,
A true charity ; great service to society. A lifetime experience to students from developing countries.,
It will better if it has option to store data on the SD card,
Great app but should have reminders for this reason am outüòÇüòÇ,
They need to work on the going into the special learning rooms,
The best educational app but it will be great to add a section for the completed or finished courses,
The video and sound quality is very poor compared to the same videos watched in an internet browser,
Its good learning app.. And quality of teaching is awesome,
Can't login with my Gmail account.  I have signed up with Gmail earlier.,
Makes easy to learn more effectively online courses.,
"Sometimes it does crash, but very useful",
"Nice,helping me in my career",
It's my favorite educational app,
A very good must have application,
Superb to people who want to aspire knowledge!,
The best app ever made,
I used coursera on  computer and  loved it,
A great app to learn something,
Best app i have  ever used,
I wish they would have been more clear on what age group it was meant for .......,
Time taken for querying even small data is too high by any standards.,
It's still missing a landscape mode for some screens like quizzes.,
Changed my life!,

"Unable to get beyond login screen. Previously i couldn't register for any classes, it just said Loading.",
Prefer destop version. This app still says i haven't started a course when I'm half way through week one. Also deadline for 1st assessment says 27/3 but on desktop version says 26/3,
"CANNOT LOGIN! Very frustrating, even re-installed and gave all permissions. I created my account via my Facebook account.",
Can't login even after signing up screen doesn't go beyond that only other option is to log out and you have all my details but I can't use your app...,
Best collection of courses. Offline content is very helpful. Would love to see a feature to enable categorizing my courses.,
Login screen is all I see hmmmm wat a shame,
ive been trying to contact you because I have a problem and it's not technical so I couldn't find it on any articles on your website and you email here isn't right .. is there anyway I can contact you ?,

Can't get pass the login screen after logging in,
HATE THE NEW POLICY,
Great app,
Couldn't even login,
Good courses,
"The app does not allow for script screen, so I can't write and take notes as I see the videos. Also,  on some screens, the app does not allow for screen rotation. So, Coursera is great, 7 stars for that, but this app is just average.",
"This is an incredible app,i do not see anything to criticize in it.",
Can't get pass the login stage after login in,
"This is my obsession. I've been hooked on coursera for over a year now, and unlike other apps and websites that quickly lose their luster, coursera continues to be my favorite because not only is it easy and enjoyable to use, but it also adds value to my life with every course. In short, I highly recommend it.",
"Overall fairly smooth user experience except on a tablet where it bounces back and forth between portrait and landscape mode in different areas. Since that's my almost exclusive use of the app it's pretty annoying. You'd think at this time that all developers would have made their apps fully tablet compatible... especially for something like this. But Nope.... Add in the forced upgrades, the failure to disclose what is changing in new versions and you have an app that seems to convey a ""customer be damned"" attitude.",
Would be better Coursera if you offered access to all of the content and curriculum of your classes entirely free. By not doing so you play a role as a catalyst to the growing divide between the rich and the poor.... Because the poor are willing to pay will never justify you charging them. Education must change how the world works. Be the first to leave money behind and put real human rights and needs into perspective. The only profit for an educational institution and system is the creation of the educated!,
The videos kept zooming in automatically when its playing. It's so annoying. Hope the developer will fix the bugs.,
Excellent app. It's really useful as I can access videos offline. It would be great if other materials can also be available offline. If I didn't have this app I wouldn't have enrolled into courses due to lack of time. I use this app when I am on bus.,
Need to pay for most of the courses.  Was really nice before universities become too greedy,
Don't try the support you type away to have it all electronically ignored. The quizzes never tell you your wrong only if your right,
Its a good sourse of knowledge and experiances as well. So deep concept to study all about biological sciences nd medical also. But net  nd time consumption is the problem.,
"New (clean) tablet, WITH tech-approved AV (which includes free secure web browsing, already setup and used) - clicked on ( 2x each) TOS and Privacy Policy links - NEVER loaded.  Scary.  Immediately uninstalled",
My saved videos aren't playing after the update! Why? I downloaded all the videos of the course. So much data is wasted! Please correct this.,
"All course is paid, no course free. Udemy is 1000 time better.",
I am in coursera since 2011.  I love the concept of teaching and learning.  Its an example of equity.,
I think you should make more free online courses. Thanks,
This app helps me a lot in learning from various international university.,
I have learnt a lot by using this app and I would recommend it to anyone who loves studying,
It's Never to Late to Learn Something New ! @tut4art,
Its amazing app especially saving videos to watch offline really helpful,
Such quality here. The courses here are top notch. Coursera is fantastic.,
The app is amazing for those who want to take knowledge everywhere...,
Great app and subtitles for the videos is nice. Keep it up.,
"Great design, even better cause!",
Just awesome  for learners.thanks a lot.,
"Great app, best college online tool",
It is manageable and easy to use.,

Excellent open learning,
Very good app,
Very nice app,
Useful tool for study,

Hangs instantly,
Great app! Plays the audio even if you turn off the screen.,
The app is brilliant but the contents are even more. Love to have app like these on my phone. Worth having them. And a big thanks for spreading knowledge for free. A big salute to you.,
"I love coursera and I pay for my courses. However this app needs improvement. The app crashes and freezes on my Nexus 6P. The back button doesn't work properly if I open the app from a notification and leads to the app being dismissed, and I cannot return to the main menu. I think more QA testing would really help here.",
"Terrible app, I've tried to download the videos seveal times without success. It works only online.",
"Every time I use the application, the touch screen stops responding and the mobile restarts.",
"the offline feature was what closed the deal for me. overall interface is great, loving you more everyday, coursera.",
"Please fix Bug of Wifi Downloading , when wifi disconnected can't compete download when connected !!!",
Coursera is Nice app for online courses. Saving classes to offline helped me lot. But some times the app crashes without any warning. This is occurring only when I am online,
Offline is good. But the saved videos disappear after few days of saving. Please fix this,
It's wonerful app. I take more than one course which make me get high rank.,
The app needs the feature of playing videos from where it was stopped previously.,
Good and ease of access interface with well organized course content.Must have app for a computer science graduate.,
This is a fast way of getting into the desired resources.  The app has it all and very efficient.,
Coursera has abandoned what was once its core principal and mission.,
It looks like Chromecast functionality broken with last update,
"Can you please make a video pause for a built-in quiz when played on Chromecast? There are seem to be issues with casting when the app jumps  several titles ahead on a device screen when videos are played on Chromecast, and they are sometimes played in a wrong order.",
It's a great feeling to have such app on phone. Learning mode is always ON.,
It's a great app.love to have download feature to project it on projector.,
I always get messages saying it has stopped working... please stop this..,
Nothing is free here. Disappointed,
I love the app but please make it stream to Amazon Fire Stick,
No complains overall finest app for learning Thank you couraera because of this app i could complete my course,
Very good app. Must have by every learner.,
It is very useful app but crashes and freezes a lot.,
It is a great project. Helps me a lot. Great app,
Very helpful nd good platform to explore our potential !,
This app is more useful because having it in your Android is like having the the all instrument that you need for your studies at the same time and you will not need to to go to cyber cafe for class,
Great app with world's best courses,
It is great. Looking forward to the experience,
Amazing. Easy to use. Productive,
Great app to get new skills,
Outstanding relevant courses for developing skills,
Must have app in every phone for learners.,
It's not working with mimax prime,
"Usefull app. Easy, userfriendly.",
"For some devices,  when the videos are downloaded, they don't show but they actually download. This needs to be rectified",
Its more than a teacher ..,
"No stress, just knowledge....",
Nice and very informative app,
Good knowledge sharing platform,
Keeps crashing,
Wonderful learning experience,
IT'S NOT FREE.,
It is amazing,
Useful application,
App is nice,
Great app,
It is beneficial,
Amazing,
You gotta pay for every little information that you can actually Google. I don't mind paying but their content is just not worth it.,
Quality content!,
Thanks,
Nice app to learn something new easily. But there are some problems because this app is not user friendly. There are not searchable block by which we can filter course but I like contents of this application everything are good there. No doubt if u learn from coursera u can easily Handel any tast for u . Thanks :-),
"I love Coursera, but I find this app of limited value because I can't speed up the videos. I don't like watching them at normal speed, so I only watch them on PC, rather than using the app. This seems to be device-specific: my Samsung S4 Mini doesn't allow me to view sped-up videos, whereas my partner's Samsung S6 Edge does allow this (important) feature.",
This is easily one of the best apps I've ever used. While I'm at work I use this to keep my mind active instead of just standing around. I only wish it could support split screen so I could take notes concurrently. It's amazing otherwise thank you!,
Just took an exam and failed because the choices were not functioning.  Also wanted to access a page on the site and it timed out.  Weirdly I am taking computer technology courses.,
"App is just okay, the videos in the course are not downloadable, so can't be used offline. Pdf downloads are corrupted. Kindly resolve.",
Good solid app but downloaded videos constantly disappear. So not useful offline where I spend half my time.,
"I downloaded lectures offline to view but when loading them up the app froze numerous times. I couldn't access the home screen buttons whilst the video was playing, I would tap screen but nothing... at one point my screen went dark and wouldn't respond to my double taps. I was worried that I killed my screen. Thankfully rebooting got me back to normal screen.  I will continue subject via laptop.",
Thank you very much Coursera  Very good application but there are some problems in choices.,
This app is so useful I will forward its name to others also Thanks for making this useful apps üôã,
"After recent update, video playing not possible. Video plays for 6seconds and goes refreshing with blank screen",
"The courses are good but the app is not user friendly...there are no filters to select the preferred courses, that's a problem. Also the videos are not available in offline mode",
It's really a great educational app and offline mode option for videos is highly appreciate able,
Just needs a search feature.,
"Excellent and perfect,however after updating I loose all downloaded materials.",
"I love it. Need to be able to change the video speed, and to resume the video from where I left it last time.",
GREAT HELP AND OFFER. THANK YOU!,
It's easy to use though it freezes sometimes,
The best educational App ever. I'm loving it.,
One of the best online learning app.,
Best learning app. Easy to use.,
Very helpful in making online study possible.,
"I like the app, but it's not functional offline, even after downloading the videos.",
I can't comment a exercise.,
I cant find the transcript for the lectures. when I try to get it from the site itself I get re-directed to the video in the app,
"Very useful , cool!",
Awesome app!,
Keep improving!,
Great app for a great cause,
Best Online Education App,
Full of knowledge,
Excellent work,
Perfect,
"On trying to review a peer's assignment, it says check your internet connection and try again. My internet connection is fine and all other features of Coursera were working normally. Otherwise it's a great app and has good courses.",
Just started and so far i'm very pleased with both content and interface,
Its a wonderful app.. learning so much each day.. luvd it,
Very very buggy,
"A very drastic downwards update since October 2016. Apps is no doubt badly built, contradict all intents and purposes of MOOC learning. Not sure it's done on purpose. It's time for Coursera to inform public of change in T&C. Even for those non subscribers, we are paying with our time for courses and your apps ranking. Time to come clean...",
"Two issues especially with offline viewing: 1. Saved videos for offline viewing are, in a few days, automatically deleted (don't know it it has been designed with a time clock to self delete? Pls make it clear it is). I then have to save them all again which uses my mobile data (not free!) and time. It has happened thrice. A hindrance to learning. 2. When the video is paused and played later, it doesn't continue from the last timing of the play it was left at, but it starts from the beginning. Plus it doesn't have the feature for smooth forward (soundcloud app has it even when buffering over online data lest offline). The app is user friendly though but some issues are hindering learning experience for me personally.",
"It's great to have the course material available and to be able to save things offline. But it crashes often. I've gotten the message ""error accessing quiz"" AFTER having completed the quiz/exam, at which point all my answers are thrown away.",
It would be better if you added an option to change the speed of the videos in the app (the same way it is on the video player on the website).,
A must have app for all the young people out there who want to increase their knowledge. Love this app abd website very muchüëç,
Unable to Sign in or sign up. It says network error. While all my other phone apps are working just fine on this network.,
"You cannot get info on individual classes, just the specializations. I'm used to the pc version that allows you to get info on individually classes .",
You provide millions of people opportunity to achieve their goals even if they are already working. This is a great way to add in your personality a new brighter layer.,
I love Coursera but the android app freezing my 2 G.B ram and octa-core mobile.  Please check and solve it quickly because we need to study :),
"The app becomes unresponsive from lock screen and makes phone unresponsive. The only option is to restart the phone. Almost useless as I was planning to watch video while travelling to and from work. Don't get me wrong the courses are great, but the app needs improvements.",
"No more quizzes without purchasing the certificate! Unbelievable! I used to love this app and took many courses but I just tried to submit a quiz for a new course and it only allowed me to see the questions as ""preview"" and in order to submit my answers and see how I did I need to purchase the certificate for $49! That's a total rip-off! I can't believe how greedy something that used to be so good has become! I used to be able to do everything besides the official certificate and now there's no longer any excitement if I'm only allowed to ""audit"" without knowing how I'm doing. Terrible!",
"Nice ap. Nice to learn new skills. I downloaded while on WiFi, which helped save on data costs, but now it doesn't want to download on my phone anymore.",
"When you get an email notification that someone commented on a discussion thread you follow, the link in the email doesn't take you to that thread. It just opens Coursera app and you have to find the thread on your own.",
"Very good app, but lacks a sharing or ""save for later"" or wishlist  feature, which is puzzling to say the least, considering this would benefit Coursera and all of it's users on the creator side as well as the consumer side.",
"Great stuff, have some minor issues, but overall is damn awesome!",
"Gave dis app 5 stars previously, but am finding it difficult 2 review peer assignments as well as making payments,d app nids an update",
It shows network error all the tym.. Please fix it,
"Best App for MOOCs, please provide a way to view and manage all offline videos.",
Great app but can you add broadcast to TV sets feature to it? it will be better to view course on 42 inch LED rather than 5 inch mobile display.,
Excellent app. Literally glitch free. Keep up the good work guys.,
"really Its good, but I like  to use my computer",
"So many great classes to take, great website and app and streaming.",
Amazing online school. I hope in the future more courses about art and film industry,
It would have been better if there was an option to download the videos to sd card like udemy,
This has made learning more easy for me thx guys u have done a great job,
"I love the offline mode, so I may watch it anytime at ease",
"Not as much classes as I would like,",
It brings the classroom right were  you are. Its fantastic,
What they are doing for the world is nothing short of amazing!,
Wonderful learning app. I suggest it to all my students,
Very useful app for those who like to learn as a student.,
Great app! :-) Although the fast forward button does not work...,
Please add the functionality of increasing the video speed,
No more excuses not to learn something.,

"I have a big problem,when i try to subscribe a message pop up with error loading enrollment data.please help me",
It does not log in me and always said that there is the network error,
This is one of the best educational App ever.keep up the standard @Coursera,
Thank you so much for the free education.,
Coursera you're the best,
Ok good,
bad,
"Another new version, another set of bugs. Now that you charge for ""free courses"", you'd think you could afford an app that works. The autoplay for video skips the next video and jumps two ahead. I didn't even realize it for a while. At the end of the course in realized I never saw a whole bunch of videos. The titles displayed while the video is playing doesn't match the content.",
I started using the Android app and it is so slow and frustrating. I am not able to open few lessons which I was reading from web. Some tabs were lagging. Bad experience with Android app. But Coursera is a very good that's why gave 2 stars,
"A couple issues with rotations & video playback and loading saved videos when not having Internet connectivity (subway), but IMHO these are minor issues. Psyched to see that Coursera values its Android user base with a great app. Props to the engineering team--an excellent experience and fantastic execution!!!",
"Update : crashes Everytime I open the app.         Almost infinite courses, of which most are free but a little for certificate, which you can pay later, and deadlines so that you stay focused. This is a perfect place to learn anything.",
The app is great and the content is amazing. I love that it has the option to play the videos on my TV via Google Chromecast.,
"I have no problem with Coursera itself because it is very helpful and useful. My problem, however, is with the app. It has a lot of bugs that I cannot even begin to describe. It lags,   and displays error messages when I save and/or submit my homework; it displays error messages when I submit peer reviews",
"Very good app, if u want to really learn something then u must download it first, especially every aspiring data scientists must have this app",
"Crashes and removes previously downloaded video if you quit app for a second, like for a chat",
I like Coursera but not all my courses are working in app. I have to use browser instead app for such courses. Please fix this bug and I will put 5 start rating as you deserve.,
It says you can opt for free but I am not able enroll free as I don't need certification,
We students are very thankful for such beautiful collection of lectures all around the world.One can go for buckets of online courses which is helpful for enhancing your skills as well as knowledge.Thanks coursesüòÉüòÉüòÉ,
"Pertaining to quizzes that pop up in the midst of a video, many times the images do not load so it's not possible to answer those questions that rely on the images.",
Please add the feature of screen rotation (upside down) while watching videos. It will be helpful.,
"The courses delivered are of a very high quality and offered by the best universities and institutes. The offline feature allows you uninterrupted access. Great job, thanks!",
Nice application. But sometimes offline video showing blank screen. Please fix this issue,
Could you help so that the downloaded videos have the relevant titles and not unintelligible gibberish as their filenames..,
"Very easy to use. Except that sometimes when you accidentally click on a lesson and go back to the course page without having watched the video, it shows the lesson as complete.",
"the best app to learn korean at all , the best helping app to make me update my knowledge at every thing‚ô° best luck‚ô°",
app crashes everytime is try to log in... Doesn't go beyond that,
Absolutely fantastic and a great way to learn basically anything.... Free. Much of the materials used within the classrooms are from some of the best universities. A must for those seeking knowledge and wisdom.,
This app is so innovative and dynamic that I can't just stop using it.,
It would be great if you add notification üîî reminders to stay focused on courses üëç,
"I'm learning this application chines language, and many other courses that is important for personality",
"To be young again, to TAKE advantage of what TODAY offers; APPLYING what I learned YESTERDAY.",
"It would be very helpful if there are transcripts for the videos on the app itself. Some students learn much better when reading as well as listening and, at least for me, it makes it a little easier if I could read along.",
"Great courses, but the app itself is terribly buggy and unstable.",
For courses while other apps doesn't,
The best educational application I had ever seen.Thanks for providing free courses.,
A wonderful platform for learning and catch up or filling gaps from past experience!,
"ReleaseLoggingT thread is a CPU hog when using external sdcard storage, the application became almost unusable when courses are being downloaded in the background. and it heats up the devices quickly to reach the thermal throttling point.",
Really a star app for a mordern unproductive busy life nowdays,
This is the best app ever for learning. It's a whole university in the palm!!,
"Have taken several online courses, they're great!",
I enjoy the way the program presents the materials of the different courses.,
Learning a lot from Universities that I can't afford.,
Love this app,
"Good control on downloaded content, you decide when to download and when to remove to save space.",
Will change the centries old way of learning,

Invaluable tool to learn new skills and refresh on old ones.,
Fulfilled curiosity of people in different subject by Coursera  nice way.,

App is designed well and courses are good,
It helps me reinvent Status Quo on a daily basis ;),
Futuristic endeavors. But need speed controls in app,
Good user friendly.,
today only i knew about this site. very happy to know about all this.,
It's an amazing job you people are doing,

Learning at your own pace is the way to go.,
Big thanks to coursera for easy learning,
Awesome portal for learning the subject you love,
Perfect. Top company. Top app. Congratulations.,

"I have started machine learning course and found that, in assignment section, assignments and weeks do not match, please fix it.",
The pictures in the quizes doesn't load about 50% of the time. It's not fun like that.,
"First of all, it's very tedious to download offline video fit the whole course. To make it worse, they are hidden somewhere. It's not over yet, I downloaded a whole course to watch during my travel and all the videos are either not showing the app or are somehow erased from phone's memory",
"This app is very effective. It will access the students any time any where for its ""save off line"" option. Many thanks to the developer.",
the application became almost unusable when courses are being downloaded in the background.it forces my phone to reboot several times  in android marshmallow Hauwei Nova Plus,
This app isn't detecting 2MBps bandwidth on my Jio 4G network instead it downloads video at 10KBps,
"An excellent conduit to access ivy league education cheaper. Assistance from the coursera  support team readily available. It is a decent platform to amass knowledge and skills , and to enhance your resume.  Loving it.",
"Was doing fine, but today all the courses I've tried have been stuttering, and I changed my wi-fi to check it's not caused by low bandwidth. Nexus 7 (2013) UK.",
"Hey!You wanna learn, try this.Trust me there is no dearth of knowledge.",
"Coursera is an important learning tool, increasing accessibility to knowledge. However, the app has a lot of bugs. Hope it gets fixed soon.",
Everytime it got crashed ...whenever I my internet connection is active,
I love it. Can't say how much i enjoy online education :-D,
sufficiently slow to mke the app unworthy.,
"Great app. Offline learning was what I expected. Now, I have it. Thank you Coursera",
"This App is very useful,it helps me broaden my horizons.",
Don't work subtitles (,
Video streaming and download is a catastrophe. Quizes crashes on submitting sometimes.,
"Coursera is an awesome app for learning. Wish I had enough money to enroll 
in some courses. great app though!!",
I simply love their courses. It's a window to unlimited knowledge,
Still lot of things to improve,
a feature to download lectures to external SD card would be very useful,
nice app helps a lot need some courses over biomedical,
"With coursera, one can be master of all trades.",
"Good App, deliver studies on the Go!",
"Good courses, good teachers, easy to use, very educational.",
Good app very handy to learn things on the go,

Good application for learning,
coursera is very good,
I love Coursera,
Good luck,
Excellent,
Useful,

Useful,
Needs improvement,
Haha,
I can move the app to my SD card but any download for offline viewing is stored on the phone's memory which make it pointless to have moved the app. You might not be using the KitKat API because once moved to the SD card the icon dissappear from the main screen every time I restart the phone.,
But contents are not enough.,
"This was once a great website. Encouraging learning. Now they just want money. I get it, businesses need cash flow to stay in business. However, this free to pay transition is tantamount to a drug dealer, first hit is free, then we charge.",
"I started to watch videos using my data plan, and few videos later is stopped loading, I changed to wifi connection ( several networks) and still got the message (connection problem), other than that I would give it 5 stars",
The app is so full of bugs. They're too many to be mentioned here. And the website is down most of the time. You guys offer courses about programming and can't fix your own app and website.,
"Every few videos, the app would freeze but the video would keep playing with no way to stop it. Force closing the app doesn't stop the video making a reboot of the phone the only solution. The app is unusable because of that.",
"The interface is user-friendly and makes sense, and offline mode is perfect especially if you like to study courses on a plane.",
"I really want to like this application, but the mobile developer is still not ready for prime time. The application has become better, but still doesn't feel mature. I spent a long time downloading the videos at home so I could watch them offline, but a recent update deleted ALL the videos.",
"The app hangs quite often on my phone.( Redmi Note 3,  lollipop)",
I'm trying to download it but an error occurs again and again help me out in downloading this app,
Its such an awesome app for taking a course and learning new stuff. The entire structure is easy and intuitive to follow and every feature of the app works smoothly towards one goal -  keeping you on track and focused about your learning.,
This application is handy when you want to watch lectures either as a review or while away from your notebook or desktop computer.,
"When I watch a lecture, independently on the value I select for video speed (2.0x or 1.5x)tje video plays always at 1.0x speed. This is a very bothersome bug!",
One of the best educational resources out there. This have been serving me for almost 3 years now.,
"Many times I start the app , the mobile restarted, especially when download",
Really useful. Thanks for enabling those courses for people all around the world from top schools,
The tool through which you complete assignments does not open at all!!!,
I loved this app. I enjoyed watching the videos and the assignments are easy to do on my phone.,
Great interface and the offline mode is best,
Its a great platform to learn and get updated and also time saving and convenient.I love it,
Video is not appearing on tv with chromecast,
The door opens the horizon of knowledge.,
I m using this app. You can use.,
Very good n cool app,
Thank you for making quality education available in this way!,
I can not watch videos saved for offline while in airplane mode. How could you not test this crucial functionality??,
That the best app i've ever seen,
Best in class for delivery of online studies.... Love the app,
So many courses and the subtitles make it perfect....  Awesome,
Cannot navigate to home screen with all my courses,
It's useful app for learner,
It's the best gift for a student,
"Samsung Galaxy Note -- ""Open Tool"" button does not function.",

"I used to really like Coursera, but I don't have the time to commit to it to make it worth $79/mo, that would have been at least 2 classes under the old model.  I work full time, have a kid so time is limited and I can only commit to one class at a time.  The program itself works fine, but unless you have time to commit full time to commit classes don't bother downloading this app.",
The app doesn't work very well with Chromecast. It crashes a lot.,
Yet again some failed new update... Now I can't download course videos any more.,
I can't able to log in.,
Gets you engaged and focused. I love coursera app.,
It's amazing.,
The best,
Excellent,
"Currently, I love this app. It gives you the ability to learn anything you want for free online, but the only drawback that I've experienced is how I am unable to submit my answers at the end of the test. It always replaces my input with a couple of lines of code, and says I got the answer wrong, even though it was the answer I submitted.",
"I love coursera, but this review is about the app. It works great, but the Chromecast streaming is still an issue. You can see the progress bar in the tv loading and when is about to finish buffering it then resets and starts over. Then it becomes an infinite loop.",
"The app does everything I'd want it to do and with a good user experience, but there are so many bugs! It crashes and locks up my entire phone regularly.",
Doesn't update my account details and courses. Shows old data. Crashes. Sometimes I have to kill app and restart to get updated data.,
"When I press resume course on the home screen, just a black screen occurs and nothing is happening. Didn't happen before. Edit: That appears to happen only when  im on my wifi",
The app itself is good anyway it's far from perfect. However I give them 5 stars because they provide the best MOOCS's I've ever attended.,
There is no way to find out which courses/parts of courses have been downloaded. Because of this offline and new courses get mixed up and we lose them.,
"Network errors everywhere. In app, in logout, after reinstalling fails to sign in. And web is OK. And network is OK. Sigh",
Just need an update that in app while opening the review your peer work the app is not able to perform the task. Please fix the bug.,
Was expecting a stable and high quality but so far its disappointingly unstable.,
It is quiet easy to use with the latest offline feature which helps to learn lot of things on the go. Educational content is Very good.,
"From 2 days I can't play any offline videos they play only in audio mode no video.And in a lot of time did not work ,stop and giving a black screen.Please help I can not resume my study.",
"I'm using this educational WEBSITE for years and it's simply GREAT! So, I would request to the developers to make the efficient changes to make it the best educational APP as well... :)",
My rating is not so much for the app but more for what the company is trying to achieve. I have done a few courses through the app and it is quite brilliant!,
"Crashes frequently, forces re downloads, hard to use offline because it's so buggy.",
Ugh. I'm not paying just to be able to not participate in assignments so this app is being deleted. 0 stars if I could,
"Please add the functionality of the media player of the website, eg. speed control.",
"The casting function would work better. I often only get audio if it works, which it does not on occasion. Please fix this. I use a note 5 with the latest chromecast on a 802.11 n wifi network.",
"In quiz screen, you guys are possibly adding views (or data to recyclerview/ListView) in onResume(), so everytime I press home button then reopen the app, the content of the screen gets doubled. This is a big app which shouldn't have this trivial kind of bugs.",
"The coursera app is a great companion for the courses online, to the extent that you can actually do the whole course on it. One of the most important features to me id that you can listen to the course while your screen is blocked. This has allowed me to listen to the course while driving or walking down the street.",
One of the main reason I downloaded the app was for a better mobile experience however I have to keep going back to the website due to non-functional Chromecast support so I don't much see the point.,
"Great course content, poor app. Chromecast support is utterly broken.",
"One issue I've noticed is that, for some reason, the Coursera App does not show up on the list of active apps on my Asus Zenfone 2, running Android 4.4.2. Other than that, it has allowed me to carry on with my course while away from the desktop.",
Gives network error! I can browse and use other apps just fine,
"Great fan of coursera content. I bought many courses and it helped me a lot. But would like to see the app not glitch, not buggy. I still don't get the point behind verification...  Anyone can reply!",
Can't increase video speed on tablets versions please add this feature üòä,
I tried taking the quiz for Geoff Hintons course on neural networks. It had lot of mathematical notations but app failed to render.,
Please provide the video speed control option... pleeeeease....this wl then b the best app ever...pleeeeease try to add it in update,
App hangs or never begins playing videos,
"When I open the app and play a video, suddenly the app crashes but the audio will continue in the background. I tried to close the app, did a force stop and even cleared the app cache and whole data but still the audio plays in the background. Finally I had to restart my mobile to stop the audio..  Please solve this issue.. I'm not able to complete my courses on time.. This is happening a lot recently.",
"I started a music theory course and its very good, except that it keeps asking me questions with a photo example that never loads so it's impossible to answer the question! Quite frustrating.",
"I enjoy working with this website/application. I have taken only two free courses so far and signed up for few more. Very informative, wells organized, and motivating! Thank you for this world wide access.",
"Please add functionality for variable speed playback, or at least save the downloads in a public directory.",
This app allows to access video tutorials from the world's best University teachers. I love it.,
So far so good. Surprised to find out I can download.  I had been taking the course on the desktop,
Enrolling in classes has become easier but still runs into cumbersome tasks when reviewing individual courses under specialisations.,
Its simply awesome. It help me lot to be perfect in my field  Thanku courseera üòò,
"Coursera is not free any more, all courses ask to pay money.",
it would be good if there are settings to set the video speed as present in normal website.. pls add it..,
It would be better if there is a way to take and save notes in the app.,
I found when running the videos via Chromecast the video is delayed to play or it causes the app to crash,
I am very satisfied with the app . Whenever I stroll or do home chores I enjoy following an online course.,
Good app but struggles when used with a chromecast. Casting takes ages to start or simply fails. Quizzes during the video are not handled gracefully when casting.,
Vibrant courses and had freedom to choose anything.Great work and Very thankful to the team,
You can take the course free or choose to pay a fee and get the certificate.,
This app charges way too much for the courses they offer there are other apps that provide this info for free!!!!!,
You can even download video and watch it offline :),
"Learning on the go, proving to a very good learning resource for me",
If your in need of good career and education results COURSERA is your home.,
Hopefully the video player can have speed multiplier :),
I loved it. It's the reason behind my new professional career. Thanks Coursera.,
This app works perfectly fine for me. It's definitely a 5 star rating.,
Contents wont load on 10mbps speed as well,
there is no any free tutorials,
Thanks a lot for helping many people to study,
The best to educate online from the world universities More than college,
Awesome app! Works well on and offline!,
"I first overlook it, but it is the best.",
A very specialized learning app. I love it.,
Videos are not loading in app you have to save it for layer and that also downloads at a good speed even if you have good internet connection,
All happening on its good possible way!,
"This Application is very good for me,awesome",
"The app takes ages to cast to Chromecast and it only casts audio, not video....",
"Useful easy to use , Educational and Nice User interface",
"Why does this app need so many permissions? Why contacts, phone identity, Wi-Fi state, and the rest? The authentication even for verified certificates does not need them.",
Shittiest app.Learn from Udacity about efficient app designing.,
The best user experience,
Still have to take it for a ride,
"Not responding in subways, when I need it the most.",
Helpful tool to progress,
Me encantan estos cursos son una buena opcion para los que queremos seguir aprendiendo.,
I only can play video over mobile data. Please fix,
The app hangs frequently!,
Graet app. Great courses,
Great app. Learned a lot,

what about portuguese?,
"I found that I enrolled the The Principle of Finance which hold by Michigan University. I am in Module 4: Company and Project valuation. When I enter the forum through the app, the app doesn't  appearance any thread. Could develop team check again this error?",
"I spend a lot of my times offline downloading videos for offline use, after download multiple videos i lost my access to the tablet. Screen gets off, no poweroff no shutdown, no turn on screen, nothing for at least 1 or 2 hours. I didn't experienced this before, but I have it now with cousera app. Coursera is awesome, I am just not happy with the app. No problem in watching video online using the app. Thanks",
"First of all I want to say that I like Coursera and I like it's platform. But this mobile app has several bugs to solve: 1-. Even if you download the videos, you are unable to play them without conexion (when you play one of the videos, it keeps loading until infinite). 2-. When trying to review a peer to peer work, it is unable to load text correctly and it starts to flash the text. But I am unable to read it this way. I hope thay they solve this soon because I really like the course that I'm doing.",
"Some classes I was unable to enroll in on the app, so I had to go on computer to enroll, which was inconvenient.",
I dont know whether the issue is with my phone or ear phones. But the volume in ear phones is too low to hear.. Please do something for this.. Thanks..,
"Love this app. Works flawlessly, wonderful concept that is full of useful information. App works well no complaints",
This is an incredible way to increase  your knowledge or learn a new subject. Teachers are awesome I'm learning a lot.,
The free features help a lot of us who weren't very financially privileged in our times to complete our education.,
I love coursera but was unable to open individual course pages hence can't use the app. Improve it.,
But this is one of the most jaw dropping apps I have ever seen i will get a credit card just to try this omg I'm stunned,
It would be great if you include a wishlist tab so that we can refer to that course later and don't have to search for the course again... While browsing I find some awesome course but there is no option to save or tag to the favourites so that I can enroll the course later...,
Want to be able to use it on tableton the go but it does not offer sign in with Facebook. Please advise!,
Please fix! Super annoying to not be able to pause.,
With coursera I don't feel like am online at all due to its offline features..  It's awesome...,
"It's a great though of a good people. Which are trying to build a new era of learning of new things. It's useful for everyone , & easy to use .",
"Since this application is on Google play, why can't we make payments to various universities via our network service providers instead of limiting it to credit cards? I would really want to do a number of mouth watering courses but I don't have credit card facilities, neither does my bank allow online payments outside the country. Hence I do my payments to various apps via my Telecom Mobile operator (through airtime). And that's very convenient.",
"Video playback is nice, but can't take quizzes because questions never load (even with a GREAT Internet connection)...",
Best MOOC with plenty of  short span courses.,
i like coursera but the app needs to improve the quality of videos!!!,
Infinite loading after update.,
High quality tutorials with mazing interface !,
The Chromecast feature doesn't work.,
"Bring back the old courses, please!",
Thanks coursera for access to such awesome video lectures,
This is one of the best platforms to learn any course.,
Its an  excellent way to learn.,
It is really a good app for aspirants,
Offers one of the best online courses,
I cannot hear the voice when I play,
Excellent app to learn...!,
not optimised for Android tablets?,
Very interesting! !!,
Great app,
Simply beautiful,
Very good,
Excellent,
Nice app,

"Good content but the organization of the app can be better. The layout seems very messy and it's not easy for me to keep track of my courses.   For tablets:  The playback speed selection is not available for tablets, which is very disappointing. The text size on the course description and notes sections can't be adjusted also, and it's difficult to read the small texts from a tablet. Missing the whole point of tablets being bigger devices for bigger displaying.",
"The UI is nice and I love that I can take quizzes easily on it. But the video playback speed changing is broken for me. It worked briefly when I first started using the app, but hasn't worked for the past few updates. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still wouldn't work. And I don't even have the option to change the speed on my tablet. This means that I still have to use a browser to progress at a speed I find reasonable. Phone is a OnePlus One, Android 6.0.1, Cyanogen OS 13.1.2",
The app keeps loading forever and crashes quite often. The learning experience is very bad. I would recommend chalkstreet. They have good learning experience and offline download option as well. The content is well structured too. I don't think so coursera bothers about enhancing the app experience. Please fix the app ASAP.,
"Cool app design. I have trouble downloading videos to SD card. When I switch to secondary it only 'download' the assignment or readings, but not videos",
"Well the courses are excellent, but it could be better if there could be other alternative payment gateways like paytm, freecharge etc. Kindly see to it.",
"Smooth and simple UI, let's you take courses and simplify your experience, I like that because you don't waste your time.",
"Nice app, only problem is if i get a call in middle of video, video does not paus",
In-lecture quiz is finally implemented! Now it's better than Web as the app also has offline mode.,
"The app force close as soon as I try to ""Verify""",
"Good app, but would like to be able to bookmark courses for later viewing/enrolling. The best way to do this I found is to save the courses straight to Evernote from the app",
I've enrolled in a course and used this app thoroughly. Mighty impressed with the delivery mechanism and UI.,
Videos that are saved offline have names that does not make any sense. I want to watch the saved videos on my laptop. How can convert those random names so that they make sense..please help!! Have two complete courses saved on my phone and my phone broke down!,
"Never been able to download.. not even one video at a time, pauses automatically saying waiting for wifi.. even when it's OK.",
"In verify, take photo, app keeps crashing",
This is a great app for learning for learning. This experience have been amazing ever since I started using it. Please I don't seem to know where to view my feedbacks both in app and on the mobile site. Help?,
My HTC one m9 crashes every time I run this app,
"I like the app, it clearly outlines courses available to me; however, it would be even better if there was a facility that would let me 'bookmark' courses that interest me and I may like to take at some point in the future.",
One of best programs you can get good learning opportunities for free thanks,
The app is useful to review lesson and learn something new. I really appreciate!,
Love Coursera my app goes on my phone fast! AND MY TABLET TO:),
Great app. Thank you Coursera for making knowledge available and accessable.,

Huge source of knowledge about uncommon subjects. It would be great if more courses are free. Some courses are very basic which takes in a lot of time to move to the main subject as all of them are mandatory. Coursera has helped me a lot in my professional career.,
"The app lets you browse and join courses, watch videos, save them for offline access and take quizzes. HOWEVER you end up having to log-in for discussion forums and peer graded assignments. Kindly consider adding these features in app to make it a standalone solution and not a complementary offering. +1 star if in-app discussion forums added.",
"I love coursera ,but the Android mobile version just stopped working a weeks ago and it seems like coursera isnt working on that. I just cant watch any course offline because it always says ""Error reading subtitles file....."" .ive seen lots of people complain about it",
Used to be good but now have to pay to see the scores of the course quiz. I don't want a certificate but do want to know if I'm getting the questions right. ¬£37 is a lot just for quiz results. Uninstalling as pointless if I can't see if I'm actually learning anything.,
I want to learn german but there  is no such courses on coursera . Please add more language courses,
I have been using it from last 4 months. The improvements are noticeable and its dashboard look is awesome,
"If you are making an app or a website for that matter, it has to be quick. It cannot be so slow that the person feels bored and closes the app. This goes for both your website and ur app. YouTube vids can load quickly. But coursera videos. No. They just won't",
Pls give solution for not streaming or downloading videos. It shows error everytime that wifi error. You need to resolve this problem as your every user complaining abbout this.,
"On phone, the most I can get from an app is go through discussion and save time at laptop for watching videos, taking notes, and doing assigenments. But discussion forums are not included !!! So The App is useless in my case",
"The app is good, and user friendly, except the fact that I've used to hang up often in my old phone, but I am not holding against it. Keep up the good work",
It needs improvement in user navigation. For some features it requires to use browser which is frustrating,
"Only reason I have the app is so I can verify my quiz results for a certificate ... the feature doesn't work.  Please fix this, and I will reconsider my rating.  Coursera Support Case #1225804",
"Interface is good but I have to save the same videos over and over again, I am not clearing app data and it still happens",
Great app. Lots of interesting courses and ability to learn offline. However after the latest patch the photo verification crashes the app. Very inconvenient!,
"Can't pay. I receive an error that says ""contact Coursera for assistance."" No way to contact them. Useless until they respond to me. Browsing EDX, Kahn, and others now.",
I don't know how but the offline videos get deleted automatically. I have to keep downloading same videos again and again!!,
I dont know how to explain the perfectness of this app.sometimes i think of not going to university and studying at home with this app.,
I love the app and it is great for videos and for downloading so I can listen on the bus. Sometime I just want to read the material and I cannot access the transcripts on the app. I have to go to the mobile site which is very annoying.,
No way to get new password after forgotten. Such a low grade mistake!,
"Amazingly eficient, doesn't pollute you with notifications (like duolingo), with OFFLINE MODE. Overall useful",
"You can't enrol single course. Also, the courses are very basic and short. It is about only 5-10%,of real university courses. If I pay for something, I want to obtain full course, not short version.",
It's easy to use and easy to get into the course directly. Courses available are really cool.,
Its all about educating people. We all should work towards making this knowledge of ocean free...,
App crashes when I try to take a photo for assignment verification.,
Very fluent app and needless to say such a great initiative.,
I can promise that you will learn so many things.,
I loved this app so much because I can learn anytime anywhere using this awesome app.,
I have a problem on peer review assignments plz fix it.,
"Brilliant app. Now I can watch my favourite lectures anywhere, anytime.",
"Assignment submission is possible. But there is no editing options like bold, italics, etc.",
Keeps crashing on my nexus 5x,
I've immensely benefited from this educational tool.,
Could be better if i was able to see what videos i saved. And have a list of them,
Offline mode is good but need to be able to save data to SD card.,
Useful and handy app for mobile users instead of desktop PC or laptop.,
I have gained enormous skills from courses offered on Coursera,
Great content. However offline videos feature is not working.,
"Awesome , I learn here what I want .",
It works perfectly well for me,
I do not sign up for accounts with apps before I try them.,
I've used this app to study at home I  coffee shops and basically anywhere there is WiFi!,
Hgdc Jeff if eh I hgty,
Many course s in apps are paid but i want to watch . why cant you make them free,

"I downloaded the app because it came up when I searched 'Learn Spanish Offline' in Google Play Store. I was therefore surprised that it does not offer Spanish courses. In general the app looks good, useful and one I could keep if you would please introduce a Spanish course , preferably Level A1/A2",
"Feels smooth and has all features I need. The only missing feature for me is video speed adjustments (available on the web), and the only bug I've encountered is that when my phone's screen turns off while casting course videos (as expected), when in-video questions need to pop, they don't. I need to keep waking it to ensure questions are not lost. Excellent app in all other aspects.",
"Before Android 6 I always hadp to kill the process in order to load the app. It was always slow in loading, which is annoying, because I simply want to see downloaded video. Now since Android 6 it stopped to work at all. Looking forward for an update to keep learning..",
"The app was ok. You could download the lectures but some of the features are not available for mobile so you still need a computer etc to do everything.  The big issue came with the last update: now whenever I open the app, all I get is a blank screen. I just uninstalled and reinstalled but if it doesnt work I wont bother anymorel. Sadly, since coursera changed platform (and has increasingly become more pay-per access oriented) the course quality has gone down.",
I can't see the possible answers while taking the quiz. Done images just aren't loading.,
"The app itself is amazing, interface is great. Lectures get downloaded fast. But. It takes forever to load.",
"It's a great app whenever it works. However, it saves the videos on the phone even if SD card is selected. Even more frustrating is that it doesn't load or play saved videos offline and keeps crashing.",
One f d Best app.. Made d toughest thing to me so easy and understandable.,
I have been using it for quite some time and very often when I open the app it justs shows a blank white screen which is very annoying. There are a few other bugs also like this. I hope it is resolved soon. It is an useful app though(when it works fine).,
Saying a big thank you to the creators of coursera. Coursera is arguably one of the best things to happen to online learning and enlightenment. Scholarly education is now right in the palm of our hands. Well done Coursera.,
"It would be a five star if it could give me the transcripts to read on my tablet etc. But overall, brilliant.",
Unfortunately the offline mode still not working after so many updates or patches. Rather disappointed.,
"Also needs to incorporate the peer assessed assignments. Besides that and the crashing regularly, love it dearly",
Answers for assessment disappear and application navigates back when rotating screen being on assessment screen. Assessments are just not shown after navigating to them in landscape mode. These bugs appear at least in Algorithms Part I course by Sedgewick & Wayne.,
I have alway wanted 2 broaden my horizon. Coursera has made it possible 4 me. Thanks guys. Keep up the good work.,
Coursera is great service for learning!  But mobile app missing one important feature - you can't speed up video (you can do it using site).  Please add video speed-up!,
Audio is moving faster than the video.,
Cruise through Courses as per your liking.... Very very impressive courses design n content! Future of education! Get the best in the world from anywhere in the world,
"Videos once saved as offline doesn't play, what's the point of saving then? Hope you resolve it in coming updates.                                                            Edit : Okay it doesn't work saving videos on sd card, maybe restricted rights or something, working fine while saving on phone memory.",
I'm just loving it through and through. On my third course now and getting an education for a lifetime.,
"After download,  reopen app, will lost connection with just downloaded video, Can not find downloaded video",
excellent. effort by the makers to connect the students all around the whole .,
Itll be great to have the discussions sync with the online forums.,
Doesn't allow to download videos in SD card. Doesn't support auto rotate.,
Can't post either,
Really so much helpful,
"Good, yet room for improvement.",
Loved it. Great app.,
"Sometimes ""Saving for Offline"" usage doesn't work.",
It's motivating,

Important tool to enhance career,

Constantly crashes,
"The lectures and courses are good. However, the offline mode does not work. I can download lectures but when I try to watch them it still tries to stream them. If I use a file explorer I can find the downloaded videos but the titles are not human readable. The app also does not save videos to my SD card. It gives that option but still saves to local memory. If the app played the downloaded videos when offline i would up to 5 stars.",
"I have really enjoyed using the app and have done several courses using it. However, the last update has killed it on my phone. Now, all I get is a white acreen and the phone locks up even when there are no other apps running. I hope they fix this soon.",
"I've used this app at early stages and thought what a great world we live in now,  everyone has an opportunity to access learning materials that they may not have access to due to economic,  geographic,  or other reasons. Back then it was free,  and I've enrolled to a filmmaking course,  which was rather useful to expand my horizon. I didn't use the app for a long time,  and tonight when I wanted to check if there is any digital marketing course,  to my disappointment there were few,  but now all for ¬£360.",
"I really appreciate this because it allows people to always have access and the ability to better there knowledge. So thank you!!!. . . . . . . One thing I want to suggest is a watch/reminder, or favorites/interested option to select like a star symbol or something to click on so you can know which other lessons you want to sign up for later or when you don't have as many lessons as, maybe, you do. Ph an less of the instructions just the order, in which that lessons, videos and tests is good enough for me.",
"Cannot set video playback speed anymore, has trouble switching between portrait and landscape mode. [EDIT] it looks it was fixed with the latest update. Also the offline mode seems more reliable. I would appreciate more informative changelogs.",
"I was reluctant to leave a review about an update that broke the app (can't get past empty white screen), but now that it's gone nearly two weeks without being corrected and emails to tech support have gone unanswered I think it's warranted.",
"The coursers app itself is generally easy to use, but it is very frustrating to search for a course and see there are 100's of similar courses related to your search only to find that most of these matches are either in a language you don't speak or are in fact not related to what you're after. It'd be good to at least be able to filter out for your native language instead of having to trawl through the many unhelpful results in Spanish/Chinese or whatever else the courses are listed in.",
"You can't view comments on the questions in the forums or reply on them, it's a major bug i hope you solve it early",
This app is not useful for all people in the world. They think that learning is not good for third world people. It's a kind of racism.,
App doesn't load at times. Shows white screen and stops responding.,
"Sometimes, when I get bored, I go to my backyard, cover myself in earth and pretend to be a carrot üòçüòò",
Learning while travelling by bus to office... Sometimes I hope to get stuck in traffic so that the lecture gets over :),
Now the app is unusable. I can't find my courses or search for new ones.,
"The app says separate courses can be taken for free by clicking on them, but none of that works, the only link that does work is the payment page...",
"Big thanks to whole team behind this wonderful platform, You guys are helping alot of people in this world in pursue of their dream career.",
Courses are rather basic and not from top universities. The app is crap and doesn't load most of the courses.,
"I'm currently pursuing Politics and Economics of International Energy, and I couldn't be more satisfied! Great range of courses offered from different universities of the world. With the app studying becomes more mobile! Great going guys.. Keep up the good work!",
"Nothing happens, no progress indication and no error message.",
I really like the app since the beginning but it's all about Science if you guys improve Arts & Humanities i'll hit 5*.,
Very slow app. Crashes often. Has tons of bugs. Please add the feature for changing the playback speed of a video. Also it would be better if this app was a foreground app instead of running in the background all the time,
"After giving more than sufficient time to start the playback, it keeps on buffering and the video never starts. And after sometime the app stops working and OS suggest to force stop it.",
"The very first time I saw this app I felt glad!%                                                                      education is at our door steps,we learn in or home.I learn in my bed everyday watching my new coursera courses videos.it's interesting for me.",
Used to be a great app. Since the last update it fails to play downloaded lectures on galaxy tab 10. This makes it useless for me. Would greatly appreciate a fix.,
"The pictures on quizzes don't load, verification almost never happens. The desktop version is better, don't ever try to go app only with this product.",
"Now with this application I can continue studying my Coursera courses on the go, even when I'm offline, it provides everything I need for learning, I really appreciate it. And I strongly recommend this to everyone who takes online training serious.",
Even with multiple updates the downloading videos bug still remain. The function works with the default storage selected but it doesn't with the SD storage selected. Please fix it for five stars.,
Improve your skills ppl. There is nothing else like this.,
It's a great app with good content. One option which the app need is the option to see saved courses/prioritize the course I have enrolled for rather than going through all course I have enrolled to find the course I'm attending at the moment.,
This used to be useful but without chromecast things have changed a bit. Please bring back chromecast support.,
I gave 5 stars. but the new versions don't works. he alway ask to login again and I can't use off line. please fix it. Fixed now I gave 5 stars,
Where has all the free options went off i cant do any of the course for free it says lie,
This was a great app  it after recent update it won't open Have tried reinstalling That sorted for a while but gone wrong again Will try unintelligible again,
Nice website but app freezes my Redmi note 3 too frequently in online mode,
Coursera is a great platform. Taking full advantage of the resources provided. Thanks to all who have contributed!,
It does not show up in the running apps list (especially when the app is running). Nor is it present in the list of the latest apps. What on earth?? Also - it's lagging and VERY slow to start up,
The video keeps buffering even with a 20mbps connection,
App is not working on my LG G4. Very dissatisfied,
I cant reply to my own threads in the discussion forum,
"The app is definitely easy to use. Watching lecture videos on the go, attempting quiz etc. is easy. Some expected features: (1) Final project submissions and/or peer review (2) ""Wishlist"" feature (adding courses to look at later) or ""recently viewed"", both in the app & desktop site (3) Separate tab or quicker access to university pages within Coursera, to check list of all courses offered by them.",
Can't add postings to discussion topics. Send button doesn't work.,
Well I haven't tried it yet but I think it is amazingüòçüòç,

Os melhores cursos do mundo na palma da sua m√£o!,
But doesn't work fluently.,
Great free course app!,
Best mooc app.,
Recommended.,
Add some courses in Hindi language,
Offline mode makes it perfect,
This is the best application for learn,
This is best,
Overall OK app and syncs well with the server. App doesn't play offline downloaded videos without an internet connection or does it randomly.,
Device : Lenovo s850,
Very very useful,
Great app for learning,
Good MOOC app,

What a incredible app,
Courses,
Gud 4 learnin,
Helpful,
Love it,
Awesome,
No Facebook login!!!!,
Online,
Thank you for making this website and app. It helped me alot! Keep up the good work!!,
Very nice,
"I truly like this platform and the app in general (especially the download of videos and immediate sync between website and app) but it bugs me that not all features are available in it... Also, it's quite bad that we cannot see imagens or graphs in the quizzes so I end up having to change to the website halfway through a quiz (and restart it) or guess the answer. The worst is that since the last update it keeps crashing, especially when trying to download videos. Huawei P8 Lite",
"the app is great and all but I got really frustrated when downloading video on WiFi, always get waiting for WiFi even if WiFi is working and the phone is 30 cm near the router. Seriously need to address this bug",
"whenever i try to watch any video or download it, it will take forever and never play",
"This is a fantastic app for those who are interested in learning more and broadening their horizons. There are so many subjects to dive into, it is hard to decide what to sign up for.",
"I forgot my password and now I can't get it back every time I try they e-mail is never delivered. Can you please provide an IT email address, so maybe they can fix it? Please provide it and I will give 5 stars. Thanks,",
"Very useful app. In the quiz, some long statements are not wrapped properly.",
"When downloading videos for offline use, the app freezes and refuses to download or show courses. It's also horribly slow to navigate.",
Nice app to learn new things everyday. Waiting for support of peer graded examination support. There is a new update every next day.,
"I tell everyone I know about Coursera  and how with this app, they can even learn while on the bus. Little by little, you can do this!",
"OK, the auto-resume Downloads from stop seems to be working. Nice app",
"Quits trying to play video ""oops something went wrong..."" Restarted app, restarted phone. Same error. Works on tablet so it looks like it needs way too many resources for the phone and the error reporting is poor. It's just a streaming video player!",
"I can get it open but when I scroll, it just closes/crashes. I have a huawei p9 lite. Can you please fix it?",
This app is really nice and easy to use and doesn't freeze or hang. Offline feature is also great,
Hats-off to the amazing work done by Coursera. Especially I love the idea that access to knowledge should be free. Very useful app.,
Solved all previous issues with Chromecast,
"After verification I can't watch any lectures, video is not loading",
Even though I usually use coursera on larger screens the mobile experience has never failed me.,
Still I am stuck in login,
Unable to download lectures and dosent let us choose the download location.,
This first came out and they didn't try and charge you hundreds of dollars for a class.,
"This app is really helpful to access the course contents anytime, anywhere!",
This App made my dream of having a quality education possible. Thank you Coursera.,
Great to be able to have quick access to my future education possibilities at my fingertips!,
"Offline mode is just what was needed to be perfect, congrats to the team",
You E-learning destination,
This is the one I was looking for...,
"It's a great app, take learning in your pocket...",
Awesome!,
Loved it....,
Vary helpfull,

üëçüëçüëçüëç,
Very helpful. Replaced my PC and browser. Excited Really!!! Thanks for developing the app.,
Great ui.. Most useful app. However the save for later feature doesn't work well.. Lectures aren't downloading after 90%.,
UI is very good .deals good with all genres of students,
Coursera is my 1st and favorite online learning source on the internet.,
I've learned a lot thanks to this app,
Awesome classes and affordable,
A great app by a great educational organization.,
Most wanted app!!!!,
Just love it,
"One issue I have is that whenever I press the home button and minimize the app,  and then open the recent apps menu, I can't find the coursera icon at all!  But when I click the icon in the app drawer, everything is just as I left it. Weird.. Don't know why this is happening,   I'm on Android 4.4 kitkat.  Please fix this bug. Thanks!",
Good app but I can't save videos for offline.It shows downloading the video but when completed there will be no files in the offline section.pls fix the issue,
My coursework doesn't update even though I finished them online. I find that a bit frustrating. Apart from that everything works well and app is very clean.,
"The app is great, very intuitive and minimalist. I enjoy learning even while jogging on a treadmill.",
"And good mobile app. Works nice, you can download the courses on Wi-Fi and the battery drain is quite reasonable",
"It's a great app, I can make very cool online courses and study it everytime with interactive texts, pictures and videos :)",
"Liked the new update, makes the courses more interesting.",
One of the most productive app ever.. 10/5,
This App has been of great help to me educationally.,
High quality content served by a high quality application. It is truly revolutionizing the way people learn!,
It helps you to improve your skills,
Very good app but some of the courses need money,
This is the best app for learning web development....,
I benefited immensely from this app,
Nice one but not ok,
"I receive an error: ""Can't play video"", when try to open course video. It happens with all courses, so basically app doesn't work at all. Nexus 4, Android 5.1",
The app is just awesome!!!,
Excelent online courses,
$‚Ç¨¬£¬•,
It has issues,
Working good,
very helpful,
Amazing app,
Loved it,
Will,
:),
Super,
"okay.. I was able to play the videos online but after a couple of weeks it started to have a problem.. it cannot play videos online no matter how many times i tried.. our net connection is just okay, i can even play youtube videos.. also, no matter how many times i tried to download the videos it just won‚Äôt.. i already uninstalled and installed it again but the condition is still the same.. i hope they will fix it cause i really enjoy this app.. btw im using the mobile version",
"The app has been getting better and better. I started using it about a year ago and it seemed a bit buggy and disjointed, but it works well now. Chromecast always works as expected, the courses are laid out logically, you get access to every piece of functionality like accessing forums and enrolling or dropping courses.",
Build in flash/html5 video player cannot reproduce videos correctly. I need to browse to the app folder and use vlc player.,
It would be great if you could play the videos at higher speeds like x1.2 or x2,
Thank you coursera founder for making coursera possible and also making it possible to atted lectures of great teachers from top universities of the world.,
"Coursera provides the magic choice , while all courses are free to watch the quality is from top universities with a payment option for certificate",
"When I dismiss a notification instead of clicking it, there is no way to find it again in the app Also, occasionally even after completing week's assignments, it still says not completed for a while afterwards!  The controls on the video player do not hide quickly enough!",
"With a busy schedule, this would work perfectly for me. However, none of the videos would download for offline use. Don't tell me my videos are ready and then they're not even downloaded. Do I have to pay to use that feature? My review will change once this little tidbit is resolved . . .",
It's nice to be able to download course materials for offline viewing!!,
Some videos when downloaded do not appear in the app ... overall .. It is the best educational app,
On the go learning made great!,
Most of em r paid Courses,
Great app,
Tons of information,
I love the courses,
Amazing courses,
wow,
Education,
"This app is a bit glitchy at times, not linking to assignments and things. However, the convenience of being able to easily keep up with lectures is fantastic. I've never paid for a course, though the option to pay for the certificate is excellent in my opinion.",
"The app works fine when there is a good data connection but it otherwise freezes up when trying to play downloaded videos.  It appears to forget which videos are downloaded too- the top says they are all downloaded but individual videos do not.  A way of navigating to downloaded videos would be helpful.  The videos have a Chromecast symbol on them, but it is always disabled.",
Must pay for course. There is no free option. Checked reviews. No one has  found free enroll option either.,
"With the latest version, I lost access to the downloaded videos on my device, can't see them through the app,  while they still take up 2.5GB of space. Wish I knew where they are,  but the relevant settings entry, is again missing from the latest version.",
"It's download the videos, but don't mark it as downloaded videos. Trying to retry, but experience same problem. I'll appreciate for your help. Anyway, i'm using LG G4 Stylus",
"Every time I go to play a video, it is not possible to full screen the video/skip ahead in time/get rid of buttons on screen, and after 20 seconds the media player crashes and I have to quit the App. Happens every time I try",
I've been using this for several years and it is helping me towards my larger exams at my local colleges to attain designations.,
"All I see is pictures, no answer options. Mobile web version doesn't have this problem but it is just poorly designed (lots of overlapping, very slow loading etc.)",
"Busy with the Learning How To Learn Course, and loving it. The option to save videos offline has saved me a few times and kept me in track. Wish there were more free courses and additional content added for areas such as Horticulture and Psychology.",
Attempting and grading test was a major motivation for taking a great even when one can't pay for verified certificate. Consider restoring the function.,
Just some features still missing. But you should group courses from same specialization together.,
Features a lot of knowledge in the form of video tutorials. Recommended for anyone eager to learn new things.,
"Excellent app, helps me to keep abreast of course content while traveling... very convenient.",
Im having problems as basic as with login,
I just love the app. The UI is just awesome and the feature to save videos for offline is very nice. The downloads are managed better than any other app like YouTube.,
Not able to cast video on tv using chromecast,
I love this app so much. It has helped me a lot,
Very good . Easy to use and the course is well designed.,
"Hey, the app is okay, but why is it not possible to download the lecture slides?! It is extremely annoying!",
Useful and looking forward to learning alot with this app.,
Won't stop till you stop.,
Thsnks a lot mostly it was loved by indians,
Awesome ! üòÇüòÇ,
This used to be free. You only pay if you want to receive certificates and diplomas. Sorry I have to uninstall.,
Why lecture video speed cannot be increased?,
The app is now ok,
Great app,
Fantabulous,
Nice,
"I tried to make the payment for a course using my mobile , but I coulnd't because it doesn't let me choose my country (Brazil) or set my credit card name. But I do finished the process by my computer. I'm looking forward to see this little issue solved in near future.",
"When I increase a video's speed, the video and it's audio get unsynchronized. Also it doesn't let me to download videos via cellular network. Update: they added downloading via cellular. Imagine you saved some videos for offline browsing and go somewhere, where there's no network available. You won't be able to see those videos, because first the app needs to download the list of your courses and then the structure of the course you want to use at the moment. It's rather silly that the app doesn't save the information about courses to make the downloaded videos available offline. So I still can't use the app offline.",
"God the app is bad. Constantly switching back and forth from app to mobile browser because 'sorry this feature is only supported on web', you try to use it on a browser and chrome gives you error. And you can't request the desktop version of the site or the verification goes nuts",
"The world is becoming more and more developed day by day, so it's our job to enhance ourselves before we are forced to do so and coursera is one of the best ways for indulging in self paced learning and that too from top universities ad instructors",
You have to pay to take classes so you can get a certificate with little rral world worth. Sucks.,
The charm has lost cz u have to pay for every course . I used to like it before very much.,
After logging in with Facebook it just stays on the login page with no option to go further.. Crappy total bollocks,
I'm so glad to know u.I love learning knowledge. I love understanding science. But I'm in bad situation that don't have this .I'm so so glad for you. I love you and thank you for helping me to be able to make my wishes true.my wish is knowledge,
"Like that app can save video, but really miss speed change feature from browser version",
"On the whole, this app is useful. It would be great if you could play at higher speeds, though",
So much has changed over the years. It's a wonderful experience to be on Coursera.,
The app gives us the opportunity to expand our knowledge any time any where allowing us to continue our course any where.,
"It is good at easy learning in mobile, But it doesn't respond some time..",
Very good  for  those  students  who  have  limited  opportunities  but unlimited  thirst  for  knowledge,
By virtue of well organised online line learning platform provided by coursera students and professionals can keep themselves updated and can enrich their knowledge or skills.,
Worth 4 stars. Plus one for chromecast support.,
Troubles with login with facebook,
Good to have coursera in tablet for doing online courses,
And easier to use,
I love this website...knowldge is expanded,
The app keeps improving,
It is the best app to learn courses,
For some reason after sign up it wont transition to any other page,
Good way to learn anywhere and anytime......,
A great place to learn,
Very usefull,
Why is it asking for a password to sign up?,
There is anyone who got a certificate from this app? ?,
"Many improvements to the previous versions of the Courses app. However, when reading lesson materials the text is very small and zoom in not enabled. There should be a way to adjust font size!",
Thanks,
"I log in with Facebook and it just tells me I'm logged in, doesn't let me do anything after that. :–≥",
"You cannot even take a quick look at it without signing up. If you opt to use Facebook to sign up and edit it's options to remove your email it won't let you login with Facebook. I gave access to read my account info, you don't need my friend list nor do you need my email address. If you do then don't make it optional. Now that I've read that you really only sell courses and classes I can see the insistence of having my email. You'd end up on my spam list anyways.",
"Poor design, unusable. It's as if a student wrote it after taking one of their classes. There is no easy way to get to discussions,  missing 90% of features found on Web,  and they force you to use this app because they removed their mobile Web site.",
"Great content, clunky app. Cons: Discussion boards practicality unusable in app. Threads don't sort properly, no search function. Other sections of course won't work on mobile, requiring a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile website completely useless. Unlikely to get through a course on mobile alone. Pro: ability to download content for offline use.",
"Free education with no pesky ads? Sign me the fook up! This is so wonderful for wanting to learn something but not having to search around on the internet, only to be found in bits and pieces! Not only that, but it's more than just a broad overview of whatever and then ""OK that's it you're done"", it's just in-depth enough to firmly grasp the idea without going too far and being profoundly boring (or at least, the Stanford nutrition course. The other ones are iffy)",
I want to major in Japanese but my school doesn't offer and I'm having trouble transferring. Please offer more languages.,
"The irony of the smartphones and stupid people is that here I am commenting on the service rather than commenting on the app. The courses are free to take, but you won't get certification until you pay. That's a perfectly fair deal. It takes time and effort to grade your submissions, so submissions come under the paid tier. This does not mean that you don't get to learn - the courses are free to take. The app is laggy even on powerful phones, so that certainly needs to be fixed.",
"Since MOOCs make global launch to initiated open education, as far as I know I'm very supported to this movement, very excited. Seems well their provide app too, this is make easily me to embrace the education. Good app, good idea, good service. This is excellent.",
Doesn't work very well when viewing videos offline. The app freezes for ages and is unresponsive when playing downloaded videos until the network connection attempts seemingly time out.,
Videos for lecture programming android applications for mobile handheld systems part-1 are not opening... It keeps on giving the error to check my network connection...y internet connection is working fine... Fix this.. Is the fix temporary that the same issue arises again n again... Is there any one to fix this issue??? Now the app is also crashing..,
"The app is great, but I find myself unable to use Chromecast, because I won't know if I missed something important without the quizzes. Had it been able to pause the casting and show quizzes on the phone it would be perfect for me.",
I would rather prefer Some free education and not pay such huge amount on the courses.,
"To submit assignments you need to log in through the browser... But when you try access the assignment page in your browser, it opens the page in the app = infinite loop of painful bad design!",
"In general stable, just a bit annoying to key in  logins",
Lacks a ton of things the website has which makes learning on the go really difficult.  It's basically a shell compared to the website.  Sentiment mine that coursera and make your app not completely limp.,
The courses are all interesting but everything I want to do is part of a specialization or expensive.,
I would appreciate if you people  view some courses from udacity-your corrival and see how interactive their platform has become !,
Free to download but beware you have to buy every course much easier in a University instead thanks for nothing spreading the word that this app has false advertisement om the app. Contacting Samsung and tell them to delete the app for misleading students. Be prepared for losing your app.,
"The video optimization part is superb. High quality videos at a very low size, just love that",
thanks for opening chances to the world. am glad because am able to access courses which are not offered to my developing nations.,
"I already have an account with Coursera. Every time I try and open the app on my 5S Galaxy Android phone I can't go any farther then the login page. I have retype my information several times, I have Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and I have even tried to make a new profile and I still cannot get passed the login page. I have Coursera on my computer but the app will not work for my phone. Will someone please fix this problem. It is annoying and frustrating.",
"Certain parts are locked to portrait orientation, this makes it difficult to use especially if using on a tablet. Design for tablets could also be improved to better utilize the screen space and especially the landscape orientation.",
"This apps was good. I mean, of course it's better to set a laptop/pc to learn online, esp for CS courses which needed running a software, but in my rushing time this apps save me",
Initially started using the browser version if the app for my business analytics course and then boom! Discovered I could cast the app on my Plasma TV with the Chromecast app giving me a better experience. Love this app!,
I don't understand why you need to know what apps I'm using? Browsing history? Are you spying on us?,
Has got struck in front page,
"I don't what has happened, i like this app and coursera too but, I've started a course as audit it for free, it had taken the week-end quiz and also accepted it but after update on the second week, is asking me to buy a course in order to submit it.... What!!! Is it...",
when you have to be online to open the app...,
Unable to login or register after 3 4 attempts,
The sound volume is too low. But the app is fantastic,
The feature that allows you to take the videos offline is the best. Makes for a nice learning experience.,
Great companion to the desktop experience. Watching videos and answering quizzes is seamless and effortless with this great accompaniment. Great job coursera!,
These courses help keep my mind sharp. Thank you.,
"I can't use it at all. It says I'm signed in, but I can't see any menu, my courses or other options.",
Coursera on the go is a great way to make your journeys more productive.,
This app is meant for using on a tablet. Please make the experience better.,
"Jusr installed this App, unable to login even after enabling access on my FB account... plz fix this....",
Needs improvement in syncing and performance tweaks in many areas,
Give us the choice to use mobile data to download videos,
"Good, but many functionalities are still not supported on the app",
"Great courses, and with the new update no more ""hanging"" problems. Thank you so much :)",
The FUTURE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR EVERY ONE,
The app is very easy to operatre and the courses are amazing.,
That is cool.,
Thumbss up for this app! Happy learning everyone!,
There's a facility for enrolling free. But there's no option for that! Please help...,
Please add an option to wishlist or a view later button for the courses,
Ventanas abiertas a conocimientos aldededor del mundo :),
It would be amazing if i get to know how to get courses for free  .can anyone tell me plz??,
Great job.....knowledge shoul reach to everyone free....noble work u r doing,
A lot. Access to every feature of coursera isn't available yet,
Stucked on the login page even after logging in.,
Loved it!,
The stars given are for concept. Have not used it yet,
I love it.,
Nice app and very educatied,
Works offline. Thank you.,

Great app,
Nice one,
Informative,

priceless,
I downloaded coursera app and tried logging in using my registered email. It gives me a network error but my mobile is connected to the internet. Plz fix this bug asap,
"With headphones, I can take in a lecture on the way to and from work... And even on the toilet, if I'm particularly constipated. The built in Chromecast is fantastic, letting me watch on a television while I take notes. Sadly, on my stock Android Nexus 5, the ""Add to Calendar"" button doesn't work. That needs fixing.",
Used to be great. Now however all the best features are taken away. I liked how the teachers posted recommended reading material and such in the free version. Yes I understand that it's free so you're not going to get the whole deal but it's little stuff like that that made you feel like you're taking a real class. I do however like some of the new upgrades like the grouping of classes and such very helpful.,
"I don't know what to say to describe the opportunity brought to me through this app. It would not have been possible to complete my courses easily, but the app makes my class to be with me everywhere I go, even in the toilet! I am loving it...",
"This is a lovely app. UI is so pleasing. Hassle-free navigation. Need I talk about the courses??  Their standard is incomparable since they're coming from highly reputed Institutes. One thing I noticed is that I am not able to add due dates to the calendar although the feature is present in the app. Except this one tiny hiccup, this is an amazing app.",
Can't sign in with Facebook.  It doesn't go beyond sign in screen. It always stays on sign in screen even though I'm already signed in,
"This is the dumbest app. It only features videos, and then everything else has to be opened on the browser. And then you have to log in again on the browser. Waste of time.",
The app doesn't go beyond signing in and then staying in the screen itself. Please look into this.,
"It says I am logged in, but I can't move past the login screen",
"Awesome app, would be great if screen  mirroring could be added (will enable us to see lectures on TVs).",
"I like school but then I get tired of it then when it's summer time I be like ""I miss school"" then I download this app to make a fake essayd",
"This is the single must functional, useful advance in the Coursera platform over the past three years. Being able to use my commute time to study pre-downloaded lectures is AMAZING.",
I can study from different weeks in the desktop site but in this app I have to complete an assessment before going to the next week. Without it the next week course is not opening. FIX THIS,
The app is awesome plus the feature to use the chromecast dongle to cast over the TV and the subtitles on the TV is working nicely. Thanks for hearing my needs and for everyone else.,
It's very helpful to be able to download all the videos for offline viewing. I usually use it to watch my MOOCs while I'm stuck in traffic,
I cannot move the downloaded lectures from the mobile to the PC (as they are not included in mobile files)!,
This program gives me the option needed to continue my studies on my own time and convenience.,
"Ever since I started using this app, everything became easy. I can learn anywhere anytime and never waste time. Keep up the good work. You help a lot of people who really need it. Thank you so much.",
Can't sign in with Facebook. It gets stuck at login page. Can't add to calendar.,
"Great project, great app. It just needs a setting to change video speed like the web version.",
Other things are OK,
"I will keep recommending this app to my friends and friends, it's learning on the go.",
This app is awsom..it has give a chance to use my free time useful..,
Thanks to the team and appreciate all the hard work put to get the world class lectures to train under a single platform. I wish to be a part of the coursera team one day !!!!!!,
Add deadlines to calendar doesn't work. Everything else is good.,
Now I can really learn anything anytime anywhere!,
"One  tip,  please allow YouTube kind of feature for all content",
I am logged in but it wont let me go anywhere else,
Great to have such a learning platform for new  skills and courses .,
Excellent app interface and more courses available to improve our skills and knowledge.,
No where near the online content..,
"We can learn everything in here, easy to use.",
"I was helped a lot by coursera, and this app is a flattering way of learning with coursera.",
Otherwise loved it thumbs up and hats off,
"I like the Web interface, but the app is a bit cleaner.",
Ability to navigate to course page directly from the specialization page without having to purchase the specialization,
Stuck @ login page,
A wonderful piece of ingenuity for mass education.,
Love to study in Coursera!,
Love it,
After going full screen on a video course there are no buttons to go back.,
"I'm trying to add the course deadlines to my calendar, but the feature is not working.",
Submitting photo is not working.,
Mind challenging!,
Wonderful ammount of knowledge,
Great application.,
Free education. What's not to like?,
Love love love love it,
Very useful,
Great app,
Very useful,

"The app doesn't direct you directly to the discussion threads. When there is an issue with the course or when we cannot complete the assignment due to the website issues, the coursera Helpdesk usually take a few hours before they understood our problems.  Not efficient and courses are refreshed without sufficient notice.",
"Many lectures available, very easy to use. When watching videos offline, it's too bad that it's not marked as read. When watching videos offline, be sure to turn your phone data off if there is no or poor network, otherwise the app would crash or freez.",
The application suddenly stops functioning after certain interval of time. Please fix it A.S.A.P,
"Awesome app with all the features such as lecture downloads and such. Of course a few bugs here and there, but nothing crippling.  (Thumbs Up)",
"Apt for online courses. Hassle free. However, more features like view purchases etc. Could have been added",
I have always enjoyed the accessibility of your app but most recently I have been experiencing some issues with actual getting past the login screen. I've already uninstalled/reinstalled the app. Any suggestions?,
"This is a fantastic application.  I can now study in the train, on the bus. A massive range of courses covering just about everything. I love it",
"After login,  i am unable to open the app un my redmi note 3",
The app is not allowing me to login even after I input correct credentials and reset my password. Still no success,
Doesn't have ability to change playback speed and doesn't remember last point in video. Otherwise would be 5 stars,
The course is very simple to understand . Very clear and easily understood. I like it. It expand my knowhow. Thanks a lot.,
"Hi ! I just want to pay for the second course ( R programming ) however whenever I press on the link to pay for single course , it asks me to pay for the first course of specialization. I want just the second one .",
Not have any free course it is bad minimum 10000 above will be it is used for rich people,
Gives all the courseware one needs on to android. No need to power up the PC!,
Bravo! Awesome! Thank you developers and thank you for content.,
Very useful application. Help a lot with understanding programming in my case.,
"When I log in with Facebook, the only option appears to be log out.  How do I get to content?",
You can find online the same material for free,
Tired of daily updates.,
"Amazing, useful, fruitful educational tools",
"I wanted to read a course, but i don't see the read or anything button, all i could see is ""Buy"" button at the bottom of my screen. What's the matter?",
This is great school in online... u can try it,
Great way to learn a subject,
Really loved it,
It is best app for online courses,
In my lenovo k3 note it's not opening for v6.,
A filter must be added for free and paid courses,
Thank,
Doesn't work on ZenPad S8 :(,
Wish list is missing.. where can I find it,
It's wonderful.,
Great way to expand yourself,
Thing. Ever.,
User friendly app,
Marvellous...,
All course should be free,
English MOOC,
Could not sign in,
Most efficient,
The best,
Great for polymaths,
Good,
Thank you.,
Oportunity to everyone,
Am g,
The new version is better designed and saved videos don't hang.,
"The idea is grate. The functionality is OK. When used on smartphone, forces to use the internet from mobile provider. When I change the settings to WiFi connection when in range it just blocked all lectures. After changing back it didn't work, so I had to reinstall it. Too bad.. All that does not encourages to use the app.",
"Wanted to do my coursework on my Kindle Fire tablet, but this app doesn't support DIRECTLY from Amazon. Coursera staff were kind enough to direct me to a YouTube video that shows how to get around this. It seems kind of silly to have to dance around like this to do something routine, but I am happy now!",
"The app has very nice features, and it would be an easy game to get 5 stars, but there are simply too many frustrating offline bugs which sometimes make it a pain to use.. as there were, when offline 1) it will refuse to enter previously downloaded video sections. 2) The app randomly logs out and requires to reenter the credentials with internet connection 3) Even when wifi is available, refuses to enter courses because it still thinks it's offline 4) Download queue disappears 5) Login requires many retries",
"The app is amazing, everything is working fine but I am giving it 3 stars only because I cannot find a way to delete the offline content for courses that I have un-enrolled from another device or the website. You should add a place where I can easily manage all the offline content.",
"Since they're offering a complete online college experience and expect to be paid for doing so, they make it difficult/impossible to access course material for free. They should just become a for profit organization. Then I would have known not to waste my time. False advertising.",
Sketchy app that keeps opening itself for no reason. Coursera ruined their site anyways making this useless.,
Voice of the lecturer is too much low. It can't be heard properly. It is inconvenience to study when I'm in the mobile activities.Please fix. Thanks.,
When without reception I find the app freezes for a while before I can play offline content.,
Offline courses are not showing up. The app response is so slow. Never get my courses list rendered.,
It is a great way to improve knowledge in our own are or learn New things from other areas.,
"I came here from TED talk of Daphne Koller, and tried it. It's similar to khan academy, but more organised and has more courses..",
"You should make the user able to open every course from each specialization individualy when I click on it from the specialization's page, you should do the same on the website.",
I think you should add the feature to download course materials such as slides and Programming Assignements.,
I came across this app and stopped searching for any other apps because it is so easy to use. Kudos to Courseera team for offering this great environment for learning.,
"I actually have a feature request.. There are some places where I can't play videos from my course, so, if there is a way of viewing page slides from the app offline, it would be pure awesome!",
I like save to offline mode feature the most as it allow you to save using wifi and then watch in free time.,
It often hangs and it's heavy on memory resources,
This new update sucks. I'm unable to play any videos even after downloading. Please fix.,
"Amazing opportunity to take courses for free, that most cannot afford. Courses from the best universities in the world. Never feel intimidated, as the professors make you feel comfortable.",
Would like to be able go between devices. Courses bought on mobile cannot be continued on a laptop.,
The videos are saved but they don't show up in the app.,
"I haven't actually used it yet, but I'm glad I have the option of using it",
"Videos can be a little glitch sometimes, but otherwise it's great",
The best educational  app i have found in the play store. Easy to learn and access videos.,
"Adding dates to calendar deletes icons from screen and all programs. Details:  I missed some assignments in digital video processing so I was prompted to join next session - I accepted it. Then it prompted me to add new schedule to calendar and I accepted it. Then I closed coursera. That's it. When I went to main screen I saw some 8-10 icons were missing from several screens (like edX, Paytm, etc.). I went to all programs and there also icons were deleted. In Apps - some entries were deleted.",
An excellent platform for MOOCs and a great way to study online courses. Thanks Coursera!,
App is very slow it takes 2-3 sec for click event,
I wish I could get fashion related courses...,
Need to improve a lot. Seeing already completed courses is a miss.,
"I like the offline feature , amazing sec to learn something new",
Thank you all for all the hard work you did to bring knowledge to everyone on the earth appreciate that,
This is the best learning app I hv ever come across,
I 've learned a lot,
Thanks for providing medium to learn free,
It's getting better every update,
Excellent knowledge and experience gained with each course,
Great tool for learning.,
Grt app...,
Awesome!,
One of the best,
Great opportunity  for self learning,
Wide platform to learn anything,
Free education? 5 stars.,
Doesn't show anything,
Heard a lot,
Too good,
Easy of use,
Excellent App,
Loved it,
Excellent,
Awesome,
all courses r paid,
Fantabules!,
thanks for the knowkedge,
Has bugs,
Revolutionizing education,
Swety,
"Got the update request for this app but keeps giving me the following error when trying to update, wondering if anyone else is getting the same error: Coursera can't be installed. Try again, and if the problem continues, get help troubleshooting. (Error code: -505). Update: was contacted by Coursera and application is working perfect now!",
"The app was working very well until this update. As I tried to update the application, it showed error 505. I uninstalled Coursera and tried to re install it again. But to no avail. This time, I cant install it at all.  UPDATE: Error is resolved and I was able install it.  Now, the app seems to working as it should but there is no ICON visible. I have to go to settings-&gt;apps / play store to launch Coursera.",
"I really like this app. It is a great way to view course material. However, there is a bug that caused me to have to go back to my PC. When in the middle of a lecture a quiz pops up, there are no options visible for me to select. I could see the images and the question at the top of the screen, but there was no place for me to enter in my answer. I have a Nexus 6.",
"1) add possibility to play video lectures 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0 times faster; 2) add page where one can access all downloaded videos and delete sime or all of them if necessary (see edx app). 3) add possibility to somehow archive courses without unenrolling. Best wishes anyway the app is becoming more and more useful.",
"Most course videos are great on the mobile phone so the app is a good option for watching lessons. I have an issue with removing downloaded videos as the remove all option doesn't work reliably. I don't know if the content is still stored & can't figure out where to verify. When I am on the go with an unreliable data connection, I can access my downloaded content by switching to airplane mode (quick way to turn off network connections). It makes the app perform better and not get hung for connection.",
"There are no dates on anything. I've studied for two weeks, then realised I have no idea when the course started, when it ends or when I'm supposed to do things. I only just realised because most of the forum comments are months old. What a mess.",
Though it would help a lot if all features work and we do not need to go to web.,
Works seemlessly over various gadgets; I listen to my lesson while driving to from work if I need to revisit any topic.,
"Devs, what have you done? :( The joy of taking a quiz and knowing the results should not be associated with payment. Only certificate should be based on payment. I've done 5 courses by acquiring close to 100 % grades but you've killed the joy now. :( Please restore unpaid quiz results.",
"Slow, take quite long time to load the courses.  Also for the courses I preview in the desktop does not show, and I even could not find it in the search, try ""Natural Language Processing"" provided by Stanford.",
I swear it told me to pay $355 or something. You could've told me that I had to pay or at least have in app purchases...,
I had learn in this site since 3 years ago. I had got so many information from this site.,
It does what it is supposed to do in a great way. I find it much easier to go through the courses using the app. The offline feature helps me a lot.,
"Worked fine until last update, wouldn't update, tried to reinstall but errors out. Please fix",
ML class for Andrew NG week 1 has been dissappeared after I updated coursera !!,
"Before this update, i was able to see my courses and even watch my ""save for offline"" videos when i am connected to the internet ... now i cannot even see my courses or anything except the tabs labels when internet is not there ... please fix fast",
This bloody thing crashed. It just crashed and left loads of junk on my phone.,
Good app but cannot be installed on SD card. Pity,
"Add the possibility to cast subtitles to the chromecast, not only the video",
"I actively use Cousera over my PC. That's why I was excited to see the mobile app. But it isn't logging in,  no matter how many times I try. My phone Meizu M2 Note.",
App crash was fixed. Bravo to the developers !,
"Love the content, the app can be buggy.",
I really enjoy this app.  It's truly the gateway to information on courses and the institutions that offer them.,
"Content is good,  but videos are not opening.  Please work on performance.",
It's not free .. I don't understand.. Please help me to understand this app.. I'm interested..,
Works fine on PC and on my phone. Really helpfull. I like it.,
This is a great application and an outstanding learning platform.,
An amazing educational tool,
It is very helpful in learning. I love coursera.,
Tough courses easy courses ..all are there thank-you,
thanks,
I cant access offline translation,
Best App educational learning app,
I can't review videos from past weeks,
Offline connectivity doesn't work,
"If I could, I would give -1,000,000 stars!, I have yo pay for EVERYTHING",
"Stupid yo like, yeah",
Most of the videos either do not play or are mute.,
Fruitful app!!,
Awesome!,
It helps me,
I love this app,
Very good,
Very helpful,
Love this,
"Coursera is free and without ads by itself but for all the courses offered there you must pay for certificate, and some of them you can't even attend without paying.",
One can take a test but not verify. No verification renders the test invalid. Same for assignment. This happened with me and lead to loss of my time and effort! And there is no remedy for this except register for new session and lose more time!,
Really helpful. Learned a lot using this App. Offline mode is very useful. I will be happy if Coursera add C programming language course.,
"It's very annoying, some pages are forced portrait, and the font size is too small. It would be great, if there were option to adjust font size. In addition some parts are only accessible by the web site.",
I love learning and have so little time to do it.  Using the Coursera app allows me to brighten up my brain anywhere! The professors are outstanding and very challenging. Thank you for the work you do.,
I'm looking for more enhancements. Good work team!,
"Variety of courses available that a plus point, but it has now become chargeable.",
EVERY COURSE SAYS COMING SOON!!!!!!! Nothing is available,
"I'm not being able to take the tests. Every time I try for tests, a message stating, ""This quiz is currently only supported in web"" pops up.",
Once video saved.. Its difficult to open  without wifi or net pack.. Otherwise its easy way learning,
When I start downloading all video. It starts simultaneously due which sometime when we leave home none of the video is completed. So please provide an option in the app to download one by one,
I am having problems with quizzes on the app when they contain pictures. It doesn't load the multiple choice answers and the submit button after the picture.,
"I have just one request: add an option where by a course video watch gets saved automatically after watching. THAT IS, YOU CAN WATCH A VIDEO WHILE IT IS DOWNLOADING, OR SIMPLY, ANY VIDEO WATCHED, REMAINS FOR VIEWING OFFLINE.",
Beautiful and easy to acess anytime of the day. I don't have to log in into my computer to access.,
"There was once a scathing review here. Now let this stand as a testament to the success of the developers. Good work. This is great once more. Compatible across the devices I've tried, from tablets to phones.",
"crashes constantly! also just recently, it does not load my course.",
"For all the courses I'm currently doing, I've saved the videos saved offline. But when I'm actually offline the subtitles don't work, when I come online the subtitles work. Sometimes the subtitles don't work at all. I do not know why this is happening.",
"a potentially very useful functionality is limited by the fact that videos often download as 0kb, and cannot play.  the app appears to go through the whole download process, but at the end, the file is 0kb. you then need to delete and retry, until it finally downloads correctly.",
Better than edx. And each update makes it even better. Unlike most apps where update ruins all the fun.,
It has pretty much everything you want.,
I love being able to access my lectures anywhere I go.,
Great full for free courses from Stanford in nutrition thanks,
Why am I not able to take peer review assignments on this app....please add this feature....I dont have PC...I completely depend on this app....I need the provision to take all type of assignments on this app,
"Update can't be installed, error code 505",
It says coursera can't be installed error 505,
Thank you coursera,
Can't update even tried many times,
Why it is asking for submitting photo and identity again and again after each update ?,
Very helpful app.,
A truly useful app!,
Superb for self paced learning!!,
Very useful,
Good,
Simply love it,
Awsome App,
Great,
"I think this is a good idea, but that is all this is, an idea, so many bugs that its impossible to complete work and even worse if you paid for the courses because nobody responds to emails, just take your money and forget about you, many links not work and crash, this makes it impossible to progress through the course",
Always says Oops something went wrong. Please check your network connection and try again...,
"Downloaded 4 lectures to watch in the subway, after watching the first video - the whole week just disappeared from the app as if it never existed. Had to reinstall the app to see it again.",
It works perfectly. I am able to download my videos and also verify my identity after every test.,
Cannot install the latest update. Even after uninstalling cannot reinstall it. Frustrating! Error code -505 on Lollipop.,
Thanks for listening to your users Coursera!  The app is now totally awesome.  You should mention your video playback speed feature in your summary of the app.  I'm sure lots of people will be great use of this!  Thanks!,
Saved videos have disappear after latest update. Current courses are also not visible.,
"Don't do any assignments on the app, or even the mobile site on your phone. Your identity won't be verified and you will be ineligible for your certificate!",
"First check your email and password, yet I'm sure they are rigyt, Onky in my tenth attempt ir so, the apo recognised it ! There is no speed button, and as for the questions during the class,the video stopsm  the question appears yet the answers are invisible, so can't answer !",
It was very helpful for a course I did.,
You can now increase the speed of the video. Perfect!,
Best learning app I have seen so far!!,
Not able see the link of videos,
WiFi is enough to download videos to listen while commuting,
It is a very good application always enhanced. Love it.,
It's easy to use,
Like the ability to download videos to my phone!,
Nice app. It encourages learni,
I think there must be wishlist to enroll later,
Learning easy online,
It does not work,
Kinetic and static,
This is an awesome app for learning,
Handy and easy to use,
Great,
Course access.,
Good,
Awesome,
Alwys grt,
- App has many screens which force portrait orientation - no excuse for this. - You are constantly bothered by screens telling you to pay for course certificates or sign up for horrendously overpriced 'specializations'. - You can't complete most assignmen,
After completing one of the courses; Coursera accepted my payment and until today after more than three months they have yet to issue me a receipt or a cert. Have written to them but no respond. Very annoyed and disappointed.,
"Very nice app and easy to find courses and videos.  I have one problem though, and it's a bug in my opinion of the app.  You support offline videos, which is AWESOME! BUT, how am I supposed to see them when I am offline if your app does not show me what videos I have available in order to choose them?:) The app just shows a loading animation when offline so the offline videos are just useless really!",
A battery drainer. 7% while app wasn't even opened. And please add a possibility to view videos at a higher speed. Thanks,
Although the app is awesome but the biggest problem is that it consumes a lot of mobile data. Kindly make it usable for low speed internet connection too i.e for 2G/3G also. At this juncture it's too heavy.,
I am unable to set default storage location as SD card in Moto g(3rd gen),
I've realized you guys are working really hard to make the mobile experience as good as desktop. Well done! I'm enjoying the experience.,
"This app is the APP! I've gained so much from this simple app and I've been spreading the word. Thank you for this opportunity. Apart from the challenge of downloading offline, nothing else to complain about.",
I loved Prof Wright's easy going style. He is obviously passionate about music but gets his udeas across as if you were in the same room. Most enjoyable,
Reliable access to resources through the app in my experience. Very useful to watch course content on the go and the ability to download and watch offline. I often also watch lectures on my phone so I can work along with it on my computer. Good stuff.,
There is so much free information now with thought provoking instructors. It's hard to choose between so many!,
Thanks to the developers and tutors in courses who are providing it. Never felt so hungry for knowledge. Thanks guys. Lovvee it üòç,
The app seems to work fine. I am able to download videos and view them either online or offline and have participated in the forums without any problems do far.,
App accepted payment but certificate was not given. Sent feedback but no reply.,
"I love it every thing about it, their service, they're everything rules, it's so awesome! Thanks for developing this app developers! You the best!",
Thank You for helping those of us who cannot afford higher education have access to such a wide array of courses and resources.,
Not able to save video on mobile after latest update,
A great platform to learn online courses at your own convenient time...,
After more than a dozen courses complete there is so much to learn,
Not going to pay for courses that I can get books,
"Lots to learn, Coursera is the platform to do just that!",
I signed up using the login with your Facebook option which I no longer have access to in the app.,
I just loved the way of teaching .,
Subtitles are not working offline for the downloaded videos.,
"Does the job. Download videos, watch on the train.",
I have propleme as the subtitle don't work even if I choose language ?,
The courses are fantastic and app is easy to use.,
You can't log in with Facebook on the mobile app.,
Great app to access course content,
It's really awesome,
Well i have been remonitorized from these courses i just dont feel thats me again i have changed Now my dream of one day being a journalist can be fullfilled,
Good app for good learning purposes.....,
Really thank you.,
- the app doesn't sync up with the progress ?,
I love it!,
I like it,
Great courses and free,
Awesome initiative,
App is storing the offline video in Internal memory of my android phone.  How can it be moved to external device like SD card?,
Takes forever to load,
"I reported a problem with its app yesterday. I got an update today! I am surprised to see the speed with which they have solved this problem. Compare that with Whatsapp, to which I have been reporting a problem since a very long time (1 year), but they have t not solved it. Hats off to Coursera tech team...",
It has improved a lot since last time i saw it. I like that you can watch offline but it would be extremely handy if there was a possibility to play videos in faster speed.,
"Good for downloading course videos, but quizzes just show up blank, or at best you might get a couple answers showing.",
"It's easy to use, has tons of options, but I wish there were courses for Japanese",
Love the whole idea of training anywhere you go or even listening to the classes during traffic.. no more excuses for not cultivate yourself !!,
I've found and plan to enroll in a lot of interesting courses.  No downsides thus far.,
I want the play speed control feature.,
this app works wonderful. to me this app is more convenient than coursera website,
"Much better than the Udacity app! Especially supporting play back speed adjustment. One request, can you add 1.75x to the speed option? The desktop version has it but mobile does not.",
Have done three music courses from theory to composition.,
Kudos for you. I love this app.,
Now it works thanks :) quick turnaround guys!,
Easy. Simple.,
I logged in via facebook account in the previous versions now there are no such options available in mobile version.,
Classroom Awesomeness,
Too good,
Useful,
Guys this is good. I am doing my second course with them but super costly. People are paying money because of the university names which looks attractive for first 2 certifications. After that I think people will move to Udemy if these guys dont come up with some loyalty program.,
"The Android app is lacking some features that the iOS version has.  First of all, it doesn't allow to change the playback speed.  Secondly (and most importantly) the Android app doesn't allow me to watch previously saved videos if I have no Internet connection at the moment. It even crashes. It is like it has to load the course information (which is just plain text), but as it doesn't have a connection at that moment, the course never loads and I can't see the videos.",
"One month ago, this would have been a 5/5, no question.  You've done something now though, where downloaded videos are a mess.  Downloading says it's all done, bit can't watch offline, can't remove from device, and coursera spontaneously crashes when attempting to view.  Sort it out!",
"The app is great and it would get 5 stars if it was possible to speed up (or slow down) the videos, like on the computer.",
"Every time I try to load my class in the app, it says something went wrong and I should check my connection. This makes the app completely useless for me.",
"I encounter a problem in Coursera's offline mode. I use wifi network to save videos to watch them offline. But when I turn wifi and mobile data off, the videos won't load any my Sony Xperia C4 dual says Coursera is not responding. The screen keeps black and I had to close Coursera.",
App is buggy and difficult to navigate. Videos downloaded for offline viewing cannot be played offline. For me this is a fatal flaw so I won't be signing up to another course in a hurry.,
I wish it didn't crash so frequently. also the downloaded videos play only the first time. I can't rewatch it again. otherwise a nice app with useful learning contents.,
"Worse and worse with every release. Offline mode does not work anymore, error messages are uninformative and annoying (""something went wrong"").   A missed opportunity, and a total waste of time.",
Best part you can earn yourself a certificate of authenticity of Completeness of a said course.,
"Same problem as some other posters: I can't access the Machine Learning course at all via the app.  Whenever I click on it, I get ""Something went wrong.  Please check your network connection and try again.""  Same result no matter whether I'm on wifi or data.",
Easy to improve on oneself and acquire more certificate courses without necessarily needing to travel to different universities around the world.,
Can't get the Stanford machine learning course to load though!,
But downloaded videos are not working properly,
Eagerly waiting for Mobile App-based Verification for submissions of assignments. Otherwise awesome app!,
Doesn't change with tablet orientation,
Thank you Coursera,
"This is vry beneficial for students.., I loved it.:-)",
Desde la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n los videos no se reproducen si estoy fuera de l√≠nea,
"Aplicativo bom,  mas ainda apresenta algumas falhas,  tanto de usabilidade quanto de performance.",
Perfect!,
Download it great app ever,
Ok,
Very useful,
Great,
"App crashes are become more and more frequent with the last few updates. The video simply freezes when the device is inactive for a few seconds more than screen lock time and then hangs. Quite annoying that I'm restarting my phone a few times in an hour. Additionally, there isn't an option to change video display speed.  The structure to each course (in terms of course documentation, lecture slides etc) needs to be more uniform.",
"Download for off-line still doesn't work for me. Progress moves for some time but then just disappears and nothing changed. 32 Gb SD card, 4 Gb free. So I have to use regular media player and download/copy manually",
Some of these teachers move too fast through the course and I have to go back to hear the thing all over again. For intro to mathematical thinking the 1st problem set I did almost made me feel like I had not even done lectures one and two. And this makes me want to get my own personal teacher that teaches for the sake of knowledge and not money &gt;.&lt;,
Coursera sold out to their VC pimp daddies and won't even let you take a quiz for free. Coursera is now a crappy youtube for over simplified feel-good courses. GG see you at edX.,
The pop quiz during a lecture keeps appearing multiple times despite that I already finished it. The multiple choices quiz doesn't load all of the choice text. It shows blank text in several choices.  Edit: I don't have a trouble of blank text in pop quiz anymore. Although it still shows up multiple time.,
I can access the course videos but when it comes to weekly quizzes or assignments I have problem. On some quizzes parts of the questions are missing so the question is incomplete. On submitting assignments some buttons do not work. So the app is only good for watching videos.,
"Not able to see any videos, course content after the update. While I can by Brower. Please resolve this issue.",
"Before it wasn't that good. But now it is awesome. You can do almost everything of coursework, from watching videos (both online and offline) to discussion in the forum to completing the assignments. You will require PC only to do programming. Otherwise complete package for coursework. Fantastic.",
"I love coursera, one of my favorite things is being able to crank up the professors lecture speed. The mobile app needs that.",
I recently updated my coursera app and it logged out my account. I tried to log in but it keeps crashing. I also reinstalled it but it's crashing. Please fix it immediately. Thank you!,
"It always says ""oops something went wrong. Try to check your network connection""... Help me through this",
Great app with minor issue: it doesn't support landscape screen orientation properly.,
"Much better now that they have Chromecast support, still a little buggy but much better. I love using Coursera to further my education. Knowledge is power people, learn something!",
Threads and discussions are the best way to reach out to fellow course mates. I am sure you will take notice of its importance in MOOCs.,
I'm very impressed with the quality of education available for free. To access for free click 'enrol' on an individual course (not a specialisation) and then choose the no certificate option.,
"Whether I try to watch online or download the videos first, if I attempt to watch the video I get an error message saying 'Something went wrong. Check your network connection and try again'. I can hear the sound of the video. This is even with downloaded videos.",
I couldn't control the speed of the video via the app. Pls add in such feature,
e.g. SD card... or at least give the video files coherent names.,
Best self-learning mobile tool with a fantastic collection of MOOCs for all fields.,
"Not very many free courses anymore,  if you're willing to drop $400 for a class have at it, but this is definitely not for lower income people like myself...",
Great app. Only thing it needs is a remember  specialization  kind of thing.,
"Courses in all fields and mostly for free, recommend it for every one.",
Pop-up management needs better design.,
Also truth for enhancement of social skills and free-time curiosity app,
Perfect place to get quality education from the world's most renowned universities!!,
i love this app. i use it almost every day. good job guys,
Lovely opportunity to find out some new stuff even when you travel.,
"I have learned alot and its free, mostly",
"This app does not update on courses enrolled. No use, no sweat.",
I like the way on the web the placback can be set to a desired speed appreciated if that feature is possible in the app also,
Mentions nowhere that the courses are not free,
So many good courses,
Gives one access to college courses in many fields.,
I strongly recommend this app.,
Won't reset the password nor let me sign in with other accounts!,
"At first it was buggy,  but now the app rocks",
Very productive and valuable app,
Keepe crashing and getting stuck.,
It really enhances knowledge,
"No more free learning, bye bye coursera",
Easily learning what I want and for free.,
great work,
Free learning convenient and good,
One of the best app in the field of education.,
i hope there will be Deutsch course.,
Really helpful for entrepreneurship.,
Great Profesor in my room,
Unable to update,
Practical app,
Awesome application,
Excellent,
Excellent,
Great,
Amazing,

Immediately crashes on start on my Nexus 7 tablet. Doesn't work at all.,
"I love the new UI, runs just fine, convenient and easy to use!",
I can't adjust the video playing speed,
Crashes on asus memo pad 10.,
Crashes immediately on my Tab S2,
Very useful learning app,
Amazing source of knowledge,
Exactly what I needed,
Useful,
"Videos play fine, transcripts available, useful course information. Orientation behavior broken. Hoping for some features: Video speed control. Offline supplemental content. Feedback separation (not all one big blob). Orientation fix/control for docks/tablets (in the meantime Rotation Control by CrapeMyrtle forces Coursera to orient properly).",
"A Transcript option in the app itself is what was missing for me; since I prefer to read, rather than listen to the lectures.  The value of the content/education is why I rated this so high, despite that small flaw. I made use of the PC version VIA Internet browser in order to utilize this transcript function & completed my course. These certifications are far from simple, the testing is also done well and demands that you retain the knowledge, before passing each course.",
"Some of the content I accessed via this app was terrific, but those were written by their prospective publishers, and not by the developers of this app, so it's crazy when I see reviews of this app based on the value one  received from a certain course they accessed through this app. This app has very dangerous and unusual access and ROOT level permissions, why must you upload my personal data, passwords and contacts, and texts to your servers?",
"I'm an engineering student from Civil branch from India. I need some Course related to Civil engineering from this app .                                   few courses are still available, but they are from architectural side but most of it are present in different languages other then English.     I request please insert some building construction & transportation course in it.",
"Slow. Seems like accessing the website directly would be faster. Always wants to be in portrait mode, constantly switches back to this mode when exiting videos. Download videos for offline use appears to be buggy. About half the time a downloaded video results in an error message. Don't try to use the ""download all"" feature, it literally tries to download them all at the same time and accomplishes nothing. But if you really want to watch videos offline I'd suggest downloading them from the website and copying them to your device.",
"Being working better and better there for the videos and exercises reproduction. However, the forum alerts are useless. You tap on an alert and the app sends you to the  main specialization site, no way to find where the forum alert is.",
"Clearly still in beta. App doesn't do anything I actually wanted it to do, things broken etc.",
"Still the problem is ,it can't save videos to SD card. It continuously says try downloading again",
Audio is not good enuf. It's comparatively throws feeble voice than the audio player in the mobile.,
"I can't dismiss notifications. Once I've downloaded a course video and I get 'Your downloads are ready' as a notification, I should be able to dismiss it. That's my only gripe. The app is good, minimal features, works well.",
Really useful for students of developing countries which doesn't have great universities like US. Now people in developing countries can get education from great universities at an affordable price. The developers of coursera should be given a Nobel prize.,
Overall i am really impressed by this app but it would be better if you include the course wiki as well. Also sometimes there are glitches when you try to take a quiz and some answers don't show up and whole questions are obscured.,
Uninstalled. Said it may not be optimised for my device (Nexus 9 tablet).  The previous app let me view videos etc.  This one was not even able to list my current course.,
User friendly. Ease of use. Download data to SD card is supported. Courses are good and free without certificate. Everything in one little app.,
Courses are too pricey and there's no filter to search by price. Having to tap on Buy is very discouraging.,
Subtitles of almost classes are wrong (unmatch) and fail to fetch.,
I love it honestly. Just needs updating for some courses where they aren't on-demand or they are out of date. This is one of the best and most revolutionary things I have seen in education thanks.,
"I have to be online for the videos to start playing, then I can go offline. It would be nice if the app could be used completely offline (maybe except for scored quizzes).",
Can't praise Coursera enough. Great app backed by one of the most important ideas of recent years.,
"Courses are no longer free and you can only audit them, which means you can only watch videos and cannot even test your understanding in quizes etc. Greedy moron Coursera",
"Easy to use, Love the fact that you can store the videos for offline viewing. Clear & concise üôåüòä",
"For tablets with data access you should make the discussion questions available through the app as well. When you're on the go and want to answer it's easy just to do it from your tablet or phone app. Just a suggestion  Also, app should have a landscape mode when the tablet is hooked up to a keyboard dock or Bluetooth keyboard.",
It assumes that you can always connect to the internet. Performance of the platform has dropped drastically.                                               Performed the latest update on 2/18/2016 makes it even worse.....,
"Offline mode is great, but I can't 'delete all' video lectures after I finish watching them. From Asus zenfone2.",
I couldn't log in using my email or my Facebook account!,
"Unfortunately, Coursera has stopped..",
Found a way of putting the course materials onto the sd card on an HTC desire and love it you can download the material and select options use sd card....:-),
"In the old version I was able to preload the videos, so I could watch them offline as well. Unfortunately this feature is no longer available, but it was very useful as I travel a lot. Thanks",
Love it. Didn't give 5 rating because there is more room for improvement.,
Tons of notifications that take you to the discussion top level page. Absolutely no value in this app.,
Unable to open the assignment page please help,
Great courses. Have finished four so far and looking forward to do more.,
Pathetic app and more pathetic customer service,
Very good app... But I'm using it for the first time... I feel this app far better than the others... But the only drawback is a few courses are unavailable.,
"Awesome app!! However, I can no longer take quizzes [Machine Learning] stopped working after week one.",
Very interactive app and easy to use. Makes it much easy to keep track with classes,
Great but some key features are missing on Android and not everything is available in offline mode.,
Learning Chinese has been simplified soo perfectly. I love it,
One of the best MOOC. Thanks for valuable courses from reputed universities,
"At this point, I call BS. Why do I have to deal with ios when I am an Android user?  Where is the Android Quiz instead of the set me up for failure ios quiz?",
Offering free courses is no joke. This is a pure example of technology used in the right way!,
Can't find anything worth the time,
A wonderful platform for improvising selfskills...,
The download progress is not shown sometimes and we have to refresh the page again nd again to see download progress.,
App crashes whenever video download is pressed.,
Cannot install app on my S7 edge,
Easy to use and very beneficial,
Loved the app and the concept of availing education on mobile.,
Study made easy. Navigation more interesting,
This app is a very useful learning tool.,
"Excellent , boon for world",
The quizzes won't load. What's the point of learning if I can't comfort I'm doing it right? Please fix,
No need for a computer. I really love it,
Keep up the good work.,
Great online studies and a great resource,
Excellent form of studying,
High quality education for the 99%,
Any chance to add an option to cast to Amazon Fire TV? It'd be awesome. :),
"We should be able to share courses. I mean, over WhatsApp, etc...",
Easy to use.,
Great app!,
Sheer brilliance!,
Easy to learn.,

Just perfect,
Excellent Initiative,
Great app,
Good,
Excellent,
Excellent,
Excellent,
This apps help me alot to learn something new out of my major as i want.  But maybe the payment process for certificate can be more easy like we buy stuff from game apps or line maybe..  Just a suggestion.  Because honestly its hard for me to pay it via PayPal,
"I really love the app , it lets me learn new skills on the go. The only problem I have faced so far is the lack of flexibility for all courses to store the downloaded videos in external storage. You can manually copy it there, but Coursera does not recognize those videos. The interface of Coursera app does play a role in giving you a feel for the course than some video player. But , else its amazing :') as they have all the courses supported by phone.",
"The app isn't so bad, there are just a few glitches & lags now and then, and a few assignments ""say"" they can't be done on mobile phone.  This being said, I see the bugs being corrected and the app being improved very regularly and it makes me tremendously happy. Thanks to the developers, keep up the good work guys !!",
"I mistakenly bought a specialization, then realized you can do everything free. They won't give return after 2 weeks despite not using any classes. Their customer support stonewalls me. They are NOT customer first org. Goof free stuff, DON'T waste your $$$",
"Chromecast support is a big plus. I'll give them that. But the quality of presentation is terrible, the quiz display is so bad that they are illegible. I have to skip quizzes. Most of the coursera resources are unavailable. This app is trash.",
"Its one of the best things i have ever come across. Just a little technical problems, when they are solved its good to go. The videos don't continue where you left them when watching online. Suddenly the app runs into problems and have to exit midway. Watching the whole lecture again, cause if you try playing it from somewhere in the middle it keeps loading and replaying the same few seconds. Also it hangs a lot!! Sometimes when I am in the mood to listen to a lecture it won't just work right.",
The app is very slow and lags all the time while taking practise tests. Please look into this issue.,
"There are some small problems though. For example, when I receive a notification that some user commented on a topic in the discussions and I click on that notification - the app does not lead me to the actual discussion but leaves me on root level...",
It was fine until I started noticing some classes I wanted to take cost money. Guess I'll go to udemy app instead,
"I really love the app, helping me find my education easy! But please how do I access the videos without using the app",
"Constantly getting oops no internet after wifi drop, even when my connection is restored.",
It's a great app. I love it works offline ajd online. Can save videos and watche them later.,
If you enjoy being repeatedly told you've no Internet when in fact it's a super buggy app then look no further!,
"This is an inconvenience and must be worked on, otherwise good app",
It's nice but I am not able to download videos using mobile data,
the only thing missing now is the ability to play videos at variable speed,
"Coursera is unbelievable.  You can take free online classes from some of the best universities in the country. I've taken several so far, and the classes are excellent. What an opportunity!",
"The best of the best of online leaning this app is awesome,special and unique.I love this!",
"Freezes on Xiaomi note 3 pro, but in general, OK",
Not even in high school or middle school and easy and educational,
A 2.x and 1.5x speed should be available for the video player,
Great way to stimulate the mind to new ideas and new perspectives.,
Works perfectly and the best education app ever,
The whole thing of coursera deserves 5 star,
This is so kind of Coursera. Thank you.,
All lies. No free courses,
Why do you need to access my contacts and much more other stuff on my device!?,
Do add an option to change video quality like in the desktop version for slow internet connections,
It is really useful i like the out line point,
Coursera is amazing!,
Everyone should try it,
The best companion for bus rides,
"Course have to be searched, or you'll see only the paid ones.",
Excelente oportunidad para ampliar el conocimiento en infinidad de areas profesionales y para comenzar una nueva carrera,
I find this app useful and interactive.,
I can't open the videos,
offline videos are not playing or show as downloaded although they have been,
Pay to enroll for any course,
"The ""cast to"" option is not working",

Luv to learn by it,
It is fast and reliable,
Improved and better UI,
great way of learning,
much better,
Excellent,
superb,
Wonderful,
Good,
Awesome,
Worth app,
The app is helpful since it has several courses in which one can join whatever course he/she likes.,
It's a great app. It would be even better if you could download videos for future viewing. High bandwidth connections are not always available...,
Best MOOC app out there. Ever improving. Great casting options. Very high quality courses. Couldn't do without it.,
"Kudos to the dev team. Before last update made it stop working on my old tablet, and few days later another update and now it works again.",
"You should look at edX mobile app. It very fast and easy in downloading videos. Also, I can't download many videos in this app!!!",
"For a busy at home mom of 3, things app is amazing! I can still work away at my education and learn, whilst I'm busy at home with the kiddies! Excellent for keeping the mind working and continued learning! It doesn't matter who you are, there's a subject you can benefit & learn from! And get thIs,,, it's free!!!! Thank you!",
I passionately recommend this course to everyone interested in sustaining education throughout their lives! Of any age. Any background. This course offered by Coursera is ACE!!!,
"It keeps crashing on me,  can't even do a course survey on it, let alone stream a lecture 18/01/16 review update: this app is working properly again, thank you DevüòÉ",
"Great app overall, but I need to be able to change the playback speed!",
Amazing tool who have a spark to learn,
enjoying courses on android looks great. nice ui,
"Great app, great project !",
Great one.,
Brilliant,
"But it would be were worth six stars if we could access the quizzes that are in video and submit work.  The idea of using a mobile app is to be able to access this sort of content when a computer is unavailable.  Please fix this and I will surely give it five stars, I really think the content offered is worth it.",
Although I use coursera o. My computer most of the time I like that I can keep track of my progress on my phone. It's also nice that if I'm in a pinch I can get work done on here. Great as a secondary platform.,
I have followed a couple of courses. A great way to learn with good examples. Very user friendly. I hope the app is as gud as the website,
Saved videos stopped playing. When I try to pause and play there is unsynchronized audio and video output.,
"Upgrading from 4 to 5 stars now that playback speed has been added. Forum access has also been made available, basically making this a perfect app.",
"Good site, but the app is not that good. All those software classes and this app is all over the place, and buggy",
Coursera has just set me up with a virtual classroom and learning at my own pace is just more fun than I ever imagined. Thumps up Coursera Team,
After the last update it was just like :hey I won't get on no matter what u do!!  Seriously guys an update shoud enhance the app not turn it off with all my offline courses in!!,
If there was some way to watch the lecture without the quiz. You must get to your phone/tablet in order to keep watching.  This is annoying!!!,
This app has helped me so much w academics.,
"Done 2 courses,  3rd on the way.  Good delivery and ever improvingl content.  :)",
Thanks team. This have been helpful overtime.,
Very complete and good usability. The are very good courses.,
So far so good! Usable with nice features and friendly interface,
"Totally locks my phone,  unusable",
Be yourself and make best of yourself. I'm proud of coursera,
"I love Coursera, the classes, and app. It has gotten me back on the path of learning.",
Using this app for quite some time now. Wonderful app.,
Cannot open app. Keeps crashing.,
Love learning via this appüòçüòò,
Thank you for a very useful course in the app.,
Whole world can learn from world class teachers.incredible service to the mankind.,
DO NOT INSTALL... UNLESS YOU ARE RICH OR PRETTY STUPID!!!,
Education made easy.. Mobile classes on the go.,
Good courses are free and in my pocket.,
Great learning classes/ tool,
Another study point in busy life... It's good...,
Killed my galaxy edge,
Great content available!,
Vvvvvvv gooooooooooodddddddddd,
Great app for convenient learning,
Better,
Good app and cources,
Great website,
I Just love it,
Loved it....,
Loved it,
Cursera,
No option to cancel downloads in progress. No straightforward way to see which videos have been downloaded (so the user can remove them to free up device storage). The user needs to go into each week of each course to see if videos have been downloaded. It'll be great if there were a way to share courses by email or messaging apps.,
"Great offering, broken downloads. The only reason I used to find the app useful was to catch up with courses while offline (train, plane, abroad), but that function isn't working anymore. I wish I could be more concrete, but all I see are spinning circles. No timeouts, no errors, just frustrating nothingness.",
"Very useful for coursera students, efficient and stable. Minor issues to improve - lecture stops after screen rotation, forums notification direct to wrong place (whole course forum instead of topic). I'd suggest also change in answering on forum - there is no vision of the post we are answering to, which might be very useful (for quotation for example). Generally: B+ :)",
Fails to even start. White screen folllwed by a black screena and error that app crashed. Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Android 4.3,
The app ha many of the website features. Still space to improve but I know you guys are working hard on this. Thanks,
"Really good app, basically stable and highly useful. I'd appreciate having the in-lecture quiz questions as they are on the website, but it's a minor point. The app itself is useful and the ability to Chromecast a big plus for me.",
"Coursera on mobile is very useful. Having an application to go through the study materials is very much essential. Runs without any bugs, which is very important.",
"For some reason the photo verification is not working, everytime it says 'error in connection'. Please fix this :)",
"Every few mins, app crashes...I'm unable to watch the videos at peace.. Also enable setting to download to SD card instead of only phone memory.",
It's easier to access and you learn alot for free. This is a win,
Thank you developers for including the downloading option for every video . This app seems to get better and better every day . I wish I could give it more than 5stars . Keep up the good work . Thank you so much for making learning so accessible to us,
"classes are not clear, I cannot find my path easily, cannot see my progress in each class",
I love the app but I am not able to read mathematical expressions with it and so I can't answer my assignments and submit them,
Since when do we have to pay to do the courses or receive certificates! They killed the free education vibe! Shame!,
"At the very least, bring back the on demand category. Now I can't tell which courses are on demand and which arent. And stop the constant updates. EDIT: Now down from 2 to 1 star due to the removal of on demand courses in favor of weekly deadlines.",
It's a good thing that it notifies about new messages in discussions. But it doesn't take you to the message when you tap on a notification. You have to find it painfully by manually browsing for it.,
Coursera is really a great platform. I would love to appreciate the efforts of coursera team for providing such a great platform to continue advancing anyone's skills and career.,
"Uninstalling. Even though it's a good app, lots of features are not available asking me to use a computer. So... Why do I have this app in the first place",
It's essential to connect masses to quality education... We should encourage younger generation to use more toward their area of interest,
Love the idea I can take university level classes while riding the bus or in any other free time. Great app!,
"Highly useful app, will get five stars when all the courses are fully working.",
After submitting the answer quiz reopens 2 more times...please fix this,
"The app is ok, the thing I miss the most is the ability to download videos to the SD card, unthinkable to my taste.",
"I saved a lesson for offline viewing, but the app won't even start if I don't have a mobile signal!! [will update once fixed]",
Cannot modify video playback speed or complete the quizzes on the app.,
this is my second installation and hope it works aas it should be this time.  I had to abort a course I was doing earlier. Hope it works !,
It's beautiful what you do for people.,
"It's a great app to learn, keep adding new courses",
Great resource to acquire knowledge. Blessings to the makers & developers.,
"App seems to work as expected, but I lack the possibility to adjust the video speed as I do in the site. It can't be done in the app, right?",
"This is a wonderful app. However, there is a ""downloads"" label before, but I can not find it recently. So, where can I fetch my downloads?",
"Helpful... Though m limited to some course, buh d free ones r really helpful... Can't wait 4 neuroscience to begin",
Excellent app. I use my phone mostly for this app. I love it.,
Would like to download available  lecture notes tho,
Excellent learning tool!,
The best application ever seen,
Free college courses on-demand. Need I say more?,
I update application and now it's not working..,
I can't do video quizzes.,
its ok..,
i have been used it after being advised by professor sirlos for mathematic science university of Cambridge it is an instant software thanks coursera,
App crashes on launch,
i thought its free? why do i have to pay 100 dollars for every course,
How to enroll courses for free?? When am enrolling it is taking me to the payment option. Please help!!,
Great product for edtech enthusiasts,
No crap n to the point,
Nice app for self development,
Allow increased playback speed,
I want to deactivate or delete my account in Coursera.How can i do it??,

I like the coursera app. It lets me look in on courses and view lectures. I haven't been able to use it for other functions like exams though--at least on my android phone.,
The sound and video are out of sync. This is am important issue. Other than that beautifully designed.,
Images don't load on the tests pretty often which requires that you guess the answer. Would change to 5 stars if this was fixed,
It's really complete. I can do almost everything without going to the website. It's super superior to the edX app. Thanks Coursera.,
"Thanks for making our learning experience easier. One comment while exploring course outline, it appears only in portrait layout, although I use landscape position.",
"A  Professor st the Univ of Chicago told me about Coursera a few years ago.  I have taken several courses and did very well.  My next challenge is to complete a Certificate Program and in my opinion it is similar to completing a Graduate level program. The work, assignments can be challenging but you will be pleased in the end.",
The application was working very well before but suddenly it is not playing videos. My internet is working perfectly fine. There is something wrong with the app.  Please fix it.,
If you will try this app you will definitely think that it deserves 5 star. And thank you very much coursera.,
One of the best educational apps available but need to refine video playback and audio-video syncing,
This app is amazing! You can learn anything you want.,
Galaxy S6.,
It helped me very much! Thanks!,
Great  app for Android  . Thanks,
Love it,
The app doesn't even opens most of the time.. I have to try atleast 3-4 times to open it up.. Plzz fix.,
"Works great if you live in the Silicon Valley with permanent & fast internet connection. :-P The app however is entirely unusable on a stuttering internet connection: Screens stay blank even when videos are available offline. If the device is completely offline (airplane mode), the cached videos work, though. Too bad that quizzes cannot be used offline.",
"I loved the app very much. I dont have a very stable broadband connection and all the methods i tried to batch download videos didnt work.This app solves those problems-up to an extend. But the problem i am facing now is , my mobile doesnt really have much storage space and the naming of the video files is insane.Is there any way to transfer the downloaded videos to my computer with file names that can be easily identified. Again great Job with the app.",
There are bugs in downloading and besides those bugs the Downloaded videos aren't properly managed. By the name of the file its not possible to understand that which video belongs to which course. Naming system should be improved and the if the files could be downloaded within the course wise different directories then it will be much helpful,
"App is not connecting to Internet now. It freezes when it needs to connect. Tried reinstalling, now I can't even log in. UPDATE: FINALLY, LOGGED IN TODAY. EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE NOW",
It's a dead app now. Not been able to open. Crashing as soon as I try to open. Fix it asap. Major bug,
The last update made video playback much worse. They removed the speed feature and now you have to touch the device every few minutes to prevent screen lock.,
"Video is laggy after last update. Freezes, and after that becomes unsynchronized with the audio. Please fix ASAP.",
I dont know why but it cant open recently on my phone (moto g 1st gen),
"Brilliant app for learning different subjects at one place.It really helped me in fields like  micro and macroeconomics,learn how to learn,financial accounting and many others.loved it.",
There is an issue when not being able to input negative numeric value as answer which leads you  to auto-fail that answer,
I can't open the app after the update.,
"You guys can't find these kind of apps at any store....Wordless to say, such a lovely design for the online learning arena.",
The app worked fine and I have enrolled for 2 courses but after update the app is not responding and not able to continue the course. Not able to open the application at least.,
"I am having problems with video, audio and subtitles unmatched.",
It's a great app with a user friendly and smooth hassle free UI. Great platform. But I'd really appreciate it if i could download the videos so that i could watch them anytime anywhere.,
The Application is crashing as soon as I open it.,
I have already completed 3 courses. Learned a lot. Thanks a lot!,
Can't control the speed of video. It's only 1x.,
Last time I used this app they had lots of free courses. Now it seems every single one is now payment. Disappointing. From 5* to 1*,
Video playback problems.,
I love it because i can take my coursera courses on my phone,
i cant download video please help,
Not working since I updated it,
No free courses in the current version,
Unstable after new update...,
It's so useful to thus students who are  interested to learning in online......,
Some of the best courses offered by best minds,
what are u want...available here,
Best app for open courses,
Fix it please.,
Great thing..,
not bad,
perfect,
Excellent,
"I really enjoy taking classes through Coursera, but the app needs help. We need to be able to ""verify"" through it and you can't, not initially and not for test/quizzes {they all need to be done through a web browser}; you can't view or upload projects through it; can't tap on the camera to ""focus"" on your subject. You're very limited on what can be accomplished with it, mainly reading and viewing most vids, but not all; playback is spotty. The app crashes often.",
Its annoying when i cannot turn off notifications for chats for different courses. My mobile notification bar is ever over loaded...,
"I don't know what happened with the last updated, I like the program and for me is really easy take the class outside because I work all day",
Also PDF links and others lecture links can not be opened in Coursera app. It is not even possible to open it in an external browser.,
Andriod app doesn't support pop up questions asked during the video lectures.,
Nothing about course information is updated. The project I was enrolled and using from website is locked in the app. Very disappointed,
"I've been going through hell with both the app and the website, the website wouldn't even load and the app keeps crashing every time I open a video, please try to fix this coz I'm missing a lot of deadlines here.",
The app is great n coursera is doing great but the problem I have is that the app is just terminating by itself unexpectedly. Please help fix this.,
The sound of the videos does not work anymore. Please fix.,
I can't understand why when I'm reading some of my course lectures and then I rotate my phone to be more comfortable I always appear in the main menu and lost all the progress... That makes me don't want to use this app anymore,
The application is very good it helped me a lot but the problem is that it stops unexpectedly many times. That's why I have given 4 stars,
The video dose not work with me even with my personal computer,
Hi guys. Ever since the new update I have not been able to open any of the courses without my phone crashing. Please fix,
Usually crashed.... First 2days are ok but then i can't use it .....please i have many things to learn..,
"Completely applicable, spreading knowledge thus peace",
Skips ever second video and there is no possibility to adjust the video speed.,
Coursera helps you in seeking out...,
Great courses easy to follow,
Free to learn and you can learn anywhere! Awesome!,
I can't put the value of Coursera in words,
In site i registered using facebook but in app i am not having that option please fix it.,
Education has never been so democtatic and free,
While waiting for my new tv ...ill be glad to take advantage. Of your latest deal..... 6 galaxy brought to me. ...but as i said.  I still want my new tv ok.  Thankyou very much !.....Lou,
Coursera  rocks but app so so,
Playback rerror is not yet fixed on my samsung note pro.,
It's almost merely a video player compared to the rich and full experience you get on the website.,
When video is playing the phone dims and then trns screen off. It didn't do that before. Fix,
Amazing!,
Just exactly what i needed,
Chromecast functionality broken,
Very good,
Good content,
"Sorry, its ok",
"The concept deserves a 100 stars. I am giving the app 4 stars only because the video does not support playback speed (like in the web version). Please incorporate that. Other than that, anybody can have access to immense knowledge in the most refined way.",
"I used this app a year ago and absolutely loved it. Being able to speed through lectures that sometimes dragged a little too slow was great. Unfortunately, this feature has been removed and replaced with a large number of bugs, including: issues when switching being portrait and landscape views, video players not playing in the screen size unless downloaded, and pages not loading. I love the concept, but this is a pretty big step back.",
"I had used Coursera for a few courses before discovering the android app. What a fantastic complement to the computer! Now I can reclaim my commute and check assignments on the fly, saving even the few minutes to get the laptop out makes this incredibly useful.",
Application is too heavy and need to be improved.  The launching time is high and require you to be too patient. But we need to learn with coursera and we will use it. Application need to be improved.,
Better to take class on a computer and not mobile phone. The profs put up links you cant click on with the phone. Otherwise nice to watch the lectures.,
This app is great. And it really help me to watch lectures anywhere any time. But add deadline to calender is not working.,
The recent upgrade has cleared all of my enrolled courses. There is no way to navigate to any enrolled courses.  I can only browse the catalog.  Please fix. Otherwise a great app (before this upgrade),
"I often go back to taking the course on the browser. I like the in - video quizzes because it helps me retain information and concepts better. However, quizzes are not available in app.",
"Cant watch videos on my phone, its only sound and in many lectures visuals are of some importance. Five stars otherwise",
"With coursera app for Android I can learn on the go. The offline download option it's great. There is a problem of taking quiz, the quiz isn't load.",
I used to love taking classes because they were free. Now every class is 50 or higher. Will no longer use app. It used to  be fun just to learn for free no pressure about grades or wasting my money.,
"In some quiz . when i want to do someone , in questios the tenses are incomplete, so, i can't answer the questios because i don't have all infotmation.",
Working normally after the update and the learning content is great. Hoping to see more learning material in future. And maybe add some language learning too.,
"Needs to support inline quizzes, like the web site, in offline mode. The inline quizzes really help comprehension and retention.",
After playing the video..within a minute application get crashes..please look into this asap,
I've uninstalled and reinstalled several time. The blue circle of death does not cease.,
"Finally, you can binge learn on a specific topic. This is great.",
I am using remix os on my Chuwu HI8. I cannot able to open the app after sign in. Feeling bad.,
Through a web browser there is the option for q&a in the middle of a video. With this app this function is missing.,
Performance is very poor. Most of the screens take a lot of time to load. Assessment screens turn blank randomly.,
"After the latest update, the app no longer shows my courses, and sometimes won't load at all over a WiFi connection. Everything works fine over cellular. Samsung Note 5 and Note Pro tablet. Any chance this can be fixed?",
Updated and felt disappointed. It just keeps loading. Confusing.,
"There's an extremely frustrating bug while casting where often the video will also start playing on my phone. To stop the copy playing on my phone and only have it playing on my chromecast I have to stop casting, pause, start casting again (wait...), and play again. This seems to often happen with the second video that plays or if I don't get the timing exactly right as to when pressing cast.",
Can't get past first quiz in calculus.   Freezing up,
This application seems to be the best use of Internet. I just wonder how they are able to give such valuable content for free. Great work developers and the whole team of coursera.,
Recent updates fixed a lot of lingering UX problems.,
No option to download specific videos that failed,
"I need to send my ID pic for Specialization course. But the camera function of the app lacks in auto-focus, so I can't! There is no ""contact us"" to let them know. How frustrating!",
"Logging into coursera is always a time to learn something new,thank you for the good work.",
"M forced to give 2 stars as Video player is not able to fit inside the screen width of my phone,  thus i can able to see only the half size of the video . Please fix this problem ASAP... .",
A recent update has broken the save video offline feature. Some videos get saved and some don't! And I can't control which videos to select for download again.,
I jst really hate the fact That most courses at this site are now paid! And they're really expensive too!,
Why to give an option to download videos offline when the app is not working without Internet connection?,
This app is a tribute to human ingenuity and the desire to bring education to all. Works beautifully.,
I quit. I've used the service for years. I've made purchases. Halfway through a course I get told it's now $60/month to continue. I quit.,
I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every week (literally) to watch the videos. Please fix. Sprint Samsung Galaxy S5.,
"""Saving to the SD card is not supported on this device."" Coolpad 3230A on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Pretty stupid that it's even a problem. Does the developer ever read these reviews?",
"It always says ""Unfortunately coursera has stopped!"" Fix this please. I don't know what the problem is. It sucks!",
This app is amazing.i love it so much.,
It has revolutionized and redefined world class learning and education for me!,
App constantly crashes with Chromecast,
A very big thanx to you guys!,
No source code available.,
thanks alot for this app it's very nice,
Must be there in everyone's phone,
Thank you Coursera :),
Useful for all kinds of people who loves to learn.,
Thanks to all team for making this amazing app,
Offline mode isn't working any more,
The app is fine. But nothing is free.,
What the hell? I enrolled in some courses.. They seem to name dissapeared.. No option to find them... Fix asap.. Samsung s6,
Now I can educate myself in bed. :),
Great tool for learning wherever you are!!!,
Still have to be improved but it's great now,
Must Have.,
Great efforts ....keep it up,
Excellent app!,
Most of the time I can't watch any videos! It just shows the pending icon forever.,
Thank you.,
This discovery is amazing.,
What happened to the on-demand courses?,
Fantastic concept,
Learning made enjoyable,
Video doesn't play,
Does not eork,
Excellent,
Nice for learning,
Very useful,
Good,
Grrreaaat,
"The app is mostly good, makes it easy to view videos even offline. But it only opens the course resources and reading in its crippled browser and you can get those links out. Can't share or even copy/paste. Have to go to course in normal browser for that.",
"First it crashed every time on start-up after I logged in. Then I relogged and crashes stopped but now I can't see any of my current courses, only recommended. Been using the previous version and it worked pretty well. HTC 820, android 4.4.2",
"In my humble opinion, Coursera is the best MOOC provider online today. The courses are taught by experienced instructors who have access to the most up to date information possible. Use the courses to challenge yourself and broaden your outlook on the global community. You can pay for certification, but it's not necessary if you just want to learn. Nothing beats free knowledge. You won't be disappointed.",
No auto-focus of the Camera when taking photo of ID card for the Submit Government ID section in the Certify part. Please fix this so that I could submit my assignments. I'm using Z1 Compact and Z5 Compact (both running Android 5. 1),
"This app was great about two months ago when I used it to take a free and open poetry course. Now there is no way to enroll in the Interactive Design course, without first paying for it, which contrasts one of the initial claims in the description for the app.",
The best MOOC provider. ..but a miner problem is coursera app not moving offline stuff to removable media (SD) I tried it but it is still in my phone's internal memory. Team please solve it as earlier as possible.  Thanks,
"This app used to work on my tablet just fine but for some reason, it has stopped showing the courses that I'm signed up for.  The app on my phone works fine and shows all the courses I'm signed up for as well as all the content of said courses.",
I felt obliged to install this app because always popping full screen when starting my course. App give much less than direct connection and it is not possible to download documents. Desinstall and forget,
"Freezes, crushes all the time. Every time I use it, I end up going to the browser again. Not satisfied at all.",
I'm running Android 6.0 and this app crash after each video finishes and when you try to change any playback setting,
"Great app.  But I cant cast subtitles, along with the video to my TV via chromecast.  Though subtitles work fine while watching on phone.  Please fix it.,",
"Very helpful in easily understanding d concepts via audio visuals. And, that too from internationally acclaimed universities' professors. Thanks. I revised Statistics subject after 10 yrs.",
"Please improve this app. I use it on my Google nexus 6 and it is very slow, freezing periodically. It is not user friendly. I prefer to use the online website!",
"I've been enrolled in many courses for free. Some of course I paid for certificate. Easy,  affordable and helps me learn when I'm not at home.",
Is a great app. All the courses are on my fingertouch. But the UI can be more user friendly.,
It's the concept of edx what makes this app great. It's just well done.,
Saved videos for offline viewing but I can not view the videos unless I have connection to the Internet. I have checked and the video are there when i navigate to them using vlc but with out internet the app fails to load the course and repeatedly crashes,
"And optional paid certificate, which as courses go is fairly inexpensive.",
"Bad performance, not updating stats in time, not validating",
Also some functions work better in browser.,
App works well. Makes learning on a mobile or tablet very easy,
There are many courses to improve your brain.,
Sometimes the videos do not get played. Please improve this.,
Why I can't reach my posts in the discussion??. I prefer the web site.,
I loved the save for offline feature,
Bad apps even the course good,
the content and quality is nice,
Videos don't load since last update,
Some videos do not open.,
This is for improve my English and Educations!,
"After installing the latest update, I can't play the video at all on my samsung galaxy note 3",
Are the in-video quizs available offline yet?,
Awesome,
How can I download videos for offline watching,
Great,
"I'm an avid Coursera fan.  The lectures and coursework are generally superior to those provided in person at college, and I turn to it to supplement every subject I study.  I've paid for 6+ courses, and participated in more than two dozen.  I recommend it to everyone.  That said, after two years, a complete redesign, and 3 mobile devices on my part, the app is still hopelessly broken.  Resources fail to load more often than they work, breaking the only essential use case, watching lectures on the go.",
"I haven't had the video loading difficulties others have reported. Works fine for me, and I can send videos to Chromecast, which is great. Drops a star because it doesn't always pick up module progress properly after watching a video. But happy so far!",
The app takes quite long to load and sometimes it  loads content from another course I have already taken. It needs some work. It is probably slow because its written in Java LOL,
Every time I open the application it takes too long to load all the details about a particular course. Please do fix it.,
"The app won't access my account or any of my courses on my Samsung Tab. The wheel turns for several minutes until the app crashes. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted, logged out and in many times. Happy to change my rating later if I can get it to work...at all.",
"I love the courses, but the videos frequently won't play properly.  This is problematic.",
This app seems to get only worse. It's super heavy and it takes a lifetime loading the course I already downloaded to watch,
"I use cursera all the time to learn about machine learning. The app is great, allows downloads of the video lessons and makes the homework tasks available.",
Takes so much time...just to display the first page when you view a course. Please improve the performance.,
I picked log in with facebook and it just tells me i'm already logged in and asks me to log in again.,
I upgraded this app to latest version. After the upgrade I'm not able to locate earlier downloaded videos from the app.,
"Website is so good, and the app so bad.. I myself can create a better application.. There is no provision for viewing the course record nor for editing stuff. Come on coursera u deserve a better app",
"First, it loads the text for like 10 minutes (no video, and I'm on fast connection). Then if I turn my phone on the side, it reloads the page again (for 10 minutes). Also, I wanted to write a post in discussions, and after a wrote a couple of paragraphs, the ""post"" button disappeared, and the text I wrote couldn't be copied! Such a waste of time. Coursera, please fire the contractor who made this app.",
"This app is terrible, with poor design, infinite loading time for most subpages, no access to my current courses. Do not recommend.",
"The app itself could use some enhancements, but I can't advocate Coursera enough.",
"very good app, but today after update I can't save my course for offline view on sd card. got message: saving to sd card is not supported on this device.",
"Now I learning one course. I see it as active on main page. But after I get in I see only Outline tab. After waiting I see Discussions tab. After another waiting I see certify tab. Why wait, and where course tab? Actually I finished one week of my course already.",
"This application is really what Nigeria needs, free and educational. I personally love this app!!! The the work Coursera gat going on",
"This error ""unfortunately, Coursera has stoped"" always pop up.",
Very Good platform to increase and share knowledge,
A very nice app to build ur concepts strong,
Videos won't load. Makes the app useless.,
Good job done team coursera,
"Absolutely horrible app, hate it.",
Why does it need a new permission to access my calendar when the changes are just fixes and perf improvements?,
Chromecast support would get 5 stars.,
You will simply love this app.,
"I have an Experia Z3, none of the videos will play. My phone eventually just goes to sleep. Please fix. üò¢",
Won't play the videos anymore!,
Its sooo slow.,
"Also I no longer can access a free course I started, now you want me to pay?? Adi√≥s, Coursera, uninstalling, unsub'ing.",
ÿßŸÑŸÅŸäÿØŸäŸà ŸÑÿß ŸäÿπŸÖŸÑ ÿπŸÑŸä ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿßÿ≥ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÑŸàÿ≠Ÿä ÿ∑ÿ±ÿßÿ≤ ŸÜŸàŸàŸÉ,
Hell app not a single free course,
Love  the add to calendar feature,
Must download,
Course outline (eg. the ML course) takes a really loong time (20s) to load over Wifi (802.11n). Phone is Nexus 6p.,
Best for learning,
Stability decreased,
Great,
"When it works, the app is amazing. However, some videos just never load. Sometimes the modules themselves never load. Sometimes (very often)  the quizzes for math don't load the equations properly but rather some math formatting code. I've waited upwards of ten minutes for a 3 question calculus quiz to load",
"Was working fine for weeks but someone has apparently decided to ""improve"" it.  Now I cannot find the Week 4 videos for UoW Machine Learning that I already downloaded and watched once.  Today all I get is pictures of the instructors and a description of what the week is supposed to cover.  This is not going to be much help trying to learn the material for this week's assignment.  Doesn't anyone test this stuff?",
"Wish all courses appeared the same in app, Intro to interactive programming in python I am looking at you.",
I have have been out of touch from my subject since my masters in 2012 but coursera has helped me alot in keeping up with the subject or otherwise it would have been all gone .....,
I can do this prior to the most recent app update. I hope this can be resolved soon.,
I was able to listen to lectures at lunch and use my phone a Galaxy S6 to take exams . My computer does not have a web cam so I am VERY dependent on the app. HELP!!! I now have problems loading anything. I love the app when its working.,
The app keeps freezing so I'm not able to access my course and it is very frustrating,
"Videos are unable to be played and problematic especially when saved for offline. The ""My Downloads"" never show any of my saved videos. App is also stuck trying to load sometimes.",
Download those tutorial videos isn't easy pls work on the inbuilt browser or downloader as the case may be,
"Recently I haven't been able to use this app because it no longer (at least not on my Samsung Galaxy S6) supports logging in with FB, and I don't have email login credentials and also can't set up email login even when I go to the Coursera website. Very sad and frustrated that I can no longer reach my classes on my phone. Help? I loved this app when I was using it on my old Alcatel-Lucent Fierce and could actually log in.",
This app is as brilliant as the people who founded Coursera. I have been taking classes through them for years.,
"Downloading the course is to learn when there is no connectivity. But coursera doesn't allow me to do so, it needs internet connectivity to login. It's terrible.",
"It works fine, but changes in your profile are not always changed in the app.",
But it sadly is not free. Can't take any courses without them trying to get into your bank account. Just another scam.,
Learning new skills is easier now. I like the offline option which will let you watch videos later.,
THIS APP SCREWED MY FINAL EXAM! and my PAID CERTIFICATE!,
I am learning so much about practically any desired knowledge I have. Referred to me by my college advisor! Now I get college level practice before the big game.,
I have been working on one course which I was enrolled in and after the update that course was removed from my list and it is in a fee-based section now. This is frustrating. Where did the open source education system go?,
Couldn't use it even once.,
Loved this app. After latest update I open the app and all of my classes are gone. What happened?  UPDATE: Thanks for the speedy fix.,
Great way to learn new things.,
This app is give the good opportunity & guidelines for students,
"Why am i supposed to write my email and name again even if i am logged in? And where is the ""My Courses"" section?",
"I really enjoyed it, until I couldn't load videos any more! Please, fix it!",
"Smooth, well organized and nice UI.",
What a great idea,
Crashes every time while casting.,
I like it. Very nice plZ join it,
Great app! You can access moocs from your phone,
"Nothing works anymore, so the app is now pointless.",
"App is working now, thanks for the fast update",
Now I can study wherever and whenever I want! The nerd's dream:D,
Lots of subject matter professionally presented. Who needs college?,
The best way to learn online..üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,
"I can't find ""my courses"" section, and the course catalogue is frozen/will not load",
Alot of bugs.,
"A good app no longer works as it should? What exactly was ""fixed?""",
When is it finally going to be possible to cast to chromecast with subtitles?,
"It says free online courses, but every class I looked at costs money to enroll in.",
I loved it,
No video,
Great platform for the learners,
I love this,
Love it,
Wonderful,
"This does not work at all.  Earliew all my videos play fine but now it does not even show me a course if i am on wifi.  My even slower 2g connection shows me courses but the courses i applied to earlier are gone.  Only those which are completed are shown. I will wait till next update.  If it doesnt get fixed,  i would rather uninstall it and use youtube instead.",
"Edit: I updated to see if that would solve the problems, but now it's even worse! Nothing works on my droid maxx. Slow, freezes constantly, and it's difficult to navigate. This app used to be great and now it is unusable.",
I cant do anything. I start it and it freezes and crashes.,
Update worst,
"I've been unable to load a single page within this app for several weeks. The website can be opened in mobile browser, and videos are available there, and they can be played without any playback issues, but the app keeps showing the loading indicator for minutes, and the content is actually never loaded. This is very annoying.",
"But that is not saying much. I like the direction the app and website are going (5 stars if everything worked properly), but there are A LOT of bugs to work out. The app hangs often (non-stop spinning circle). The only solution I have found is to force quit and try again. When it works, loading is still pretty slow. Some permissions seem unreasonable, but you can switch those off with Marshmallow (preview).",
"It's pretty nice to be able to download lectures and watch them on the bus or whenever, but I really, really need the option to increase the play speed. Some professors take forever to get to the point, and mobile devices don't really lend themselves for fine tuned control of the play bar.",
"When i first downloaded the app it was great and i was about to give it a 5 star review. It updated 2 days ago and I haven't been able to open the app since. I was really enjoying the courses, everything was so well done and laid out.  I feel that i had gained a lot from Coursera and i wish i could keep going. Hopefully a new upgrade will come out soon, although if my classes close before it happens I doubt I will resign up for them.",
"Atrocious app from a ""learning provider"" that counts android development as one of its main subjects. What's the point in being able to save material for offline viewing if the bloody thing tries to load at every opportunity. It will even start trying to load the page again on rotating the screen. Shame, as it looks quite nice. UPDATE: now I even get two loading circles at the same time!",
Initiallly I was able to watch all videos but all of a sudden no new videos are playing. Everytime I click on a video to play it says can't play video Its really disappointing as the application was really working nicely for me.For now I m reinstalling to check if issue is resolved,
This cousera is really helpful and I enjoy it very much. But it'll really fun if the subtitle can work effectively.  Why does the subtitles can't show up and keeps saying that error. So I hope you make better improvement and thank you for this app !,
"When will app developers realise that internet connections are unreliable? I give up using this if my internet connection is unstable as it constantly tries to load. Also, how does the offline  mode work? How do I get it to continue downloading as it does not seem to do it automatically? I have lectures in various states of download. I much prefered being able to choose which lectures to download rather than the app choosing for me.",
"I like the app, but there are many things to be improved.  It bugs when I am using the offline mode and very often it wouldn't load the saved videos. Also, the videos themselves are too big, and all of a sudden I have 4GB memory used by 3 courses.",
"It's an okay application. But I'm not able to download videos on my SD card. That's a very important feature for me so that i would be available to access it offline. Anyway, keep up the good work.",
"At first i could access my courses,now with the update they videos are no longer playing.its not my internet connection. Feeling very frustrated because im behind",
"I was really enjoying my classes but now after the update I can't even get the app to load! All I get is a white screen with the spinning wheel. 30 mins and still no data showing! I'm missing out on my classes and I'm over a week behind on 2 of them! Help!!!        Update as of 10/10; I tried the new update, still nothing but a white screen. Uninstalling. You would think a company with so many complaints would at least respond to some of them.",
"When it starts, it shows blank screen.  When I tried to refresh by pulling down gesture,  it shows updating circle forever.  When I tried search,  it complaints of ""no connection"", while the other applications work fine including Google Play.  I'm using it from China.    It was working quite well until October 1st, 2015.  It's indispensable for my study with the offline feature that I am eagerly wish it returns to its past glory. On October 7, 2015, I found that the problem reported above is gone. It seems that the server side of Coursera's app might have improved, or fixed.  Thanks!",
"This is a very invasive app. It spies on my contacts, my browsing activity, my camera.",
Some of the videos take 3-5 minutes to load and you can't always see your quizzes at the end of the video.  So then you have to switch back to the desktop.,
"I haven't found any issues with the app, though I don't use it a ton because I'm busy. I don't quite understand all the permissions, but they must be for reasons.",
Many of the course videos wont play- they buffer endlesly,
Great app but need some improvement as it crash very frequently on my MotoE device,
"Chromecast support is great; however, my lessons aren't being marked as watched when using this feature.",
"I love Coursera, and this app wad great when I first started, but now it won't play any of the course videos on my phone.",
This is a great and very useful App for people interested in knowing everything in a cost-free way. CONGRATULATIONS,
This app just keeps getting better. Chromecast experience is now great.,
It hangs a lot. I can't skip a part of the video. It results in crashing. Pelvis version was much better. And why is there no bifurcation between on demand courses and present courses?,
App won't even open now.,
Thanks for your hard work,
Nice app. Keeps everything intact. Love the organization too. Thumbs up Team Coursera.,
Too bad looking for a Spanish class and none available.,
All the course content cannot be accessed on the app and all courses can't be verified.,
The streaming of the videos are really slow.,
"This app asks for a lot of rights, so many that I'm wonder if it is better to drop Coursera due to this. Access to my contacts? Righs to download files without notifying me? Seriously? This feels creepy...",
Subtitles are showed on device while streaming to Chromecast,
I really enjoy to use this app!,
Not free,
Great work Coursera Team.,
This app makes learning easy and simple,
Works great and I really like the content,
I do not know all apps on my tab open except ot keep downloading with very little progress . The version before was much much good than this one now . What can i do ????,
"WHY DO YOU NEED ALL THESE PERMISSIONS, MY CONTACTS,  MY HISTORY, REALLY? How many fall for this? NO THANKS CAMERA!WHY DO YOU NEED MY CAMERA... To spy..sick *@#+~%",

Crash while watching a video..  Worked well before.,
Videos never load,
Video does not load. Sometimes video start playing in background while you are using other applications.,
Nice app please download it....,
Total crap,
Ok üëå,
Thats good,
nice work,
Dr B,
Gracias!!!!!,
"This used to be a five star app for me. I can no longer download videos for offline viewing. This is a big problem for someone like me who is limited on their data, can't stream, and therefore at the mercy of downloading videos via free WiFi. PLEASE FIX!!!",
"Thanks for coursera team and all universities participating, from the bottom of my heart for gathering all the knowledge in the world at one place.",
"I just filled the information to sign up, and when logging in the app crashed, and its the same everytime I open it. Please fix it!",
It's nice that even when I'm not at home I'm able to access my course information. Clear picture just like on my laptop.,
Would be great to be able to speed up videos like in the browser.,
I wish I could save courses in one place that I'm interested in.,
That's what this MOOC is all about.,
Awesome,
I'm wondering why I see listing dated 2014 and is it ok to try to join in?,
Crashes after signup,
Except some missed subtitles..,
Love it,
Wont let me play some quizzes on my tablet. Once letting me complete and verify the  quiz before erroring and then saying not available on  tablet. Constant problems with viewing my homepage and courses. Problems downloading courses to my phone. If you fixed the bugs this would be my favourite  app!,
After the update I can no longer view videos for any of my courses in the app-xperia z3,
"Chromecast is finally back! :D  Few niggles to sort out but overall great app. However some of the lectures have a too low volume, I do watch while commuting in tube, and although I have noise cancel. headph. some lectures can be barely heard. I wish volume was consistent. Also I wish one could browse the course weekly view when offline, instead they can be accessed only via My downloads, in there they r all mixed in 1 big soup in there, so not very user friendly. Other than that, I love it.",
Logout then clear app data solved below  issue thanks ...When I login via web it is showing study content and lectures. Inspite of that course is already started it is showing nothing in app.,
All the menus glitch and the course exercises disappear if the screen rotates.  Using Chrome instead...,
The app lacks some functions which are available on website mode like changing the playback speed of lectures. Also there are sometimes problems on playing lectures of normal courses(other than on-demand courses),
"I can't see the General Course Pages. This app used to be awesome, with videos and awesome content. Please bring back the first versions!",
App works fine but there's no control for video playback speed. Watching lectures faster is the highlight of coursera for me.,
"This app is awesome, working satisfactorily but I am unable to save offline video in external memory.",
"It's the greatest innovation that ever happened to curious minds, this app reaches out and educate people from all walks of life, for free. Coursera is moving in accordance with our basic technology needs",
"This app presents the course as a pile of stuff. It doesn't remember where you are so as the course progresses doing anything is a tedious exercise in scrolling. No option to open links in external browser. If the phone locks or even rotates(!) while using the internal browser it resets you to the main page. For courses that are just a series of videos maybe it is adequate, but for anything else it is pretty useless.",
Its good app. My phone has less internal storage. I would like the app to save offline videos directly to SD card.,
"One of the major advantages of having this app on the phone was that I could download videos while on Wifi and then go through them anywhere anytime. With the latest upgrade, I do not see the download option anymore. Please fix this.",
"Courses are amazing but the app experience is not that great. Loading is very slow, and the app needs a serious upgrade(specially in the UI area).",
Option to download videos to SD card is always resulting in app crash.  please fix that,
I have a paid Specialization course and another free course where neither are displaying any course content and many in the General Discussion board stating the same.  Also the camera will not focus in on Government ID for verification.  Please fix and I will fix the rating thanks,
"I am not able find any options to download offline lectures using mobile data ....it just say waiting for connection, what is wrong with this app",
since the site was redesigned i can no longer do anything useful with this app.  i can't see videos/assignments etc.  it works ok via Chrome (although the new layout is terrible).  come on guys this used to be the best app ever what's going on?,
Why doesn't it display that I have completed the quiz and sometimes it doesn't display quiz completed even when I have done so,
I can watch my videos on my smart phone or tablet. I don't have to be tied to a computer.,
Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini. App crashes when trying to select a course,
I am able to write exams from the app but can't view the videos or slides and can't download them as well. Could you please fix this.. Thanks,
"I can't find download video option anywhere, kindly guide me. Hate this new update",
"Cannot login, invalid format for email address",
Videos are sharp and clear. Great to catch up on a lesson right on your Smart Phone.,
i cant send the photo for final verification.. plz check it ..,
"Very rewarding, I can go at a slow pace",
Its not working over wifi,
I have completed my online courses with this wonderful App. It's wonderful!,
Good  app but yes at the same time is little bit problematic,
"If you like to study on the way to/from work, you should try it.",
Good app however the speed of the lecture cannot be changed. Love to have that feature.,
Best app out there to further my learning,
Provides the functionality needed to access the course material on the road,
One of the greatest app Learn like you wer to live 4ever,
This what education should be. For being accessible to all,
"Nice, organised and goot structured App.",
Last update crashed the app. I can't get into any course...,
Amazing way to learn new skills,
Great way to get inspired.,
Where ever we need...‚ò∫‚ò∫,
Really helpful app love it,
Couldn't ask for more,
love it,
Awesome platform for learning,
Best Ever app,
Love coursera,
Excellent  app,
Good app,
Can't login,
Oky,
"Even though the save for offline feature didn't work very well before ( not downloading all videos for a section ) it was the only reason I used this app. I like watching the lectures on my way to work, please put this back.",
Universal access to the world's best education.  This is the coursera mission. The app is great but limited functionality compared to the full website.,
"I love this app, but I have one major problem with it. Every time I try to download notes on a course, it will not let me do it. I've tried it on three different devices and it still will not work. Also, I tried to contact y'all through the app and it wouldn't let me either.",
You're spearheading the future of education. Thank you.  Only 4 stars cause I can't communicate between phone and desktop...would also be cool to see a job board evolve.,
"Here's the thing; I saved a course to my watchlist. Its past session has finished like 2 years ago, and they're about to open a new session on October, so I was thinking about enrolling and saved it to my watchlist. Suddenly, when I installed and opened the app, it's as if I've took and completed the past session! All the video lectures were there. And so according to the app I also don't have any upcoming courses which is super weird because I do have it if I open the website. I'm definitely uninstalling.",
"Se traba horrible la nueva versi√≥n y es m√°s complicado de usar, incluso visualmente es feo. L√°stima que hayan bajado la calidad de tan buena aplicaci√≥n, en lugar de hacerla mejor.",
Cannot look at my the materials my current classes have. I want to be able to take the classes (3) but I cannot access the material. You cannot search for classes you already enrolled (I wanted to check if that is the way to go to the material for the course) got worse. I was able to access the material before.,
The app gives unfortunately stopped working error when I try to save content offline.,
"After this update, app starts periodically, not when needed, interrupts other activity, changes device orientation and what not. PLEASE DISABLE this! For now I made a new restricted device account just for Coursera, then uninstalled it from my primary, a simple PITA workaround :-/",
I'm enjoying the Mandarin course on both mobile and PC but find the reliance on having a webcam for verification a bit annoying.,
I'd prefer using the browser to access Coursera if it didn't keep redirecting me to use this app... Using the browser was much faster,
"Please, add an important feature: save a course material, video and text files, to an external memory card. Your competitors have already done it.  Thanks!",
"It's been couple of years that I know Coursera and I'm so greatful of their service, I believe with Coursera world would be a better place. Keep Up the Good work",
ModPo class doesn't have forums and is a mess. It will be difficult for new students to follow through the disorganized files. I would drop this class but I have taken it before and loved it.,
The video stopped working so I cannot finish my assignments by due date.  Went online to finish and now if says it is over due,
This is a great app but I cannot download the lectures for offline use. Please fix it,
"Really bad, simply doesn't work. Won't update my progress. I have to use the browser.",
"I installed it on my cell phone. I have to try it on my laptop to see if it has the same efficiency, but all in all I thought it is a great app.  Great Job!!!",
But videos stopped working,
Loved it but the option of increasing the video speed would be much appreciated. Thanks!,
The app is in line with the high quality of the site!,
This is where I fell inlove with programming!,
I love it ad more to app,
Please add playback rate feature in future updates,
Lots of very interesting topics.,
Intuitive and easy to navigate,
Thanks for the free education :),
Really helpful...,
A nice educator,
Crashes :/,
I love coursera,
Working awesome again,
nice App,
Awesome,
Helpful,
I cannot play downloaded video lectures on my yu yureka after last update. Please fix. It was working before :(,
I just started a course last week and downloaded the app hoping it will be easier but since the last update videos dont load up on the app. They load up fine on the mobile browser so its definitely not the internet thats the problem. Hope the developers notice & fix this asap or else the whole point of having an app is wasted. Update: i reinstalled the app and it seems to be working fine now.,
"The app was great at first, for giving free lessons. But was disappointed when they turned the app into a business by giving paid lessons for at least 50 dollars. They should have but a donation account and be more voluntary for those who can't pay their lessons.",
Please check this bug As I can not watching videos I am only hearing . Do you have any suggestions for solving this issue from my side. Appreciating your feedback and fix ASAP.please when upload new version kindly write which bugs are fixed as until now video display are not working on some phons which you need testing your app in different version of android and mobile phone.waitting next upgrade to fix video problem.,
"I keep getting notifications but when I acknowledge them the so crashes. Access to course information and forums difficult, I prefer the web interface.",
I have registered my self for digital marketing course and none of the video is playing. Plz help,
Couldn't login. Unstalling after several attempts. It used to work but no more.,
"Felt my brain cells dying scrolling through Facebook.  Now, I'm learning topics that I've been curious about. Most interesting app I've downloaded yet.",
"I love Coursera and this used to be a great app, but now it doesn't show me videos for current courses and is inconsistent with the downloading of on demand videos. Also not all my previous courses are visible on the app...whereas they are on the site. The current course layout is confusing by mixing on demand and time-tabled courses...so it is now easy to miss dates, also...where is the option to sort courses by start date? Finally, really disappointed that the majority of On Demand courses do not offer statement of accomplishments. I will not pay for a certificate as I am only completing the courses for fun...but it was nice to have something I could keep to monitor my progress. Really disappointed with Coursera this year...having used it for two or three years now. I hope these problems are rectified soon.",
I wish I'd found this before it is fast becoming my most used app as there are so many great courses. Highly recommended.,
The only reason I'm installing this stupid app is to stop the barrage of popups telling me to install the stupid app. I like learning so I give in: I'll download it. Here's a star.,
"It help me learning the new things on many fields in any time, any place, any device i have.",
constant pop ups forced me to install this app. Your UX guy sucks and should be fired,
With your programming codes you are doing a dis-service to our beloved Coursera.,
I wish there were more topics I could study even if they just taught us the basics it could have added a little more to the help you guys are providing... Keep up the good work guys,
Same problem as reported by others - course videos not playing.,
Hangs. every time I try downloading a file from the internet,
I can play videos but i cannot access quizes and other course materials,
"Minimal features, some quiz still requires browser, but it's still ok to learn on the go.",
Since a couple of versions the app keeps crashing when I try to download any of the courses. I'm trying to download them to SD. Issue still occurs as of 30.08.2015. (No fix for over two months),
Won't let me log in with Facebook or my email. Unusable.,
I cant seem to search on which courses are starting soonest anymore if they are not on demand.,
"Now I can learn on the go! Just what I needed. Just one suggestion, could you incorporate a feature to speed up video playback?",
Please add speed control feature to the app. It is really important for learners.,
Please add video playback speed change support to the app!,
Last time I checked in there were plenty good free courses. None now :(,
The easy to use user interface and the registration process of Coursera is great.,
helpful for staying up to date with my courses,
This is indeed a revolutionary way of learning!,
It is very nice app and helpful for me.,
No course opens after the recent update. It worked very well before the update.,
Successful negotiations: missing lot of courses....,
Great courses.,
Like it,
Belajar menjadi demikian mudah dan menyenangkan. Gunakan waktu luang untuk menambah pengetahuan sehingga termanfaatkan dengan baik.,
Great learning...,
I'm a registered user but the mobile application won't load into my page,
So handy,
Best for studies,
Love it,
This app used to show course content and could stream to Chromecast. Now there is nothing but the course catalogue and descriptions. What's the point of this app now?,
"The application becomes less useful than before, which cannot view the videos of completed courses and it is hard to find the downloaded videos when it is offline. The old app does them well.  The website now works better, more powerful and useful than this new app and it makes the app even more useless.   For all ongoing courses the app works fine and it deserves a higher rating score, and keeping providing most of the courses for free makes Coursera a very good reputation. But still, only with respect to its current app, it is hard to give a high rating score.",
"Used app for 1+ yrs. Nothing good to say about it. Began with major login issues, passwords not saved nor updated immediately (at time of reset). Never fully resolved. Now, when you attempt a reset, the site claims your token has already expired - in less than 2 hours! When you are lucky enough to get it to work the lessons are downloaded and saved to the device, taking up significant amounts of space. There's got to be a better way. Til then, you're offa my phone.",
Now the video won't play.  You shouldn't need my location either. Boo.,
You can get a certification of many university's around US at you home for a low price.,
5 stars if bug fixes are done . not able to send feedback there is an error saying NO RESPONSE FROM SERVER...,
"Every time I click on one of my courses in the list it just crash and I have to restart.  The same in the last three updates including the new one on August 27, 2015 Galaxy Note 4",
"Coursera still seems to be the best of the online learning apps available on Android.  But I'm concerned about the intrusive permissions requested with no explanation, so I am reluctant to use it. I'm glad that at least I can use Itunes U!",
"Nice app -- but I have to mark it ""Just OK"" until you can adjust the video speed. This is a crucial feature for learning lectures.",
The app would be great if it had a video quality control and a video speed control option.,
Every time I open the app it crashes after a few minutes. I never had this problem with earlier versions.,
Shuts down whenever I try to open a class,
This app has been updated with nice graphical interface.,
Make it Lightweight and add signature quiz support,
Great application for fast learning.,
"Seriously, why do you need location permission for me to watch coursera videos? This is sketchy practice, at best, and downright wrong at worst.",
Thank you for everything you doing!,
You lost me right there!,
Does not work,
What's the point if almost all the videos aren't enabled to watch?,
Thank you,
Good job,
Great app,
Love it,
Sehr gut,
Abdul,
"The app worked fine for like 1.5 months (mid of July to today, 21/08/15). But then it starts to close itself everytime I try to access a page that contains non-video content. Video pages work fine.",
"Needs multi window support for Galaxy Note devices for side by side note taking when watching videos. Also Signature Track verification and payments need to be brought to mobile. Saving offline to SD card was a massive step forward, keep building on it. UPDATE: In version 1.6.4 the app maintained the older, more consistent, more tablet friendly UI. However the current version 1.6.8 build once again reverts to a phone/small screen UI:  -No slide out menu -Menu is hidden behind the icon at the top left which is unintuitive  -The menu is PORTRAIT ONLY (Poor usability on a tablet)  It is obvious this is an attempt at refining the app and introducing more material design elements, however it appears not ready for tablets. Please make previous build 1.6.4.1 available for download as a fall back for people like me with an 8 inch tablet(Galaxy Note 8 N5100) as the current layout is regression in usability for me",
Good app. User interface is horrible. Videos are not well optimised to mobile resolution.,
Latest update demanded access to location.  Previous version worked fine without it.  Uninstalled.,
The videos won't play - it just spins and spins. I then got the latest update and same issue.,
Says network error. All other apps on my phone work. Love coursera BTW...,
"I really love coursera service and to have it on my phone and take it anywhere with me is just great opportunity never leave my study, so thanks for this app!",
Is not possible to keep listening while the display is off!,
"I downloaded videos to watch on the train, but if I launch while out of reception I can't do ANYTHING until back in reception, most of my trip wasted. So unnecessary.",
But some courses don't seem to support offline viewing. Pls correct.,
Thanks good job but I think you can do more  on software,
The best way to learn !,
Awesome way to keep learning.,
Thank you :),
"Great courses catalogue. I recently completed a course in Genomic and Precision Medicine, something thats not offered any more on the platform. Thus, I couldnt apply for a financial aid. This is something not acceptable because the course was pulled off in between and though i could attend the lectures, i couldnt go for a financial aid. However, the option for a paid certificate is still available. Its a good platform and hence this was not expected.",
"Coursera is an awesome initiative providing us with quality online education. I am a self taught Game programmer I've worked on both large and small scale projects. And currently working with africa's leading mobile game developer, leti arts. I have no degree .. all self taught.",
"Nice app.  Pretty well organized and put together.  I really lik eteh Coursera classes.  There are only three things that I feel need improvement with the app. First and most important is that you NEED the ability to setup and verify your account for quizzes via a mobile device. The app already requests camera access and the typing pattern (while different from a PC) is still unique on a mobile device so there is no reason you should need to use a PC and webcam for verification. It is really restrictive not being able to use the mobile app for verified content. On a similar thread, I had some trouble with images in quizzes.  They are very small and the app does not allow for rotation. There is an enlarge image button, but that didn't work all the time and wasn't always enough when it did work. Please add rotation and free zoom for graphics. Finally, the Save For Offline needs to have a cellular/WiFi selection option for downloading content. It seems to download on WiFi only, but only some of the time. Some user settings might make things smoother. Pretty fair app overall and great courses.",
"hi guys,  First thank you for the app, it is so great to offer access to this kind of content. My only issue is the following: User's favorite course:  When browsing courses, I'm often interested by several courses at the same time, but sadly, without joining the course i don't have any way to pin (to keep) those courses in my profile to review them later and choose whatever course is really interesting me.  If you add the ""Favorited courses"" option You can also add reminders of these courses that for users 2 or 3 days before it starts.  that's all, good luck",
Hi!! Coursera is real boon for a learner like me who does not have much opportunities. Learning is very easy as so many world class instructors and mentors designed the courseware. These courses are really awesome and GREAT!! It supports now slow internet by giving option of OFFLINE READING. Love you,
App crashed while sending feedback. Uninstalling to use web browser instead if you let me. (Please stop with the fast redirection crap. If I want the app I'll use it),
"Am satisfied with concept and presentation of this app. The only issue is contents aren't loading. Since the recent update of the app, videos aren't loading.",
Norton Mobile Security now flags this app as HIGH RISK. The permissions are far too intrusive for an app like this. Beware!,
I absolutely love the site and the app. The only thing I would add would to be able to bookmark a course that I am interested in to take at a later date. With my schedule I can only take one course at a time and always have a hard time finding the courses I was interested in later.,
This was a fantastic app until the latest update. Practically unusable for me now. Doesn't even load any content anymore.,
Will rate you 10 given a chance to download the stuff for offline viewing. Thank you :),
I can only hear the audio. A black spot coming instead of Video. Disappointed.,
The app crashes in the loading screen. Please fix it. I use an lg g2 phone with lollipop 5.1.1,
"Upon account creation  the app gives access to a great variety of courses in a wide diversity of fields, at various entry levels. It would have been great to have additional functions like a watch list, and ability to organize courses in the catalog by date added (without having to flip through the whole thing every time)",
All things are going well...  But suddenly the msg comes tht...  Unfortunately coursera stopped and I can't able to open it. Plz solve the issue,
The app keeps crashing and unable to play videos. I fail to see why isnt the Coursera team working on fixing the app.,
Pretty well organized and put together. It is so great to have access to such a useful content. This app has added a lot of value un my life.,
"Suggestion: offer entomology courses, beyond what one can learn from public tv/documentaries. (No online suggestion box found). Free education! Exactly what I was looking for - like auditing courses except can do this anytime",
I was trying to review the list of available courses and was forced to install this app to look at a course description.  Became stuck in a password reset loop.  After having to reenter my email about a dozen times I gave up. Apparently just a HTML app anyway - if my interest returns I follow-up on my PC.,
Love this app and feel it is a great idea but cannot participate due to my 4G Samsung not being able to open video feed. Might have expected this on an older phone but not on this kind of model.,
"Previous versions handled offline playback much better,  this one still wants to connect to the Internet and hangs up when it can't. Dev  team please fix this issue. Thank you",
"If you guys can give option to complete & submit assignments through the app it would be just icing on cake. Please devs, much needed thing.",
This was a 5-star-app until last update on android 5.1 came on.Since then I am not able to watch any of the downloaded courses.Please fix this issue.Thanks.,
"Content is absolutely amazing, the changed interface is great as well. But what's the point if the videos don't load.",
This app has added a lot of value in my life.  The content is Amazing!!! State of the art. World Class!,
"A bit laggy for me, but it's content is worth it.",
"Requires access to almost anything on the phone - calls, accounts, contacts, files etc. And at the end no videos can be played. Removed.",
"Mobile app is a must have for Coursera, so it's a real shame they went only half way. It's missing variable video speeds, quizes, and most importantly - in-video questions. This makes it unusable for question-heavy lectures.",
Just an amazing thought that changes ordinary minds to extraordinary minds. Hats off,
App used to work perfectly. Now it does not work with my Chromecast.,
"Absolutely awesome, thrilled by the audacity to deliver such knowledge to discerning students, at the click of a button.",
"""Coursera has stopped"" is an everyday message",
I just love the Coursera concept !! The app is very convenient too,
"Conceptual brillant way to learn, expand or brush up on a wide variety of knowledge.",
"Now, you can educate yourself at home on a smartphone.",
This app is asking for to many permission.  Why would it need my browser history or my camera?  Plus access to check out my wifi network.  This is spyware at it's best.,
"Good app, but more limited than the Web version in some aspects",
I have so much to learn. I love it. It did really a big help.,
Amazing for people who are busy and can't make it to a class roommate,
"Updated review - after reinstall app now works, so great!",
Thanks. This version is much better that the previous one.,
It gives me everything that I want in one place,
"I had trouble learning Calculus, but now I think I'm gonna make it!",
One of few educational must have app,
I am forced to install the app to use the website and after that it doesn't even work?! What the heck is this?! I can't login in the app (although I log in through the website) and can't start the intro videos even,
For learning at all levels,
Good but can't get it on Lumia 520,
This is a very nice and informative site but its Videos are coming out all blank Its only streaming the audio  Please fix this problem,
I'd rather use the webpage than the app on my phone.,
"Great app ,fun learning",
Just great!,
really awsome !,
Thank you,
Are all courses free?,
An amazing resource,
Great App,
Nice app,
Fantastic,
"First of all thanks to coursera for providing free online courses. Its a great thing. However i have a problem with this app. I am able to either join or unjoin the course. However after joining a course, I am not able to goto classes. Also downloaded videos gets erased automatically. The app gives no information about the courses that I have joined or registered.",
"This is an excellent way to study, depend on your will because the videos and all of that things are so fine.",
"Personally I'm in love with the services provided by coursera but the android app isn't at all satisfactory. Takes a few seconds to load properly in my device. Needs huge improvement, guys.",
Need to improve a lot. No option to make a wish list of courses we like. Hopeful...,
"I love the content of this app, but every time I close the app after watching lecture videos I have to uninstall and reinstall it to continue viewing my course. I'll select a lecture to view and it shows a loading screen but the video never plays.",
Works great again.  Thank you Coursera! I finished The Paradoxes of War and am now going to start a new course.  Wonderful app.  I feel blessed to live in an age where we have an app like this,
Please add function watching video from courses list without internet access.  I know it's possible watch it by list with downloaded files but is enough clear and easy to choose what user want.,
I have tried to use coursera android app on my huawei g700 over the last 4 months and it has always crashed. I have tried it on other android phone and the same problem. I wished you could get professional developers to do this job.,
App keeps crashing when trying to save topic for offline reading...please fix it,
"app uses in-phone starage instead of sd-card (as all the applications do it), so i cannot download lot of lectures, install new applications and my phone constantly yells ""phone storage is low  there was nice applications from third-party developers for coursera, in which i was able to cache lectures for few full courses - but looks like coursera wants to be a monopolist. so now in my vacation i have to jump from cafe to cafe catching wifi and downloading one by one lectures and erase as i saw them",
"After last update, application became very slow. Not able to open any videos!..",
What an iFail. What is this 2007? - even the Applecrats at Chipotle have a functioning Android app these days. I guess you can use the iOS version on your Grandma's iPad for signature courses.,
After the last update I'm not able to save for offline viewing the videos that i want. Before i just selected the ones that i want it to download now even the ones that i already watched have to be downloaded i don't like that. Please fix that.,
"Much needed for course attendees. But unthoughtful UI, limited features, inconsistent behavior across different courses and bugs make it frustrating to use!!!",
I now cannot even download material to watch offline on my tablet!,
"This. App is less than useless for me. I can't get to the demo site from here. I can't even use the browser version on my tablet because it redirects me to the app. And why does the app require access to my contacts? Lame, and a waste of my time and bandwidth :(",
"Excellent application, access to amazing resources and without charge.",
The UI update made the app even better!,
The best free lessons from great universities. Simply awesome,
Free and open high level education will broaden the human future as a species.,
It is a great app for the learners..gives a variety of subjects ..and learning through this is too simple..,
I must say this app and Coursera has improved my quality of living,
Lot of p.langs can learn from here.,
"So something about, it is a good app",
High level courses in several professional areas.,
Courses available are useful and awesome.,
Ah! The additional links do respond. That's great.,
This is a blessing. Free education it's a gift and I am very thankful.:-)) :-)),
Great for self learners,
"This app is very useful,thank you",
The circle is turning and turning and turning,
Please allow playback rate as we have in the web version,
Thank u for this big work (y),
"What is the use of offline view , if not a single video can be downloaded.",
Best MOOC App I came across!!!,
Limited features. Needs  lot of improvements.,
Crashes very often.,
No words... Awesome app,
Love this app it is very useful,
Amazing resources,
Great app for learning,
Very good,
Its awesome,
amazing,
Perfect,
Awesome,
Amazing,
"Please how do I find my courses, I HAVE installed the app but i don't  have same experience like in the web... can someone help please",
Lumea,
"It's a great web-site and great application! I highly recommend it. With every update a lot of new features are coming. Thanks for doing that! However, it would be nice to have assess to archieved courses, which are available through the website but not in this app (e.g. Data analysis and statistical inference). I believe this small feature will make this app even better :)",
"I love Coursera, but the app is really bad. The video blocks every time: even if i can hear the audio, the video is stuck for 3-4 seconds, then it is sync for some seconds again, and then again stuck. The quiz in-video lectures aren't shown also.",
For people who aspire to learn anything without a cost this is our chance.. And for god sake the people who said the app is bad because the video etc is not that good. IT'S FOR FREE! Be thankful.,
"I love coursera and the courses, but the app needs a lot of work. It does not allow you to access all the information you can on the website for each course. Also, it crashes constantly when I try and search for courses.",
This email format is invalid even though I'm signed up for courses and they are emailing me..,
"Old app let you watch archived courses,  has simple intuitive interface. And now it's a f**king disaster,  useless tiles, no archived courses, come on guys!! Yesterday was watching archived course, today in updated app I can't, never was so disstressed üòû by app update in my life",
"The app gives me access to the videos for the course I'm in but that's pretty much it. I can't get into the assignments or the discussion forums. To actually do the course work I need to go back to the web browser, so the app is of limited value. At least by installing the app I am no longer promped to install it every time I go to the website.",
"Unlike Udacity and EdX, Coursera won't let me sign in with my existing Google account on my device.",
"The videos are the only content  in the app, and they aren't  working. Just a black screen.",
I KNOW my email Addy and password ARE CORRECT! Don't understand why I cannot log in.,
Doesn't show the capstone course in the list of current courses. Overall poor user experience.,
Its fantastic but facing issues at question ..unable to see images only text appears,
Love the learn at your own pace feel & love the fact real life professors from actual acredidted Universities are taught through this site,
"It's good to watch the video, but it's not possible to perform the tests that appear on the videos.",
For the lectures I am getting only audio and a black screen !! Please help ASAP,
Download course vids to watch offline is pretty much the only reason to use it.,
I love the new version. Thanks guys!,
Crashes every time when video starts,
This has always been the best.,
good interface.new course to explore.,
I like to studying coursera for my mobile SAMSUNG,
Truly fantastic app Universities of the world in hand,
Good and free to learn everything what you want,
I miss  the translation because it doesn't appear any more ...... Please make it back.,
There is lack in lot of features when compared to original site.,
Very Useful!,
I took course on laptop but in between continued it on app. The app asked to retake all the quiz that I have already cleared.,
It's excellent...!!!!,
For learning,
Great!,
This the future of education,
Love it,
VERY helpful,
Perfect,
Good app and would like few more features: (1) like to move the downloaded videos to the additional SD card storage and (2) Save and view the downloaded videos to computer. I am unable to view the videos via file explorer. (3) option to turn on the sub titles when viewing the lectures,
Signed up for a course.  Started watching videos for it and taking quizzes for it.  Thought I was doing everything but turns out I missed a bunch of testing assignments and a project worth 25% of your grade.  The app had nothing at all about these.,
App doesn't complete the loading process. It won't download to my Note 4.,
I attempted a quiz twice and non of them were recorded and now I won't even get my credits! It was a waste of my time,
You need to make running the videos with the screen switched off an option. Being forced to have it on drains too much battery and data to be useful.,
Great how it downloads the seminars for future read without streaming. You tube came up with his idea recently in India but you guys were much ahead with f them,
"Coursera the website is great, the Android app, not so much.  Seems like they put in the minimal effort to be able to say they have an Android app and left it at that.  Need to be able to control playback speed like on the web, the teachers speak way too slowly.",
"It was Ok in previous course, but now I can't play video in R Programming course. I'm using HTC M8 Android 5.0.1. It shows can't play video error.",
"The menu that contains links to ""My courses"", ""my downloaded videos"" etc,  appears sometimes, and it does not at other times. Also, the ""my downloaded videos"" list cannot be grouped by courses.",
Thank you for this website.  I learnt many things .,
I can't verify my account every time I click on take photo it just do nothing,
"It used to be a very fine app, very useful, very handy. With a couple of bugs. Now, losing so many previously existing features, it feels weird. Hopefully a white board in progress?",
Or just download video and caption file with reasonable file name so I can play it using some other software like VLC that support playback speed control.,
"not able to login from FB , using FB LITE app",
Here you can get all the information you want to !,
The new version is poorly optimized for Android 4.1. I cant even search!!!,
It been real go for me so far....grades recorded and learning new stuff,
Would like an app option for keeping track of when classes become available.,
The videos are big files and a txt file with the transcript would be great!,
Every thing is great but the speed of loading contents,
A chance to refresh my knowledge,
The interface could be made more user friendly!,
Coursera really is key to knowledge,
I love this. thank you all.,
please get more  courses....deserves a 5 star,
So useful for science lovers,
Essential to my growth,
Why I can't turn on the subtitle??,
Fantastic app,
GOOD,
Head of section,
"Lacks critical features for playing lectures. Coursera itself deserves five starts, but the Android app lacks many key features. I never listen to anything at less than 1.5 playback speed, so I really can't use this app. Additionally, I often want to keep listening to a lecture as audio only when I turn the screen off. Currently, I find it more worthwhile to download the videos and watch them on a decent video player. This is a hassle, but far less frustrating than using the useless player of this app.",
I can barely hear your learning about learning course at phone and external speaker max. This is the fourth time I've attempted to contact you about this. Every time your app quits.  Please respond.,
"I can't take tests on android, that really bugs me because my computer broke and now I have no way to take tests üò≠",
"It keeps throwing up a loop. The phone has become unusable. Have had to uninstall it. There is dialog box ""Unfortunately Coursera has stopped.""  and it keeps popping up. I am not even using Coursera and it happens randomly. EDIT: Seems to have fixed the crash loop.",
"Videos of the courses are good, we can download and watch offline.  But forum and discussion, comments parts need to be included in the app version.",
"Only lists course lectures and videos, no discussions, no peer reviews, no facility for copy and paste from other documents, nowhere to complain! Coursera's good reputation harmed by this inadequate app.",
This app crashes when I click save for offline.,
Couldn't reset forgotten password from phone. Tried to get a new password. You sent me a request to reset password but when I entered it said request token invalid. Did this two or three times same result. Get your act together,
"I give it an extra star just because it can view, save the lectures and conducts quizzes.  Every other feature found on the website is missing here (resource links, notes, forum support, auto graded assignments, etc)",
Enrolled in the Project Management course. Videos won't play. Just keeps buffering without playback. On mobile data and wifi. Note 4 running on lollipop.,
"Used to be simple and reliable, but now keeps crashing, getting slower every update, and doesn't work offline, even when you have downloaded videos beforehand... Please fix it!",
"This is a great app and platform, but sadly the subtitles don't show up in Chromecast, I'll give you five stars when you fix this issue.",
"It works perfectly well for me, the offline content is a great idea to learn on the go. Happy learning :)",
I used to download videos overnight on my cellphone internet. But in the new version video download is allowed only using wifi! Fix this! I loved the old version!,
"I don't give 1 star because I DO LOVE coursera, but I cannot give you guys full credit if I cannot enter the app to study... It crashes everytime I try. I've reseted my phone several times now, cleaned the cache... Please, try to fix it as I may not be able to meet some deadlines :( // Update: THANKS for the update and reply!! You are the best!",
"New design of ""my courses"" page is not so good - loss of wasted space.",
"It works perfectly fine for me. Love it actually, I've been looking for an app like this",
This is one of the best way to share knowledge.  Coursera is doing the best for whole world,
The course is already available on website but still not on the app. Kindly improve this. Thanks!,
"Now that lectures can be downloaded to SD storage, the app is great!",
"I've really enjoyed hammering through a course with this app, but it bugs me to have to log in with my email - why isn't there a log in with Google option?",
I loved being able to learn new things in an easy way,
Well informed instructors well supported information and case studies.,
New update lot of bugs. Video lectures won't download for offline use. Pls fix,
Please enable downloading of txt and pdf files.,
It's best edn apps,
Mobile App - Not so good.,
Just love it!,
Best app ever,
Great app for keep learning,
Love it,
Categorized as sports app on everythingme,
Wonderful app,
COOOL,
Nice,
"Since the last update, I still can't un-enroll from a course plus I have to log in every single time I launch the app, please fix",
Baik,
Slides and audio don't match sometimes. This happens every time you go back to review a part of the lecture video. Also cannot find reference documents related to lecture on the app.,
"On Galaxy S4, android 5. Works smoothly and is stable. Earlier version bugs when rendering maths symbols and layout of equations now seem to be fixed. Functions missing from app: download course for offline viewing, no comments section below videos as present in windows version.",
"app is ok but after the latest update, it keeps crashing and cannot access the mobile app already.. hopefully this can be fixed.",
Developers please go through it. I have a course that starts in a couple of days.,
I prefer read and watch the content in more dark colors schemes than white background in mobile devices. Some of this configuration would be awesome!,
"I paid for signature track and they were saying I can retake the course. I paid even though I didn't have time to finish the course for that month.  Later on they changed their fine print and asked for repay in the next month.  Highly discourage paying for the courses.  Use it for free, Just avoid the signature track or any payment",
"Great to see official Coursera app, at last. But unfortunately offline mode doesn't work. Pressed ""Save for offline"" and after some while a notification with text ""Your lectures are now available offline"" or something like that appeared. But when offline I can't open the course (says that I need a connection) and also no videos available under Downloads - You haven't downloaded any videos.",
"Without downloading lectures, they simply jump from one file to the next without actually playing any audio. Once downloaded, they continue to play, pause button will not work, and it will not stop playing, even after closing the app? - Large selection of courses though, new classes being added regularly.",
"The on demand courses design is so slow loading and the math quizzes always tell me: ""Math processing error"". Please fix. I need to finish my calculus one course. Unless you fix. 3 stars.",
It's so handy using coursera on a smartphone. I can watch the video courses anytime I like without having to have my laptop wherever I go.,
i want this to be a constant part of my daily life. learning has never been so accessible! and the wide-array of topics -- unbelievable!,
"This app is user friendly, the bug causing it to close often was fixed. It's using less Data so I'm happy so far!",
App is useless to me without Chromecast,
"Subtle bug, previous video's subtitle keeps running even after the video changes.",
The best app to learn variety of new things in an very convenient way. It also makes videos for offline viewing........,
"Make possible to change video speed like in web version, please.",
Search and browse functions are broken.,
It says coarsera has stopped working,
Thanks so much for making this app and offering the service!,
As a android Developer please support to play video on other installed player!,
"I think app doesn't show forums, or I missed it.",
Cant download / view readings. Also give course start & end date in the course info,
Works perfectly. No problems encountered so far. Very smooth and easy to use.,
Won't let me login. What's the point of the app then? I love the desktop courses though.,
This has become extremely extremely buggy. Used to be rock solid.,
I have only tried one course but it was really good and there are so many to browse,
Nice app to learn something always new,
Great tool to elevate your intellectual skills,
Coursera - truly transformational!,
A tablet layout would be really nice for this kind of application.,
I can study at online with this app.,
But needs to provide the discussion forum,
FREE programming courses to management.,
Pl add daily notifications.,
Very good application and contents,
Would u like to learn or teach? Download it and then joint the courses u want.,
"Studing the Stanford ML course , sound is not playing!",
But daily notification should be added....!!!üòê,
Amazing courses,
But can you add a notification so i wont forget to do this everyday?,
No Discussion Forum Tab for Any Course,
Learning on the go best app,
Just loved it.,
Great app,
Cool app,
Good app,
Coursera rocks!!,
"The courses can be tough, but I think that is the point. A beginner's course will not give you the skills you need to go further in your career. As a proactive leaner in the Coursera Community, you really have to push yourself and do the groundwork. I like that challenge. I appreciate the opportunity to add knowledge and skills even if you can't actually get course credit without paying.",
"The pictures that are used in the quiz are at times not visible(full screen and otherwise). Its not the internet connection because, I did try it on more than 4 WiFi spots and mobile data. The pictures do show up sometimes but that's a rare case. If possible please let me know if its not a bug and is an error with my phone.",
"Is a good app, but cannot download the lecture notes on note 4 or samsung tab s. No help available for this problem. Also notice the g+ link is not fully optimized in these devices either. Note 4 has lollipop and tab 's has kit kat. Otherwise, love the amount of content that is available and it is exactly what I was looking for.",
"This app has some decent courses on it, but it's not a very large selection. The app itself was nice but upon simply looking at the courses (not even signing up) my inbox is now filling with emails. All I did was watch the introduction videos and I'm getting course announcements without even signing up for them.",
"While I absolutely adore Coursera, this app is still immature. Lecture download and playback is solid, but the rest of the functionality is lacking. Content downloads and hyperlinks, while shown, aren't functional. Also, I have just experienced a massive fail where I finished a problem set, and when I submitted my work, it suddenly told me I wasn't logged in, and lost all my inputs, effectively wasting me half an hour. I hope there is still work being done on this app, as I'd love to use it more.",
"First version was pretty good. After all these updates it is a nightmare. Somehow this app reduces the speed of my phone so I have to force stop the app to boost it.                                    As long as most of the courses are on demand, you can not download the videos to watch them offline.           And last but not least, you have to use the laptop to pass the exams under verified certificate.",
Love it! To the people that say that its a waste of time because you don't get credits for the course: if you put a verified accomplishment certificate (obtainable via $29 charge) in your r√©sum√© I don't think its wasted because employers will look at it! Plus taking free courses is always an enrichment for your own education... I'm very grateful for this!,
Learning anything I want for free without pre-requested class knowledge. I feel a sence of freedom I've never felt before. TY Coursera,
"Am veronica Stephen,am a secondary school teacher in Nigeria. Am taking this course for professional development.also to acquire new skills as a teacher.",
The idea of providing courses online is very good but I have comment! There should be better focus on beginners to learn because I think they're the most using these kind of apps. I wanted to learn programming but the course was pretty tough to learn and and instructor's way in teaching wasn't good for me! Although it was for a beginner!!,
"Great opportunity to learn, plus credits if you pay, nothing wrong with that. Excellent delivery and content.",
I love to recommend Coursera to my Graduate students. They r enjoying their learning from online sessions in Pakistan.,
"I first have to say thank you,for sowing knowledge, into the world. There is nothing else I have seen yet that gives to the world with such in-depth focused class's that allow you to pick the courses you want to learn.",
This is the first app that I am rating 5 star it's just amazing. You can learn almost anything here and most importantly its' fun learning over here,
Overall app performs OK. But not having ability to play videos at higher speed is a big problem.,
"Me encanta Coursera pero no puedo ver los videos desde la app. Los videos tienen un lag importante, no sincronizan con los subt√≠tulos y cada X segundos se queda congelada la imagen pero el audio sigue. Imposible.",
I really like the concept of open learning that platforms like coursera have brought into picture. The app as such is okay and could use more features where we could tweak the settings. Especially controlling the playback speed.,
"Updated: The app is good enough to get the work done, but could use some work in integrating profile management and allowing people to purchase classes on it as well. Some transactions still have to be done on the website beyond the app.",
"Seriously, such a basic feature so poorly implemented. It says everything's downloaded but when trying to play it just freezes.",
This app gives so much in a little pack...there might be few bugs...but one of the best apps to learn on the go....thank you coursera team for this lovely app,
I did a computer science major equivalent from coursera courses. The unbeleivable part is that it's all for free!,
This is one of the best. Free and easy..  some cost a little for the completed certificates but there are options for people to get them at no cost. Just a little of your spare time or all can open up a wide variety of learning.. for free!,
I have used coursera for sometime now and I have achieved so many of my goals in life. I am pursuing a master's degree and I have found the knowledge I acquired through Coursera lessons a help of infinite wealth to my career purpose. Thanks Coursera Team.,
Overall a brilliant app which supports the website very well. The new feature to play videos via Chromecast is great.,
"Since last update, able to only watch videos that I can download. Since all videos are not downloadable then missing parts of my courses.FIX IT",
"Lovin' it, the app help to explore wide range of fields that can stuff our brain with knowledge.",
Coursera is amazing.  Great professors reaching great courses. This app is a nice interface to using Coursera. It's great to be able to download video lectures to watch on planes and other areas with poor or no Internet connection.,
Courses that I enrolled in via the app are not appearing in the list of enrolled courses when i log in into my id from any browser.,
"The last update was real nuisance, but you've got things back to being awesome with this update.",
"I've taken advantage of this app by fielding videos offline, as well as watching as streaming when I'm behind and am travelling for work, or am commuting to a customer site. Could improve forum interaction. Otherwise, perfect app.",
A GREAT opportunity for those who want to brush up on their skills in maybe a new field or even with something they are currently interested in but are limited in funding.,
"The first and the best courses online. Easy, fast and relevant information.",
"My computer was not playing the course videos,  this app will. Saved my course!!!",
Its very useful tool.it enables me to follow my courses in essy way.,
"Do it for you, not credit.  Top schools, great subjects, and it's free!  Why are people complaining about not getting credit?  If you want to learn, can't beat it.",
Sure it's free... but to get the credit for classes? NOPE. What is the point of this besides wasting people's time??? It's nothing more than a slap in the face to students like myself as it serves ZERO benefit.,
Very disappointing that they would remove Chromecast without any warning!,
Let the learning begin!!! Thank you to everyone who has made this possible. I'm indebted to you for your efforts. :-),
I was looking for this app to complete my courses!! Awesome,
Great courses. Amazing to have this much quality education at my finger tips. Simply wonderful!,
Please fix this bug ASAP.,
"Nice app...easy way studying, being offered by best universities of the world at your fingertips...",
Tough to verify its me.,
Keeps crashing and offline downloads not working properly,
At you own pace.,
"I can't take my picture from Android, telling me ios. Why get the Android version then? Important things for certificate track, then it sucks",
Amazing. Free courses. Also great job to the schools for providing and allowing these classes.,
The app would be nicer if it allowed changing the playback speed as well,
"This app is awesome, but when I try to watch on Chromecast the subtitles don't work. Only me have this problem? Any solution??",
This app is developed for phones only. please develop tablet version of this app.,
It's a way you learn not to worry about documenting your knowledge,
It is very useful for the youth so I will give 5 star,
Very good app indeed..learning at any tym  n any where..,
Wonderful app and the recently  added offline download  feature is awesome!,
"All round a great application, did learning.",
So important App for such important platform,
"One whole week without an update, that's a record! Extra star for you guys...",
"It's a godo tool for my, It's really interesting",
easy learning through your screen,
"it  is  wonderful ,  my  classes  with  no  stress",
My app doesn't open anymore... bad. Why guys?  Why?  Please fix it.,
A really great learning experience,
Coursers is good..now that u can cast to TV. Its awesome!!!,
Very good. Thank you so much.,
Perfect to cathch a few lectures on the go,
Nothing better to do...on vacation,
Can learn anything...... More than a university......,
Very good app.,
One of the best software & courses,
Stimulating and informative,
Invest in Education,
I love Coursera apps,
How to search in a different language ?,
Great!,
Good!,
Great program,
Loved it,
Knowledge knowledge knowledge,
Awesome,
loved it,
Perfect,
Great,
Like web there is no section of accomplishments. Also i don't have a webcam with pc can you provide the verification on the app?,
Everytime I turn the phone sideways/phone auto-rotates all my responses are gone.. At times i get a new question paper,
,
"This app is great to use your comute time, but unfortunatly at the moment you turn off the screen or send app to background it stop playback. It would be really useful to keep audio playing becaus slides are important just time to time.",
"Everytime I click the link for the readings, it doesn't work so I have to copy-paste it to another site so I can dload it. I do hope it could be fixed. Like just a click of it we can automatically download the pdf.",
Really needs a few key features that are in Web version... Most critical is playback spreed. Audio only background playing (or video in window) is a must else it's impossible to simultaneously take notes of view slides,
"I just downloaded this app today, and I can't open a single lesson. I'm going to give the web version a try before giving up, but I'm currently disappointed.",
"I can't open either PDF or DOC, I have to open coursera on a web page.",
What a great app. I'm always learning new things thanks to this app I can download my course videos and watch me whenever there isn't free minute. May edit: why does this need app history permissions?,
Finally can attempt homework on app also..Thanks people,
I welcome the new download feature (that has been around on iOS for long) as it is essential on the go. App in general is getting better. Thanks!,
The app worked great before the last update. Now it crashes every time I try to load a course lecture. I have tried rebooting my device and reinstalling the app to no avail.,
"Every time  I select a lesson it stops working, fix it please!",
Coursera is a superb site to get all your curiosity sated.,
Does not work for me after update.,
I enjoy the courier a app; it operates just like the website.,
Makes it so easy to access...u don't need the pc to learn...,
"Nice classes, Great price!",
Great learning with great app!,
"Coursera is awesome, coursera app is only good",
Great app for learning freaks ;-),
The great app!,
"Prev, Play and Next buttons in the player are too big?",
Source of knowledge,
It really helpful,
Nice  4all,
"Love this, made it a lot easier to get through lectures with chromecast. Only problem I have is it occasionally stops mid video and I have no means of figuring out where it stopped (or if the segment is done and I should move to the next one)",
"I have yet to use this app; I've only used the web version. I thought I would probably use the app, but these permissions to access our contacts, device ID, list of other apps on the phone, and even more are absurd.",
Allows you to do something productive even during traveling,
Great app!  Takes online education to another level.,
Has some bugs,
Like very much,
"The implemented features are very good--lecture videos, course registry--but it would be great to see more. For example, I would love to browse the forums and view assignments and feedback. Also, the videos should have speed controls as in the browser.  EDIT: It's been a year, and still no forum browsing or playback speed controls. Demoting to 1 star, as I have no reason to use this app when the browser version is so much more fully-featured.",
"Transcripts of the lectures would be nice! Sometimes I prefer to read lessons, or I am in a place I cannot play sound while studying. This would also expand student attraction to deaf and hard of hearing individuals. As previously mentioned, speed control and subtitles (as well as language preference for transcripts, when you add them) would greatly improve app functionality and thus student satisfaction and overall ratings.",
"If you do a certificate program there's no way to use your phone Web cam to verify your identity, at least on my Samsung galaxy note 4. I had to log into a pc to take the quizzes etc. Other than that it's great for watching the lectures. I do wish there were more options for the discussion board in the apps and acess to reading material.. these things required I go to the full site. So far this app is great for the video lectures and quizzes only if you're not doing a signature course.",
"There is no access to forums or other vital aspects of the course,  which is quite frustrating. I signed up for my first course, thinking I could take it while traveling, only to discover that I could not. However, realizing this, the app is still very useful. I love that I can download lectures to listen to while I'm out and about. Not being tied to my desktop makes it much easier to find the time to get my work done.",
"I love Coursera and I love this app! Being a busy college student, it can sometimes be a struggle to make time for online courses. Thanks to this app, I now download lecture videos at home and watch them during my daily commute. Efficiency++! I have a small request to the developers. Please add playback speed control in the video player, like in the iOS app. I'm used to much faster speech than that of a lot of the instructors and it saves me time to watch the videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. Thanks and kudos! :)",
"This app doesnt allow users to control the video speed like the web page does, among other funcionalities.",
I have a thousand reasons I think Coursera is great and a hundred ways I wish they would improve. That's a good success rate. The app is a great complement to the online courses.,
I don't understand how some ppl are rating this app 1star ... And for the laziest & stupidest reasons.. Get over yourselves.. This is an amazing resource that deserves no less than 4 stars!!,
I can no longer view course materials from the app. I am very frustrated.,
Will save but not submit answers. Have to use pc which negates the purpose.,
"Unbelievable, shockingly, and outrageous. The greatest online education in the world. Although few lecturers are boring cos they are too old for modern technology teaching. Anyway, you have a choice",
"Can't download Resource material, link do not respond in App,then I download from Website",
If only for the  variable playback speed. I need things a little faster.,
App was great until the update. Unable to even open course videos after updating. Pl fix asap. Will give 5 stars then,
"I love Coursera and this is great app, but video player cannot hide software buttons bar. It would be nice if player were using all of the screen space availible, like most of video players do. Playback speed seems to be the feature a lot of people want, and I'm no exception. It's just some lecturers speak so slooow :)",
good thing is now you can download the videos and save it anywhere  and get it onto your pc ...thanks,
The ability to download lectures is great!  Edit: I said the only feature I'd really like to see added is the ability to play lectures on a Chromecast.  It turns out that the icon does not show up if there's no Chromecast available on your WiFi network.  Thanks to the devs for the quick reply :),
Thank you very much. The app and content is very good. Only problem is that I can't manage to move videos data from internal storage to micro sd card. Is it possible to do so?                                       Edit: thanks...problem is solved with new version.,
"Great effort by the developers. You will need to earn the fifth Star by adding a ""Single Click Download-All"" option for the course videos.",
Please consider adding video download option for ondemand courses. Would be much appreciated.,
"Almost perfect , except it hangs sometimes. Can be improved.",
Keeps closing on some courses.,
Great app! Just like actual college courses.,
"Why does an educational app need to dig so deeply into my device's personally identifiable information? I would, honestly, like to know.",
New courses are not displayed,
Hat off for your great work.,
"Great app, good content, but randomly closes.",
"Nice tutorials but bookmark will be helpful, exercise contents are not appearing..",
"But it does not have an invite system, from what i have seen.",
"Very good app, can watch directly on the app!!    I believe keep learning will gradually change my life n everyone's life!!!",
Used it to better understand calculus,
"Works most of the time, but sometimes can't show video.",
Very helpful and easy to use,
Please add Web designing,
Really helpful app for learning new technologies.,
It's very powerful leaving app,
Very useful application.,
To learn is a life time goal,
One of the Best free courses support!!,
Please add .1.watching speed .2.arabic subtitle .god job Thanks :),
You have to try this.,
Really useful for academicians and students.,
I have cimpleted 2 courses using this app,
Learning on the go!,
Con una sola palabre les describo coursera: Buenisima!!!!,
Great app,
Grt initiative ! Learning on the go!!!,
Was super fast,
Love the learning experience overall,

"it is working worse and worse in the recent weeks. The courses that I have joined do not show up in the app when they started! The app removes the course from my list and I have to join again, or I have to use the coursera webpage. It is getting absolutely useless and frustrating. I miss the app older versions!",
"I have the same problems: videos are not launching, links are not working, it crashes all the time.",
"With the new upgrade this week, I can no longer see the courses I'm enrolled in. I can search, but there is a completely white screen on the Samsung 5.                                          New updates are working much better.",
"I like the app in general. However, I wish the storage location of course content is transparent. As it happens, I may only have access to this content from other devices only if I root my phone.",
The videos don't play in the screen. the problem had been there for some time now and it has not been resolved. horrible .,
"Thanks a lot , Im very keen to learn Forensic Science . hope u will help me for that . Regards. Rehana Gul.",
My only complaint is that any accompanying materials cannot be downloaded from the app.,
"Videos are OK, but no speed control. Main improvement would be forum access",
"Nice app, but it would be better to continue playing audio when screen is switched off",
I absolutely love the fact that I am able to access classes from my computer to my phone! It's wonderful!,
Can't d/l or stream any videos despite wifi on 75/75.,
But I would like to be able to see my grades from the app as well,
Please add a way to bookmark a course.,
Ive done one ppr in 2013... everything is good.  Really appreciate it. :),
ÿ™ŸÜ⁄©ÿ≥,
"Very handy when I am in the waiting room or otherwise not able to get to my laptop.  I use this on GalaxyTab 4 - 10.1 and LG phone.  Tab is rooted, phone is not.  One thing that is missing that I  would really like to see is access to the discussion boards.  They are an integral part of the learning process in every MOOC I have participated in.",
"Navigating to find your 'enrolled' courses and videos is frustrating since it is possible to do courses that are not 'active.' Why isn't there any kind of sorting? Like ""most recently watched' ? There is no x1.25 or 2x speed button. Buffering videos takes FOREVER on anything less than a strong 4G signal. A HUGE ""Thank you"" though for pulling out the stupid in-video quizzes when watching on mobile... That was so annoying.",
"Its a really great app but it still needs a few tweaks.  For example, the app could help learners by giving the ability to particapte in discussions, view the required readings and, most importanty, find the downloaded videos in the phones files easily just like when the same videos are downloaded over at the site using PCs.",
"The only thing I do t like is it won't allow me to download any of the lecture notes or other downloadable files, only videos. If you can fix that it will be 5 stars",
"Seems like video's buffering of downloading too slow for me, YouTube works fine. Hope this will be OK soon",
Please add a speed toggling button to the vids. Some instructors talk unbearably slow.,
The classes are nor open yet and this is week 2.please fix and I promise 5 stars,
A really good app. It includes so many courses which takes forever scrolling throw. It would be really useful to have a reach function to find what you're looking for.,
The quiz system refreshes randomly and does not deliver submission to the server. I have lost my completed work twice through this App. I would discourage anyone from using the quiz system on the app. It is good for streaming the lectures though.,
No longer able to use it in landscape mode. Videos are tiny on phone in normal mode.,
The app is fantastic. But let me know How to store the videos to external memory. The videos are occupying my internal storage.,
DM is too buggy at least in my LG G3! Please fix that as we need to get videos for offline use.,
This Android app does not allow the course content to be viewed; it only shows the course description. I have to access the content via a browser on the desktop. So this app is pretty much useless.,
"Very useful for learning on the way. You can view courses content - may be not all of them, but many. Desktop version it's still more convenient, butthis app makes access simpler.",
I can't find the option to download unlike before :(,
"Nice app for a great site. Sometimes the courses dont appear in the app, but they do apperar in the web version.",
Can't play the video. And also waiting for more functionality!,
So far everything is good except for one thing - why can't the video lectures start from the last possition? Why do they restart every time you reopen them???,
Can't open a course,
Wonderful to have when on the move.  Thank you for making learning more accessible.,
Thanks course and to everyone who made free learning possible!,
Giving the power of knowledge to the world you are The real gods,
Its very useful for students in order to compete this world in technology.,
Problem solved..ty,
Cannot complete quiz within app,
Course which I want to study are almost available in different languages other than English so will you please provide inbuilt translation !!!?.,
It's the Haven for knowledge craving people. üëç,
When i first got it you werent able to see the course material but man you can do all that and its to kool,
Thank you Coursea for offering free educational courses.,
Thank you so darn much,
Amazing app by all means. Thanks a lot,
Should have the option of playing videos in external player.,
Simply genius presentation and content!,
Please let us move all videos in external storage please make seeting to move all data in external sd my phone starts hanging when i stored many offline data,
Thank you for good to help me grow.,
Add forum and invideo quizzes support.,
Awesome app!,
It works pretty well....love the site anyways....,
Awesome... :),
All the best,
Amazing,
"We have to use this app to complete quizzes for my AP Calculus class and every single time I work on one of the quizzes for well over an hour, IT DELETES MY ANSWERS. It never fails that it just deletes them all and I have to redo it. It does this on my iPad and my phone. I hate this app.",
"If u can include a guide section, that can provide a listing of available on demand and scheduled courses from an individuals interest area taking into account the experience level and familiarity with the subject, that would be awesome! Currently I end up taking an advance class before a basic class because I am searching randomly.  Also beef up on demand courses as the collection is pretty useless there.",
"Coursera  is a great place to learn new things. Certificates are affordable. Im a broke person who can't afford to continue education at university, but while coursera  certainly cannot replace university education, it is still a good medium through which you can learn. :)",
U can actually learn things here from different categories. All u need to have a good internet connection and interest to learn..,
I love this app.  I just finished week one of my first course.  I passed my first quiz 100%. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to further their education whether they want to receive certification or are just wanting to learn something new.,
Im in a situation where I need to study and I have no cash in me.... Im really thankful for the changes and the studies that I earned,
"Allows to gain full experience: watch lectures (even with subtitles), do homework, see course logistics and of course browse for new courses. Everything is perfect:)",
This app is really very good if you want Lear something... enable video downloading on on demand courses or add some language courses to learn new languages .,
"Subtitle doesn't work in some courses, please fix it!",
The app works well most of the time when it does work. Does tend to hang though.,
Can't get the words to explain how wonderful this app is.,
"First time for me following open courses, thanks for doing and collecting open courses in one app",
Is this like college but free! Will i get credits and is there something with nursing,
"Please, include a easy search by university/country",
Its easy way to learn from cell phones great app for education,
Excellent app. Can you please have a folder structure or a good naming convention for files in download Manger? Seriously needed feature.. PLEASE!!,
Really helpful especially for those who cant afford to go bsck to school like me. :),
Otherwise definitely worth 5 stars,
It's what an educational app should be like.,
Doest work. Nothing else really to say. Dont download.,
"Great app for free ""studying""",
Can't find how to increase subtitles text size.,
Thanks for this app guys...   Can  study anywhere now...  Great job!!!,
This is what an online class....superb,
Awesome app.... extremely helpful and useful,
Love this app. Good.,
Very interesting,
Love it absolutely..,
I love it....,
Thanks for this great application,
Loved it.....,
All hail Coursera,
Useful  app,
Best and easy,
Thank you!,
"I use this very frequently, though a full web browser session on a real PC is more flexible and a bit more stable. In the stability arena it's mostly the weaker hardware in my old Nexus 7 than the app that is at fault.",
Would you please add speed up speed down option on mobile and the ability to pass the signature track as well. It would be very useful.,
This app can read all the accounts in my mobile and all the contacts too. Its ridiculous how much data the developer collects with no transparency. Also the app started taking screenshots of my screen without my consent.,
Website allows login using FB account and app there is no option using the same. This is a half baked app. Really disappointed.,
The app does what it intendz ie offer the lectures and announcements on mbile. The ability to download videos for offline healps.A liitle more work usability will make it top rate.,
No support for changing playback speed. Often the sound is fine but video hangs. Can't see in-line slides.,
"Sir i have a suggestion, your video files are saved as  001.mp4 , 002.mp4,in this way sometimes a conflict is raised, instead of this scheme implement a new video file naming method, For every course assign a unique ID and save video by That ID and The lecture number , suppose if course is from University of Michigan and Course is python then try name like UOM_Python_Lecture1, In this way video will be identified uniquely and even on reinstalling after deletion of app the retrieval of data will be easy. Plz",
The page My Courses does not work. It is really annoying that after months this issue has not been solved.,
I think the ability to take courses and watch videos in the app and also take exams right away in critical for your app. I hope to see those in future releases,
Coursera is doing a great work by providing free online training in many specialized courses from top universities.,
"The coursera app was excellent (except for a couple of bugs), but has turned into a disaster as it is not any longer usable for off-line users. And what is this ""Hockeyapp"" all about?",
Please make download to SD card possible. I cannot fit the course I intend to study on my internal memory. That is the only thing that keeps me from giving an otherwise good app 5 stars!,
I just love coursera's platform.  I'll definitely recommend it for learning top courses.,
"Learning guitar course, coming soon... Bummed, my main reason for install... We'll see what soon means.",
but I miss a profile page where I could see my certificates.,
Crashes every time while playing video.,
But make simplify to view and download video lectures.,
I can do now more courses using my phone ! Any where any place ! GREAT!,
Please add a full fledged video player with jump forward and jump backward ability,
Great app and quick support.,
It is addictive.,
The best learning app I could find,
More features are missing compared to the web site,
Can't seem to download videos for on-demand courses.,
"Great project, great app",
Cannot download videos anymore,
Nothing better than free education.,
Really speedy and good UI.,
Thank you developers that added Chromecast support. I am forever in your debt.,
Downloading videos feature is awesome!,
Learn on the go!,
Just crashes when open a course,
Please add features mobile notification/calendar about assignments,
Cant play video. Tell me how to fix it?,
Nice app for studying...,
"I can once again watch the videos offline, so upgrading my rating to 4 stars.",
Amazing app.,
Why does it need access to my contacts?,
Excellent.,
Unstable app,
Best Education App,
Can't play the video.,
Where is download video option...???,
Cant connect fb,
Best lessons,
Positive psychology,
E,
Awesome,
Superp app...,
Now with Chrome Cast support,
"I had installed it some time back. But even though I have enrolled into new courses, its still showing the old courses",
Tks,
Worth it,
"In addition to all previous ""features"" (periodically forgotten downloaded videos, lack of hi-speed playback, constant crashes) the new version keeps prompting for login every time it runs - REALLY useful when running disconnected (which is my case right now).   UPDATE1: Fixed login issue, then broke again it in the next release.  UPDATE2: Current release doesn't show any registered classes when running disconnected  - discovered it on the plane. (you can still access downloaded content through ""My downloads"" menu). I'm truly impressed with you guys...",
"If I were just rating the courses, it's a five-star app. But a lot of the content won't load within the app. Instead, it opens up in your browser, even though the mobile site is pretty lousy",
"I go through courses videos only with this app. But several technical issues: 1) when I tap ""pause"" during the video, video continues and pauses only after about two seconds, and therefore I often lose some formula for which I wanted pause the video; 2) sometimes videos (voice in it) are to silent even with full volume - seems like volume in your app is lower for some reason than everywhere else. I have android 4.4.2 on Lenovo vibe x2. Also, of course it would be very nice to have in-video quizes",
"Only thing I wish was that we could change the playback speed. I tend to watch videos on faster settings, so I don't use the app as often because of this lacking feature.",
I think the issue was with my storage. I just re-installed the app and it's working fine now. Much better experience and thanks for quick response :-),
"I cannot see full sized video during video section, the button on video section is awfully placed, and cannot see / download pdf lecture. Fix for 5 star :)",
Can't find a way to see what courses r starting soon like I can on the website. Starts on my past courses which is pointless.,
"Its great browsing through hundreds of courses, but it really needs the ability to star or favourite courses you maybe interested in.",
Great app. I've been learning so much. I can't access the slides provided. Please fix this and I will give 5 stars.,
Good app for educating oneself on many topics. But why can't I add the on-demand courses to My Courses? I need to dig through the catalogue just to find it every time.,
"I'm downloading videos at home, but the app spontaneously signs me out so I can't watch them without internet anyway.",
"I use a proxy to connect to my schools wifi and my apps go through this proxy. When using my mobile data, I was able to read course articles snd watch videos. But connected to wifi. I could only search for courses and read articles. I could not watch the videos. I would be grateful if this bugis fixed Thanks.",
"Basic functionality is great. Five stars when they add the option to play videos at different speeds (1.5x etc). You can do this on the website, and generally speaking it makes it poss to get through the material much faster while still keeping it understandable.",
Makes it possible to fit academics into all of the downtime of my daily life.,
"Because of coursera, microeconomics is the only subject that im gonna get a certain A this semester.",
I love it! I'm using this app to get further knowledge on neuroscience and cosmology. It is really great!,
I decided to download the app to see what it was all about and I couldn't even get past the sample quiz. Please fix this!  Moto G,
Everything is good except that I can't attempt quiz while it's Chromecast.,
Will help you fix it if you like!,
The quizzed not working yet,
It has all the courses I need and  it is really helpful.,
keeps crashing after updates on 4th March.,
Very useful service and good app.,
"Awesome app learnt a lot in the last 1 yr, tks coursera for the great lessons",
I love that I can do some extra learning on my own at my own pace for free,
A great app to learn completely free whatever you want,
if only we could change the download folder toother folder that would be great,
Luv it .Best application. Everyone should have it. University education for free.,
Coursera takes pictures of you when click on the app.,
But we need subtitles plsss,
"Beautiful design, responsive interface,  fast performance",
Truly experiencing learning on the go,
Keep building bridges for knowledge and the people.,
Best app i ever had. Luv it !!!,
I was going to rate this app at least four stars..... but what hockey app for taking screen shots is doing in the background after latest update? It would be nice to have access to forums.,
Absolutely amazing device.,
Learning on web version.,
It makes everything handier!,
It works all right. Needs more topics. Did you know the logo is nearly the same as CoPass?,
God is great may God bless you.,
Reality useful,
Great app with great content!,
"Love it, really helpful :)",
Love it.,
I love the courses!,
What's not to like about free learning??,
Awesome!,
Great!,
Works extremely well,
Computer Science 101,
pdf also include in,
Educative app,
awesome app,
Great,
Finally Chromecast works,
Thanks...,
"Still buggy, but it is better now. Please fix launching the app in WiFi/cell data off mode. Downloaded material still should be available in this mode. This should be your major feature.",
Thanks for all this efforts to helping us in learning what we want from any place at any time.,
I cannot see the videos,
Awesome anywhere learning...,
"I have noticed(including myself) that most of the time we only use our mobile phones for social media and goofing around. Can you imajine what our generations would have done with this technology.  We have everything we want at the palm of our hands, including knowledge.  I am dying to go back to college but certain life events have pulled me back.  With coursera,  I could learn anything. I have college education without the fees.  Someday I will go back to college and for sure I will be more than ready.",
Some video material is being downloaded with audio part only... I will appreciate a lot if you would fix this. Another thing: I don't see a possibility of downloading files to the SD card so I have to move them manually which is quite annoying...,
This is the system that delivers good contents with good system to the whole world on a massive scale. I am really enjoying the lectures on diverse topics offered by coursera. Hope that coursera keep up the good works and improve all the time.,
"I love this app ,have tons of certicates learning in non-stop,take advantage",
"U guys need to change the name of the app though , people gonna mistake it as a programming exclusive app",
A good app with user friendly interface and good categories also,
"Stop wasting your time,Start learning by Coursera",
The best app in market for learn about everything,
But would be better if you  could add more courses,
"World class education, just a touch away.",
"Trying my first course on it, so far it's good",
Coursera is great and so is the app.,
Thanks a lot for an accessing to an amazing free knowledges on my phone!,
Love it!,
Better than working from the PC!,
Great app!,
Really good and useful,
Excellent app,
Very great,
"I hope that NullPointer exceptions when trying to start app when phone loses internet connection will eventually be fixed (filed a crash report on that).    Besides, one suggestion is could you please stash on-demand courses somewhere at the bottom of my courses list (in ""past courses"") after I successfully pass the course and get credit?  Another suggestion is to  refresh course list only _after_ successful reply with data from server, otherwise with poor inet connection I end up with blank list.",
"Some of the lessons I watched were popping up questions from previous lessons. Now I'm having trouble watching some of the sub-lessons for a Medical Terminology class I signed up for. I was able to watch the very first intro video but every other video in week 1 is only 15 seconds long and there is no audio, only an intro picture of the school with the teachers name at the top. Please look into these issues.",
I have been using this app for last 2 months and it always crashes. I was waiting for the new update hoping that it will be fixed. The apps also restarts on it's own. I have no choice but to uninstall and install again or use force stop. Please help.,
The App's course browsing options keeps displaying the same courses for different categories. As if I'm looking at the list of all the courses and not a particular narrow set for a specific subject.,
Thanks for making this awesome app. It had been my dream to study abroad. But the tuition fee is terribly expensive. But now I can take a great course from ive league online.,
"Was using this app on a Nexus 7. When online it worked perfectly. However, it kept crashing when I tried to watch offline. Hope you can fix this. Thanks",
Almost gave up on this app altogether when I couldn't access my courses for a while but now that its working again its all good. A few extra features would make this app even greater though.,
Was fine until the last update. Now the course pages (syllabus e.t.c.) are all empty. And the app keeps popping up unless closed. Pls help fix it. Thanks.,
"This perfect app could become even better if the useful ""playback speed control"" feature that is available on the desktop web app is added to android app also.",
I can't open assigned readings pdf. When i click on them nothing happens,
The app is crashing when trying to view saved videos in offline mode. It used to be a great app a week ago though,
"The app can't work offline. It just crashes, and will continue background crashing. The app is updated practically every day, more than probably any other app on my tablet. Maybe have less releases and more testing?",
The courses are very helpful and I learned so many new things. Good to have an app like this.,
App is crashing in offline viewing mode on Nexus 7. Just started with last update.,
Thank you for the update. Videos work perfect. Still some videos of some courses play only audio.,
There's no scope to control the playback speed and the videos don't jump to next video after completion. Crash when trying to use offline.,
"I love the idea of being able to download the videos for offline viewing, but the app crashes when it loses connection!! Please fix. It is a great app to follow the courses while commuting on the train. :-)",
"When browsing, the category you select does not filter, still shows all the courses.",
Latest version is crashing often. One scenario is when the network disconnects during play back.,
"Like this app. Despite all the stuff tucked in here, works smoothly. Love the content.",
App crashes when trying to access offline videos without Internet connection,
"Can you add a function that lets people add upcoming courses onto a wish list or as a favourite, ideally with notifications closer to when they will commence? Thank you.",
Last patch seemed to fix viewing offline videos through the course listing now. Works a treat!,
Very convenient and easy to use. Very Clear videos. An excellent app.,
Otherwise i am Greatful it exists at all,
"Why i can't take the quizzes if i'm on signature track?! I have a keyboard and front facing camera in my phone/tablet.. Also, I love the Chromecast integration, thanks for that wonderful feature!",
The browse feature does not seem to work properly as it returns the same list of courses for all categories,
I love coursera and with the app I can learn whenever I like :),
"I download the app and I only see coming soon , coming soon course.",
And a brilliant platform all together.,
The application is not complicated,
Very nice design and user friendly,
Good for learning..,
"This application seems to be unfinished mostly because the weird implementation of things like tabs, I haven't understand why it doesn't have a swipe gesture to navigate through them. There's also a little detail when you open the navigation drawer and is that the 3 lines in the action bar doesn't move.",
"I really like this program. The courses are rigorous and effective. I would give it 5 stars if I could take quizzes and upload assignments in app. Also, it would be great if I could verify assignments with my tablet or phone's front camera. Little things to be sure, but would be nice.",
It has been working since I downloaded this app but it doesn't appear now please try to solve this as I need the app most of time.,
"Previous version was more stable and robust, the latest version has lots of bugs and crashes. The most annoying aspect is that I have to provide my login credentials every time I start the application. Can you provide a way to rollback to the previous version.",
Excellent app for education. But  frequently signing  out from log in. I hate this .,
"I really like this app but recently it started log out and after restart there have been lost all my downloads. Fix it up, please.",
You can't use the app without an internet connection.  It will log you out and when you finally get a connection it will force you to retype your credentials which is not fun on a small tablet.   I can't log in now for some unknown reason.,
The idea behind coursera is anonymous. But the app was big disappointment since it lacks lots of major essential features that are present in it's website.,
"Chromecast support was critical for me, and they brought it back. I use this app to watch lectures on my TV using Chromecast.  Its perfect.",
Update today seems to have corrected issues with my courses not showing up on app. Thank you !!,
Asks for but doesn't need contacts. Doesn't even try to explain permissions grab.,
"Handy for downloading and watching lecture videos, but doesn't really work offline or with a weak internet connection.",
You're making life better and learning easier for us... Thank you,
Really changing the way we learn things,
Great app but it would be nice if we could control where the video downloads are being saved (device storage vs SD card) since videos do take quite a bit of space!,
"It's a very nice App that help me keep track of my progress on the courses, get updates on them and download videos for offline watching.  I would like to suggest a single feature: - Add a configuration option to let the user (optionally) watch the videos with an external video player app (while keeping track of the course progress). Most people are used to their video players,  and some offer good features that help on watching the classes.",
Love being able to go offline for days and still exhaust my brain before the downloaded lectures run out. Auto content preload? Assignment and video lecture scheduling (one-a-day)? Flashcards/quizzes?,
Just started let's hope it goes well.thanks for the apotunity,
The app should have the discussion forum integrated with it.,
Great app which allows you to interact with online course at the touch of your fingers,
Can't download pdf and txt files. Why is that? Nice work on fixing previous issues.,
Courses will now load. Thanks,
New permissions added without explanation,
Love this app.. Just one question: how many times in a day is this app updated?? (LOL) keep doing the good work guys!,
It's a great knowledge sharing platform.,
Recent update seems to have fixed the bugs. My courses are showing up again.,
From coursera staff: try signout then signin. Works for me!,
So've it,
Thanks A lot,
Usefull,
"With the recent update, we need to login before watching videos. Why can't we watch lecture videos offline? What's the point of downloading videos to your phone then?",
Nexus 5,
"Can't see the courses, can't search...",
Why is the app not available in Colombia?,
It only works after cleaning data,
I'm not sure the issue people are having but clearing data and cache after an update fixes things for me.,
"Nexus 5, android lollipop.",
"Please please fix the logout problem with the latest version. Every time I close the app now I have to login again, which means I can't view offline lectures if i don't get a signal. With Nexus 4. Thanks! [Edit: And you've fixed it! That was very quick. Thank you so much!]",
It is still the best edu site. But this app is completely broken,
After updating to the latest version it doesn't list my course any more when I login.,
Systematic and variety of opportunity to make mobile a learning tool.. excellent app.. but cannot get into discussions.. wish that was possible using this app,
"there were several more updates, I auto-install them, but it doesn't help still.  Specifically, currently it allows browsing and searching courses, but doesn't show my courses (both current  and past, just blank page). Clearing data and logging in again didn't help.  On my other device, android phablet, I didn't update it for a while, and older version still works. So, if you have backup, you can use it.",
The application is awesome but after the latest update it does not load my courses.,
Good. But broken now. The 'My courses page doesnt load now. I.e doesnt show my courses',
After updating this app it has stopped working and shows error,
Really like this app. I can access all my courses and information as well as the videos. Great :-) :-),
Is not working :c I can't see my courses,
The app does not list my courses anymore,
Prefect app for life long learning,
"The app and it's functions are great, but when I log I, it doesn't show my courses anymore. Any way to fix this please!",
The app has much to improve:  Access to assignments through the app would be appreciated. alerting multiple times that there's no connection every time I open the app or perform any actions in it- even if I just want to watch downloaded videos offline is useless and quite  annoying.  Last update fixed logout bug - (re)added 2 stars.,
After this update not able to see my courses and also can't see the lecture videos.,
Devote 2-4h/w and you could learn many new things through their video tutorials.,
for questions that contain tables they are not displayed correctly. Usually just on one line You can't figure what the table is. For the eg the new data science course from uiuc,
I had the same problem with the spinning bar of death.  I logged out and back in and everything repopulated,
"Empty screen on my classes, can't watch video of current subscriptions",
"I would love to use this app, but none of the courses will load properly. All I get is a white screen that is continously loading. Looking at the reviews, I'm not the only one having this problem.",
"Amazing app, just need to fix some downloading issues",
I use all time on subway and commute and in gym.  Happy fixed logout issue which solved subway issue!,
"""My courses"" will not load. Nexus 5.",
Great when away from my pc,
Course page just spins infinitely.,
A very good app for learning.,
"The interface is friendly to use and easy to move through different courses. I like everything about the app except the part where I have to sign in to my account each time I open it. This problem has been recurring after the recent update. If this can be fixed, it'll be greatly appreciated.",
This is a great app. The only challenge now is I have to sign in every time I open the app. Which is kind off a worry to me. Fix that for 5 stars,
Used to be 4 stars...now it wants too many permissions.  Can't think of any good reason this should have access to my contacts list.,
I cant watch videos offline now as you now have to constantly log in and you need a network connection to do it... making offline viewing if courses impossible and the abolity to download course videos to watch offline redundant.,
But auto logs out on this version. Typing password a pain and can't watch downloaded videos offline,
"It sort of works, but has extremely poor functionality and a lot of bugs. A lot to be done.",
Every update broke something that worked before! I think most of us need this app to just watch videos offline and we can't!,
Would have given a 5 star if the app also include the forum feature,
Needed also a pin - to pin a course i  saw and like it to be pined for next time...,
"Really nice app, but the new glitch with needing to log in everytime you open the app is a big hassle.",
"Old version was better,. New version so painful, anytime I open this app, log in again..",
"2-More filtering features, 3-Push notifications",
"More courses, the rest is ok",
Great for offline viewing lectures and materials. Keep up the good work.,
If icon is more small. It will be prefect!,
"Don't play subtitles to Chromecast, don't save in external memory, navigation can be improved... It's a work in progress...",
Love the site. I'm sure the app is great,
I think learning for free with Coursera is a wonderful opportunity.,
Love the lectures. No complains.,
Links doesnt work.. App is good..can b better,
Why does it require me to login everytime? It used to retain my login session..,
The best one!,
This new update prompt me for my login details every single time I close the app.,
–ü—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —É–∂–∞—Å–Ω–æ —Ç–æ—Ä–º–æ–∑–∏—Ç –∏ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ –≤—ã–ª–µ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç,
Fantastic way to learn on the run,
"After the previous update, every time I reopen the app after using it, it asks me to log in again. Fix it, it used to be okay before.",
El mejor MOOC,
Nice app,
Login each time?,
Yes! yes!,
You can better yourself everyday for free. One should never stop learning and with Coursera it's possible for you to obtain more knowledge to become a better you.,
"Mostly good, but videos cannot be sped up (unlike watching web version on desktop). Biggest problem: It autostarts and uses RAM, which is the unforgivable sin for apps.",
After watching 1 video full. I pressed back button and I was in course list page but automatically other video was started were I left. After doing force stop from setting the vidoe/app was stopped.,
"It is an amazing Web. Because it intoduces a collection of  high ranked universities from U.S. and I think from other countries.  Also it gives a lot of courses from many fields. So, it is a good app for  serious people who like to learn new skills and a new knowledge.",
Thank you coursera team for making this wonderful app! Your goal to help people get free education is remarkable and this app is definitely doing that well.,
I get to take so many amazing courses and most of them are fun. Surely beats actually going to universities,
Everyday is a learning day. So everybody download this app and apply it to your everyday routine. Enjoy learning Godbless us all.,
Opens the door to online learning from the World's top Universities,
"I love that I have the opportunity to go to a class without bring in one, with it being right on my phone. Great app. Great schools.  Great opportunity to expand your mind!!!",
moto x 2014 with 5.0,
"Great, however I'd like to see the ability to ask questions per video like on the website",
New update is wholesome as it brings in the quizzes to mobile-OS.,
Would be much better if contains all the features of the website.,
Doesn't work. Doesn't load any of my courses,
"Great way to learn new stuff, and its free.",
"This is a wonderful idea, and preforms it's job perfectly.",
This app is amazing!,
Awesome!! Great app and love what you guys do.Maybe access to forums would be something to look into?,
Fantastic for learning and useful knowledge.,
"Watch out, this app wants to eat your contacts!!!",
Wh00p wh00p chromecast is back :),
Your site version is much faster and easier than app!! But still i love it!!!!:) the best!!!!!!!,
Excellent concept and execution.,
Very beneficial app,
Great supporting app,
"I can not view any courses after logging in to my account under my Coursera app. Even i can not find  support customer service to contact to resolve problem. I hope after looking at this review, someone should respond. Please look at reviews and respond and solve problem.",
"I really need the following functions:   First one is the multi-window support. I prefer to watch videos in a train and I need to do some notes during that (because it's not a movie, it's a learning process), it's really annoing to switch beetween 2 applications all  the time, because Coursera doesn't support multi-window mode. Another way - to watch videos in a browser, but then this application is useless... (for me).  And the second one, not so critical, but it'd be great: the possibility to download not only videos, but also slides and so on.",
"Even after successful login,  it keep saying sign up or login.  Unable to access ""my courses"" please fix asap",
"Just an idea and implementation are already very good. Thank you. I find missing: 1) more filtering options (language, dates, duration, more detailed categories or tags); 2) playback speed control (some of the lecturers speak so slow that I hardly manage to stay awake, could easily play at 130% of speed at least without losing a point), 3) wishlist or other bookmarking system.",
"'Was wondering what I'll be doing after graduation, this app just came with the perfect answer! Very good for those who can't stop seeking knowledge.  Hoping for more courses and they should make it possible to access all other features like forum, colleagues etc without getting to the desktop site. ...was glad for the app but it takes quite long to load and so, it's kinda boring!!!",
Coursera really lived up to my expectations. It's awesome and recommend every student to install it.,
"It is doing what it has to do. Firstly I had problems with architecture of the app and activites tree (there is a ""main"" screen with my courses, which is parent of all activities (""pages"") - what is a bit confusing)",
"Terrific courses offered. Something for everyone. Most require no previous knowledge. You can do as little or as much as you like. Even with advanced degrees, I find the courses interesting and challenging!! I hope some day they can offer a Degree Program. They have the courses.",
"Until Friday this app worked across the listed devices on the following providers:  Century Link WIFI, Verizon Wireless,  and AT &T wireless.  At approximate 9:01 pm, PST,  Friday, 30 January 2015, classes ceased to download and stream.  Text copies of the captions stopped downloading successfully.  The default Android browser which used to stream and download lost its support and  chrome and Chrome Beta are not working with video and text streaming and download.  Quizzes are not accessible.",
"Completely Useless. When trying to play a video, all I see is the title of the video across the top of the screen, below which is nothing but blank white. It doesn't matter which video I attempt to play.",
I like this app and it is helpful in pursuing the course anytime anywhere. But it access through the browsers sometimes and asks for the login details again that sounds weird.,
Please introduce option to download videos for On-Demand courses. Choice for video quality will be also useful.,
"Not giving 5 * as on downloading content for offline study, its consuming phones internal memory where as it would be best if it saves it on external memory.",
"i like the app a lot. however, i cnt open it for several days. i hope that u fix the bug immediately. i missing my lessons. :(",
Will be much better if video player would has lock function or background options like mp3 player. Needs when you bicycling or running.,
It's a good app to a great website but it lacks the speed option on the videos that I think is a must to have.,
Its an ok app. Why I can't access my courses via my google account. It will be good if I can do it.,
Awesome free app. Not the greatest course selection but can't complain since it's free,
"Now I'm not able to see the My Courses page, which was working before",
Good vehicle for learn something new on mobile but not good for those who take Signature track course.. .(Chris),
"The app is great, but after a while it stopped showing my courses. It launches,  I can access downloaded materials, can search and browse, but I can't see my current courses and so can't get to materials that I didn't download. Please fix it, please! I don't have enough time to study at my desk on laptop.",
Please add support for more than 1x playback. Also it would be nice if the app reopened to my last course.,
"It does some things great - like let you easily watch the lecture videos, but other things just don't work.  For example, I'm on week 2 of a course, but it is only displaying the material for week 1.",
"Excellent resource although limited in some faculties. Could do with a ""bookmark function"",  to bookmark courses one intends to do in future.",
"I've lost all the answers twice to the test I'm taking and it's frustrating. The app just does not work properly. I'll have to retake the test on the web page. For me, the app is useless.",
"Very detailed app. Easy to download files. Only thing lacking is the ability to add courses to 'Wishlist' or look out for 'Future Sessions' of a particular course. Also, add option of sorting the courses while browsing. Please fix the issue.",
"Hi devs, there's this bug that whenever I play offline videos, with subtitles enabled, a white overlay covers the video. Even with the subtitles disabled when the player bar is being shown i.e. by touching the screen, the overlay happens again. My device is galaxy note 3 android 4.3!",
"Not only a great way of accessing this resource, but very quick recognition of an issue, response (unexpected, thank you!) and resolution.",
I wish the app could save appdata on ext SD....it becomes a huge problem for phones with low internal memory,
I really enjoy Coursera and the quality of this App. It helps you keep going your courses when your are not at home.,
"Great app giving huge opportunities! I only regret ability to speed up videos, that is already present in IOS version. Please, please, add it!!!",
Not every course is available on this app. There  is also  no  playback  speed  control  like  in the  website. Lots of usability problems.,
"This idea is still in its infancy, but Coursera has definitely got it moving in the right direction.  In due time I think the paid verifications could start to gain clout from a r√©sum√© perspective and could put higher education in the hands of anyone with the will to learn.  The app itself works great and facilitates one of the world's best ideas.",
Its working perfectly fine now. I just have to reinstall it. Great learning app and I enjoy using it. Got tons of useful courses. Would recommend it to my friends. Giving it a five star !,
"This app has the same knowledge that you can find for free online. If you cannot find what you need, ask me on Twitter @piggybear1987 I will be glad to help you find something Free to replace this paid bull crap.",
"At risk of sounding egocentric, it seems that the app is being updated around the on demand courses that I'm taking, so I can take the quizzes without using the web browser! Whatever the case is, thanks guys üòÄ",
"Now i can feel, I'm living in the new century. Free education and reachable. Very well done üòäüëç",
"It used to be a great thing,  but does not work any more",
I liked it very much~ how we can learn from the top Universities in the world,
"I'm unable to play videos, on my lg L7 dual, plz fix it. .",
"On my Lg G2, cannot even log in. Does not let me hit the log in button.  Broken...",
"Great app! Nice design and works well. A few important features missing: 1. Browse and comment in forums, 2. Download lecture slides 3. Speed up video lectures playback. Thanks!",
I've been a fan of this since it was released there you can find lots of educational content,
It would be nice if it could set reminders for assignments etc. wishlists would be awesome too!!,
Now can I login using my google account¬ø getting closer!,
Thank you Coursera Team for the hard work.,
Grt app..but some time facing prblm while  downloading  videos,
Chromecast support returned!  Enjoying watching classes on big screen.,
So much for free time!,
It worked with Chromecast for a while. I suspect support for device was removed after update. Reintroduced then dropped again. Why oh why?,
Can't change video playing speed!,
Quit removing past courses!,
But not on the app . Videos isn't working .,
I love Coursera. Great app. High quality course content. Top notch.,
It showing me subtitles of different  course for different course video,
With Cromecast support back it is again a great app,
I cannot watch my courses. It doesn't load anything.,
Would like to see more self-paced courses,
"Sir , can u tell me how to do assignments on the app",
Very good for who looking for learn any time in life!,
It's free knowledge can't beat that.,
"For the new update, if the 'my courses' section seems to load forever, go to your phone's setting, then 'app' (android), then coursera. Clear the cache. Your courses should be able to load. Warning....you will lose all previously downloaded videos. The interface for this update is sleek by the way",
"Good, but sound during videos is too low",
Inexpensive high quality on-line learning.,
Great app. Love the flexibility and convenience.,
I love it and recomend this app.. wow,
"Can watch lectures, but that's about it",
We can learn everywhere,
Thanks for making chromecast support work again!,
I love it! Do you have plans to support video streaming to a Chromecast enable device?,
Please add an option to limit downloads over WiFi only,
need to add pop-up quiz inside lectures,
I have always loved it.,
Better than edx,
Absolutely wow!!!,
Best app ever!!!,
Great App!,
Great app!,
"Simple ,Clean and Effective",
How to download course videos please help,

Good App,
Amazing,
Brilliant,
Cant sign in,
Lov,
"Whenever I try to join any courses , it showss ""a retrofit error"" . Please take note of this bug and find a solution.",
I cant see my courses after update. Also on-demand courses don't open. Always loading but nothing happen.,
It utterly astounds me when I think about the immense amount of knowledge available for free through this app. Keep up the good work.,
Big thanks to Coursera team for all the knowledge it gives us ! Great app,
App is good ....but what is default location for storing the downloaded videos ....my course videos consumes app storage ..but default storage is external SD card.....               Update: problem solved,
"Great courses, not the clearest app",
"The app has sync problems and video pause and play problems. Also, there are very frequent updates",
"The unenroll process in the app does not work properly. It gives me an error when unenrolling. I logged on to my computer and I am not in the class, but still getting emails and, the class continues to show up in the app. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app to no avail.  Please fix.",
"Edit: Chromecast is back, and so is my daily use of the app! ////   The app was near perfect, but when you removed Chromecast support it ceased to be useful to me. Won't really have a use for the app until it is implemented again. Listen to your customers, and don't regress on a key feature. Old rating: 2 stars.",
"Have problem with the video in my tablet Samsung GT 5112. If the video is paused for quite a long time, half a minute at least, than   the video does not  unpause, the error appears, so I've to start the video againe",
It would be helpful if classes could be displayed one of two ways - alphabetically or starting date.,
I cannot see the video in course Functional Programming Principles in Scala,
Awesome! Helps a lot to carry videos offline.,
Thank you for helping me in building my skill sets everyday...with lots of love and respect....,
Needs chrome cast.,
Nice App...,
interested & inteligent,
Cool,
Gut,
Unable to search or view my courses.  I have videos downloaded but the courses do not show.  Used to work great,
"Almost everything about the app is fine, but Search on the other hand doesn't work. I can't search for the classes I'm looking for.",
"It's really good to have an app like this. However, I would really like the app to have the discussion forums integrated into it. That would be an awesome enhancement to the app.",
I turned on subtitle of the program and found out that it appeared on my phone instead on my tv. Not sure how i could watch day video on tv and read the subtitle on my phone at the same time.,
Thanks for your efforts in making a nice app to help us all. Would appreciate if you add a feature of exporting the downloaded videos so that we can copy them on a laptop as well,
"The search feature doesn't work, so can't find what I'm looking for.",
Thank you for bringing back chromecast support.,
A very good programme learning,
Really useful! Loved!,
There is no option for downloading videos. Please fix it. Thanks!,
Much awaited app on Android,
Great application,
Great,
Can't login,
"Installed the app on my samsung tablet without any problems.  Logged in, got access to my courses and watched some videos. App then crashed and it never worked again. Tried re-installing but made no difference, can't see anything on it now.",
"Nicely done; everything I need, even the possibility of downloading lectures from courses taken long time ago. This app is even better than taking courses over a desktop or laptop...",
"Cannot change video player speed (x1.5, x2...) although it is mentioned as a feature in the courses, and it is available on the web. Please fix this.",
An example of M-education. Good way of imparting knowledge.,
Thank you for the chromecast support. Please add more native quizzes.,
"Couldn't sign in, so it was worthless to me, unfortunately.",
"Finally, a proper Coursera app!",
Coursera is ofcourse d best1,
education for life time.,
Learn so much with this app,
Knowledge in the pocket... Everywhere you go... Easy :),
Just love this app.,
With the latest update it constantly asks me to sign in and each time I do so it says I have no enrolled courses which is not true.,
Excellent app and course,
Convenient,
Nice idea and app,
¬°Qu√© gran noticia esta! Esto s√≥lo lo permite el avance tecnol√≥gico y disposici√≥n y buena voluntad de las universidades. Gracias. J.P. Torres.,
Trying to submit for a class and got a retrofit error,
I'm really missing opportunity to play faster movie. For some courses it's fine to have 1.5x faster because presenter is speaking really slowly.,
Never used coursera before because I do not like to watch videos on my computer. Chromecast support completely changes that. Will tune you every evening.,
You can become a better professional by taking one of the many free courses! Awesome!! Thank you so much!!!,
This is a very helpful app that allows me to stream the video to chromecast. Nice job guys!,
This new update doesn't work for me. My courses can't open. Loads endlessly. Plz fix.,
Best way for measuring your self...,
I'm taking the bethovan sonata course and it works well.,
Excellent learning source,
Perfect for the insatiable learner!,
Can't play the video.,
Encouragement and incredible,
Good,
"*only Course General Page*   Sorry for being negative, because I really appreciate Coursera, as a service. But this App is flawed, in my experience. I am using a Nexus 5 with Android version 5.01(Lollipop).   Usually, the content does not fit the screen at all, in scale. and the Videos do not play, tried both html5 and flash (note that the videos do play when using the Chrome web-browser, on the same device.) Also, there is quite a lot of overlapping text occurring.   I hope this gets better in time.",
"New version is disaster. I lost all my courses, and search is not working .",
"The login is not remembered, which is ultra annoying when coupled with a crashing app.",
On web you can speed up or slow down the video. Why is this impossible in the app?,
For learning new concepts,
Very good,
Introduction  to  Marketing,
Best interface,
Awesome site,
"Why would this app need the permission to start at boot time, read my contacts, draw over other apps or even access the camera?",
"The app is great for catching class on the run, but returning the option to view on the big screen is an excellent return to form.",
Please add support for immersive mode full screen video for devices that use software buttons rather than physical ones.,
very convenient,
Uninstalling until you fix it.,
Prior knowledge needed not mentioned,
Liked the Chromecast support!!,
Loved support for chromecast,
"Buggy as hell. Best one is when you hit Logout and it says ""you must log in to access this feature"" (login doesn't work btw). Needs a LOT of work before it's anywhere near usable. Maybe they should take their own course on android programming. If they can access it.",
It is ok but quite slow. Another problem I found is video. The videos are not shown whereas voices of the professors are heard. And there is no any type of button to change codecs.,
Glad they added Chromecast support. The only issue is that some of the assignments can't be done in the app and require a PC. Fix this and I'll give it a 5. Offline video viewing is also very helpful.,
The app is not fully optimised for Android Lollipop.  It crashes frequently and shows ANR dialogue. Please fix it.,
I would use this app more if it worked properly. Every time I try to enroll into a class there is some error code. I have not been able to use the app at all. The website is awesome tho...,
I wish it would let me access the downloaded videos folder so I can save the videos on another devices. Sometimes people don't have enough storage or would like to review the video material.,
Improve search features wish advance search options. 2. In app course material reading including pdf files. 3. Integration with cloud for opening excel docs et al should help.,
"I love coursera because I can check out classes and career fields I other wise would have avoided because college is expensive!  The layout has yet to be beaten by any other app of its kind in my opinion, very reliable too!",
It should give notifications before the assignments and when the new videos are available. iPhone like Signature track verification is also badly needed!,
Error is found in after doing the exercises I cannot return to the lecture list. There is no any link.,
"Awesome app, but lacks playback controls. Would love it if the app allowed me to increase the play speed for slow lectures.",
"Would be nice to be able to change playback speed, especially when quickly reviewing content.",
I really liked it. Nice interface and very reliable.,
Auto restarts hundred times a day,
Such a great app.,
Finally Chromecast is back!,
Please bring back Chromecast support.,
Very user friendly app!,
Loved it !,
Wonderful learning resource,
Chromecasting is working again.,
Great app,
Chromecast is back! Yay!,
The app seems to work ok online. I used option to download/cache the videos to my device so I could use it on the subway where I don't have an internet connection. The app demands an internet connection to even go into the section to watch the videos I saved. Major app FAIL since it cannot be used offline for practical purposes with no internet. I'll have to go to the web site and get videos manually.,
"I really like coursera, but the app lacks some major features which the web version has: more control over video. First, the app version does not have in-video quizzes; second, there is no way to make the video faster or slower.",
"Pity, but Coursera ends unexpectedly on MediaPad when opening any of my courses, or trying to open course description from the catalogue",
"This app allows me easy access to my courses, but there are some issues.  The links within the app do not seem to work.  If not for that, I'd give it a 5.",
"Well, great app to catch up on the lectures, but I still feel the need to go back to PC to do some serious reading or attempt the quiz.",
I still encountered some problem espescially with 3g connection,
Everyone should have this app.we can learn alot in many fields,
"The more knowledge you share the more it grows! This is a brilliant way of not limiting education in four walls, but reaching our to millions of yearning students! Kudos!",
Coursera is amazing! I've already taken a few courses on it. A great app for inquiring minds!,
"I am able to log in using my mail ID and password, when I am using coursera from my laptop, but not able to log in using the android App on my HTC one M7.",
Miss playback speed setting. Sometimes screen can be turned off only to listen to the video. Would really like an option to download videos to SD card (my phone memory is quite small).,
It started off okay then it crashed and wouLD not start again,
"Wow what a Great App. This App is so Full of Vital Information for Millions of Everday People to Business,  and Company's definitely a 5 Star App. This is what makes the Google Play Store so Valuable to Everyone.  Fantastic App. Timothy Cline Union City Indiana.",
"Continuously get a network error,  unable to join any class",
Thanks for adding option to move to SD card. It would have been better if you could have name the video files appropriately and categorised them to appropriate folders.,
Can u add forgot password link in login page. Tks,
I already took a class on coursera and it was a great experience. Taking my next class this March. Great app.,
Coursera is wonderful but lack of saving videos to sd card is really a bug problem. Videos need really big space.,
Why remove Chromecast? Bizarre. I've stopped using this app as its just no longer convenient.,
"Need support: the level of volume is small, no avatar and the color of subtitles.",
It's not convenient to use anymore.  What an unfortunate usability hapering decision.,
"Previous version was good. In new version, Chromecast option was removed.  Please add that feature back.",
It's  Amazing! It just lacks some classes that I want to attend to,
Please fix,
"Love the app, and I love coursera. Keep up the good work",
Sometimes able to cause hard reboot... Not sure how that is possible.,
Only reason I've ever used the app was to cast it to the chromecast.,
It is the best learning app i have ever used,
This is one of the coolest things in education right now!,
If you let me acess discussion forum through app i will give 5 stars,
Can't set the speed of the videos,
Very nice app for learning.,
Everyone must have this,
Needs Chromecast support,
Great courses always in your hand!!!,
Feature regression is not good,
Finally a great place to learn more and more,
Thxs for subs :),
awsome app!,
Great place to learn.,
This is awesome !!,
Invaluable!,
Knowledge is every thing,
How do I recover my password?,
I love this app,
Very good assistant,
I love it,
Nice medium,
"I really like coursera and its offerings; I've taken several courses. I've tried using the app a few times and each time I've gotten too impatient and switched to the website so I could speed up playback, which allows me to greatly speed up learning and keeps me at better attention. Please integrate this feature.",
"The first business I searched for, the app gives me a bunch of locations, miles away, elsewhere.  Yet it doesn't include the location 5 minutes from me.  The second business I searched for, is no longer open, yet the app shows it open, complete w/address & phone#.  Because I know my area, it's no problem. For someone new in town, this could be very aggravating.  Going back to using Google search.  Uninstalling.",
Please work on the download. It's difficult to download from mobile. I have to use my pc before I can download.,
"Everything about this app makes is much easier to learn without the extensive paperwork or required work. And the new Chromecast feature just nails it for me! The only thing missing, is obviously SD card support. EDIT: No longer works on my tablet, my course won't load, searches are always empty, and crashes all the time now, worthless now. AND no more Chromecast!? This is pathetic.",
"Within a course, ordering and organization from the website is lost, so you get a mixed up list of entries. The course intro page isn't even displayed.",
I'm really happy for join this course. This app help me so much to learn more things. Thanks coursera,
Unable to find lectures for the course I have registered. Its just showing the introduction video of the course.,
"It helps me a lot make my dream come true learning from distance in a great school world wide , thanks coursera",
"I would like to have a more functional offline mode, be able to launch the app, and better quizzes management when the app lost connection,... Otherwise it's very helpful to have this app.",
"Installed coursera 2 weeks ago but haven't used it or created the required sign in. Yet my phone tells me that this app is in the top 3 to 5 of mobile data usage, using more than Facebook. Care to explain? Meanwhile, uninstalling.",
"Can't view or do the ""do at your own pace"" courses. This app still needs developing.",
"Not able to join any course through the app - get network connection error even though the internet is working properly. Also, the app speed is very slow.",
It would be better if I could watch courses that have no openings yet.,
This is awesome software and I would recommend it too any child or adult in pursuit of higher education.,
I really apriciate a service like this with broad topics and choices. Thank you for the good work.,
"Coursera is by far the best self learning tool anyone can need. Very broad selection of courses, very good teachers, different perspectives from teachers all around US and Europe. And it's chromecast compatibility, makes it the perfect tool.",
The app doesn't have forums which is highly disappointing. Further in video questions are also missing.,
Can't join any of the courses via the app. It's really only useful for searching.,
The videos don't work which video player should i have? To be aware my cell phone is samsung galaxy star plus,
I wish EdX follows Coursera and launches its Android app.,
The website is definitely better.,
Crashes constantly after the update !,
The content provided is no less than the web application,
I use their website more. The app I use on emergency occasions.,
My downloads needs to be organized by course. Offline needs improvement.,
I found love: Philosophy and the Sciences by University or Edinburgh. Sweet.,
This is the best online educational app. Absolutely brilliant,
Tremendous stuff from top universities...,
Video can't be stored on external storage... Basically makes app useless...,
"Clean, neat, crisp and clear. Great job. Highly recommend.",
"It used to show up, now it doesn't.",
Without Chromecast there's no advantage over the website.,
Need a speed-up button!,
It is unfortunate if Coursera no longer works with Chromecast.,
Waited for ever for the official app!! Yes. It's going to be soo helpful! :),
No option for preview course material. Please add this option.,
The app is very slow..to use..,
Great resources for information.,
On line  short  course. ..,
Why can't we download old courses?,
No more Chromecast support?!,
Amazing way of learning,
Great learning source,
Very buggy.,
Innovative,
Thanks,
Yak,
"can't verify assignment, keeps force closing on quizzes",
An excellent platform for self development,
Very unstable,
Why download videos to some remote place that cannot be accessed without root and renaming those files to make it worse. I don't believe you guys have problem with people saving those videos as per there needs.Change it if possible... Uninstalling...for now....,
"The app doesn't do much, it's too basic and lacking in features compared to the web version. Also it would be nice to have Google sign up as I always forget the password for these things, I can't remember login details for each and every service I use. It's not 2004 anymore, this problem has a solution.",
It simply does not work. A mess. There was a coursera companion app which was awesome. I think they should have killed it by a law suit or something as that one is not working either and is not available in play store anymore. I hope they know what they are doing.,
"When I search for a course, it says no result, then kicks me out of the app because ""Coursera has stopped working"". Please fix this.",
"If you're taking Coursera courses, this app allows you to listen to video lectures and even take exams regardless of your physical location. Unfortunately, the app crashes a lot on my Nexus 5...",
"However, I miss the ability to run videos at faster speeds which the video player in the browser can do.",
Really like this application. But it's missing or lacks access to the discussion forums which are significant part to the online learning experience.,
At home I would love to be able to stream lectures to my Chromecast connected video setup.,
"Lets you download video lectures, but doesn't work offline. Not as featurefull as the old 3rd party apps. Particularly missing are the ability to access downloaded videos, and continue playing audio while the screen is off.",
The update took away the only useful feature which is chrome cast. Useless pos now.,
Learning became easier than I could imagine. Anytime and anywhere I can watch my courses on my handset. Thank you so much.,
"Hi coursera, would youn mind to give us an option to choose where to save directory, my internal memory could not save enough, so i want to add it in external memory without do any rooting things",
"Getting some ""retrofit"" error when doing almost anything.",
I cannot play the videos on Chromecast anymore :( Nexus 4 Android 5.0 here,
"I love being able to travel and watch my videos, but you cannot access the class section screen, even to watch videos, when offline. You only get a linear list of ALL videos from ALL classes in a single list. Please keep improving offline support!",
"It's a pity that there's no more chromecast support.  And the ""on demand"" classes don't seem available. Other than that great app",
Cousera is an awesome website but the app is not good enough e.g. every time when I restart the app I have to watch it from the start but not where I've watched last time.,
"Great app, but there are a number of features missing from the web app. Playback speed adjustment would be really nice!",
"Video doesn't load on app(even with 3g connection),and even after downloading,video is taking 1-2 mins to play.",
Can you please add ability to speed up and slow down rate of video feeds? Do that and I'll give 5 stars.,
Latest android version is getting better.   It still really needs the variable playback rate available.,
"No chromecast support,  can't register for classes,  can't see classes I am in. Please fix it asap.",
A fairly useless and redundant  app with out Chromecast support.,
Pretty pointless if video won't play.,
"A very good app for learners, with smooth flow between your past and present courses.",
"There are bugs every now and again in the app, but Coursera's people update regularly.  Wonderful program that keeps getting better!",
"After one week of not using it I checked what programs were using the most data. I was shocked to see it at the TOP of the list, having 111MB of my data and I'm not even enrolled in any Courses currently!!!",
Can't enter the tests. The pages of tests are empty,
Wish if we could complete the courses offline:-),
It says it is unable to play videos... Also there is no option to download the videos to sd card...,
Chromecast is one of the best features of this app .... Please chk this issue,
"The all caps are because I absolutely love everything about the app, but need the chromecast integration really badly. Help!",
Its the era of practicing new learning and much diversified education.,
"Works really well, downloads content for offline viewing. Loved it!",
I have learned a lot from courses since last year.,
It will be better if there is an option to save videos to SD card.,
"Guys great app... Just fix the certification option for signature track, when I press ""verify"" the app crashes...?!",
thanks for making this handy-app.. it helps me to finish my 3'rd week quiz.. but I can't verify my submission (I'm on signature track). always crashes. please fix this issue.. thanks,
"I was having issues seeing some lectures on my phone, so I went and got a Chromecast dongle just for this. Now I see there's no support the first time I got a chance to try it?  Wow. Uninstalling with extreme prejudice.",
Please give different speed settings for videos like in website,
Great app Plz include one click full course download option,
Please add this option to help keep big data amounts and a few courses.,
Bring back chromecast support!,
"Can't enroll in classes for some reason, it errors out on me. Also can't view previously taken classes for some reason. Also, Chromecast support is dead? Why?",
"Finally , in this world , we have some people who are caring bout others ! :') I'm very proud . Thanks",
What's the point of having the apps if I can't watch the videos,
Amazing stuff guys...keep it up,
"Things have been fixed, fast, THANKXXXX",
Watch videos? Check. Answer quizzes and other homework/evaluation? Not yet. It would be great if it were possible.,
Great way to learn!,
Amazing highly professional educational platform,
Coursera is on the list of supported apps for chromecast but I don't see the option to cast.,
I can learn whatever I love.,
Does the job. I used to like Coursera Companion more before it ceised to exist.,
Easy and convenient to use. Please include the slides.,
Still at the level of watching videos,
Please fix chrome at support in latest version. It's the entire reason I use the app.,
Best courses here.,
All this free info? You can do whatever you want in life.,
Has been a use full tool,
Please add this app in windows store,
Awesome!,
Works well,
Most useful app,
isn't it working with Chromecast?,
Loved it..,
ugly,
Publish a lite version of this app,
Add courses for auto cad,
Why did they removed  Chromecast  support in latest version... without it app is only ok... chromecast is must have feature for such kind of app.,
Just good,
Useful,
Love it,
good,
Chromecast missing,
University on the go,
Thanx,
"O programa eh bom, mas de vez em quando trava no meu celular. Toda vez na hora de reabrir ele encerra e tenho que abrir novamente. De qualquer forma, o material do Coursera eh otimo.",
"I am really disappointed of missing chromecast. It is really essential for me and I see that this is the same for many users. I will really appreciate if you restore it. I would like it even in a beta mode without guarantee for smooth play. If it is not possible because of your policy I would be glad to install the old version of the application, if it is possible, because chromecast casting mostly made me to use this application. However I will give 3 stars because I like Coursera as well as your mobile support. The last 2 stars I keep for the chromecast feature.",
"Why can't I download ""on-demand"" lectures from the app; why does the app insist on an online check with poor reception, blocking access to my already downloaded material; why can't I resume a video from where I left off. Always have to start over",
"I never had a complaint about this app. But after the last update, it appears to be a lot faster that usual. That great. Thanks Coursera!",
I downloaded video lectures but unable to see videos..only able to hear voice..highly disappointed.,
A great way to learn. Access to what was previously unavailable without spending time and money.,
"It just needs ability to bookmark upcoming courses. And maybe notifications. I agree that connection with Chromecast could be very useful. Anyway, good one! üòä",
I cannot play the videos on my Sony xperia j.Someone help me!,
My registered courses are not shown on the My Courses section of the app. Pretty frustrating.,
Wish there was a way to alert when upcoming classes you are interested in are open for enrollment.,
Five stars for previous versions but I am missing Chromecast support in the latest update too.,
"I can't view my current or past courses. The app used to work, but not anymore.",
Please enable roku streaming on this! It's just like chromecast but I heard it's even better!,
The one thing that would be helpful would be to be able to save or move downloaded content to the external SD card as space is now running low and I generally need to watch the video content on the way to and from work.,
Thanks for helping me in studying and researching,
A great way to learn.  Thanks Coursera :D,
Great app but the new update seems to have lost Chromecast! Please bring it back.,
Easy way to learn something new,
Need the capacity to access course dashboard,
The app is most useful with Chromecast.,
excellent app to study my courses on-the-go!,
Great study companion on the go.,
Great update! Keep doing it!,
Enable it and I'll participate again.,
"Please re-enable the chromecast supoort, it's  vital for a whole lot of people. Thanks.",
where is the forgot password option!!,
It shouldn't have option to leave course,
After the latest update videos won't play anymore,
Nice app,
Helps me a lot,
Extremely helpful,
Nice,
Great app but I wish I could be able to Access my signature track & do my assessments through this app,
"missing 1 star for lack of SD support, another star for other options (integration with calendar, chromecast, access forum etc)",
"While watching the lesson, we can't do the quizzes.",
Perfect functionality. Although crashes sometimes.,
Altre App non ufficiali offrono diverse opzioni che al momento non sono supportate nella versione ufficiale,
No Chromecast support after last uptade. Hope you fix it soon.,
"Not sure what updates have gone in. When I launch the app, the landing page is blank",
A must have app,
"I loved using Coursera with the Coursera Companion app, which had so many more features than this one, but since the official app was released for Android, the developer withdrew Companion, and I'm left lamenting the loss of access to forums and peer assessment, the ability to save lectures to a chosen location and the deadlines automatically appearing in my calendar.  What this app does, it does fairly well, but by comparison, it's lacking.",
Its a good app. I don't know about other phones but I'm unable to move it to SD card. If that is solved then 5 star.,
"Love it, use it extensively. Would like to see video speed control (1.25x, 1.5x), download of lecture presentations, only voice lecture",
"Until latest update there was chromecast support and that was neat and useful and working great.  Now,  it appears to be gone.  I hope it is a temporary error and will be added back soon. With chromecast it's 5*. Without,  not so much.",
This app is a must to enhance your knowledge. Offline viewing is really awesome feature.,
Too tired of data collection for sale to who knows who. Buhbye.,
"Like the others, wondering where Chromecast support went.",
Can download videos and watch it on the bus/train. THANK YOU,
Great app but needs to bring back Chromecast,
Please bring back Chromecast!,
There is no more chromecast support after the latest update.,
Without Chromecast support this app is an instant uninstall.,
Where's Chromecast?!,
Why does this app need to take pictures and capture video?,
Loving it,
Logging requests,
"This is far beyond basic. You will not be able to view nor do a quiz, can't view nor complete assignments, can't participate in the forums. If you're doing it just to watch videos and nothing more then it's perfect for you. But anything extra you will have to leave your phone and get to a computer.",
"1) Downloads page doesn't categorize videos by course. How can I identify the introduction video of course A from introduction video of course B? Also 2)  Old already-answered in-video quizzes keep popping up for no reason at random times (android 4.4.2, Coursera 1.2.2 (879) and Galaxy note 8 inch GTN 5100) Finally 3) There should be a feedback page.",
"I love the concept and the selection of courses on offer. Though, there are major functionality issues for my lg optimus l5. I cannot load any videos, download or stream, and i cannot solve the problems because the drop down boxes i select just stay selected and not display any information. Fix these problems and i will give the app a 5 rating with an outstanding review.",
"This program makes a good start to enable schooling on the android 
platform. The most irritating isue I have found is that i cannot download 
code from my current course ""Creative programming for digital media and 
mobile apps"" so I have to go to the webpage to get all my stuff. As others 
have mentioned, you should be able to write to sd card. A built in calendar 
would be nice.",
"The app is quite prone to crashing on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. It isn't a fan of multitasking, so when I watch one video, switch to Google Now/a browser to search for something, then come back to the video, the app likes to take pause.  On the positive side, it is possible to download lectures for offline viewing.  On the down side, when accessing quizzes, it is simply the website stuck into the app into a subpar web browser, not optimised for devices other than desktop. There is also no access to the discussion forums. The video player could also be improved, adding features such as change playback speed, and remembering where the video was last stopped, then resuming in the same spot.  As for CourseRA - love it, love all the courses and material that has been made available. The app itself needs a little work.",
"There are a great many courses that are coming soon, I would like to have some way to be either push notifications or email informed when they are starting or able to be enrolled in.  A slight modification that would make a great app much better.",
In phone with limited internal memory we cannot download more videos for offline viewing. When videos are downloaded it fills up my phone internal memory which is 2 gb. I could not find anyway to move this data to sd card or usb storage.,
"I've already taken several quizzes and I have never been successful in submitting it through the app! I ended up redoing all the questions and submitting it using my laptop. Also, please include the forums in the app version. Notwithstanding these glitches, I really love Coursera. Downloading the lectures through the app saves me a lot of time. It just consumes a lot of my phone memory though so I have to delete other videos as soon as I finished watching them.",
"No app2sd support, no ability to change downloads directory, not even to find download files by any file manager.  Ps. I have android 4.4; changing downloads directory is impractical without root.",
"It's very handy having this app available so that I can watch my course videos on the bus.  The only drawback is not having the review questions in the videos like on the website, but other than that, this app is very convenient.",
"Crashes virtually everytime I run the app; get a text partway through a video - CRASH! Look something up online - CRASH!! So many videos also don't play, which can result in cumulative disadvantages once you reach the questions stage; even those that do work (with WiFi) DO NOT work without WiFi, even if you download them specifically for offline viewing. Despite these manifold flaws, and others still, it is a beautifully conceived of app and I am proud to be addicted to it.",
"The video player crashes every time it goes into background, and it doesn't remember my place or rewind properly. I can't view lab details or instructions or access the forums. I like that I can download videos for offline viewing and as long as I'm online I can take quizzes and read the class descriptions. Still needs work. What happened to coursera on the go?",
This is very basic.  The in video game quiz feature doesn't work.  There are no video display (example: speed) options.  Coursera should open the source to this and some student in one of their courses would make this reasonable in days.,
App works good but it would be nice if they add the option to change the viewing speed of the video lectures. Another thing I hope they add is the option to shut off the screen and still be able to hear the videos.,
"Sorry to look a gift horse in the mouth, but 0.) the schedule is a little buried in under 'Course pages', 1.) one should be able to jump from content listed in the schedule to that content, 2.) the video player should retain, a bookmark to the last video content viewed and, and 3.) player speed should be adjustable, the better to accommodate English speakers native and non-, both.    Thanks.",
"Great app, i liked it from the moment i opened it. however there is a bug everytime i open a video it shows that the application has crushed.please fix it.",
"Reading notes or slides are unavailable for download, course updates, forum, homework assignment either.",
Every time you leave the app and come back to it after a while it crashes. Has been happening for a long time and still no fix.,
It's full of bugs. Crashes usually. If I pause a video it freezes and the give me an error every time I try to play it again. There's no access top the forums nor most of the sections. I'm very disappointed with this app,
"I am very unhappy about this app. After this app is released, the good old coursera companion can no longer login (which I already paid for all plugins). And this new app is much much worse than coursera companion! It does not support changing speed, does not support window mode (for Samsung devices), and often black screen (no video, only audio)... Completely broke my work flow and killed others!",
"I love Coursera, and I love that I can use the app to download videos to watch on the go. But this app crashes (twice!) literally every time that I open it. By now, I'm used to it - I just plan on hitting ""don't report this crash"" twice, then launching the app again.",
"Though I love Coursera, this is a really pathetic excuse for an app. Lacking multiple features of the site, and occasionally frustrating to use. Don't bother using this.",
"If you are currently enrolled in a course, the app is well suited for viewing videos. It is also compatible with chromecast. However, when you try looking for available courses, the app takes you to old courses, most of which are not available. This makes browsing or searching for courses very frustrating.",
"I have been using coursera on the computer with no problem. The app is convenient, or so I thought. I've signed in and tried to add several classes and it won't let me. An error code pops up. I've also tried signing in to classes I've signed up for on the computer and they don't show up in the app. Very disappointed.",
Too many bugs with sessions that doesn't allow me to complete quizzes. This app doesn't represent how coursera is great,
I've used the desktop version for so long I can't bear to listen to these in real time please add the speed up option!,
"I get tired of seeing an error message saying ""Looks like you are not signed up for this course"" and having to login on the webpage it loads just to see my course content.",
"I've tried to login multiple times and it keeps telling me that my password or email is wrong when it's not. My phone is fine, your app not so much. Please fix and I'll give 5 stars.",
Amazing tool to learn on mobile but they should cover some more topics related to medical field.,
The app is a full of bugs and crashes often. Really grateful to the team behind for providing free lessons. Thanks.,
"I love Coursera,and the app is good as is, but easier access to the quizzes and discussion forums would be great. Some courses require participation in the discussion forums, and, if you have limited access to an actual computer, it can make it difficult to gain a statement of accomplishment.",
"Coursera is an amazing product. If we could mark which videos we have opened/finished, and could organize the courses in order of how they are displayed, it would be perfect",
Crashes after being minimized on my Phillips w823 if playing lecture. Also lack of access to forums.,
I would like to be able tout change the  speed of the video like on the website... Some teachers are so slow to get to the point!,
Please add autosync of all deadlines with Google Calendar and speed up videos feature.,
"One would think that Coursera's mobile applications would be so much more important than their web application: watching & listening to lectures on the go (or out of one's home/office) should be pretty common. However, this application -- while existing -- fails to impress. On a number of occasions it just crashes, which is bad enough. Downloading videos is unreliable and slow. Videos, while being watched, do not keep the screen on, requiring constant tapping. The speed change feature of the web player is absent, despite multiple licenseable third-party video players on Android allowing this. There's no audio-only option, though that seems like it would be pretty useful to devices with limited battery capacity.  In all, this feels like about the minimum product that Coursera could have built to check the ""Android App"" checkbox. It leaves so much to be desired, at the very least in the area of lecture playback.",
Glad to coursera app. Would like to see settings to change video download location (SD card etc.),
"It downloads one video at one time , I have not seen it download all the videos of a week at one time , to fully utilise the network speed",
I am a big fan of Coursera and the android app is really good. You can download videos and watch it offline at your convenience..,
"I use Coursera daily. I would use it even more if I was able to access the forums via the app. I would even settle for a mobile site, because right now they're unusable on mobile.",
"It is such a good app and you guys are doing such a great job, giving education for free. Great work thumbs up.:-D",
"It would be nice to be able to control the speed of the lecture videos, like how we can in a desktop browser. Some professors are great but talk just a bit too slowly.",
"The app provides access to videos, but thats about it. It doesn't have playback speed control, and you can't lecture notes.",
5 star content with 1 star execution.  Could not use app to stream or download certain sections of classes.,
Decent app but desperately needs a speed up option. Quite useless without it,
It's nice to be able to watch lecture videos on the go (when the app works) but you can't take take certificate track quizzes or see what videos you you already watched on the computer. It just feels like a huge step down from the regular website.,
Very useful and the lectures look great on a Nexus. It'd be great to have an option to change the viewing speed for people like me who enjoy watching their lectures at 1.25x.,
Please provide the ability to change playback speed and unlock access to downloaded videos.,
Constant crashes when switching back to the app after some time. Sometimes Video doesn't start. Offline video doesn't have quizes.,
"Forums, assignments, additional resources are all missing. Currently it's easy to watch video on the go but that's about it.",
"Videos are the heaviest files you may download on the phone and I cannot believe this app (or the downloaded videos) cannot be moved to the sd card. Do you if an easy  get around exists, without hacking the os? Thanks!",
"The app is great for browsing courses and viewing material, however, for assignments and courses you pay for more support is needed. I don't have a PC anymore...",
"It seems to be impossible to follow links (for instance, to download a supplementary PDF material) :(",
"I especially like the feature that allows you to download the lectures to watch offline. It seems to lock up when I work on the quizzes, so I still need a PC to compete the work.",
"User-friendly app, easy to play video lectures, overall a great platform to learn various subjects",
"It used to be ""we give knowledge to people for free and make world a better place"". And now it's more like ""haha we got you! now that you are hooked on, you pay for EVERYTHING!"". Up yours you capitalist pig! I'm out for good.",
"Videos stream seamlessly and I prefer app to browser for watching course videos and taking quizzes, because of the wonderful and user friendly UI",
"This is the only app which does not need to tell me to go rate it. This is an incredible idea and app, so grateful",
"It would be Nice if you could subscribe tot courses which are coming soon, so that you get a notification or email when that course is released. Put that in the app and you have 5 stars",
Education is no longer a privilege. It's like God to developing countries around the globe. Great!,
When we download a lecture and leave it without playing it the same lecture cannot be opened in the offline mode.. Please fix this issue..,
"This app is pretty good, but not up to the standard of the third party apps like ""Coursera Companion"" and ""Coursera on the go"" that were available until recently. My key feature: speed controls for lectures. A total must for some lecturers, and really helps optimise my time.",
"Now every time I open the app, it crashes. Reopening again fixes it. So I need to open the app twice before I can use it",
"The offline viewing functionality is close to useless. It downloads the videos but the app does not let you see the section with the downloaded videos because ""you have not downloaded this section"". Also, no speed controls on the video player. The content is great, the app is not.",
"Please offer a paid version that has minimal permissions, as the requested permissions for this 'free' app are ridiculous. There's not even an attempt to justify them in the description.",
Useful app but they sell your information. Not happy.,
Now that I started getting into my courses I would have thought and hoped that discussion forums would be in the app. Their absence almost makes the app irrelevant.,
"Works well, but absolutely NEEDS an option to move the downloaded videos to the sdcard. A couple classes at 3 hours of video a week each, of course all in the least compressed format possible, and I'm eating ask my internal storage.",
It is very helpful to learn new courses that you even haven't ever heard about....,
It's one of the best educational apps I have come across. It's free & it only needs an internet connectivity & our time to study. Great stuff.,
Fantastic course  content free too. Very helpful  for my professional coursework. Thanks fellas! You are life savers,
The app is pretty nice and simple. However it would be perfect if it had the forums and discussions as well.,
"No more crash on start, saves position, offline download, syncs progress to Coursera.",
"Take classes on nearly any subject out there, from science to philosophy to history. Easy to use video interface, and now you can even take the quizzes!",
Downloading issues.videos stop downloading for no reason. great app otherwise,
"Do not update to 1.4 until they explain why they want to run the app at startup, in the background, and especially why they want total access to your camera and microphone!",
I just bought a new nexus 9 and the Coursera app is my favorite! Hopefully there will be a dedicated tablet version some time in the future :),
"Why on earth would the new  version require access to my phone and phone calls, including knowing who I'm remotely connected to? That's creepy and disturbing.",
"do not open readings inside the app, it doesn't work for video and poor for web pages, open them in browser",
Keeps crashing on my phantom especially after pausing and taking video back.,
I feel like I've new adventures to go through,
Black screen on all videos,
It would be much better if the video speed could be changed for the mobile app.,
one of the most amazing apps ever thank you for making learner so much easier :),
But now you can't even browse the courses without signing in...,
I've benefited a lot from Coursera without spending one cent. I backup the incentive of giving all beings access to free and good quality teaching.,
"Good content, no glitches on Galaxy tab 10.1 end it' s really free.",
Great way to learn stuff outside of your field! Highly recommended!,
Wonderful site where you can start learning anything else,
"I love Coursera, I entered the world of MOOCs thanks to Coursera, so this app comes in really handy!",
Hate that I can't save the videos on my memory card,
I keep getting errors when I play the video.,
"Easy to use, help me to much. Thanks",
"i cant download and it is not smooth online, though it is so useful.",
"*No courses about rock mechanics/geomechanics **imagine I found interested course with ""coming soon"" status, how can I add it to my ""lib"" so that to not forget about it?",
I can't see the videos.  Only the voice.,
"OK for watching videos, but that's it.  In-video quizzes very buggy.",
Works really well and easy too navigate through.,
Best for working people to upgrade themselves on the go and get connected with the most recent knowledge.,
Just the only one that fully works on mobile. All resources are here.,
Helps me to keep up with the courses I've enrolled to.,
"Wish I could adjust the playback speed on the videos, like I can on the website.",
None of the courses I've registered for show up in either the past or current or upcoming sections,
But it should have ability to be installed to sd card. Or at least configurable download folder,
But 4* because of Crashing...This app crash several time...anyways all content are really cool,
This app has allowed me to attend courses by Wharton.  Valuable,
"Needs calender , alarm , more classification,and to allow you set the time you want to search for courses in",
But I cant find some courses available on the site in this app!,
Great it makes commuting fun as I can learn something new everyday day.,
U can download the course video also,
I would like to see video speed options and a richer web viewer,
"Great app, but it needs the ability to play the video even when the screen is switched off",
The videos is not working well.there's no pic,
ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ∑ŸÑ .. ŸÖŸÜÿ∏ŸÖ ÿßŸÉÿ´ÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ≥Ÿä,
Would be much more useful if video speed can change,
No logical reason why u wudnt have this app ...,
this is agreatest app. i have ever seen,
It is really motivational..I am so happy with the whole idea abt coursera..it refreshes me..Thank You MOOC...,
It was good Hope the App update is better and Coursera is Awesome !!!,
Great. Place to learn from great teaching faculty,
Knowledge is the best thing that any human can ask for.,
Made with lot of thinking . great app . must for educational students,
Free Online College classes from top Universities,
Love it but i wish i could Download courses,
Thank you for making Coursera availabe on Android! Wow!,
This is the best app I've ever downloaded!!,
Excellent website and app .. thanks coursera.,

Elevate you're mind with coursera.,
One of the most real useful apps,
.....keeps me updated.... home study.... a really great app for anyone who is determined!,
Tons of courses to choose from,
Great app just what I needed,
Great App for Education,
Very informative and benefitial,
A must have for book-worms,
"Good application, helps  me to understand very new concepts easily, But some videos don' t play!.. shows an error?",
Such a magnificent effort..,
What's better than free courses? Free courses on your phone!,
Can study anythin...gud app,
How can I cache videos in SD? It quickly stuffed my phones memory,
Supports chrome cast!! Awesome,
Marvellous..... Curious mind will benefit large from it,
The app  seems to be promising....,
It is great! Love it!,
"Awesome, quite helpful...",
Thanks for fixing subtitles issue,
It is awesome man. Keep it up.....,

Classy. What I wanted. :),

Amazing!,
Excellent way to spread knowledge,

Why do you need camera permission?,
Good,
:-),
Missing cast...,
Galaxy SII,
Yay!,
Yeppers,
"The application is a mess. Yes, it exists, it supports Chromecast, these are two stars out of 5. No subtitles via Chromecast, nothing from the original structure of the course, and no integration with Android. For example, when I'm Chromecasting the video and want to pause it from the top menu, there is a pause button, just like any player's button. But if I press it, it gets me to Coursera main screen in a landscape mode, so I have to tap the pause button there. And there so many things like that.",
Good but need to be able to display horizontally and be able to choose player and need to be able to swift left and right for fast forward and back word and need to be able to download videos.  Why don't u just integrate with MX player.  Also need to be able to view past courses which I dddnt register to over the past its VERY ANNOYING I cannot do that.  Need to be able to perform weekly exercise via app.,
"Just finished a course using this ap on the road. Missed pass grade due to the app not showing me peer assignments. So missed them out. Also missing all the side bar tabs. Only the course info, videos, and quizzes could be viewed. So 1 star as its mot really fit for purpose.",
"Brilliantly built app,very light weight and highly usable. However there is a main issue with it, the app allows the system to sleep while playing videos, this is rather annoying and joy killer when you are watching and listening to a course but I'm sure it is easy to tackle in the coming version.",
App doesn't stream videos. Only audios are streamed for any course I go through. I am having S-duos (4.0) which doesn't support HD videos. Please fix this error. I don't think coursera team even read these issues. This has been the issue for a very long time now.,
"Coursera is fantastic and this app works really well in bringing the courses to your phone. The navigation is a bit odd - you have to use the back button within the course and not the upper menu.  But the main problem, at least if you have an older phone with a small first partition, is the videos are downloaded to /data so quite quickly you can get an android error message and not be able to update any other apps.",
The app is just pathetic. I downloaded an intro video of cryptography and the video player plays just the audio.  What's even more worse is that when I turned on the subtitles I got the subtitles for some course on vaccines. Why on earth did you bother to build such an app. Even an android noob can create a better app than this.,
"It's useful to download courses for offline viewing, but on my WiFi tablet I can't view courses even after downloading because I get an error that the course has not been downloaded. Instead I have to look as the list of downloaded videos. In video questions don't work, and as a signature track student I can't take quizzes.",
"Good App overall. But there are some basic mistakes. The web version of coursera allows students to speed up or slow down play speed, that should be part of this app from the beginning Also, once courser material are downloaded there should be no point to force people to authenticate again (that means internet connection).   Lots of people download because they want to watch  offline. This enforcement is honestly stupid, even there is bureaucracy going on. This makes the download feature unusable",
"I just cannot believe that this is free education.  I can use these studies to improve job related skills.  I was a mechanic for many years then came to Peru and injured my spine working alone because my employer feels that a healthy, strong and fifty year old American can do his job alone.  Since I cannot return to mechanics I will have return as a office jock or a teacher so this is a great program to teach me another skill.",
"I love this app. It is top notch and it makes viewing the Coursera course videos extremely easy. This is especially if you enjoy loading all the videos for a given week in one go and watching them piecemeal later.  I wish they would do the same with the course notes, as it seems that this is not currently supported. Great app!",
"The only thing this app can do is browse courses, register/leave, and view course videos. It allows you to download the videos, but the developers decided to fill up the /data directory with the files instead of a more sane location.  The downloaded videos are inaccessible from outside the appon an unrooted phone. On a rooted phone, all you get is file1,file2,file3... making it useless.  Phone memory is limited, and I can not let this crappy application fill it up. Wait, there's more fun. You have to manually delete the videos you don't need, or yourphone memory is full and unless you know this app has this issue, you'll waste a lot of time trying to find the culprits.",
"The app provides a great way to interact with the material, more convenient than with the web browser. Video questions should still be implemented and it would be great if the contents/playlist for courses was automatically updated every time (minor issue). Great app, really convenient!",
"So,  android finally gets a coursera app.  After iPhone got one a year or so ago,  then iPad got its own special version,  finally the 80%+ marketshare leader is graced with an app.  Now,  I wouldn't be half as bitter if the app wasn't a cobbled together mess of bugs.    the app frequently crashes.  The videos don't pick up where they left off,  the player is bare bones,  and frequently just stops for no reason.  Quizzes from other videos pop up right in the middle of a course video.  Hopefully fixes coming",
"The platform itself is great for learning new material. However, not every assignment and material for the courses can be accessed via this app. For instance, I cannot access discussion forums and I am unable to neither open a link in an external browser nor can I copy a link and paste it in a browser. I am enjoying the content, but not the functionality of the app.",
"The User Interface is very clean but it has some serious issues with video playback. I downloaded the videos for The Data Scientist's Toolbox and it plays only the audio. My phone does not support HD Videos and that could be the issue. So it would be great if we can specify the download format. Also,  subtitles of a previous video overlaps with the current video that is being played. This app is an indispensable tool. Please fix this fast.",
The fonts are very small and light on my Note 10.1.  There are features on the web page that are not here yet. I have taken Coursera classes and like them but this application is terrible. There is no log in so no dashboard or anything else.,
"Very incomplete, player lacking important features such as video speed, and no possibility to use an external, better player. Connexion errors reset assignment answers. Taking down non official apps to give way for a half-finished, locked down app is not consistent with Coursera's ideal of open education.",
"With Googlecast support, I can really experience a classroom at home!  With so many classes, this site has a class everyone can use regardless of the field you are studying.  Competing services may have better specialized content, but this Coursera covers far more topics.  Add an app that is quickly changing to meet the needs of it's users, and that is encouraging.   All I can really ask for is the ability to choose a download location.",
"This app is definitely awesome but there is aproblem im facing with this app , Im running out of free space how can I move courses I have downloaded to sdcard. why there is no option to move files to sdcard please make this option available in next update . Thanks for the great effort .",
Working 6 days a week 12 hours a day leaves little time for luxuries like education. This app has allowed me pursue my interests outside of work. I mostly use it for learning things I think will help my career.,
"Pros: I love what they are doing here. Free education with the choice of paying for a verified certificate (assuming you accomplish the course). Learning music recording and now going to try financial taxes course (no idea how to do taxes!) and I am tempted to go for a certificate! You can also download the videos! Cons: I don't think some* courses are that sophisticated compared to lynda. The interface could use some work too. With that said, I'm checking this app DAILY. Love it you guys!",
"Spoken lectures at normal speed are slower then the brain can handle and it is much nicer to watch them at 1.5 speed or so, but this app doesn't offer that. Otherwise it's fine.",
Lots of bugs. Refuses to open lesson from course menu while I can see all the individual videos in download manager. Download manager doesn't feel like downloading anything midst of the time. Can't specify location etc...,
"1-You don't can move it to the sd card. 2-when you download the lesson it go to your phone and fill your phone, not sd card possibility. 3- don't show the questions that are in the lesson that the online version do.  Very good the chromecast  for saw on TV's.",
"Most valuable use of technology I have seen till date. Best concept delivered in best way by the best faculties to create a better place to live in. Small sizes of videos make not only downloads easy but also concepts short and sweet to understand. And variety of subjects covered. ..at least one for everyone! Methodology....real life scenario, concept delivery and questions, no boring  theories. Thanks a lot for making knowledge accessible and affordable to one and all.",
Nothing well. Course material can't be downloaded. Any written form work not seen,
"1. Often crashing after switching to another app, e.g. dictionary; 2. Homework can not be reviewed after restarting; 3. There's no subtitles view options; 4. Subtitles are obscured when video is paused; 5. You are not allowed to move data to SD card. Common! Video takes a lot of space! Why there's no option to move data? Uninstalled.",
Compared to web page has this app limited functionality. Subtitles of video won't load for some reason and in video quizzes do not work as well. That's quite a let down if I imagine how many people uses this app.,
"I previously gave the Coursera app four stars, because there was (in my view) a serious shortcoming: in-video quizzes did not work. Well, now they do! My only problem with the app now is much more minor: the next video plays automatically, without a way (that I could find) of changing that behavior. Annoying, since that makes the video appear as watched when it actually was not. Also, even more minor, getting back to the list of videos can take quite a lot of taps, but I can live with that...",
Ive passed some free and some paid courses. Don't like this service since it became completely paid - free courses dont let access to full content (and assignments) anymore.,
"The content and the presentation is intuitive and easy to access. The ability to download the video is a great addition. But the problem is Video download is not on sdcard. So, we can't download the videos of great many courses to watch it on the go. It will be better if the video downloads is moved to the sdcard partition.   Thank you!",
#NAME?,
Has everything you need to learn on the go. Works and feels like your are using the chrome web browser. So glad I downloaded it.,
"So far it seems great. Finally something to help me quench my thirst for knowledge and understanding. But it still needs subtitles in more languages, like Portuguese.",
"I'm taking a math course on here, and 3 times now I've had to restart a test because ""I wasn't enrolled in the course,"" even though it clearly stated my name in both the top and bottom parts of the test, where the code of honor thing is. The app doesn't log me out, it only says I'm not enrolled, which doesn't make sense because I shouldn't even be able to access the content if I weren't... Other than having to redo everything every now and then, great app so far. It motivates me to do SOMETHING at least (:",
"I just hit the install button and a 941 error popped up. I'm using a brand new Nook HD, so there's no good reason for this.",
"Built-in video player is a joke. Quizzes and homeworks are not available. Coursera requested to remove a fantastic app named ""coursera on the go"" from the store to deploy this less than mediocre app. Shame on them.",
The Android version of this course suite is even better (for me) than the PC version. This is excellent course material wonderfully presented.,
Its been a great source of learning. Though its free but its worth beyond words. Thank you coursera team,
This is a great app but it really needs the ability to filter by language. I want to be able to only show courses presented in English.,
Used to like it ..but they are very inflexible and the content is a bit erratic.. you are better off with other options..,
Love the content. The app needs polishing. Feels like it was hastily designed,
Basic functions for now. Plus for chromecast option.. Missing speed control at least on phone. Problems with downloaded lessons when no net.. Videos are forced in landscape orientation instead of showing Fragment of Video on top of the portrait screen with list of lectures/videos under it...,
I tried to get several different courses and each one kept trying to load but didn't.  I love the selection but w I uld actually like to learn something.,
"Really good learning tools, can use in combination with your CHROMECAST plug-in on the go ANYWHERE there's a TV (w/HDMI port). Any subject you've always wanted to learn they have it. Squandered away college, wished you had gone now. Well now we can. For FREE! Love It!! I'm broke, can't afford college right now. Perfect app for me. Thank You to the creator!Recommending to all my friends and family.",
Hi..I love this! Only issue I have is storage location of downloaded video. Hope you can update the app so all downloaded video can be stored on external storage (SD Card)...looking forward to it,
"I am tired of apps requesting permissions that they don't need. Why would you need to know number who is calling me? ""Device ID & call information Allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call""  "" remote number connected by a call"" WHY? Clean up your code please!",
"I like that you release an app for android, but forcing to delete the other apps that have been here before is not the way to go.",
"I'm taking a history course and there are several segments that I can't watch. I get a message saying ""video error can't play the video"". It's not all segments but i can't make any progress when i can't watch them all chronologically.",
I tried to login to my account but it's not accepting the password.so when I try to reset the password there's no option for doing that.,
"I was using the far better ""Coursera on the Go"" and I am now frustrated with this one, which: a) is not configurable at all, b) I cannot get it to show english subs c) Is so unorganized",
"Cousera is an amazing website and the app is very good. I also experienced the sound-only bug on my samsung tab though, and i would really like to see the video speed functionality implemented in this app. This is the main reason why i still prefer to use the web version to view videos.",
"Whenever I try to join a course I get an error, unauthorised notification at the bottom of the screen and does not allow me join a course via the app",
"App seems reliable, but doesn't let you adjust the playback speed of videos, which makes many courses very tedious (this was possible in the past, using Coursera on the Go and DicePlayer). Please either add playback speed control, or make it possible to watch videos in an external video player (like DicePlayer or VLC).",
When I downloaded this app it was working well but now I see that no quizzes are been shown . I tried loading it so many times through WiFi n even mobile data.. Fix it ....!!,
Great app but lacks a couple of important features: 1. It should be possible to download videos to ext SD card! 2. Please enable In-video quizzes,
"Force closes every time I open the app or switch to it. Also sometimes won't play downloaded videos because ""they're not available offline"" when they are.",
Same insights as the ones below-- I wasn't aware of the peer assignments and other tasks. Did not get a certificate of completion for Leading Strategic Innovation. Boohoooo. üò¢ And I loved that course!,
Great courses good app but cant acces the downloaded lectures and dont have much of internal space so kind of restricting me.,
"Great idea, and decent app. It lacks some functionality of the website, and downloaded content can't be saved to SD.",
"This app has such a wide variety of courses, I wish I had more time to take them.",
"I find this app easy to use and very convenient. No need to boot my computer. Just run this app and watch lectures, answer quizzes.",
I can not move app to SD card. It is consuming all of my main memory. Please fix it,
The webpage loading was poor and it doesn't load the page sometimes. I had much trouble when accessing the reading using this apps. A fix for this bug would be helpful :),
I am presently doing a course on Child Psychology and none of the hyperlinks on the course page work. Also no discussion forum on mobile... That's a serious mishap!!! App needed and is classy but these are creativity problems.,
"All my other apps stream no problem to Chromecast. I don't see the Cast icon anywhere on my phone screen. Using Galaxy S3, Android v4.4.2",
I use another email address instead of my Google account email. The app should remember the email address that was successful in logging in.,
"there is problem with your app, when played in Samsung Glaxy it is only you can listen audio but video screen remains black.  plz fix this problem",
"Videos crash all the time, very frustrating and can't even get through one video. Please fix!",
"i like the simple style,but with the essential function. much convenient downloading benefits me to learn offline.",
"It looks like it might have some interesting courses, but there isn't even a category for languages which was the main reason I even looked at the app",
All downloads are under /data folder. It is impossible to export videos unless rooted,
If nothing else take learning how to learn course. Its awesome.,
The app clashes now and then. Also it does not shows the peer assessments and related things.,
"One simple fix, allow to open links in course pages on chrome, I can't read the bibliography requested on a course from the app.",
Able to download video lessons and play offline without any issues. Completed my first course and waiting for the result.,
"They should allow to enter offline entering to course page, when video are already download , rather giving cannot access internet",
For smartphones in busy life very nice companion for knowledge updating.. Thank you very much all.,
"This app help me follow my courses on coursera easily. However, video data for watching offline take too much storage. It'll be more perfect if video data can move to sdcard, in that way, i have more storage to save video for watching offline.",
I found an issue with video in Crafting an Effective Writer. A video isn't reproduced. There is only audio stream. The latest update hasn't fixed the playing error of video. ((,
Coursera's done great work here. Still has some rough edges but it is constantly improving!,
This app represents everything I hate about flipped classrooms. It is half assed claiming to be a revolution to education.,
The app crashes when I try to open it from the multitasking menu... Its very annoying... And video downloads stop when minimized,
The user interface looks good . But unable to view downloaded videos . I usually prefer transferring videos into my laptop and watch it . But it is not possible with this app,
"On the website, I always speed up the video. Without this feature in the app, I can't use it.",
"Good for watching course videos, including downloading them for offline viewing, but that's really it. You can't do quizzes or peer reviews, so it's back to the desktop after you're done with the videos. Surely Coursera, which is charging for signature track courses,  can do better than this!",
Great app but the video player freezes up my phone. Downloading the videos and playing it does not help either.,
I cant see the video in online as well as offline mode. I can only hear the audio and see the subtitles.kindly look into the issue and rectify it.just joined machine learning course,
Main problem is video freezing. Also needs support for SD card storage.,
The Coursera app we've all been waiting for! It would be great if the app allowed users to manually select the downloads directory since I'm sure there's still a substantial number of users who rely on an external SD card for storage.,
"Videos wont play properly on my Samsung Galaxy.. I can hear the sound and activate subtitles even, but the screen remains black the entire video.. Not happy.",
"I just wish there were a few courses for Jewellery. I'm a Jewellery designer... If I could learn something about gemstones etc, it would be great",
"I cant see videos ,  when i play some videos only i can able to hear voice but cant see videos.plz fix it. &  i will give it 5 stars",
"I really love this app, so now I can study abroad without leaving my country. For next update, please make this app can be move to sd card, because my smartphone storage limited",
"... If only it supports its subtitles too, it could be amazing  I'm not english natural speaker and I need subtitles, I hope they'll add soon subtitles support.",
Coursera for Android represents a nice concept but it brings some bugs and restrictions compared to iPad or computer versions. They should devote time in order to fix them and improve the app.,
"The app is great, but there is a big problem: the app stores video data only in internal memory which is limited. IMHO, the developers should add a possibility to store data in any SD partition.",
"Rated as one of the best apps by Stuff Magazine. A university in your pocket ,download any courses from maths to medicine study  it  ,complete the test and it will enrol you to the next level! Excellent",
Kindly add preview lectures like desktop version for upcoming courses. Then it will deserve 5 star.,
"Can't join any course, everytime I try I get the message ""network error, check your internet connection"". I changed 3 wifi's, and still no go",
"Keeps on crashing while opening downloaded videos. If the video player opens, only audio is heard.. nothing is visible on screen. Please fix this",
I have 1GB internal storage. I could not find way to specify download directory or move whole app to sdcard. Without possibility of downloading videos and limited mobile brandwich it is unusable in my use case.,
It' just wrapper over web view. Slow and not very user friendly,
Due dates should be one of the first and easiest things to find in the app. There should be configurable notifications for due dates.   Loving the Chromecast support! Thank you!,
Need to have the in-video quizzes in the app also. This is causing the app to lose out on a very good and essential feature of the website. Please add it soon. Thanks!,
videos are not visible.only sound with subtitles can be seen on my Samsung quattro.,
This app is very good. One improvement needed is to mark the completed lectures  as 'Watched'. It would be easier to keep track of the progress made.,
The app has upgraded from previous version...now can connect course videos and links..but still has scope for further improvement,
I am writing this while downloading this app. Not yet used but i am very happy to get it for android...,
It will be better that the cousera app downloads it's videos into the /sdcard folders instead of downloading into the /data/data/.. folder. It's comsuming space for apps,
"Nice UI, has most of the features I would need, but doesn't allow viewing of slides or course projects or forums.",
"The app is excellent, however it would be helpful if there was an option to save the downloaded videos to the memory card instead. After downloading a few videos my phone memory is full and I can't move the app or it's data to the memory card.",
"Since a few days subtitles don't work anymore, reinstalling didn't help.  Besides decent app.",
The app seems pretty interesting  but while playing the clip only the audio plays the video doesn't appear..!,
This company and app is amazing. I am an engineer student and being able to learn various subjects and even other engineering subjects broadens what I can do with what I learned in university by combining them all.,
"Grt app, but downloaded lectures should be saved on SD card and options should b there to search for videos",
Lots of missing functionality within the courses.  Coursera Companion was much better.  Please update the app so it will compliment these great courses!,
I've took a course there learned a lot from video lectures over here. a fantabulous app for those who want to learn in the short period of time in their schedule..I'm looking forward to enroll in other courses as well tnx... For introducing this app to android platform and I wish I could meet Mrs. Barbara Oakley...one day:3,
"You can only watch videos, join or leave courses and see course info.  great integration with chromecast but I can't see subtitles while casting.",
I hope it is not a sample of software taught in your courses.,
It stores video on internal memory which is limited on android phones. They should hire a good programmer,
"I absolutely love the app and courses I have taken.  Even though it already has MANY courses, it could still use more.  Keep up the good work!",
Even after downloading the videos on a lesson the app doesn't let me switch lessons if I am not online. It claims I have not downloaded the videos... Fix this bug and there are 5 stars from me,
This app build our learning confidence in study...and make basic concepts very clear and easy. Learning on it is very good experience.,
Great for catching up on course lectures. It's missing the important feature of speeding-up/slowing-down the videos.,
i have been using this app for the past two years and it has been an enriching and fun learning experience! many interesting courses that cater to different interest :),
"This provides just a small fraction of the functionality of the web site with a limited user interface, it's hard to see any value in the app.",
Why cant i see my course on chinese for beginners in the app? Is it for web viewing only? I hope you can make a way to put it in the app. I dont use my desktop pc much.,
"The downloaded video gets stored in internal memory which fills up pretty quickly. Is there a way to store in in external memory? Besides this, everything is cool.",
Luke the app especially it's offline lecture viewing mode. Makes for no trouble on the go. There is potential for adding more support for the Signature Track courses to be able to take quizzes and verify via device camera.,
Can't open the lecture slides in pdf or pptx on Nexus 5.,
"In-video quizzes, finally, that's great. But. On my Dell Venue 7 tablet an app cuts off the screen, audio stays streaming. To fix that I'm to lock/unlock the screen. I've tested other video apps -- they are working OK. The second issue is -- and that's really disgusting! -- as I dl all videos from the chapter and I need to go offline, app tells me that I didn't download any videos! Unless that is app bug that is UI issue.",
"I just tried the app, had access to all my lecs in 2 different courses, played them and opened an assignment but didn't answer it. Yet, i can use it WITH the website and not totally depend on it.",
It's so convenient to be able to access my courses when away from my computer. App works well. Easy to use.,
Would've given five stars except it crashes too much,
"The app seems good at first glance, but doesn't allow speeding up videos. I usually view them at twice the normal speed!",
Thanks for your efforts. The chromecast is very nice option as I requested this some time ago.,
The UX is good. It already lets subtitle fetching. The additional feature I need is the ability to control playback speed.,
"I like how it handles video downloading, but I really miss speed control. That's the only reason why I use desktop computer for some courses. Support for specialisations would be nice, too.",
Love the education resources I have available to me through this app. No complaints as I understand this allows me to view lectures on the go and then use my pc for assignments and forum use. Well at least for my courses,
I haven't even yet opened the app but I'm just glad that its here! I will leave a proper review after I've tried using it with my courses. Thanks!!,
"Great website, but this app shouldn't exist in its current unusable state. It doesn't even show the current courses I'm signed up for!",
"I'd give 4 stars, but after some updates the video subtitles ceased to display on my phone (Galaxy S2, Android 4.4)",
"The website has ""follow course"" to be informed when a pending course goes live, but the mobile app lacks this-- which would be uber helpful. Thanks!",
without sd card integration it is not really useful for offline study.,
I could not load this onto my android mobile phone.,
"Why do you need to access to my phone ID & calls , anyway great APP",
please make it so that download location can be changed!!! major hindrance,
Just finished week one on a five week course on learning techniques about learning. Free classes from State Universities from all over.,
The ability to download the videos with subtitles and answer the assignments within the app is awesome to get things done on the go.,
Is great for those like to learn more in their life. Alway recommend my friends about this.,
App has advanced user-friendly interface. I just have a lots of fun with it.,
"Nice app. I can browse all the courses. Directly play video lessons, one by one",
It is really helpful at keeping track if the class I am taking and downloading the lectures is easy.,
It may be made transferable to sd card to avoid occupation of memory due to offline videos.,
"I used this app to complete a course on developing andriod apps, ironically.. Its a great app, very useful for getting course content onto my mobile  but... it would be nice if I could save the videos to my sd card instead of taking up my storage on my device..  That way I could save on my mobile data.  Any chance it could be updated to be movable to the sd card?",
Often crashes at launch after being in background for several hours,
The downloaded lectures for offline access are downloaded on internal memory not to sd card leaving no space on my low internal storage. shift the downloaded video to external storage and its 5 star,
The video donot work on my phone .l hear voice only but no picture pls help,
Love it. Everything seems accessible. I dont really mind having to go to the websote for quizzes and what-not. So glad I found this site and app. It rocks!!,
This app so so helpful for me. I can learn alot,
"Much better on my cell phone, version 1.1.4, Tablet version is later but all I can do is download videos, everything else is blank... aah! I just got this tablet for my courses",
Its not showing subtitles in this version and crushes alot !! Reported from nexus 5,
This app offers something that is worth thousands of dollars for free I am already a great fan of this organization and all the teachers across the globe supporting this wonderful organization. Keep doing this great work and giving people this great gift of learning to more and more people.,
"After downloading videos in the app and disconnecting from the Internet, a couple of times I couldn't access them - no Internet available message appeared.  Once this problem is fixed, I will increase to 5 stars..",
Love the rewind feature and I don't seem to have the problems with the app I used to have earlier.,
"The app, especially it's download feature, works really well. But it crashes occasionally. Also it should be able to notify about deadlines and and move the downloads to SD card.",
"This app refuses to acknowledge my email as real (my domain ends in .codes), and has the login button disabled. This is the same email attached to my account online (where is does let me login).",
It might be better if there was an actual video instead of just audio I would  of give it a five iif there was a video,
This is really amazing. I love it I don't know what else to say,
I can't wait to get started. I downloaded this app on 3 different platforms.,
"Great app, especially for the video downloads which help on my commute. Any chance you'll include video playback speed change like on the web player? Keep up the great work, I love Coursera!",
It does not work properly with subtitles.,
"The video doesn't show up! Only the audio is working. I tried their ""help"" button to assist me in fixing this but it just didn't HELP.",
Can't play any videos in my Huawey,
I haven't opened it yet but hope its good,
Taking the latinoamerican course... the android display is wonky. Additionally.. can't open the readings from the app.. did well on the quiz.... but would have learned more with the required reading....,
Has an almost material design. App did come late to android though. Very late.,
"Completely functional, but it would be nice to have multi window capabilities for tablets.",
Please allow changing downloading path. It used up all my space...,
This app is great a little difficult to navigate at first but found after a short time it is great!!,
U know what ur helping lot of people I love this app &lt;3,
Coursera on the Go app knew a lot more.,
Very minimalist UI... Easy to follow... Works seamlessly over both online and offline mode.,
coursera on the go app was better,
I don't care if it crashes sometimes with NPE but can I change where this app stores downloaded lectures? On my phone I don't have much internal memory but I couldn't find how to change it to external storage. And how about in-video quizes? :) Thanks.,
Great app. It's nice that invideo quizzes support has been added recently.,
An educated mind is a free mind. Thank you so much for this service.,
Please add feature to move videos to sdcard.,
This is really a great experience of accessing courses through this app.,
Thank you for listening and adding Chromecast support. You guys are the best!,
Would love to be able to listen faster!! :),
Great app.Better than the PC version in my opinion.Good job.,
Sometimes hangs and also quiz submissions have issues.,
How to have the downloaded stuff transferred to sdcard? I want to download videos. But it covers up my internal memory. Help!,
I love the app but can't see the subs even though turning the subs on. Why is that? Does everyone have this problem???,
Add ability to change video speed & to solve in video quizzes,
"Best way to learn anything as your choice. ... very informative, very well way explained.",
This app makes taking courses on coursers more fun and far easier. I love it !,
Coursera makes it easy to stay on track even on the go.,
One of the best & most useful  application I have on my note 3.,
In learning college leveled courses for free and I just started high school,
Whenever I tries to play a video it says can't play the video video error.,
"Always gives error(1,9001). Not able to play any video.",
I do not understand why I cannot download the app,
If you haven't downloaded it do it now!,
I love how they provide all the subjects. This is great for independent study,
I have learned so much with Coursera.,
Really wish this app had enabled users to modify the video speed!,
This app is really awesome and helpful for studying on the go,
Allows me get access to my course materials on the fly,
Easy way to learn a few new things at a time.,

Needs improvement to bring back the adjustable speed feature,

Wonderful way to educate yourself!,
Excited.,
I hate being forced to use a gmail account.  I don't use a gmail account for anything.  I hate gmail.  Quit trying to force me to use gmail.,

The previous version of the app could play lecturer voice even if your screen is off. Why on earth should a developer remove this feature?,

"I went online and read somewhere that you have 3 weeks to decide if you want to keep the course youre taking and if you decide to keep it, you have to pay between $30 - 100. Is thia true for all courses?",
"Muy agradecido, hay un tema que algunas funciones no estan permitidas via movil como foros y algunas tareas, espero lo resuelvan pronto igual vale 5 estrellas :D",
"The editors of this app should add a save to read later kind of option, even if it has to take some sort of memory because sometimes internet is not available. If this option is there will someone guide me to it.",
"Please add reminder notification for deadlines for quizes and projects for pertiular courses. It should be like, you can make on/off for notification. You can also set time for remiinder for it like one day before or 4 hours before.",
Super...,

"Good way download lectures for offline viewing. Missing several featues which would make a big difference. Speed of playback is fixed - can't speedup or slow it down, Screen has to be on during playback, which prevents background listening with screen locked or off. No way to take notes while listening. Latest version puts big icons in the way on pause screen, making it hard to read paused slides.",
"This app lets you download and save all of the videos for offline viewing -- very handy for when you're killing time without wifi. It doesn't let you do much more than look at content, but that's enough for me.",
Better then other apps for coursera. But it crushes time to time I hope the update helps,
Wonderful music theory course from University of Edinborough. Well organized  and amazingly friendly considering the numbers of students and distances. Teachers/Profs are  professional. I really felt part of a class.  DIfficult material.  This Is not an easy course.,
Thank you for such a great app. It would be great if there is an ability to speed up/slow down video as it is done in the web application.,
"I love being able to have university and college courses to independently study, and the classes are free. The only thing I don't like is that some of the videos don't work and glitch when trying to watch.",
"I spend so many hours on the Coursera site, I might as well have it as an app on my phone!  :) Being able to speed videos up would be even more awesome.",
"The addition of Chromecast support (although a bit flaky sometimes,  at least on my old Lenovo tablet) is nice. If there were support for the discussion forums, then it will be much better (an unofficial app had that IIRC)",
Stops playing on the chromecast when the screen goes off. Do try out plex to understand how it's been implemented,
This is a great app. What I would like to see is adding speed control to be able to watch lectures with faster speed.,
"As useful and functional as the main site. Amongst the recent features, Chromecast support takes the cake.",
Started getting spam to the unique email I used to sign up.,
"Amazing, spread knowledge all over the world, great idea, great mission, thank you Coursera's staff",
I can see where I could watch video. I has click on the course but it always show course info instead showing video. Am I right?,
In video quizzes will not submit my answers. I always get an error message. :\ fix that and this is easily a five star app!,
Thanks for listening devs! You guys rock.,
+1 for the Chromecast support! But it is still buggy on downloaded sessions management.,
Very good course app. With preload vifeo lecture!,
I want to be able to see and respond in the forums from my smartphone. Can you help me with that? Thanks in advance...,
This update had made it a lot faster.,
It makes everything easier!!!!!! We don't need to be near a pc to move forward with our courses,
Could have been even better if I could save the videos on external SD card on KitKat. Aren't the videos released under cc license?,
Very slick. Saves so much time over the web interface.,
"the courses are easy to find and good to watch, for the UI, awesome, just love it.",
I'm downloading it now! Finally! I've been waiting for something like this!,
Fantastic app and incredible opportunity for learning on the go!,
The time when colleges go bankrupt.,
I being able to watch my courses on my phone when I'm away from my computer. 10/10,
Great to have Chromecast. Five stars now.,
Fitting to the remarkable quality approach of Coursera!,
It provides easy access to great lectures.,
"Please, keep improve the interface. Sort by language, date time and etc.",
A sincere thanks to the developer,
The world needs more education apps,
Please add video speed controls,
"Please fix the app, I can't watch video after update.",
please add move to sd card for video downloads,
You rock!,
"Thanks, latest update implemented all features I needed.",
"It would be nice that the app make everything in the course accessible, e. g.  lecture notes",
"Upd6: Still same error: ""Can't play the video"" (( Whyyyyyy? Why you don't fix it, guys? You can do it, I believe!",
Thank you so much....,
Great learning experience,
Very nicely done,
Very useful,
Nice,
Excellent app,
Good,
Thank you!!,
Free,
I love this app! But I wish you can save the courses you want to take that are coming soon. There are many courses I want to take but I have to screen shot it so I remember it . It would be nice if I can put them somewhere when they do have a set date.,
"Excellent app, excellent service",
"This is one of my favorite apps, which is why I'm taking the time to provide feedback, hoping to see more improvements in near future:  * At the end of a segment, the video player automatically skips to the next segment. This is an annoyance in most cases, and should be user-configurable.  * Once you click on a segment, it is marked as viewed and there is no way to undo that. When taking multiple courses, it is tedious to figure out your resume point each time, especially when the video player tends to play segments you may not want to watch yet (see above).  * If you hit the back button in middle of a video and then return to the video, it starts over instead of resuming where you left.  * User-interface relies on tiny buttons, which are especially difficult to click on tablets and smartphones. Some examples are the video download button and the new 10-second-rewind button.",
Lecture Videos seem to take forever to load... rest all is fine,
"As a strong believer in continued professional development, coursera flawlessly merges affordable learning with cutting-edge tools on an extremely portable platform, synchronized across all devices. The latest Chromecast ability is the cherry on the icing",
Thank you for developing this great app,
"Really nice app, quite easy to use.",
Useful,
Data is stored in phone internal memory,
can't watch videos!!,
Really fast development and the app works great.,
Yepiee .awsome stuff,
Increasingly Unstable,
Keep learing ....,
First aid,
"Would love feature to keep videos playing with screen closed, as well as option to submit assignments in app. Also option to auto download current course materials when on wifi, and reminders to sign up for pending courses (listed as coming soon) when they allow sign-ups. As mentioned in other postings, notifications would be awesome for new material posts as well as finished assignments, and deadline reminders.",
Before this app I had different one that worked better for me ( now it's not working anymore). Mostly I miss a possibility to save downloaded video-lectures to file specified by me. Now it takes a lots of space on my much smaller internal memory and it's impossible to cast on TV when I want to watch downloaded lecture with my friends. Please fix it.,
"Unfortunately I just found out that any quizzes embedded in the video lectures, are not shown when watching lectures in the app... This is really a let down, back to watching in Chrome. Also I would love to add it to the multiple screens options on my Samsung devices so I can take notes while watching..",
"Use the website. It's less stupid. If you don't download the video, it won't resize it to fit your screen. It also won't allow you to pause. So basically you have to download all your videos if  you want to be able to pause  it or just watch it without the need to scroll around on the page. If you try to open up a blank page,  nothing appears. And it won't appear neither.",
The app is very good. Have been waiting for the app for long. The download videos for offline viewing is a great boon. But the video should get downloaded to SD card as internal memory is generally low. My phone has an internal memory of only 2 GB and one week's videos take about 300mb. Also the sound is also pretty low. Difficult to hear while traveling. But all in all a good app.,
"The Coursera app is almost perfect, if it were not for this important detail:  No ability to set data (videos) to download to SD Card data.  Coursera videos being HQ and heavy on data, this represents a huge problem when device memory is limited, which is the case for the majority of users and devices.  Even tricking the Coursera app to install on the SD card does not solve the content data still being downloaded into the regular device memory.",
The app functions well. The videos don't take long to buffer and it doesn't stop when you rewind it a bit. But the app should have the pop up questions for the video. That feature is still missing. The app should also try and feature quizzes for the non - signature track courses as it's easy to keep up with the weekly course work.,
"About the only thing it does properly is play video lectures, although the popup questions dont work. You cant reach any readings it seems. As you get to the page with the link to the reading there is no way to open it. Taping the link does nothing. All in all its a good app if you just need to watch your lectures, but not enough to finish a whole course. Its a poor supplement and no supstitute to a laptop :-\",
"This app is great ,but I can't download or play any video in China. And it gives me this Toast message. Error(1,-1004) during playing video.  I my device is nexus5,and I have turn on ART .  Hope the coursera team could see this review, and fixed it asap.",
"It is such a great idea, I love it! The only downside is how much of a struggle it is to run the app on my phone. The videos will say that it has pop up quizzes but I can't see them or it will pause to see how you answered on a previous quiz but you can't see that either. Or when you are doing an assignment and it has pop up instructions, they don't fit the screen so you can only see half of it and you can't even zoom in or out or even up or down. There's no way to minimize the screen.",
Downloaded videos don't go to the SD card or a specified location (you can't open then in your own preferred video player). The video player you have to use doesn't offer the ability to speed up the video (2x etc) so if the instructor speaks very slowly you can't speed things along.,
"I'm using the app on my iPad and everything is great apart form one thing: my current and most important course doesn't load. It's been 4 weeks already, and all I see is an instroduction  by the professor. All other courses work fine. Updating doesn't help.",
"It is a very useful application ..  it saves time and makes me learn anywhere, anytime .. but i'm facing a serious problem in storing videos. all downloaded files use the phone storage which is usually smaller than the external storage .. and it makes the phone storage running out which causes many problems in the operating system .. ( android ) ..",
"I use a MotoG and mostly I've found the app to be very useful and smooth. The MotoG doesn't use removable storage, so I don't know if saving location is still an issue.  I only have one suggestion: Please allow me to keep listening when I turn off the screen. Many courses only intermittently require looking at the slides and if I could turn off the screen, I could more easily listen to lectures on the go, which would be terrific!",
"I'm a Coursera junkie and have been anxiously awaiting the Coursera app for Android for a long time. Now that it's here, I have mixed feelings. The app is a good start, and certainly better than nothing, but it really needs some work to reach its potential.  The good: - Lets you download videos for later offline viewing, even allowing you to ""download all"" with one tap. - Gives all the functionality of the website, with some of it offline  The bad: - The interface takes some getting used to. Pressing the device's options button does nothing. (The options menu can only be opened by selecting a button within the app interface.) - There is no way to save downloaded content to an SD card?? Wow. - No integrated calendar with quizzes, deadlines, etc. This seems like it should have been a no-brainer - NO LANDSCAPE MODE!  It's a good start. I hope that Coursera continues to bring some improvements to make the app easier to use and more powerful.  Edit: Now you only view videos. You cannot participate in required polls, take quizes, etc. 1 star.",
"I'm glad there's an app, but in order for it to be useful it should be functional. I can't download any of the documents or open any links from the pages.  It's unorganized and needs to be more responsive.  The app need a lot of improvement because it is difficult to navigate through a course when I'm unable to open any the documents the professors provides on the pages.",
"Good app! Easy to use and even allow you to download the videos. However there are still some issues: for some course, click on the   hyperlink in course page to download materials will just lead to error, and there is no way to unenroll a course ( or at least I didn't find it ).",
"SD Card storage was apparently not thought of during the writing of this app. Not really sure who could miss something like that with such large files! Also, turning off the screen just stops the video from playing. Have no idea why this would occur. Many videos on Coursera are just lectures and can be listened to quite effectively without having to waste power running the screen. Can't really get beyond these two incredible oversights to review any of the other apps features.",
"Video doesn't fit correctly on my screen. Makes it difficult to see certain notes and take certain quizzes. Please have an option to select full screen that fits. Plus, it doesn't seem that I can view any PDF files from lectures.",
"I've just spent half an hour completing a quiz - and it says ""You are not logged in"". I've logged in, and it is spinning for half an hour. Back button doesn't work. On the web the quiz shows as not complete.  Downloading offline often fails for no reason. And even when downloaded - you first have to get through title like ""Week 1"", and when you click on it, it says ""You are offline"" The videos are hidden somewhere, so you are forced to use a built-in player that does not remember your position and doesn't allow you to change speed. So it is good that Coursera finally has the app, but at this step it is not much more useful than just using the web.",
I was about to go spend a king's ransom on guitar lessons and you guys have put together such an amazing course in introductory guitar. I didn't think I would learn how to do fingerstyle so quickly but it was easy! Thanks sooo much :),
"Links within the course won't open, for example, on clicking ""click here"" for the required readings,  nothing happens. And like has been pointed out, the app needs to let users store video in external sd card. Also, the videos should be in a standard formart playable by other video player apps as well. I'd very much appreciate if that app substituted rather than complimented the website (which is  not mobile-supported btw).",
"Hi, I have downloaded the videos of my currently enrolled course. Before the last update, even without internet connection when I clicked on the course it would open videos from my downloaded videos, but now when I click on the course week, it gives error that you do not have internet connection and have not downloaded videos, even though the videos are downloaded on my phone. Going to download manager works, and I am able to see the videos from there.  I am using Moto G.   Please look into the matter and do the needful.  Regards.",
"The actual app is fairly poorly designed tho obvs coursera content is great. A lot of features like useful pdf viewing, effective downkoading and organization, organization of courses when browsing, playingvideos at x2 speed etc are missing. Hoping it is still being worked on!",
"Attempted to look at course documents.  Does not work: ""Error authenticating with Coursera server""",
"I cannot use the app to watch any content. Everytime I click a class, I get a 400 HTTP error. GS4.",
"Real nice interface and no issues so far, but please add chromecast support. Would make it so much better",
"As many have voiced here, videos lectures are huge, but it appears there is no support for external sdcard.",
"The only problem I have is the size of lecture videos. There should be an ability to crop it or watch in full screen mode. Please, fix it. Device: Galaxy S4 i9500",
"Overall this app works really well for me, and I do recommend it as the best app out there for using Coursera on a mobile. However, when I download lectures, it saves them to the phone's internal storage, not to the much larger external card storage (which is where apps are meant to save larger amounts of data). As a result, I can only download 1-2 lectures at once before storage fills up.  Coursera developers, please fix the storage location issue! It really makes this app hard to use. Otherwise I love it!",
"I can't do the writing assignments through my phone and it's kinda frustrating since I can't be home all the time when I write them. Other than that, it's amazing.",
"When video is playing only thing I can see is black screen and subtitles, I can hear audio too.",
"When browsing courses, it would be nice to have a link to the full website, which has a lot more info about the course. Right now I have to share the link with Google Keep, and then click the link there to go to the website.",
#Can't open PDF files. # app is still not completely mobile friendly. # Difficult to use discussion groups.,
Just installed this a while ago and got to browse thru the courses list. Lots of courses from classical to futuristic. Should help me recapitulate all that I have forgotten from my college days or ones I never relished then.,
I just downloaded this app. It seems to have some pretty interesting courses. BUT one thing is missing. .. There is no way to link it to my Google Calendar for reminders. .. how do you set a reminder through the app??? Also needs to be able to have a save to SD option. A very simple request for a great app! ! Then I'll give it 5 stars!!,
"I tried to watch video of lecture. But I have got black screen without any image. There is sound, subtitles, but there is no picture.",
"I find this application very good, although having to watch the videos off my mobile phone is a bit of a bore. And the fact that I cannot copy the video files to my PC and watch them from PC it's just ridiculously absurd.  Hence why I give it 2 stars.",
Need to know how to drop a class.  FAQs need to be better indexed.  Wonderful idea and I love it. ..but help me drop a class!,
Just a small suggestion. An option to save the downloaded video lectures to external SD card instead of internal memory would be a lot better.,
Everything is great except the ability to access forums on mobile device. I just love keeping up with the comments :),
When I hit submit it then told me that I wasn't signed up for any courses.  Logged back in and completed quiz.  Should check for authentication before presenting quiz questions.,
"I see aft of propaganda from a lot of liberal universities.... I.E. climate change (global warming), Evolution /Big bang theory (which is full of holes you can drive a rnac truck through it and not to mention it is a religion). where are the alternatives to these psuedo sciences?",
"I really enjoy Coursera and the app is a great start, but some obvious problems have not been addressed. 1. Videos should be downloaded to the SD card, as internal memory is way too small to accomodate even one course. 2. No calendar function for deadlines, etc. 3. No settings! How is that possible?",
I've got error 400 on Unit 2 and now I can't reload it. cool interface,
"This app could be a hit. I have not taken a class yet, but it seems promising and could really help me out educationally, since I've just graduated from highschool and have yet to attend college.",
Crashes sometimes. Doesn't load course text pages. Rotates screen. Not a great experience. But great concept :) Fix issues on tablets for 5 stars. EDIT: Please follow Android Design Guide and add more features.,
"After working through a quiz and submitting my answers, the app gave a log in error. I had to do the quiz again on my laptop.  Being able to download lectures to the app is great.",
"After I registered a course, I can't see the video tutorial, it's black screen, although I can hear the voice. Please help, thanks",
With this app anyone can learn anything . the app is very good just instal and become a learner till last breath.....,
I always get an error message when I click on the play button. Can't play videos even if I download them.,
This app needs to let user decide where to download the videos. Otherwise it's just a space hog.,
The limitation of saving videos to 'phone storage' has really irritated me. I was forced to delete all my videos as my storage space simply ran out... Better to use the desktop site and download videos directly from YouTube...,
"I am doing a course online on my laptop. I downloaded app to do the work when I'm out and about and the apps days ""coming soon""...  -_-  5 stars once it's fixed.",
"It allows viewing the courses you're enrolled in and watching and downloading all its video contents to watch it any time which is great. However, it still lacks accessing the forums and allowing homework and quizz submissions. I would give it 5 stars if it does.",
It does what it's supposed to do and works flawlessly on my device. User profile and settings are missing though. Also categorization looks a bit messy. Some courses are listed under several unrelated categories.,
"SD storage is a must, sorry I am a bit disappointed from otherwise great application",
I tried many ways to see the videos... I see only black screen with audio.  Please help,
I can't get through my course on my phone because the videos won't load. That and the quiz are the only thing for my class so pretty much pointless right now,
love this app but it takes too much device memory the downloaded items are stored in device memory. So please add option to move app to internal storage. Or to set the download path please...,
"The unique problem is a miss function for per assignment. Without this, everything is fine and better than website.",
"I'm really enjoyed Coursera content and amazing courses presented. I want to report a few issues with Android mobile application:  1. Videos downloaded for offline access cannot be played - I see error: Error (1, -1004) during playing the video - when trying to play downloaded videos.  This is really annoying as I cannot use your app when I'm offline - and this is important feature for countries where mobile internet is not as good as in US/UK.  2. This is not an issue but rather a suggestion for improvement. When video is downloaded for offline use - it is no longer associated with course and it is not clear which order it should be played.  There was Coursera Companion app on Play market (cannot find it now), they just indicated in normal courses list view which videos are available in offline mode. This is much better then confusing downloads menu item on existing app.  Best regards and keep doing a good job!",
"Was so excited about it, but I can't even download it. I have roughly 500MB available on my phone, and this app is some 8MB, but each time I try to download it, an error message pops up saying insufficient storage space.  Can someone help me on this?",
Videos do not work but the courses are good you just have to use a desktop computer to look at them.,
"I cannot play lecture video on both my Nexus 7 and Galaxy S3. Im always on the go, need a mobile way of learning but end up not knowing how to study now...",
I love this app. As well as educational video that I can watch anywhere. So I guess I recommend you getting this app especially if you want to learn new and different things in different areas of education.,
"It's great that you now have an app, but the lack of landscape view for videos makes it near-useless to me.",
"The courses may be great. But unfortunately I can't use the app because the font in Coursera courses is super tiny mini on my tablet. Even if I change the system font to huge, the Coursera font won't change at all.",
It use to work but I can't watch or download anything on my s5 anymore,
I've tried on multiple android devices without success.  A core functionality that doesn't work.,
So downloading is almost useless. Add this feature please.,
"Only missing the option to download the course material and the possibility of playing the lectures in another player. Other than that, it's really good!",
App is good. Need to have a confirm password option during sign up to avoid typo errors.,
Coursera is such a great site and I love that I can keep up with things on my phone and tablet.,
"I was very enthusiastic with this, as I spend a lot of time commuting to work and back, but I get an error whenever i try to play a video lecture (1, -1004), thus making this app unusable :(",
The app constantly shows toolbar to install Coursera app from Google play on Android 4.4.4. The layout often breaks and switches to PC version of the website.  And please add video saving to SD card.,
The only reason I don't use this app and instead just go to the website and download the videos is so I can speed them up like I can on the website.,
"I have 3 coming up and I already see issues I'm going to have...no calendar integration, no download to sd (even though I have 65gigs on the cloud/drive NOT THE POINT) please add these functions.",
"I am deeply appreciative of the concept behind this application. Free education is a massive massive thing. I must admit though that during a video the app will crash fairly consistently, especially when trying to interact with any of the controls.",
"* no quizzes inside lectures  * no fast playback  * most of the pages look like the desktop version   Overall, this app offers little incentive to choose it over the desktop version on Chrome mobile.",
"Generally mobile app is used to keep track of courses and related assignments and quizzes. This app doesn't provide any support to keep track of quizzes or programming assignments. That can help me to remind and complete my work properly. This app should have a ""add to calendar"" feature.",
Please let downloaded media be saved in the SD card. Its not year 3000 and still our devices have very few megabytes in their internal memories. Let everybody enjoys the juice.,
"Sprint Galaxy S5 - Downloaded, gives error on installation. Unknown",
It works well but only deserves 5 stars if it allows to save vids to ext sd card.,
The downloaded videos use phone's internal memory which is quite less and not sufficient enough to have videos of even one complete course. Pls include feature of storing videos in SD card.,
"I download a lot of material from this app. Hopefully that I can save them in my SD card. Sadly, there's no feature to do that.",
"Everything you could want from online classes, minus calendar integration... And getting getting the actual credits.",
"First of all, coursera app has a 'use coursera app' popup when you open a homework or a test page. It also errors out when you turn off your phone while answering the test questions and then trying to submit the answers... I think it loses connection with the server.",
The app is decent and allows you to take the course content on the road.  Pros: - Video download for offline viewing  Wishlist: - Download slides - View videos at accelerated rate - Lock the screen while viewing videos - Ability to save downloads on SD card or external storage instead of internal storage - Option to auto advance to next option,
"Basic things like saving courses which are coming soon, better categorization of courses etc. Will change rating upon update.",
I would wait for sorting out the storage issue and the forums access to give better rating.,
"To enable offline viewing, the application saves the content to internal memory. Can't move to SD card. A deal breaker. Simply unusable without this feature.",
"It worked for a few days.  Now when I try to play a lecture video an error occurs. error(1,-1004) during playing video Maybe they will fix their application. Samsung Galaxy Note II",
Only problem is being able to access the forums on mobile version..,
But for one thing - no option to download lectures to external memory,
"Download starts and it pop's with error msg - ‚Äùinsufficent storage""  But My Storage space is more than 1 GB.  Kindly suggest me how to resolve this issue.  TIA  Ashok",
"In videos page sound plays ok, but only black screen appears.",
"Lots of great subjects with great structure. Room for improvement though. Push updates for deadlines, access to forums, and alerts for responses on forums are all features I expect to be added.",
Clogs up space on internal phone storage.,
Need zooming in on lecture videos to read small in-lecture text (urgent for phone sized screens) and playback speed controls.  Or let us choose an external player like coursera companion used to.  Potential for greatness.,
"I was looking forward to installing this application but it is a major disappointment. Videos are sound only on my phone (4.0) and they are only downloaded to a hidden folder on the phone (cannot be moved to the SD card). This, unfortunatelly, renders the application entirely useless. Hope the Coursera team will fix this soon.",
It is nice to be able to watch courses on mobile but to get there you need to login. Please tell me why are you pushing google accounts to login? It may save a precious 2 or 3 seconds to those that use Gmail addresses on coursera and annoy the hell out of everyone who doesn't,
The app is nearly flawless.  It just needs to integrate some important elements of the site into it. But it's understandable that all apps in the beginning are work in progress. For this reason I give it a five.,
I really liked it and wouldve given it 5 stars but now it's not working; the error above keeps popping up when I try to watch a video and I've reinstalled it already. Please fix!!,
"Signed up for courses in business and mgmt. It's great and it's FREE.  Almost too good to be true but don't believe me, try it yourself and see...",
"Really easy to use app for learning. No need to bring laptop, all coursera courses can be accessed from this beautiful app! Really appreciate this innovation",
Great app for learning different courses free and also it provides the video tutorials for each course. Good work guys üòäüòÄ‚ò∫üòÅ,
"This would be awesome, but nothing will load on my tablet. The course will come up but not the videos, quizzes , or anything after that.",
"Save lectures for offline viewing is an awesome feature... but some times even though I save lecture video classes.. it some times prompts that there is no offline content available n it never opens that weeks classes offline on my nexus 10, I have to find a hotspot, delete n redownload that classes... it wud be more awesome if we wud have play speed adjustment in the app, that we currently have on the website",
Please add an auto play function to this application.  With auto play it is much more convenient to listen to classed for people on the road.  It is dangerous for people have to press the next button in order to play next video.,
"It's a great app, but on lower end devices, there need to have an option to store downloaded videos onto the SD card, as lower end devices tend to have very littler internal storage space.",
No option to select where you want the video lectures to get downloaded in your device.  Does it in the internal storage by default. Very important to fix this problem.,
you make our lives easier and more enjoyable. Thanks a lot,
I'm trying to find where the downloaded videos are stored to manage mobile memory.       Not able to locate the backup folder,
Cannot play video on my Huwaei mobile phone.,
It's just sad that we didn't have something like this in the 90s.,
"Occassional errors aside, this app is a must-have for learners on the go!",
Can't even watch the videos just shows a loading sign,
"App provides core functionality and has a nice UI, but until video speed options are added, it's not worth using, since I can get through lectures 1.5x faster on the website.",
Excellent app landscape works fine for me the classes so far are fun and very insightful.  A calendar would be a cool addition but I can add it into my own calendar keep up the great work!,
"it's a great start, but the video player is completely inoperable. keep getting the same error message and no visual.",
"but useless on my phone. If I download just 1 week of videos, my storage space is full. There should be an option to download videos to SD card!",
Please add the ability to categorize the downloads by course. Otherwise all the downloads just mix.,
Please add the feature of downloading to SD card. When you do it I will rate the app 5 stars.,
So stupid every time I pick a course the screen goes black,
"I took the quiz, but doesn't have options to review. Also download video to sd card is needed. Forms and embedded video quiz is important.",
I've had fun and also learned a lot with this app. It is very useful for me. Thank you.,
On my Huawei y300 when I select the week of a course it crashes.,
It seems that I need special codecs for video...,
"Great app definitely a 5 star, but the 1 less star is for the notification. Notifications for course starting and assignments dead line",
I really expect and believe that this app could give me a lot but it is showing video errors and its not playing nor online neither offline.,
There are issues in download functionality. Downloading does not complete in one go. Need to visit multiple times and start downloading. Also there should be option to save on sd card.,
Would be better if provided options to speed up and slow down the video,
Very good designed app but misses some important features. Option to copy or share videos with other devices and video player with speed settings,
I have been amazed how this experience has been so rewarding and easily available. Tnx gk,
did not expect it to be so useful. classroom on the go. good job coursera!,
Its nice but I can't see any videos and can only hear audio.pls fix this,
Nice app ...you don't need to browse the internet to get ur video...u just get it here..bt the only thing is they should work with current courses stuff,
This is the best thing for people who want to learn! I love all of the professor's who make this videos,
A great app for those who want to sharpen their minds.,
There should be forum discussions as well. PDF download of slides is absent. Otherwise gr8 app,
the download video will full if you have not much space,
Absolutely fantastic. What a great way to keep your brain in shape! Can't Wait to start my new courses &lt;3,
"However, I miss the discussion forum and the interactive lecture quizzes. Implement this and it's five stars.",
"I can't view the videos. Can u guys please fix the bug, make the videos which are universally playable",
App does not show the video on my android phone.,
There's no calendar. No way of tracking deadlines within the app. There's no access to exercises from within the app as well.,
I haven't used the app yet but I truly love coursera and I'm really happy I can now use it on my phone so 5 stars for bringing coursera to the google store :3,
"The major problem is the downloaded files cannot be managed or moved to sd 
card.",
"No support for some things like assignments, so still need a PC for that...",
"Think its important for this app to spread about as much as possible, hence the 5 star rating.",
useless until fixed  .  0 stars,
Help need this app,
Job well done! No ads. No bugs. Definitely learning always on the go. Courses are really interesting and cant wait to learn more!! Keep up the good work guys!,
"except the videos wont play, download or direct on my Sony... Then whats the use of it at all.. . Ill be using it directly from the web for now.. Pls fix whatever the prob is cuz not many user has this prob..",
Can hear only audio no video ..pls help,
Useful and very comfortable to watch your classes lectures and exercises. Improve your knowledge with this app.,
Need to restart the app after pause because error occurs,
Not able to see the video. Only audio is available.,
Still waiting for playback speed control. Need to use additional software now for this.,
This is one of the most useful app i've ever seen.,
"Its a good start but needs some work with bluetooth controls, more settings particularly where to save the vieos, and problems with video playback after turning off the screen.",
I get an error saying that the video can't be played or error playing video,
This is simply brilliant. I love knowledge and this app is perfect - can I host course on here as well? Please get back to me.,
I'm a high school student wondering if these class credits could be used on my transcript?,
"Not able to view video on chromecast, please help",
Hi... I have forgetten my password... how to login to my account,
it's better use web app on tablet,
Says Network Error and cannot connect.,
"I love Coursera, and this app is incredibly awesome.",
This is the best MOOC app and has the best content .  Just love it!!,
But not good for more language,
It says I'm not connected to the internet.,
"Worthless if videos don't work.  Can watch fine on website, not sure what the problem with this app is.",
"The best MOOC platform. I love it. Thank you, guys!",
"The app crashes, when there is a call.",
I like it so far but I would like it if you could download the transcript,
It really helps a lot :) thank you,
This is a serious bug! What's the point of downloading videos if you can't access them without internet connection?,
"App is very slow, not loading the contents for a long time.. Don't install this..",
Excellent app to further your own education.,
Wonderful app for people looking to increase intellect by watching lectures.,
"All videos are downloaded to memory, not to SD card. Unsuable",
Can't retrieve lost password,
Thank you so much Coursera. This app is awesome,
It is great. I wish I could post to the discussion forums through the app.,
This is an amazing application for those people who love learning.,
Videos are not being played . Only the vocals are being heard.  Please look into this.,
Its just superb app for study and growth in any type of skills.,
This app promotes and inspires you to study and develop yourselves....,
The best educational app all over the world,
"Error(-1,1004) please fix I can't watch the videos.",
It would be a great to watch videos on my TV vs phone or computer.,
"I've downloaded all of videos of week 1 of ML class, when i download videos of week 3, i cant watch week 1 videos again!!!!!",
"This makes it much easier, I can download the videos and view them offline later!",
Very good app. But sound is not audible. Can increase it's sound quality.,
Didn't work after upgrade. I am angry because it's works very smoothly. Why are you forced upgrading?,
The fascinating lectures with subtitles are fit for beginning learner.,
More than Exellent .. just for addictive learner really Love it,
Allow All Applications Folder and the best Apps maximum 100%net‚Ñ¢,
Many interesting subjects for visual learning by professional teachers.,
I will rate higher when auto screen rotation is enabled.,
I can practice my English skill with this I love this cousera &lt;3,
Cannot play lecture videos on Galaxy 10.1.,
I love it. Its making it easy for mr to do activities and participate.,
Many thanks giving iranians the opportunity to use Google play,
I woulf highly recomend it to those who follow their corriousity,
Proud of coursera!!  Tons of  knowledge  for free,
I love all the online courses offered here,
A very useful feature would be to categorize courses by level,
The app is professionally developed. Good job,
One of the best apps in the Google play! And free.,
Please add Chromecast support!,
"A well-designed useful and easy-to-use app, much like the website itself. It's a good start, but needs improvements such as ""Settings"", ""My Profile"" page, an autoplay option, etc. But I'm convinced these will be added with time. Terrific job guys, keep it up!",
superb! but might use a few improvements: speeding up videos (like on the site) for instance,
"Videos aren't playing on my galaxy s3. Otherwise, this would be 4 stars",
Its really great.  MOOC in mobile.,
"FREE University Level Coursework, Incredible!",
It is missing the video markers like in video quizzes,
I love this app so much! Thank u!,
Finally got the Chromecast support!!!!,
Since my Samsung S3 upgraded to Kit Kat the Coursera app has been shutting down intermittently causing the phone to restart,
Great App. Excellent organisation!,
An app that will really help non-dumb people.,
Simple to use..fantastic,
You can find a lot of courses,
Even for offline studies,
Works fine ado far,
But I don't find my stuff always,
Why I can't watch or download past courses? And what about saving files to SD card? I give a 5 star if you add these functions.,
Free education!!!! Priceless,
Great learning tool! Works flawlessly.,
This is really wonderful app. Thanks for your efforts.,
Knowledge is power! So learn more,

But the app needs to be able to do a lot more to match browser experience PDF and txt download option and most importantly the ability to play video on 3rd part players pls make the needed chang,
Have been waiting for this. Still waiting for Connexus.,
What the hell the downloaded videos are saved in the in internal apps memory! Are you crazy!,

ŸáŸÖ ÿØÿßÿ±Ÿáÿü,
Videos downloaded only to device's memory? No option to move to SD card ??? Are you kidding me???  And Coursera is supposed to teach you things :))))),
Very cool program. Recommend it.,
Can't ask for more.  Awesome.,
Really does need Chromecast support.,
Pls add courses of equity/stock analysis,
Move downloads to SD card & calendar integration needed,

"O Coursera, al√©m de ser uma fonte inestim√°vel de conhecimento para o mundo inteiro, acertou em cheio neste aplicativo. Voc√™ pode inclusive baixar os v√≠deos (muito rapidamente) e assisti-los offline. √â Assessibilidade e Democracia de informa√ß√£o no seu sentido mais puro! Espero que n√≥s brasileiros desenvolvamos cursos como os deles.",

Great application.,
"The layout is definitely minimalist.  It makes it hard to understand where everything is.  Either I am completely missing it or the quiz and quiz info isn't included.   Both the app and site sould include tracking of where I am in a video.  I often lose my place and it is marked as watched when the video isn't complete.   Also the forum isn't included.   The app seems to be for people who use both a computer and the app so far.  It's easier than using the website on my phones browser, so three stars.",
"I won't continue taking any courses here, at least through your app, because it's just giving me problems when I take a quiz, the app make me think it's done, but when I refresh or go to your web page, the quiz is like if I haven't do nothing, but of course it takes the time and the attempt. As soon as you fix this, I'll appreciate in fact",
"Enjoy Coursera on the computer, wish I could on android as well but no such luck (LG optimus L7 ii dual, P716). Can't play video streaming; able to download but won't play from there either. Also can't find way to send feedback of video error (fullscreen). FAQs don't open. Hope these things can be fixed soon",
"I waited for this app to happen. However, the video is not playing. The audio is ok but all I see is a black screen. I downoaded the videos but they're still black. I wish i can play it in my own video player so i can adjust the video settings if it wont be fixed. In this way, I think I can adjust the video/picture manually. Thanks!  Updated and videos still not working Updated, still not working",
"I didnt know about this app before.If I would have known, I would have finished all my computer science courses.Great work guys.Why dont you get some award for this outstanding app . absolutely no complaints.The user can even download the courses videos for offline viewing, thats amazing too.I suggest you add more computer science/game designing/game programming videos..",
"You have to go to ""My Downloads"" to access the downloads. You can not go to the course and click on a video to watch it offline. If you downloaded a whole lot of courses, the video file names may not be helpful.  Also please add speed control for the video playback speed.",
Please add:  1. Video playback from same point one stopped viewing (also across devices)  2. Option to play audio track only and let it continue while switching apps and turning screen off 3. Chromecast support,
"This is a great app. I think the design, layout and the overall content is excellent. I'm glad that many universities worldwide have taken part in making this a success. I just have one question? If I wanted to join a course but it has already started how will the grading work? Will I be deprived from a decent grade because I joined a couple week late and missed some work? When I joined Coursera, a couple of classes were already a few weeks in. Please can you help me with this issue. Thank you.",
Despite all good design it has a very critical shortage. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MOVE THE APPLICATION TO SD CARD!!! Also it is not possible to choose the download folder for videos. This shortage makes the usability of the application highly degraded if you use it on the move frequently.,
Doesnt work on background so if you open another app during lecture. Bam. The app reloads and starts from the beginning. Need an update for that. Other than that the UI and design is perfect.,
It simply crushes when I'm opening course materials. Very disappointed.,
"I love this app.  The only thing it is missing is a download all button.  I'd love to choose to download the entire week or entire course if I wanted to along with just the individual videos.  If that would get added, this app would be unstoppable.",
"It shows me error at the time of whatching any video,example:  error ( -38, 3748688) when paying etc. It would be good if the problems is resolved .",
"I am not able to view the video lectures. When I click on the play button, the audio starts playin but the video doesn't.  Please help. I am using coursera on galaxy core.",
"After you start a video, everything stops and you can't do anything. Had to restart the tablet.",
Moved to a smaller phone now nothing works :( Videos do play if download fro main site though,
"Great app big step, however we still need to be able to store videos in SD, one course and my storage is full. Keep it up looking forward to the changes and updates",
Brilliant initiative and great to see them seriously building apps for the mobile devices as well... The video streams beautifully and I can download them to watch offline.   But this app is work in progress and I think it will definitely improve in user exp.,
Thanks for all your deed  You creat the future by education A lot of thanks can not be. equal to your deed,
"this app is a good start towards making the online content truly mobile. Though the app has a lot of ground to cover before receiving 5 stars. Many issues, as told by the reviewers. Dev need to work on those issues asap!",
Overall app quality is very good. Just one problem (I'm not sure if it is already reported): Quizzes embedded in video lectures doesn't let user answer them. Please fix it. Thanks !,
The app should record my progress through the videos or even within a video. It should resume the video from the last position I stopped watching. Like the kindle app for books.,
"The antivirus system original inside of Huawei Mate 9, send a alert ""This app contains a virus please uninstall"" the virus database it's provided by avast",
"A very good app, but I would appreciate very much, if it was possible, that in-video quizzes also were displayed and functioning",
This app would be truly amazing if only it would save off line content to a SD card.   Please fix this is you really do should get a 5 star rating.,
We need to be able to move the app and its content to the SD card please. Give us this option and it is a 5 star from me. Thanks all the same for this great opportunity to get best education for free. Much greatly appreciated,
"It was more configurable and thus had much less issues. Want to save videos to SD card? No problem. Want to watch video with an external player? Go on.  This one doesn't play video on good old Galaxy Tab 10.1, just black screen and sound.",
The lack of double or 1.5 speed playback (or at least  playback with 3rd party apps) is very frustrating.,
"It's good app, but it doesn't have function of accelerating viewing like your web-player and this is very disappointing. Also sometimes when I push button ""My Downloads"" apps is closing.",
"I have HTC One x, which has a built-in memory. When i download lectures from coursera it saves them in the application storage which made my phone run out of storage. Please allow me to tell the app where to store the lectures.",
Love this app. All the things about it is good and according to my expectations. Thank you coursera team. Keep up the nice work,
Revolutionary education app BUT I dont see why they need permission to view the identity of my phone calls.,
"This is a solid start, but still needs some features. Chromecast support would be great, from any platform if possible. I'd like to be able to set the app's download directory. On the 'My Courses' screen, you should be able to swipe between the three tabs.",
"thank you for the app,  but it is suppose that we can have access to our courses anywhere and anytime,  but some courses puts quizzes into the videos,  actually don't have access to that.  Also can't move app/content to SD card...  this two stuffs will give you 5 stars.",
"Last two updates have been a disaster, since I am mostly mobile I can't watch videos even after downloading!",
"Free education is the most powerful thing, and this app is the key!",
"I'm really glad that I can now take the quiz and watch videos on the go. Offline videos and a clean design. Enhancement: I would like to swipe (left and right) in the view pager for the ""My Courses"" page, to navigate between past, current and upcoming courses.",
"Without getting into the technicalities of the app, the spirit of ""Learning on the move"" deserves 6 stars out of 5 !! Great work Coursera team.",
"Still after the last update im not able to play any video through my HTC desire X with default viewer is really awful, I love coursera, I've got 3 statements of acomplishments but this is really pitty :-(",
I really enjoy following the courses on this app. It would be perfect if I could stream the courses to my TV using chromecast!!,
They should add in the feature of playing the lectures at 1.5 or 2 times speed which is something they have on the coursera website and appstore,
"Easy to use and lesson content awesome, learned lots. Thanks guy's",
"It's nice, but I can't see any of the videos. They do have sound, so I can hear them, but it's not the same.",
Excellent performance if you try to achieve & achieve. Abdul Malik Ghaloo Jacobabad (Sindh),
Could benefit from Chromecast support and social login.,
"For a lifelong learner like me , coursera is like oxygen to me and i am greatful to the team for this app.",
Best courses for free. Also the content of most of the courses are great. Just love the app,
Well done (Y)  Great app!    i need agricultural & biological engineering courses.,
Great selection of courses ranging a wide array of courses worth your time.,
App works great other than this...please fix,
I think this is the best free online lecture provider today.... keep spread knowledge to all people in the world borderless...,
Thank you for this valuable Resources! Keep up good work!,
"Nice app in a lot of ways, but I'd like to be able to move downloaded videos to the SD card before I can give it any higher of a rating.",
This is a great app. I would only ask for Chromecast support.,
Needs option to download videos to SD. Otherwise great app.,
"Great app, great innovation.",
Can't take the in video quizzes! Otherwise is great!,
I love it. I like coursera and it's apps. It is quite helpful.,

I love the fact how the app runs so smoothly and the video player runs without any problems. That's something I always look for in an application. Good job you guys and girls.,
"The screen goes black and I am not able to see the video while the audio is still playing in the background and video the controls are visible. Also, I am not able to participate in any peer assignment from the app as the option to open any peer assignment is greyed out and seems to be unclickable.",
I love coursera and its app. Almost perfect. The problem for me is the coming soon courses I can't join nor a click to be informed when the courses start.,
"It's interface is clean and I love it,but in the videos i get only sound and subs,no image playback,just blackness.i don't know if i did anything but since i'm not sure I'll rate it 3 stars,hope you guys fix it if it's a thing",
Please provide an option to do the quiz..of the course which v have opted. Cannot move it to sd card as well .plz fix it,
"Started Using this program in 9th grade and still, one of the best things that has ever happened.",
Quizes are not shown on video lectures. Also not being able to access course material (Pdfs etc...) is a major drawback.,
I have 1gb of internal storage and some apps can't be moved.  Please add this feature,
I love the download function. I was able to download a few lessons. But then my download was interrupted and now i wasn't able to resume or retry the download. It keeps telling error. Help me please. Thanks. STILL some videos cannot be played or download.,
"User friendly, extremely handy, gave a totally new use for my tablet. Opening of video segments is fast with download possibilities.",
Overall this app is great. It has all the essential features. I'd love if there was an option to speed up or slow down the videos though.,
"Loving the app, you are even  able to watch the videos on there and they kept track from where i had leftoff on PC. I didnt see of tests were working but i give it a 4* for conveniance.",
I vividly recall that awesome moment when I was handed my Coursera Certificate of Accomplishment. To me it was inspiring. To now know that I can equally learn through my mobile device via this wonderful app is overtly inspiring. Thanks to the Coursera Team.,
"Searching ""project management"" leads to totally unrelated topics and even just ""project"" leads to unrelated course which does not even have the word project in any part of the close description. If by any chance you don't have this kind of course, there should not be any result.",
I am in love with coursera and now with the app it just got better.  Learning was never so much fun!  Thank you again Guys!,
It took a while but now that it's here it's such a pleasure to use and pretty much flawless. Only suggestion I have is to add forward and rewind buttons in the player like the android native one has. Good job!,
"Thankfully I can download videos, but while attempting to stream it the video parameters seem to be too large for the screen without any option for full screen. Either way, after downloading it the video works fine.",
Course catalog not useful as it's not possibile to filter by language. Playback speed cannot be increased.,
I have been waiting for an android app from cousera and I must say am more than impressed on this app. The user interface is very neat and lovely. This app deserves more than 5 stars. More greese to your elbow guys. Awesome app.,
"I use a samsung galaxy s duos(GT-S7562).Whenever I start a video,I  only hear the audio and the screen remains black.Please fix this issue.I really want to reap the benefits of having a coursera app.",
"Great app! I really love the fact that i'm able to download it on my device and view it anywhere I want. But the only down side is, I can't extract the downloaded file from my device. Mainly because I can't locate where they're stored. It would be helpful if I can set the download directory to my SD card instead of internal memory. I only have 8GB internal memory on my tablet....",
A heaven for those who believe in knowledge and the power of education. It's like a blessing which deemed upon us in this internet age due to tremendous connectivity. I hope as many people join this and keep learning more.,
I have 400 mb of phone storage in which stock apps are stored and 16 GB of SD storage. The app stores video on my phone storage and that's why I can download hardly one video. Please add option to chose custom download folder thanks.,
"Can't move or save videos to SD card so really annoying, par from that amazing app.",
"Works flawlesly for me in either tablet or phone, love the fact that I can have the videos available offline!",
"There is nothing to fault. Simply flawless! From the app itself to its layout, and that's not saying anything about the idea. Totally recommended for all with an urge to learn and muster more knowledge.",
Please implement the video cache to save the videos automatically without having to mark for download. The OS cache will handle the memory,
Will be better if there's no error during playing video,
It is great that Coursera is providing free education and now an free app to view the courses. But I feel like a few more features can really improve the apps usability.  Features like:  Resuming  a video even after you quit the app or press back (Or allow 3rd party video player like VLC) Changing the playback speed of the video (Or allow 3rd party video player like VLC) Switching Languages In Video Quizzes Chromecast (maybe?)  But overall this is still a great app! Keep up the good work!,
I think Coursera is one of the best projects on the WWW. And they're welcome to Android.,
Beautifully designed respecting android patterns. Fully functional and really fast!! Smooth job!   Thank you very much! I was waiting for this!,
keeps telling me network error.,
I love having this app available since I'm a continous coursera student.,
Totally love it! Now I can even do a bit if study in the bus to work!,
Add an explanation for each permission. Why do you need it and what do you do with it. It's just fair and transparent for the users.,
Pls add support for lecture videos download to sd card without this mobile learning will be limited,
I didn't found how to download lectures on SD card. All other stuff is excelent.,
"I can describe this app and service by using single word ""Incredible"".",
It is an excellent app. I wish i access much more courses via coursera,
Coursera is the best MOOC I have ever seen! Congrats!,
what you need to keep your Brain from Rusting,
Great way to learn and gain knowledge,
Good learning Improve learning methods Need to add even more subjects,
Waited a long time for this app and it did not disappoint!,
'nuff said,
"Great free e-learning app, impressive (academic) content",
Awesome app for free education.,
The best app in my phone,
Awesome app that follows Google Design Guideline,
Awesome 1 for free n top courses,
Simple and to the point. It works.,
The next revolution in open education,
Cannot choose Offline save location,
Finally it comes to the app version. Love it!,
Cant move to my SD card :'(,
Was waiting for the mobile application. Thanks,
Good apps ever!,
Superb! Thanks!,
Thanx keep going,
Great!,

Superb,
Excellent,

Just wow,
Thanks Coursera,
Thanks,
Wow,

"I used to miss deadlines because watching classes was only easy if done on the computer. Now catching up on the go is easy.  My only gripe is that the app should remember the point where you last watched each video, that it support pausing and displaying the in-video quizzes, and that it remember the last video you've seen within the course.",
This is an excellent app which even works offline as my data connection is slow. The only issue is that this app does not provide the actual topics which will be covered in brief or rather the synopsis which gives an idea of the level of difficulty of the course in science or math. Otherwise just another milestone achieved by coursera. Brilliant app no doubt.,
I'm really happy about the app because it makes everything convenient. But please do something about video playing errors. I already tried downloading the videos but it doesn't help. You might want to just let users choose our default players whichever works best. I think that will really help. Please address this ASAP. Thanks!,
"I'm glad you made a native app, but so much is yet missing from it; I'm confident it will improve with time. When playing videos, you don't have the option of changing playback speed, or putting the video in full-screen, or even positioning it so it all appears on the screen (the lefthand third of the video was off of my G2's screen)  A nice to have feature would be for the app to pop-up reminders for upcoming deadlines, and allow the user to configure the time before the deadline to receive the alerts.  All in all, I'm glad there's an app, but I found myself closing it and using Coursera in the browser.",
This app is great. One thing you may improve is to correct -38 error. It happens when I trying to seek video stream. This error comes from wrong state of android media player class. I'll give you five because its free and great. Thanks,
I can get access to the newest android programming courses  and other  courses for free and at any time. And the lectures were given by famous professors from famous schools. Videos are of high quality...to sum up the app is perfect coursera is perfect!,
"This app has changed my life. Being able to seamlessly listen to lectures across devices is so simple, yet fulfilling. Not many apps can make you a better person - this one contributes to your education in a big way. Love it!!",
"So far, I see the usefulness of this app; however, I can't seem to get the videos to play. Therefore, the biggest benefit that I have gained so far is to be able to read the lecture notes and keep up with the schedule. Other than the problem with the videos not playing on the app, this is a useful tool to keep up with what is going on in class.",
Coursera no doubt is the best site in the world. I simply can't afford to pay myself to attend expensive MBA courses while Coursera has solve my pain and give away information for free.  Keep On!,
"I was sad when they took CourseraCompanion down, but I trust this app will catch up soon. I'm particularly missing 1) play with screen off 2) save to SD 3) better organisation of weekly videos",
"Watching the videos was painful in chrome and is much nicer within this app. The experience is now missing the interactive quizzes, though.",
"But one disadvantage of the app is that it does not allow the user to move downloaded video to sd card. I have to clear the cache to free the internal memory. So please fix it, other than it obviously great app",
"Half of the video is playing off screen,  regardless of how I position my phone. If I accidentally get off the video,  I can't get it back.",
I missed many classes because I could not access classwork on the go. I have not tried a course on this app but this is a step in the right direction as many from developing nations will have direct access to courses that otherwise would cost much to do. Keep it up!,
"This review is not going to be helpful. I'm just super excited to have coursera on my mobile. Personalized learning, I say.",
"Great app - but please figure out why screen capture is disabled in video mode.  I like to capture some screens, graphs or slides for notes and this is not currently possible.  Fix for 5 stars.",
"Very handy, full of useful functionality.   Would appreciate the option to filter by language (if I haven't just issued it :-) )",
"It's fairly useful, but you can't access the discussions which are an important part of some courses.",
"Video download works flawlessly, and you can select a sequence of lectures for download at once.  Browsing the courses from the app is also excellent - it is visually appealing, and I found it better to look for classes on the app instead of from the website.",
Look forward to trying it. Need to filter search by language and add ability to see PDF and past course results/certificate.,
"On my device it works just fine, except of more complex tasks (the ones that need PC to complete anyway, like programming)",
Haven't even finished downloading as I write this. 5 stars just because I'm glad they made an app for this!,
Really awesome app. I love being able to download the videos while I'm using wifi so that I can watch them later on the train. Wish I had this for the last course I did.,
Its a very simple minimalistic design and nice. I however think it can be better than this. Keep it up guys. :),
I am going to school but sometimes I want to learn something outside of my degree. This makes it possible for free!,
Its only week old so expecting it will improve fast. I was looking for an option to choose a drive to save the videos.But couldn't find the option.This can be one of the places to work on.,
"Do not click on leave session. It does not close the app, it un-enrolls you from the class you viewed last. It is too easy to make such mistake. Otherwise pretty good.",
I hope to get coursera android app in last sunday. but we do not see video files directly in our country because of not being fast internet connection!,
Have been looking forward to this app. Videos work fine but a speed up feature would be nice,
"It's here at last, the Coursera app for Android! I was enthusiastic at the idea of an app I could use on my tablet and downloaded it at once. But how disappointing! It's a very confused thing, totally useless...",
I'd like to thank the developer team for such a great step in the era of mobile computing. It is very easy to use...,
"A great tool for the development of intellectual capital, the best intangible asset that mankind needs.My appreciation to Coursera and the technology service provider.Thumbs up!",
"The video doesn't work on my RAZR D1. There is only sound when I play. Why cant we use it with our own players, and save the videos where we want?",
Samung galaxy 2 . It keeps saying that i cant connect to the internet even though i can,
1.Their should be an option to choose the storage of videos. All the video are downloaded and kept in internal app memory which quickly fill the phone app storage.  2. The app can also provide  an option to auto do wnload the latest videos of courses enrolled.,
The best way to access knowledge from well established universities around the world. The app is also a great organisational tool for all online lectures you have subscribed to. I would definitely recommend this app to all curious geniuses out there.,
Thanks for launching the app! It would be easier learning things now without missing the class :),
"It works, but missing features.   Cannot download pdf. Cannot view courses offline unless you go look for downloaded videos.  Download ed videos not organized by course. Cannot go to quiz or forum pages..",
Before this app became available. I found my Coursera course extremely difficult to undertake with what I had available.  Kudos to Coursera!!!  I feel empowered to do Coursera again :D,
"Nice app, too bad its missing the forum discussions",
Haven't opened the app yet but I am just glad there is one!,
"Nice clean design,  and makes accessing all of the course content so simple. Would be nice to be able to access the Discussions from the app as well - 5 Stars if / when access to Discussions is added.",
thank you all for making life very easy students. I'm just glad that this app is here.,
This app is excellent. The ability to download lectures and view offline is great if you want to study during a commute. I now have an extra 10 hours a week that I can spend viewing lectures.,
There is an error while trying to play videos on my Huawei G510.,
It looks great but videos can't be downloaded nor streamed in my Motorola moto g (no SD card) so it's useless.,
"Review will Not be helpful, but just wanted to share how HAPPY I am!",
"A great idea for those of us with an android phone, but bug filed on the tablet.",
"I love this app,but the  downloaded videos can't move to the SD card, the APP become larger and larger,  the internal storage space of my phone run out soon, so I uninstall it!",
"Thnx,  coursera, for the app, as hopefully it will make our life easier for all the students there on cousera.",
Often get http 400 error,
"It's one of the best apps for free courses! And there are a lot of topics that I could only learn if I pay for it, so this is my favorite apps of all!!",
I have only used it for video lectures and course discovery. Works better than using the browser.,
"Finally the Coursera app went out to Android, I had been waiting for a while! Now I can study on the chartered bus and during the lunch time, 5(five) star!",
Being able to download content is awesome. Most importantly is that courses are free and with high level content,
"Can't login to my existing account. Says ""Network error.. Please check your connection."" but my connection works fine otherwise. I have reinstalled twice with no success. üò¨üò¨üò¨",
And some profs speak slow!,
I love Coursera and the app works really wellin both my phone and my tablet. One think that would make it perfect would be Chromecast support!,
desperately need the option to move the app to the sd card,
Useful app for all Courserians,
Otherwise a good app. Some more features from the webpage would be nice,
I used to use coursera companion. Hope this will be better.,
Finally!! I hope the app is good. But I am just so glad Coursera is here,
Amazing app overall but I was hoping to save the documents released by the professors as well (not only videos).,
thanks a lot but please let me store lectures on sd card,
This app doesn't seem to allow access to forums or am I missing something? In fact functionality seems quite limited overall. Will stick with Coursera Companion until this one improves.,
This is one great app.. Takes the MOOC experience to a whole new level!,
Come on guys!! I think the android app deserves an android styling and not the progress circle from other platforms!!,
Long expected and there you are! Intuitive interface brings excellent use experiences! Bravo and gut gemacht!,
"Coursera web was great,  and this looks even better. Excellent job by the team.",
Learning on the go! I procured 2 certificates.. But now no course is offered free. So moved to edx.,
"No speed control, UI looks like 2000",
"Very good app for professionals, thank you very much.",
Much awaited but many improvements are required.,
Good quality app. Exactly what I have been waiting for. Keep improving it.,
This is amazing. It has a vary good chance of improving the the world.,
Coursera is the best! ! Thank you guys! You make world better,
Im sure you will make the videos work on future updates.,
Thanks coursera for such a beautiful app! Clean and nice interface :),
Allows me to study on the go. Keep up the great work,
5 stars just for existing! Now I won't miss deadlines when away from home :),
"Overall, an awesome app. I'd like to see the video speed option implemented.",
I just downloaded it and it looks so elegant :),
I've used coursera for a few classes and they are very inciteful.,
A minimalistic UI yet incorporating all the features of the desktop version. Awesome!,
The best learning app ever. Now on the go!,
I was eagerly waiting for this app! Good interface and simple to use!,
awww i have waited for it for ages! glad tat it is out finally:),
This app has just made my life easier to get to class without using my browserüôåüôåüôå,
The program works better than the website,
I never thought something like this could ever be possible,
I was waiting for this for a long time,
So excited to see coursera's app. Yet to use it though.. Will get back with the review soon..,
How can i choose to download lectures to external sd card? The lectures are eating up my internal storage right now.,
been waiting this apps for long time.. finally,
I wish if I could give 6 out of 5 to Coursera.! :D,
What a relief!! I haven't installed it on my phone but I'm confident it'll work. This app will surely give me the control to study anywhere! Literally!! No more excuses :'(,
I enjoy using this app. I can study anywhere i want to.,
"Nice app in every thing,GUI is best..",
Please make the course readable so that some of us can also read when we do not have data to watch the videos,
why is it storing vidoes on app partition rather than sd card?? its eating upp all the space! other than that its good..i'd still prefer coursera companion over this.,
Very fluid and easy to use UI,
Best online school app in the market,
Nice to be able to take courses for free,
Very optimized and efficient. Thanks!,
"Good to have it on android, but I can't view the video, I get error 1, 21...",
Now in my palm thanks!,
Easier to keep up with enrolled courses.,
"I love coursera! This year, I'm finishing my bachelor at the University, for this reason, I can't engage any course. Nevertheless, I'll try more courses as soon as I finish my bachelor! I'm pretty happy with this app!",
Good job!,
Always wanted a Coursera app!,
Doeant really have that many courses or titles :/,
Easy way to keep up with your courses,
Thank for the free education,
Awesome app,
It would be nice if slides are available,
Love the offline mode for videos.,
Ultimate app with a wonderful learning experience.,
Am this App is finally available for us student to access on the go,
Wish homework was visible.,
No option to transfer downloaded videos,
Finally coursera in my hand 24/7..,
Works perfectly on HTC Thunderbolt.,
"Very much useful,learn anywhere anytime",
Thank u coursera,
Now i can study anywhere,
Finally! !!! So  excited to have access from my phone,
Education is now Limitless. Thanks for this application!!!Super!,
User friendly and just perfect for me on the go!!!!!!!,
Super!!!!I can learn anywhere now!,
I have trouble signing in with my coursera account. Do i have to create new account?,
Need this so badly!!!!! Thanks a million,
It goes beyond bookmark replacement.,
Why Iranian students shouldn't be able to use this?,
Very nice :),
Thanks so much !!,
Amazing app highly recomended,
Error loading vedios,
Pls improve more... but for now its good...,
At last!!! Excellent!!!,
Great apps.....,

Very good,
Finally landed on Android,
Request minimum privilege,
Age of sustainability,
Great app,
Best,

Ironic.  Coursera has had multiple classes on Android app development but it took this long for the app to get released. I'm just glad it's here!,
Unbelievable,
Awesome,
Great,
Great,
Good,
Waiting for this!,
cant open,
Ok,
Thanks,
:)   :),

"Having limited internet connectivity, the fact that I need to download the course videos on my mobile and re-download them again on my PC (or even worse, stream them on demand) is very weird to me.   Otherwise the app is very good, (I wouldn't mind an option to adjust the speed of the video playback though -- I usually watch videos on 1.5x or 2x speed).",
Make it to save downloads into SD card not phone.  Also It would be cool if the video files had their names from course not jus like video11 which is totally means nothing. Please make  this changes. I respect you guys for the brilliant app but it needs some work on it to shine like a star,
"It's great to have coursera on Android!  No soft volume control in the app, no speed control like the web interface. Would be nice to have same controls as web app.  Can get into a back button loop; not sure how I got there, but killing app cleaned it up.  It would be great to get this app on ChromeCast!",
"This app is missing key features which were present in ""Coursera Companion"" (which Coursera has kindly forced Google to remove now that they have their own app):  * Speed up when viewing videos.  This is a deal-breaker already.  Built-in player does not offer this feature and files cannot be downloaded for offline viewing with other players. * Access to full course page.  Peer assignments, forums, special content are all completely absent.  Therefore you CANNOT KEEP UP WITH YOUR COURSES USING THIS APP ONLY.  Not only that, you wouldn't even know what you were missing.  This is a major drawback.  Absent a native interface, there should be at least some sort of in-app browser window until a next-gen interface is developed. This is an interesting beta for some future Coursera app but without the above features it is really crippled and ultimately unusable. Unfortunately, Coursera Companion managed all of the above and much more but it was unofficial and has been removed from the Play store.  If you can find an APK floating around, use that app.  This app should not have been released from beta.",
"Coursera is a magnificent experience, it provides a new system of MOOCs. I have been taking courses on coursera since the first days of the company. I gave you 5 stars for the love I hold to the company, but the app still needs improvements. For instance, I download videos on my P.C. and now I don't know what has been downloaded and what has not!",
"I have just found that the andriod app has used 189 Mb of mobile data (despite having Restrict background data selected).  I'm not clever enough to know whether this is an issue with the Android 4.3 version running on my Galaxy S3, or whether it is an issue with the Coursera app - but it is obviously fairly frustrating (we have really tight restrictions on expensive bandwidth in my country).  A couple of other issues I have found: - some of the lecturers are very quiet - which even with ""speaker boosting utilities"" - are really hard to hear (I try and listen while commuting, but this is not possible with the current combination of application, lecturer sound levels and my previously undiagnosed hearing loss). - videos don't resume at the point you pause them if you switch away.   - you can't zoom into the video (if, for instance, there is a diagram being shown that has detail you need to read). - logging a support call for the Android app  20 minutes of searching - without success.  I am assuming that is my issue rather than the application.  Like many others, I have been waiting for this app for a long time, but the data usage and sound are key issues for me.",
"Still some bugs but works really well. Wish it would show more details like on main website, quiz scores for example. Video could use speed control functions as profs are too slow and time is wasted... Double speed videos please!",
"expand your horizons with this app. came to submit the review to whine about poor tablet support (no  landscape for navigation but yes for video playback ugh) , but that's fixed with latest update,  kudos and well done¬°",
"I don't get the landscape mode on my tablet, but apart from that, its a wonderful app. Does exactly what it says it does",
"I AM wholly unimpressed with an incomplete app! Yes, you can sign up for the courses.  I did.  Now I have to figure out other access if I want to complete the courses I signed up for!  All the other comments about sd storage would be helpful too... I've got 64 gb card waiting go be used! Let me!  Yeah,  you can watch the videos... read the comments type in the box to reply... but then you CANNOT submit!  Absolutely unacceptable... furthermore all instructions regarding tech support refer only to the I PAD iPhone app. NOT THIS ONE... Clearly not ready.  Please contact me when you fix this (galaxy note 10.1 2014)  Come on people,  impress me! I want to love this app!",
"There's a lack of links to lecture slides and documents that are available on the website. If that were to be included, there would be absolutely no reason to go to the website anymore and all my studying could be accomplished from within the app.",
Being a learner always  helped me keep in touch with the technology working from home. Coursera has  made it easier with this new app .,
Great app but can't always get videos to work. The main reason I use this app is to be able to watch the videos on my phone.,
"This is a great companian app to watch the videos and check for course updates, however some on the interactive features such as the autograder or interactive command prompts for classes do not work on my HTC One.",
"The app used to be working very well however out of sudden, it could not work with nexus 7 2013 edition , don't know what went wrong. Please help",
"Please let the downloads to be stored in the sd card, instead of internal storage because devices with low internal storage cannot make more downloads at once, due to space limitation.",
This is great apart from not being able to access the in-video quizzes. I like that it lets me control downloads and see all my courses at once.,
"I believe this app delivers better UX than the web interface; unfortunately, video speed up option is missing. I hope this feature would be presented in the next version of the app.",
"It would be nice to have an option to adjust play speed, like on the website.",
"This app does what I have wanted since graduating college, to be able to go to college class everyday. Anyone wanting college education on a topic by taking a class on the topic, this app is for you.",
"Not much freedom on setting in anyway ie. Data location selection,  data usage etc.",
"Download speech is too slow in  southwestern of china and this app could not auto pause, if I leave a wifi region. I like this app, but if these problems still remain. I cannot have a well experience.",
"We get a variety of options to choose from the courses, we can enroll to many courses. This really gives great learning time !",
Phone will sleep and become unresponsive to button presses for several minutes before rebooting.,
"Great app and works well. However , I never watch the videos at normal speeds and not having the ability to change the speed prevents me from using it as it takes twice as much time to go through the videos.",
Please put option to increase speed tp 2x and 1.5x. It saves a lot of time of mine.,
"a couple of minor tweaks would make it prefect, still 5 star though compared to a lot of other apps",
"The videos work well but it needs discussion forums, reminders for upcoming deadlines, browsing specializations and being able to take quizzes when signature track is taken. Good start, glad to use the app",
Thank you for the app. This is very much needed for the complete learning experience.  I wish if  the app remembers my progress across devices; including the video location.  Sometimes I switch to laptop or iPad and I've to remember the location where I left off.,
Only audio is playing during lectures with subtitles. Phone: Samsung galaxy grand quattro 18552.,
Video downloads work well but it doesn't download slides or recommended reading links,
I don't see the in video questions but other  than that its a good app.,
"Excellent! Now coursera on the go. Happy about it. For those who have a lot of travelling to do, good way to catch up on classes on coursera. Nice app. Keep up the great work",
"It's a nice app to follow Coursera.  It needs a settings page for download location,  CC font options,  playback speed,  allowing only to listen to the videos by turning off the screen. This will probably be the main application to follow Coursera for much of us in a few years,  so it needs features on par with the web site.",
I waited quite a while for this app to become avalable. Learning is at hand now. Would appreciate some enhancements like x speed for playback and option to link downloaded videos based on course...,
This is the best inititave ever. Got two certificates and learnt many things. I just love Coursera.,
"Good start but missing too many features. No in video quiz, can't turn in homework within app, no forum tab, etc.",
The new update sucks!! Now I'm not able to stream any video for online viewing and an having to download every single video for offline viewing. Fix this quickly coursera,
1) Can't read full title for all videos  2) still needs 2√ó video speeding function or at least allow external apps to view offline videos (like vlc which allows 2x)  3) smooth experience. Nice ui. Great job!,
"This app is awesome! It has plenty of room for improvement though, mainly in the quizzes part and search filters... Also it would be nice if we could install the app in the SD memory. Looking forward to this.",
doesnt have the ability to define the storage space in sd card. make me very hard to download the videos. very limited stored space in my mobile.,
"This works fine for playing videos. Gets very flaky when offline, sometimes won't load vids already downloaded. Doesn't show mid-video quizzes.",
There are lots of resourses in this app. It makes my dream come true that I can study robotics by myselfÔºÅ,
"The ""Download all videos"" is awesome, I can study while on the road without data conection.  This makes coursera even more awesome.",
"Good app, would love a calendar which shows you upcoming deadlines for all the courses you're enrolled in.",
I can't see video during runtime only audio is working on my device Samsung s7562,
It is a good start.  I would love for it to synchronise with the online part so I can see which video was already watched.  Needs forum integration and ideally writing peer assessment. Definitely let me do the grading.,
I used to be struggling with coursera videos on my tablet. Thank you for this great app!,
Great app. great project.  However android app really lacks the speed control functionality.,
I can hear to the audio but I there is no video visible. Please fix it as soon as possible.   Using Samsung Galaxy Win,
"Good fit of design to function, no crashes so far, a great service made mobile.",
"Apart from some glitches, overall a good app. Please add video speed options and course suggestions.",
"Interface is simple. Although the video player is clutter free, it would be desirable to have features like selecting the storage location for videos, playback speed control, volume and brightness controls on player, etc.",
"Perfect, does as expected. Maybe add feature to listen to the videos' audio channel with screen switched off, and download scheduling (when network is available / when course opens). Thx!",
Errors all the time :(,
Dissapointing...Nice and simple interface but cannot play video only audio. Also no choice of where to save downloads.,
"Quite excited, you can't find some of these courses for free. Thumps up thumps up :-) course era",
Glad to have possibility to use my android TV set for education from coursera,
Thank you coursera team for this app on Android phones and tablets. My long wait is over now. Would love to see the landscape mode for the phones as well. Can you guys also enable pinch zoom? Am I asking too much! I know you guys working very hard for us to have a fun learning experience. Couserans rock!,
Would be perfect if it had the video speed controls that the web version has.,
"All major features including downloading lectures are here, and everything works great",
Takes up scarce phone space.,
It would be useful to be able to turn off the screen while continue listening to the courses.  Thanks,
"This app is perfect for being on the go, much easier than trying to get on the website from a mobile device.",
"Works as advertised, but it would great to be able to read through the course forums.",
"I am a big fan of Coursera. Thanks for the app, been looking forward to it!",
"Easy to use, really like it!",
When you are watching a video you cannot see the quiz in this app otherwise it would be a 5 stars application,
"can't be moved to the SD card, and so it gets kind of heavy on the system memory",
"I like the convenience of the app, but it is missing two things.    1. When there is homework to be done,  you can't turn it in on the app. 2. When watching lectures, the in-video quizzes that the web application uses don't work on this app.   Otherwise,  it is a 5 - star app.",
Please can you clean up the download section and sort the videos out in their own course? It gets confusing when you have millions of videos and you dont know which video is for which course,
Maybe a quiz download feature that synchronizes as soon as there's a connection available would be nice,
Thanks  Unique problem is that application download all videos on internal memory.,
"need to add the ability to put courses on wishlist, and to [automatically] filter courses by language",
"Finally, the app is here. I love coursera. My horizon has expanded. 5 stars from me.",
I love coursera! But I would love it so much more if this app supported chromecasting!,
It is working very good with me & no problem at all  but really we need to be able to choose where to download courses bcz most of our mobile phones internal memory are very small,
I deleted Facebook and installed cousera. Now when I got time go burn I learn! Such a fantastic app,
I got it blocked at 90%that's not good,
"Arise awake n not stop,coursera is here.",
Great initiative! I have long awaited this. Thank you Coursera!,
My kind of schooling..free courses at your own pace,
the only thing I wish Coursera wold add is the option to watch videos in x2 or open the videos from other players,
"Need to improve more options like quizzes, discussion forum and assignments, videos with low quality to download in mobile etc should be included into this app.",
"It is a great app, but needs to support landscape mode",
I love coursera and this app too &lt;3,
Amazing app . Thanks . Can add new features though,
"When it comes to learning there is no other app, that helps you better than this...I just love it...",
It worked flawlessly before update and  now videos are not downloading.Plz fix it,
Never thought education can be mobile until this app came. Kudos!!!,
Amazing app. Kindly ensure downloaded videos play in offline mode.,
"Free courses by UNAM, Slim foundation and Telmex Hub Mexican teachers.",
Many thanks to the Android team! Would be great if we can lock the screen when playing lectures.,
Invaluable. Use it every day on a nexus 7 tablet and motox phone.,
"Very good application, can you please allow downloads to move into SD cards",
The mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.,
I was waiting for this app for last 8 months today I got this app... Thanks to coursera.....,
Gona be the best app fr me,
Great app and if you would add Chromecast support it would be Awesome!,
Can't play video,
This is the best college level app i could find for course material,
"Love the app, I have expiericed no issues as of yet :)",
It's working very greatly even the network is low. Best app for the online learners....,
I can only get audio in my phone!! :-(,
Exactly what I needed. Thank you!,
"Love it, hope you become better!",
Learn when ever you want n where ever you want... Amazing App,
User interface is easy to navigate and the app itself is very stable.,
Todos deveriam ter instalado,
I love course ra. This is so convenient for me,
Great!  It would be perfect with Chromecast support!,
Best app ever! Could be improved,
Totally enjoy listening to classes on the go.,
Welcome to the world of open learning from world's best academicians!,
Could use better PDF integration directly in the app,
LUV the app. If u want free education this is the app,
"Finally it's in android. Will be much better if (1) there's a link to course forum, (2) we can zoom/playback video in default player, (3) we can still listen to video when the screen is off. Courserans rock!",
Love the site... this app is really great,
Nice app and works perfectly on my phone,
Excellent.  All of us should contribute to this,
Glad the app hit Android.,
"Awesome app, learn anywhere anytime.",
And continually improving.,
100% recomended,
Please show deadlines next to quizes,
Can't download the course book PDF files. Without books how I can do the course?,
ChromeCasting support would be a nice enhancement.,
Please add speed up for video,
"For a open learning platform, Coursera deserves it",
app downloads only in internal memory :( Please make option to change download folder.,
This is how I am learning! !!,
"Excellent one, and I have been waiting for this for long. Would be wonderful if you can add options for (1). faster video playback, (2). in-video quiz, (3). zooming, (4). resume from last playing position, and (5). choosing storage location on sd card.",
Needs 1.5x video speed option,
Where to find the downloaded lectures for offline viewing on  laptop,
I joined two courses they started today whats next nothing is showing,
It requires much size when download any video.,
I have been waiting for this app  ***** ((5stars)),
Well done.,
Keep it up please !,
Was waiting for this android version since last year.,
Very nice now!,
Thank you so much devloper...,
More than worth it!!!,
need a function of chosing the video download path.,
Love this app!,
Great app!,
Excellent app...love it!!,

"I was using the Coursera On The Go Free. Somehow, this app was discontinued. There are some feartures from this app that was very useful and it is not present in this app: 1. Ability to view the PDF files. - lecture slides. 2. Option to use internal or external video player 3. Information where the lectures are stored. Or the Cache directory  The app needs improvement",
It feels great to see this site over android version. There is long way to go for improving it. It should include download option for SDK card too. Forums are missing. Home page and discussions are also missing and documents are not getting downloaded too. I hope future updated options will solve these problems.,
You are getting two stars for some issues related to your app.  First is that the app crashes a lot. Also is a feature you should do. Chromecast should be supported.  Otherwise I love your app. When these issues are addressed the star value will be increased. Do you have any need for Glass developers?  Wearable tech like Google Glass would be perfect for this. The videos would work well in a pinch.,
"Please, this is only on v. 1.0.2, so it must be full of bugs and such. But that aside, I have benefit so much from this little app. It allows me to download them via wifi at home, and then listen to them during my lunch break at work, so I can catch up on some of the videos.  That being said, I would like to see one feature, to be able to move the videos to other locations, aka SD card. I mean, my phone only has 16G, with the system holding roughly 6G+, I don't really have that much left for all the videos that I am going through. With this option available, I would be one HAPPY guy, able to catch up when I can't get on the web, especially on the plane.",
"Ive been waiting for this app in google play for so long, and I have to tell you guys this app is amazing. Hope it will get better and better.",
You guys need to contact the writer of √ßoursera on the go. he knew what we needed in an app. I love coursera  on the go. Can't cope with yours.,
Like it but 2 things I wish it would do is handle a landscape mode and also working with Chromecast. Love the fact that I can download the videos for watching them when I don't have an actual connection!,
"It makes researching, and learning something new very easy by puttuig it all in one place, Love the concept..keep it up :D",
This is a ambitious project. Really appreciate for the app and i am confident coursera will bring revolution in education and develop new knowledge age. Make the world go further.,
I had been waiting for such an App. Honestly I envied guys with apple iPhone getting the luxury to this app. Thanks for making us believe that android too has the hang over Coursera.,
"The application is well designed, it covers some of my academic subjects. So once again , thanks :-)  STUDENTS MUST USE THIS APP",
Should add the ability to store videos on SD card rather than internal memory. Takes up all my space. 5 stars after it is done. Otherwise simply gr8,
The fact that Coursera is  now on android is alone enough to make me feel wow. Now I can learn on go !! wooohoo,
"The myth that you need to spend thousands of dollars for a decent education is no more with the announcement of Coursera, and now it's even easier with Coursera Mobile :)",
But causing error while playing downloaded videos please change it,
"the concept of offering free classes to people is awesome. if you are preparing for college, furthering your studies, or if you just randomly want to learn something new, this is a great tool to use. i rated it 4 stars only because there is no tablet/landscape mode.",
"But too bad, it couldn't be moved to sd card",
"Very nice adition, please add the faster video playing option",
It's a long time I am looking for something like this.,
Been waiting for this a long time. Great work with the app. Gonna try it out.,
Been waiting for n official app for a long time,
Can't download videos on SD-card.,
Works wonderfully but would appreciate if there were more advanced filtering options and speed control option on tutorial videos.,
Coursera app for Android is great! Now I can do my homework even without my laptop.,
Sorely missing out on the speed controls on the videos.,
I will wait for the catalogue of courses to improve.,
Can't use it on the phone otherwise :(,
How could you not love the website and the intent of this whole idea. One really annoying but minor let down is the fixed Portrait orientation of the app... surely/hopefully this is an easy fix???,
"Just perfect, makes learning easy & life productive. Thanks Coursera!",
"Knowledge is Power! Coursera, Thank you for providing unlimited power to the future!",
Should add the ability to store videos on SD card rather than internal memory.,
Helps u learn more on ur favorite topics,
Thank you for this amazing app  that I was waiting for,
Great job.,
Coursera on android is probably the best thing to happen to android.... and coursera,
App is still missing a lot of feature but it is a good start.,
It eats my internal memory when downloading videos,
I love this application.,
Makes access to nerddom very efficient!,
Great app. So far having a good experience with it,
"High quality content,  High quality teachers,  High quality app,  Oh and the courses are FREE",
Increase play rate button needed,
E learning becomes mobile and smart,
Great to learn on the go,
i love it.. its long time i was waiting for it..:),
I am very happy that coursera is available on play store. Thank u coursera...!!!,
Greatest app for lifelong learners.,
No fixes still can only hear the audio,
Just say YES!!!!,
Great app.,
Really like this,
Google+ integration.,
Great app to easy learn,
Absolutely love coursera,
Reshaping the future of learning,
On Android,
Great app,
Thanks coursera.,
can we have the option to move the app to sd card?,
Awesome,
Ok,
"Overall, the app works great for the features that they have implemented. It is missing a few features cause me to use the website more than I wish was necessary; however, I am glad they have made a somewhat limited yet stable rather than putting in a dozen broken features. I do wish it supported landscape mode in several views which shouldn't be hard to implement.",
"I cannot sign-in using my coursera username and password. It gives me the message ""Network error. Please check your internet connection..."" And I tried to access other apps on my phone. The connection is fine. I can sign-in to coursera on my PC though. Please help.",
I've been using this since beta and its been great.  Few minor bugs here and there but... At this stage it is expected. All in all I was able to watch my lectures with better ease than going through the website on my phone.,
App is perfect for watching lectures on the go so you can stay up to date with your courses during a busy day.,
Just started using it today and it works well so far. Chromecast support is a must. That will help with my signature track video lectures.,
The app doesn't work in landscape so on a tablet it's really not much more than annoying to use. Other than that it seems OK but I'll only use it if the update supports landscape.,
Getting only audio and subtitle after selecting any video in the app..pls fix this bug,
Having enrolled in the upcoming Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures course I know that there are video lectures that the professor has asked us to preview. Yet they don't appear to be available in the app.,
"I love it, but it doesn't have prerequisites, which can be annoying when signing up for new classes. Please add this.",
"The very idea of coursera itself is fantastic and the website is excellent. But this app takes the accessibility to another level.  Even though it says 'designed for phones', or works beautifully on my nexus 7.   Thank you Andrew Ng & team.",
It is a pleasure to be able to catch up all my courses easily in the public transports every day. I was really looking forward to it!,
In Samsung Galaxy S2 sign in button is dissabled or at least does not work,
The amazing app that can learn high-quality course from your pad.,
"A great endeavour.  Truly culmination of a great thoughts put together with a vision to make access to education ""free""..",
"Nice APP but if you are short on disk space, download the videos is a no-go. Hope future versions allow to move to SD. An agenda sync option cames in handy too.",
Implement google+ sign in! I hate signing in manually.,
"Simply an excellent app, have no words to describe. SUPERB",
"...but, it does need to have landscape mode for tablets and videos that play correctly. It also needs settings availability for night mode, font size modification, etc.",
Learning is the essence of life.  Coursera is the best thing to happen to education in ages,
Hats off work guyz,
"Very nice app, I wish it had a calendar view for your current courses. Other than that it's perfect!",
"1. Could we play the video at 1.5x or 2x speed? Or, we could allow the use of external video players. I think it's very important to speed up the video for online courses.  2. Could we also indicate whether this video has been watched, not only in each video titles, but also on the week titles?  Shawn",
It would be better if the events can be integrated into my Google Calendar.,
Works really well. Chromecast support would be an amazing addition.,
Allows me to watch video lectures while on the move. Very useful.,
The app is just great! Now its easy to learn anywhere and at any time.,
Not able to browse the course section.  Else content is good...  Plz develop....,
Please add the ability to do in video quizzes and ill rate a perfect 5 stars.,
"Waiting so long for this, you should all definitely install this app ;)",
chromecast support would be a great addon,
The best app I ever seen!,
Google calendar,
"I was waiting an official app! Awesome, no bugs until now, let's see how this app behave..",
Very useful courses and a very good interface,
Great platform for learning,
We need an upgrage but AWESOME,
High quality video. Organized well.,
Yipee I was waiting for this for months,
"just what I needed, a bit late",
Needs chromacast support for Lecture Videos!!,
App is great but where are the downloaded lectures saved ? I want to transfer them to my laptop.,
I have been waiting for this for a long time! !! Thank you !,
It's amazing.,
very nice..its too gud too useful..:),
and free... Kudos!,
Amazing!,
Awesome app for learning thx,

Could use Chromecast support,
Thanks Coursera,
Finally thanks coursera!!!!,

"HI, Others have also brought up this issue. The videos cannot be watched on tablets.   This application seems to download and store in internal storage, which is very inconvenient, and not accessible to other players which provides higher level of flexibility for playback during offline mode.   I usually download all videos and transfer to tablets and watch while commuting to office n back. The process of having to transfer is what I expected to reduce, but it did not happen.",
"The current app is useful but 'breaks' usability by forcing me (on a Nexus 7 2012 edition) to use it in portrait mode. At times, I hold my tablet in inverted portrait mode (e.g. during charging so I don't bend the cable) and to suddenly be forced to change the way I hold the device just because I use the Coursera app is irritating.  Ditto when switching between watching a video and the app. Having to constantly turn the tablet between portrait and landscape mode is bad user interaction. The video should be playable in portrait (and inverted portrait) mode.   The app should offer portrait, inverted portrait and landscape modes so that users don't have keep turning their device to use the app.",
"Great app finally released. For the people who are finding bugs or have problems with the app, simply shake your device and a prompt will show up to send feedback. Please do, because that's an efficient way to let them know things that need fixing.",
"This app is  a must for all those who likes to learn. UI is nicely designed, love it more than the web version.",
Great way to study on the go. One thing that I can't do is evaluating peers. Specifically for the Programming Mobile Apps for Android Handheld Systems course where I have to evaluate other students. There is no way to do it using the app.,
"This is a comprehensive app, and the ability to download content is fabulous. However, still a little glitchy and slow to load. Also the navigation can be tricky when going between menus. Overall it is nice to have and I look forward to future updates!",
"I would like to see a more diverse learning environment in which more liberal arts courses are offered to balance those of science, technology, and business.",
I am glad that they came up with this app. I always find myself too busy. With this app now I can learn my courses while in commute and so on.,
More of a problem with the business model (and me) than the app.,
Unable to create an account keeps showing error day 3 unable to create an account unistalled app fix this problem please. ..,
Sometimes the app is very unresponsive and simply hangs. Also has some resolution compatibility problems. Sometimes it opens desktop version of the page.,
"Works great and I am able to watch videos in full screen and rotate my mobile device, so I do not understand the problem others are having. Please design for tablets also",
"can not login using this app, keeps showing ""network error, please check your internet connection"". I am using internet over bluerooth.",
Great app. It doesn't crash and the download manager seems to have all the features I want.,
It took a long time to be available for Android but it's awesome. UI problem: the top right menu button goes half beyond the screen.,
"Courses on a wide variety of topics. Could make one very educated, if used on a daily basis.",
"it works very well, I gave 4 star because it's missing in-video quizzes and I think the first update should focus on this.",
"Now. I can learn on the go.  I have a 3hr daily commute, all can be put to good use.",
Was waiting for this one for long..  Please add immersive mode for video playback.,
This is a wonderful app with nice concepts. All my best wishes to devs for future projects.,
Minimalistic and easy to use! Great companion app for portable learning. I'd appreciate having the fast forward option for video play through similar to the website though.,
And nice idea but there is a very prominent disadvantage you can't watch videos in full screen and rotate the screen..,
Finally an app! Definitely needs a lot of upgrades and enhancement... Hangs in between... Still will mostly stick to desktop,
Doesn't allow the audio/video to run in the background.,
Thank you for releasing Android application. Works great.,
"Everyone can find something to learn from here, for free!",
"Thank you, I have been anticipating Coursera for Android!! This mobile app has sweet features. I can now watch videos and learn any place, any time!",
"Works great on my Galaxy S3 :-) , but not my TF700t tablet :-(",
Now I can make take classes wherever I go.,
You did want we asked. Great!,
Clean design and very easy to use. Great job team!,
Finally for andoid! Shoulda done the android app 1st before lame a$$ apple... but at least its here.,
Very neat and efficiently designed app . congratulations on a work well done,
I can finally take courses on the go! This app has an amazing user interface and design!,
Giving 5 stars till after my evaluation lol.,
It looks clean and I have been waiting for it. But why is it only designed for phones?  I can't even rotate my screen. Please fix this in the near future.,
Awesome. Please add chromecast support. I know there is another app that does it out there.,
The great Coursers is now on mobile. I am glad !!!,
As good as the last one with a better user interface,
Works perfectly for me! Also it has a lean and beautiful layout + all the contents. Great job!,
Coursera app is the greatest app for me.  Learning on the go.,
Simple UI Good work team cousera!,
"Beautiful design, clean, easy to use. Take the learning anywhere.",
Thanks for this. About time Android users got access.,
Simple and easy to use.,
Waiting for this app for a long time.,
Thanks for catering to Android users too!,
Still need lot of improvement,
Very easy to use,
"Finally, the official coursera app.",
Attended Berklee music for free,
Been waiting for this in a long time,
Really friendly and wonderful app.,
Was waiting for the app from a long time...Thanks a lot team :),
"can't see any video, plz fix it gives some error(1,‚Äì214.....)",
"I love it but the video lectures play audio only, makes the app quite useless",
It is early days...am very happy,
I can do my home work early...,
Great app for great service!,
Waited so long for this app.....,
Can't wait till classes start!,
I like it.,
"Fast, clean UI",
"Go, Google!",
Its free... üòÄ,
Great app!,
Great and useful app!,
Chromcast support needed!,
Love it!,
Awesome!,
Good app..,
Please add chromecast support,
Education on the go!,
Killer app,
Love it,
Excellent,
Excellent,
Finally on Android :),
Thanks.,
Thanks,
finally,
"The moment it asked for contact, photo access and device info during an update, I click uninstall instead of update. This app should be used for studying and not to collect information about the user. I am already getting coursera ads on my email and I don't want them no where near my phone.",
"After uninstalling and installing again after updating Android O.S., I forgot my password. Coursera has no option to retrieve a lost password and refuses to create a new account under the same e-mail address. Ultimately, now I can't even enter the app.",
"I tried a new course for 7 days and forgot as i didnt have time to cancel 
it. I was charged for a month. I asked coursera customer support to refund 
the fees as i was super busy this month. But they didnt as per policy. Then 
i asked them if i can pause this and continue 2 months later but no help. 
Now i will have to painfully do the course with a super tight schedule. 
With no help from coursera. Painfull experience..",
"CAN MY PHONE PLEASE NOT F***ING GET A NOTIFICATION EVERY TIME I PAUSE AND 
PLAY A VIDEO IT'S THE MOST IRRITATING THING EVER. My phone always vibrates 
and gets the notification sound every time I pause and play. Please fix 
this. Otherwise a great app",
"I used this app a lot last year and found it really useful. However, something awful has happened in the last update, and I have now uninstalled the app. Since the last update, the app now launches itself without warning. Literally every time I unlocked my phone today, the app was open. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have closed down the app eight or nine times, and yet every time I unlock my phone, it's right there. It's massively annoying. I don't want an app to open without warning. Uninstalled.",
"App is very good. For people, ""video not playing"" make sure you have very good internet connection (5mbps atleast) for good quality videos. But the only defect is when my phone is connected to internet and while at the end of the video, when I press back, the video still plays in the background (only sound) and the contents are loading at the same time. Please fix that.",
"I love taking all this knowledge with me in my pocket. Just download and listen to in any opportunity. One note though: I would want to be able to read the transcript through the app, in a standard text format. In many cases it's easier and more beneficial than listening.",
"There is no core structure. No suggested tier system for learning a specific topic. And once you find a class that interests you, you're most likely to get a ""coming soon"" notice without the option of being noticed once it becomes available. Very outdated app. I'm sticking to FutureLearn.",
"I love online education start ups like Coursera, and the ideas behind this app, but it's beta stage at best. Several things can't be done inside the app, only watching videos works(and you miss out on the in video quizzes.) It also cannot save login information- you have to log in every time you open it. They have a perfectly functional mobile site, just use your browser instead imo",
"The service and they way it is presented, both are fantastic. They video player has got some issues , when I try to change quality, it does not responds. Using on a tablet. Otherwise a great app and a great work by you guys",
"These guys are absolutely awesome, bringing the best courses to some of the most remote places. Thanks guys, don't worry too much about the negative non constructive critism, these things will get better over time. Employers love people who can deliver, and that is what this empowers us to do.",
Why does the latest fix for videos that were not playing properly for some courses require the permission to 'Read phone call status and identity'?  Fed up with app developers who require permissions that make no sense and they don't bother to explain. This is another one of those. UPDATE: These have been added to the What's New page. Really need to go in description where they are always visible.,
"This app is not designed to replace traditional college, if you're looking to gain credits towards your degree then go to university. That should be common sense. This app is for people who LIKE to learn just for the fun of learning and expanding your knowledge. Like Rick's comment, are you seriously complaining you don't get credits for taking these courses? If you are concerned only with working towards a degree then go to college, don't write a bad review. I think this app is great! But I love to learn",
"I was excited to find this App. Awesome app, same experience as the desktop version.   Helps me to finish my video lectures whenever I find time.  Only thing is that the videos r just downloaded in one single list.so if u've downloaded vidoes from 2 diff courses. ..there is no way u can figure out from the ""My Downloads"" list. If u guys fix that, then it wud be 7 out of 5....-)",
"Good platform for building skills and learning new things with lots of good classes. App works smoothly, but doesn't have a setting to turn off the quiz pauses, which would be nice when listening to a lecture while doing other things (running, walking, etc)",
"Wont even ooen and, what's worse,  clicking on 'find courses' at the coursera site in the browser throws me into the app store. Apparently I must use the app to use coursera, but the app doesn't work, constantly am told 'unfortunately,  coursera has stopped.' Well, unfortunately,  I'll be using edx for my next course.  Extremely frustrating. :(",
"Paid for two courses but one course doesn't show up at all and the other one and me to pay again to upload assignments. Coursera cannot be contacted, instead they have a troubleshooting forum. Cannot get a refund because the courses don't appear in my 'purchased' tab but the money has been taken out of my account. Lots of people have reported the same problem in the forum but got no response from coursera. I lost a big sum of money and so did many others.",
"Downloaded the android app from the Coursera website but it does not play the videos, which is the main thing I wanted it for as they don't play from the website either when they have breaks in for quizzes. Changing players does not work either. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note, so not some ¬£10 piece of crap off a market stall.",
"in my opinion, the videos need subtitles (I'm not 100% expert in English but I understand more reading than listening) there's an option to download it I know but my device doesn't open it ..",
"Hahaha, hate smelly apps that don't work from the beginning. The app got stuck at the create new account part",
I like this app but I am facing issues since I have installed the latest version of Coursera on Samsung E700. There is no sound in the videos for any course that I choose. My sound system is fine as it works in other applications. Kindly check into this.,
Multiple choice questions did not render correctly so only part of the wording is visible. I will use browser instead.,
I'm using the app on a tablet (tf201 stock) and it works well. Only two things are buggin me: (1) the outline isn't rotating to landscape and quizzes only seem to work when I'm online. Also for questions/answers with some math forumla they dissappear after some time and show a math error.,
"Downloading the videos on wifi, so you can watch them while away is very convenient. That it suddenly needs access to contacts (with ""Bugfixes"" as the what's new message), is disappointing.",
Why can I not enroll for free from the app like I can in a browser?  I'm not interested in paying for the $300+ course. I'm a stay at home mom who just wants to do something in my spare time so as to feel like my mind isn't mush. I thought that this would be an easier way to do such from my tablet. Way to prove me completely wrong. My advice... Give us an option.  Is it really that hard for you to do?,
Uninstalled due to limited functionality and general frustration in attempting to access desired course information. Definitely not worth the permissions the app requests.,
"This app is highly recommended. For those hungry for knowledge like myself, you can now study at ease and at little or no cost. Enjoy",
"The app's request for certain permissions on Android (such as ""contacts"" and ""device and app history"") cannot be justified for the provided functionality. Please fix this so your software looks less like spyware and more like a legitimate app.",
"On my first course I found myself doing the same stuff about three times, not sure if I was missing other stuff and getting confused. Resorted to bookmarking the website in my browser. This worked better.",
"I tried this app when it was still new and had some problems with loading videos, now it works seamlessly.",
"There are almost no free courses. The app description is deliberately vague and misleading. If you're going to charge for most of your courses, you should at least mention that.",
After installing I logged in its shows this app can't work so many times I tried.,
"This app is broken. Have watched several videos and answered many quizzes, none of which shows up as being completed.",
"The only thing you can do with this app is download the lecture videos.. One cannot access discussion forums,cannot complete peer assessments and view the main course page.",
Been taking a course and it's so wonderful. I love that I can learn things I truly care about for free in this hard time of my life.,
"I'm enrolled in a few different courses and I absolutely love them. Definitely works with my work schedule as well. I go to work during the night then come home in the morning, watch a couple of lesson videos, do my work, then I go to bed. Definitely recommending to my friends.",
"App freezes, doesn't show enrolled courses even when net or other apps work just fine. After taking screenshot of a clip by pausing it, app started taking literally infinite time to start.",
"coursera has been helping me so far on my career development, professionak growth and learning language it's an amazing education platform",
So the grading is just wrong when using the app there are obvious glitches. I would have suscribed to the premium service but it's clearly not worth it. Content is good but it's a pity that the app and grading are so bad.,
"Loved it when I saw it in a friend's phone. But when I try to create my 
account after downloading the app on my phone, I get an error message 
everytime. Disappointed",
"The app does not validate the email. No matter how many times you unsubscribe, you'll receive more emails",
"The app fails to download - always shows the status as ""pending download"". I have tried several times in the past one week.",
"App is not opening on my samsung tab. Many times it stops playing the videos. Pls help as i heavily rely on ""on the move mode""",
Courses provided are very good. Faced 2 issues. Not able to download videos to phone.  And a video once seen doesn't reload again. Minor bugs when compared to the big picture... Kudos to the app,
"The courses are great, the platform is a real pain and doesn't do justice 
to teachers nor to paying students. Also, some paying courses on Coursera 
are freely available on YouTube. I paid. So much frustration and time 
wasted because of the platform.",
"Great app, have alot knowledge eith affordable prices You can enroll for 
free if you do not want certificate",
"this app needs a filter to search for and find courses easier. It needs the ability to filter courses by price, subject, institution and difficulty level as well as language. Edx is a much better app for learning because of this.",
The app won't even install. Courses are also forcing the use of the app when on a mobile device. The site should give the option of using a browser when on a mobile device.,
We cn easily utilize our time n we cn easily learn so mny thng through dis app.,
Course pages often do not work. Videos are stopped if you block the screen. Navigation is not great. Downloaded videos are stored on ROM and can't be moved to SD card.,
Too difficult to see and work with downloaded files. There is no place to see and remove downloaded files other than in each courses pages. For the majority of us would have more than one course that means you have to go into each course and hunt for what you downloaded to free up space. Horribly inefficient compared to other apps.,
"In the option for my courses,can only see present and past courses. Earlier version showed all three options. Future courses interest me more than my past attempts. Will be happy to downgrade to the earlier version.",
I was looking for online courses for free learning. I m interested in learning excel and all MS softwares functionality for free. No money for learning and if I want certificate I will pay.,
"The app is extremely slow, appearing to load tabs over a network connection. It is very buggy in regards to saving offline video. I'll be downloading the videos manually from now on.",
Its an awesome opportunity to live in home town and have a lecture from the best universities and great teachers....realy helps me to enhace my knowledge,
"My only complaint is the lack of sorting of downloaded offline files. If I download all videos in a course, they're in my downloads in reverse chronological order, which is a bit annoying. And if downloading from multiple courses, there's no order at all. This one feature would make the app just about perfect in my book.",
"I installed the app out of curiosity. They spammed me daily with junk emails, ads, and update notifications, until I uninstalled it.",
Not upgrading unless you remove these intrusive permissions. Will uninstall completely if not remedied soon.,
"In play store apps says that its free courses,  no just lies for you to get app then ask for money. Would have taken courses,  but you have lied to me, me dont  trust you now or Ever!",
"Forever student, staying relevant and self development. I'm intrigued with how far my growth will take me.",
I love this app. I try to watch lectures at work but since I don't get any data at work I download it at home but there's no point since I keep getting logged out when I close the app and I need data to log in to watch the videos I downloaded beforehand.,
"Videos not scaling properly, and the app seems to ""call home"" on its own even if not running. Thank you, but no.",
"No more free courses. I used to love Coursera, nothing came close to its quality. Now it's the worst one. All classes must be paid for in advance. Meanwhile,  competing online courses services like EdX,  Cybrary,  Udemy etc all have free options asking for money only if u want a certificate, some even give free certificates. Coursera is now the worst option for online courses and doesn't even have half of the courses offered by it's competition.   I'm sorry Coursera it was nice while it lasted. But in leaving you. I'll be at EdX taking courses from some of the best professors of the best campuses in the world - free of charge.",
"I love this site since last 2 years, high quality content, dedicated staff. No words to explain.",
Courses are very easy. Not much helpful. One would better but a textbook and read it him (/her)self,
"my mobile internal memory is low so thought moved or download those file to sd card, but failed. this storage issue is urgent for mobile user. Expecting quick asap response.",
"Was great but went bait and switch, since most content is payed now. Taking 5 courses a semester is more expensive than regular University.  There was released potential for equality in education in this.",
"I switched to official app from Coursera Companion and I'm happy about it. Soft, well looking design. Good implementation. Adequate navigation. Convenient video player. Keep it up!",
Once logged in all I could see was the login screen. Attempts to login after that were met with a notice that you're already logged in,
"With the last update I really cannot imagine why this app may ever be more useful, than site in browser",
When you try to enroll in a course it trys to charge you 50+ dollars to acess materials. Not cool. Thought this would be a study guide. Already paying for school. Not going to take a unacredited class on my phone....,
"Almost every course is paid now... Like even if I do not want a 
certificate. you still have to pay for even watching the lecture videos. 
What is the whole point then.",
The amount of perimissions needed are ridiculous. I simply won't install the app and keep working online untill it becomes an app purely for learning.,
"Last time I used it I couldn't submit my answers to a quiz I hope they 
fixed that so I will be thankful if someone answers me regarding this 
because I don't want to spend time and then to my surprise I can't 
participate and continue",
Disappointing. Was looking forward to learning on the go but I couldn't view or download any videos. Let me know when you fix it.,
It is great to use the app because you can watch your videos offline. But I have a problem on mgmt HTC desire 816 lollipop when I set storage to sd card and try to save on demand videos I get an exception.,
"I would really like to use this app as I am always on the go, sadly videos don't work on Android (Samsung Win) and I had to uninstall",
"No more sign up this sign up that before using app, plus I only use google plus or facebook for new sign up requests. Deleted.",
I have not better product in online courses industry than coursera. Keep doing good work guys.,
I use the app from my android phone. It worked great but I have met difficulties with the video loading for month already. I can not use the app practically. Probably we need an update and I hope to get it soon.,
"Beware, Coursera will email you in the middle of the night and disprupt your sleep. Even after unsubscribing multiple times.",
"It didn't let me sign up at all. I tried to press the little arrow. It said ""signing in..."" then the little screen would go away and I would be still stuck on the sign in screen.",
The timeless wisdom of the greats and the brilliance of the Ivy league combined with an app so frustrating it will make you want to hurl your phone across the room. If the content weren't so amazing I would never put up with this app's many shortcomings.,
"You have to pay for everything , not even a single course is free, what if 
someone don't want certificate and just want to learn , this app is not for 
them.",
"In the new interface, users are more likely to misbehavior on the switch to 
the new session. I was so and could not return the old course, while my new 
session was limited to the first new week.",
I can't see any videos from coursera with my galaxy tab. Constantly it says Can't play video,
The idea and the app in general are great and I might take a course on my computer. But the videos in the courses do not work. So that makes it pretty useless.,
Installed and managed to login but could not access course work after going into enrolled course. Ipad version works fine.,
Thanks for the oppurtunity of this app. Before I was able to run everything on my phone but now the crashes is to much. Disturbing my plans to watch and do my assignment. Pls do something urgently. Pls let the update be the ones that will improve user experience rather than this one. Thanks,
From two days I am trying to sign up but shows check your email and password. Please solve this problem. I have checked my email and even changed my password twice but it doesn't works.,
"I use Chromecast to watch course videos.  There is about a 10‚ÑÖ chance it works correctly.  Usually the app crashes, it doesn't start, or the video doesn't show.",
Never believed that I could get an advanced degree. Always thought you had to go back to college.        Now I can go to school on my phone .,
"How about ""forgot ur password?"" Option. I was trying to login, but apparently I already have an account and don't remember my password and there is no way I can get a reminder on my email... Little details that matters...",
Takes about three minutes to load a course since the update. That is a very unreasonable time frame. Nexus 7 user.,
"App allows you to download course material, but you can't access the downloaded material unless you're online. It makes it significantly less useful.",
"I installed the app but none of the courses worked. The specializations wouldn't even load, and an error message came up when enrolling for a class. I have used the Web version for years but now I might find another provider with better mobile app services.",
Recently the app is not working properly. I cannot access my course. I am re-installing the app.,
"Without going into the content of the courses, I didn't like the way you have to go through enrolment to find out how much a course costs. I hate the face ID feature.",
Bugs in the app get in the way of learning. Customer service was responsive until they just stopped.,
It's a comfort to be able to use this app on my phone.But unfortunately the screen starts getting hanged after a couple of uses till u reinstall the app.now that's a mess!,
You have to pay to see how u did in a quiz. That makes no sense. I'll give 5 stars of I don't have to pay to see how I did.,
"It worked fine for certain courses, but just began crashing for a lot of other one. Uninstalled.",
The app is pointless if I can't view any of my courses.,
"It generally works pretty good, but I cannot do the biweekly assignments from the phone and apparantly my course progress is not the same if I go on the web.",
"I love this app, but please please allow to save content on external card for offline view. Currently you support only internal memory which is very limited.",
"Poor app, I decided to uninstall. There's no point in having it in my phone when I cannot use it with the same privilege as in the website.",
"It's awesome. However there are a lot of people who want to get the app but 
they're not english speakers. It would be really helpful if the courses 
that are in english have at least subtitles.",
The app just stopped running and a window persisted to a point of disabling my phone. I Uninstalled it for now.,
"Its a great knowledge app. It is a great platform for learning. If you have 
the desire to learn new things and enhance your knowledge, this is the 
place.",
"I have a web account and now I want to have this app on my smart phone. When I tried to log in, it said I'd had an account. However I couldn't because I forgot my password. I reset my password but it didn't accept my new one. In the end I gave up and uninstalled this app.",
"Whenever I try to open any course, it says ""oops something went wrong."" I am uninstalling this non-sense.",
"One has to click twice the play button for pausing a video to take down the notes,  causing difficulties to pause at the moment it required, I would prefer touching screen anywhere only once to pause or resume, because I had to pause these videos frequently",
"The website is very glitchy, but the app is perfectly fine.",
It told me that yoy can learn languages but i cannot learn french,
"Hi! I'm new to Coursera and I'm wondering why I can't start. Today is the first day of "" Crafting an effective  writing"" but I can't view the videos and syllabus. Now I will try to download this app again to see if there's an improvement.",
"Learned about the free training by the top star universities via this app. Mark you they are short courses, offered free, and you get a certificate at the end of it. Several courses are available for everyone. This is my bookmark. Great App",
"When I click the notification that someone replied in a thread that I follow, it just takes me to the overview of the app. I then have to manually search for the discussion to see the response. Not cool.",
"Pathetic. The app wouldn't let me sign in, and them I created a new account, the same thing again!",
Love the app but your courses are a bit expensive though üòÇüòÇ,
"I changed my reviewi made my I'd and I started my course but next day it 
started some problems in opening the app.i will say website is better.",
should i sign up for something which most probably won't know anything more than what you can usually find by simply searching for it online.,
"I can't speed up the video, and it's painful to watch any course at such low speeds. Other than that, the content is amazing, and worth the download.",
I love the interface and everything but I think app updates should be pushed weekly /monthly.,
"This has to be the coolest app. Great classes,  and the opportunity to learn whatever you want for free. Give thanks",
Get to continue my course no matter where I am! Little more development is needed though.,
"A real pity that such a brilliant concept simply does not work in the app. Downloads are not available offline (the main reason I have the app), and with the latest update not even able to open anything anymore with crashes without any reason. Rather stick to the website version.",
"Please improve the payment section, I'm facing problem related to the card 
for payments.",
I cannt join one class.Show error 401.And even i join it from PC. I still cannpt see the course list in my phone!,
"Tests cannot be done offline, too bad there are rooted devices. This application should notify the amount of space to be taken by a multiple download.",
As I am using this service provided by coursera is awesome and helpful to learn through top university's certification for free.,
"I guess this is for people who want to take tests and peer review each other... And enroll in courses. I just want the content to watch and read. Oh well, back to Plex and Books.",
It will be useful if you add the inline-video quizzes and the ability to speed up the videos while using the app.,
"I hope it be more optimised, either. I have a fast phone but experience issues often.",
"It seems great, and a great reviews, but I can't even get passed the login. It keeps returning as though I refreshed it.",
"I found this site just now while surfing in desktop, and it really got me interested, so now I'm holding my phone downloading this app, so yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited to change my star to higher.",
"It's a revolutionary platform that aids learning in the best way possible 
for today's digital world. Kudos to team Coursera and to the educators 
who've contributed to make learning accessible and fun.",
I am using this app almost a year. But can't done a course. Cause i always forgot. Please. Improve it. It helps me to understand more. Thank youu.,
"It would be great if the app could open external links in system default browser (e.g. Chrome) rather than trying to display content itself. Mobile view is not working, neither is zoom.",
Wants me to sign up before I can even look at the courses to decide if I want to try one.,
"Already completed one course, and about to finish another.  No hiccups, on both Samsung,  S4 & note 10.1 2014 edition . User friendly, and has excellent course choices.  Well done  Coursera.",
"Great start, but a far cry from the web equivalent with too many crashes/broken functionality",
"A handy additional way to access Coursers content; once some of the bugs (advertising the app on in-app web views?) and omissions (no video playback speed control) are fixed, it'll be absolutely essential!",
"Can't login with account, though it works fine on website.  And most classes are 'coming soon'",
It would helps us a lot. And most learners will be benefited at their finger tip,
"I just install this app and when i open it the app crashed, had to uninstall it. Please fix it.",
"I love how there's so many courses to choose from & whether or not I have the $ to enroll as a certified student, I can still access the course just like I was. You don't get a certificate for the class unless you pass the class & actually pay the enrollment fee. Textbooks, Syllabus, Workbook are all accessed online for no fee. Finical Aid is also available if submitted.",
Loved the app better before the last update. You need internet before accessing your offline videos. Doesn't that lose the essence?  Pls work on this aspect of the app...üÜò,
During internet. Comprehensive  research a solid liquide film intergration taxable credit encoders TI has acclaimed in Irony Pride for the emancipated faithfully employ under imfopeuruer...USA GOV. TI,
It is a good app but this mostly has University Courses. If there were courses for schools and all it would be better. Along with a child mode because the forums are great but for children maybe not so much.,
I love this app for accessing my courses. However would love the ability to choose where to save the downloaded video files instead of having them fill my internal memory. Also the ability to view assignment deadlines and other critical functionality that is available on the web version would be a welcome update! Thanks Coursera for educating the world for free!,
"The very first time I saw this app I felt glad!%                                                                      education is at our door steps,we learn in or home.I learn in my bed everyday watching my new coursera courses videos.it's interesting for me.",

"never seen app like this just install it without wasting your a single moment , and make your future bright",
"Coursera was the first MOOC I've  knew, and I am satisfied with this experiences. I always love to join the next courses in my field.",

"That new interface ia great, i just hope for fewer bugs than the last update, thank you for leveling up ‚ù§",
"Pay = dumb ,for the people give the lesson in the courses you teach someone 
but you want a reward you SUCK HOLES",
Live the classes they offer.. I love that it is free üòäand learn at your own pace. Fun stuff!,
The latest version needs logging in every time it is opened. Not ideal especially when being used offline. There really should be an option to rollback apps to last previous version.,
With this app learned a lot of lessons and I strongly recommend this for all those who wanna study at home this is very good.,
"I would love to access my courses, but the download stops at 87% no matter what I do. Please fix this bug and I will fix the rating once its working",
It's a great app but it keeps crashing any time I switch to a different app,
It's been a whole two days and the app is still installing. I tried to do this through my HTC ONE and on my desktop with Google play and still to no avail. I don't know what's going on but this is not off to a great start and my class starts next week! Smh!,
I have tried to install this app several times the last few weeks.  No luck,
"The app however is a little cumbersome, I like the desktop version better. Thanks.",
"If your like me, then your phone doesn't always load. I feel that there should be full typed documents so u can read them. Besides that, I feel this app is very helpful.",
but I cant go to some Coursera pages without the ad for this thing popping up.,
"The app offers only a fraction of the functionality of the website. But the website dumps you into the app at every turn, locking you out of functionality and information. Designed by monkeys whose target audience was probably morons.",
You don't need to see EVERYTHING on our devices including our pictures and WiFi info to teach us. Developers are not going to stop doing this stuff until we stop accepting it; I stop now.,
"App is big with every update. There is no button for setting video resolution . sometimes the internet is slow and I can't watch videos I want 240p , 320p videos options.",
Great way to catch up on course content and watch videos while commuting. Unfortunately still does not have in video quizzes or access to discussion board.,
"It's indeed a great app. Someone who really want to learn, he can. So many courses from good institutes.",
"I'm using it daily. Latest updates allow for very good features, like subtitles, going automatically to next video, accessing some of the course content, previously available only in the standard- non mobile, desktop like- web browser. Congrats to Coursera!",
"Can't browse a course without installing this app, and then I still couldn't browse a course. Fail.",
Great app for online studies for those needy student who don't have the opportunity for going to college,

I was only able to view videos and quizzes but other assignments aren't available through the app. Also the forum isn't accessible.,
The app is ok but I find it difficult to watch videos. Fix,
"Although I really like the normal website and wanted to install the app, it's asking for far too many permissions. Why are all  those blanket permissions required rather than what the app really needs to work properly?",
"Advertised as free learning, however the app requires a $49 monthly subscription fee to unlock content. I uninstalled.",
"I love Coursera courses, and the app is great too.  It's cool that it supports Chromecast, so you can watch the lectures on your TV, the only thing that is missing in this mode are subtitles.",
There's just 1 problem that the pop-up question are not visible in mobile app.,
This is a great idea but the app doesn't need access to all of the things it pokes it's digital nose into Limit its access to only what it needs to function and I'll reconsider.,
"It's usually pretty good, I just can't download the app on to my phone anymore keeps telling me there's an error :/",
Even I tried to play a video on my nexus 7. But it's not working. Long way to get 5 star,
Crashes too often,
For continuous redirection from a mobile website to this link without acess to mobile website.  It is ok to suggest an app but continously denying a user an access to website on mobile is criminal,
Doesn't have many courses available. You have to wait for a given time to join course.,
"After new update, voice is not transmitted to my car bluetooth",
"I am regular student to your website and had learn a lot of stuffs. My question is I am staying in India, will I get the certificate or just I have to buff without certificate that I have that knowledge. The certificate will be recognized by blue chip companies?",
Provides material that would otherwise be virtually unattainable to busy people. Reputable schools and courses with certification options. A must have to further education without intrusive scheduling conflicts!!,
I was expecting actual courses. These are all generic vague courses.,
"I think this app is really awesome, I wish it there was a filter for the 
searches but that's my only complaint as of right now. Been using this for 
6 months now I believe",
Not able to save videos offline and when it's saved it removed on the next day,
The most great initiative that I ever have possibility take part in.,

"Java error 409... Ya sure, those programming error messages are a great user experience. Keep it up",
I put my login information and it keeps saying no network even when I have active and functioning internet connection,
I can say it's the best application in Google because it's helpful to those who need self-improvements.,
Hard to believe anyone still thinks it's a good idea to use logins that require giving up your credentials to third-party accounts.,

Used to be great but now subtitles just ruined the app. Should be our choice to download subtitles or not,
It'd be great if we could use phone's webcam for verification. I have a desktop with no webcam.,
I had to uninstall this because it keeps restarting. A real shame because I loved this app but I can't have anything running in the background on my old phone .,
This is one of the best learning network I have come across. Keep it up coursera. The world needs you.,

One of the main advantages of coursera is being able to talk to many people in courses. On this app it was not possible to find how to connect to forums,
Good app but I wouldn't recommend it for professional graphic designers.,
