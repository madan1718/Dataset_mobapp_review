Review Text,Category
"I peruse the NYTimes app on my tablet every morning. It takes full advantage of the digital resources offered by this platform. Besides the words on a page, video content is easily accessible. Data are represented in dynamic graphs that include search functions so that one can get even local data based upon the reader's zip code, for example. I am very impressed at how this ""newspaper"" has filled the information space created by contemporary technology! I recommend the app and a subscription!",
"Saw a good deal on a subscription so I subscribed. Didn't want automatic renewal at 9x the price, so I followed the instructions to cancel. Throughout the process, it was clearly stated that I would keep access until the end of the first year. My purchase history shows that I still have access for another year. But nope, I lost access the next day and a rep confirmed this. Huge waste of time.",
"Works kind of okay for text portion of items and simple images, although images often are slow to load. But they have trouble with videos, being slow to start and stuttering, sometimes never starting at all. And they like to attempt fancy text/graphic presentations, which fail miserably. I use a browser if I really want to see it. Other apps on my phone don't have these problems.",
"The content is good, but the app is really letting it down. So many basics are poorly done. 1. There's no scroll bar on the articles so you can't tell how much longer the article is. You'd have to scroll to the bottom to see that. 2. If you leave the app and come back, it will loose your place. It brings you back to the front page. It would be better to remember your place in the article and allow you the choice to continue. 3. I wish there were reading options like font and size.",
"I love the NY Times and am a subscriber. However, I'll stick to the web, this app is not good (at least on Android). Freezes and won't update, routinely thinks my device is offline when it's not, video plays poorly, and agree with other comments about ads screwing up the reading experience. And why is the NYTimes Audio app only available in iOS? Taken together, seems like they've made a business decision to cut development resources for Android.",
"One star because the app allows you to mark your favorite topics and columnists but never displays them in the ""for you"" tab. It either ignores them or has the worst predictive algorithm in the history at predicted algorithms. Also, it constantly tells me it can't update because I'm not connected to the internet but that's never correct. Very frustrating.",
"Navigation in this app is awful. Simply awful. Ads cause pages to jump to the ad in the middle of reading. If you let your screen turn off, main feed goes back to the top. The main feed is not today's news, but a mash up of high traffic articles from previous days and some leading stories. Love the writing and journalism, but this app sucks.",
The app itself is okay. Slow article and picture loading speeds on gigabit and 5G internet—I'm being generous—and the video and audio buffering is horrific. It always crashes videos. I *always* need to scroll the page for any video to play one frame while audio plays regardless. Article hubs disappear w no warning even while large news events are still occuring. NYT doesn't offer sub sharing. Their pricing keeps most low-income readers from reading more than the few free articles per month.,
"Unsubscribing is made purposely difficult. Do not get a subscription. You will find it nigh impossible to cancel. If your credit card is stolen and cancelled (like mine was) they'll still bill you. If you cancel right before the next billing period they'll send your bill to collections. Now I have to dispute debt for newspapers I never received with a third party debt collector. The journalism is good, the rest is the worst experience I've ever had as a consumer and I will tell anyone I can.",
"Piece of junk keeps telling me that I have reached my article limits when I have not. It is also incompatible read the articles on Facebook. I used to subscribe to NY times. After I closed my subscription, it's worked for a while I'm now it doesn't. I also agree that they have made searching impossible!!! And incredibly badly designed App, they are going backwards.",
"Just for latest version 10.9.0. The new text sizes option is pretty lame. Default is very tiny. The largest is not really very large at all. Thankfully you can still choose the ""system settings"" where my system font size is probably 50% larger than NYT ""LARGEST"". Technically my system size is 164% of ""normal"" which is comfortable for my 78 year old eyes. The NYT text size app options are half measures at best. Great if you've got young eagle eyes. But would think your readers tend to be older.",
The app gets stuck in weird states. Tons of Notifications that don't seem super tunable. More importantly notifications never link to the article they mention. Most of the time they just reopen the app to whatever you were reading last. Then you have to be able to sort through a pretty useless search to maybe find the thing you wanted to read because of the notification.,
"I like the New York Times, but this app is not useful. Looking for a way to listen to their podcasts from a phone since the mobile version of the website doesn't work for that, but this app makes it hard to find those and can't track that I started listening to one or how far I was in it. These are basic features they just never implemented.",
"Ridiculous amount of push notifications. Large number of ""doom and gloom"" notifications sprinkled with pointless things like recipes for pickled carrots. I wake up and this app bombards me with 10+ notifications every day. It's absurd. Clicking them doesn't even take you to the article in question. It's ridiculous. Then, the app itself is almost impossible to navigate efficiently. I love the NYT but I'm probably going to uninstall this app, it's poorly done. App needs a major overhaul.",
love my NY Times app. There is always some very interesting stories each and every day. I always look forward to the various subject matter that the NY Times has to offer. Quite often I will open an article up and hit the save button if I don't have enough time to read it. I have a fantastic body of interesting articles concerning many topics that I can pick from when I have enough time and interest to read. To the people that work at the New York Times newspaper: Thank you for your hard work!!!,
"We have dark mode! I would still love a reader so I can listen. The articles and information is great, but this app needs some updates. There's no reason the app shouldn't have a dark mode. The bright screen makes me not want to read it at night. The Washington Post app also has a reader so that you can listen or listen and read together if you'd like. I'd really love to see this feature on the app in addition to dark mode.",
"It's the NYT, so it's mostly great. Aside from the click baity OpEds, the content is wonderful and pretty reliably accurate. But there are always some weird choices made by the Times tech people. It used to be the inability to copy text, but that's fixed. Right now, it's the missing widget. There's supposed to be a widget for the headlines, but its not available in the widget list fot any launcher I have (One, Nova, Microsoft).",
"The app works and I use it everyday. The search function is fair but not great. my main complaint is that the primary headline portion refreshes itself too much. For example, if I start the app and immediately decide to scroll down, the app will refresh back to the top a couple of times. Likewise, if I click on an article and then return to the main page, it frequently goes to the top of the page and not wherever I had been when I clicked the link.",
"If they can't make updates to fix the issues we all see, I'm going to uninstall it and see if it's any better just trying to read it from the web. How could it be so bad?! Lousy user experience for a good newspaper. There is no way to sort or articles. If I open World, for example, I can't sort so the app gives me newest articles first. The customization in For You is practically non existent. There is no Search. Really, NYT needs to hire better, more experienced or just more developers.",
"I use this app mostly on the NYC subway and it has almost zero functionality when there isn't a data connection (like when you're underground). I sit on the train staring at a blank screen or playing article roulette, tapping article headlines hoping I find one that was pre-downloaded to the device. This app is effectively unusable in New York City when commuting, which is unbelievable. This has been an issue for ages, why can't you fix it??",
"app is terrible! 1: can't zoom into images in article 2: bookmarked/save-for-later is shoved to corner. 3: the ""for you"" is not even based off MY saved for later articles. 4:my suggestion: put my bookmarks in the front, and simply offer related stuff along it. 5:thoughts: basically shoves everything your not interested in in from of you, rather than let you continue what you want to read and discover more. I'm just staying with the web version, at least you can zoom into the images.",
"I use the nytimes app for reading articles instead of using the website because it has a night mode setting. That said, the app has some serious issues. Sometimes it can't find stories when you navigate there from the browser. It crashes frequently. The tabs sometimes just don't load when you click on them. My biggest complaint, by far, is that when you're reading an article, your location in it is reset to the top if you turn off or rotate your screen. This is super annoying. The app has LOTS of issues that need to be fixed. However, the reporting continues to be good and worth the annoyance.",
"The app is good, without being as good as it can be. What holds it back is a lack of smoothness: there's too many stutters as you scroll through pages. In turn, I suspect this has to do with the in page ads that take long times loading; the ads also take up so much of the screen, combined with the app stutter, you'll end up clicking them. Some of the audio visual stories are outstanding and that the app does well on those.",
"Please bring back dark mode, I understand it is being rebuilt, but it's taking too long. Not sure what is going on with this app recently but it has been extremely buggy in the last few months, often when I am reading an article it will just randomly fail and navigate back somewhere else. You guys really need to step up your game. Love NY Times content. Happy to change this review when this is fixed.",
"Paper itself is great. Notifications used to be great, but now only seem to pop up when I open the app (which turns into a barage of the last 24hrs worth of news). Also, most of the time I have to open the app twice before any articles load. This is especially annoying when trying to get to an article from a notification, which takes me to the ""this article can not be found"" page 99% of the time (and now the notification is gone so I've lost the direct link and have to hunt for the article).",
"I like the New York Times. However, this app is extremely frustating. When I touch an area on the screen that has an advertisement (usually by accident) the whole screen goes black. (Doesn't even pull up the add) Pressing the ""back"" button has no effect, nor doe trying to scroll through it. The only way out is to completely close the app and reload. At that point, I need to go on a hunt for the article I was in the middle of so I can finish it. (Using a 2018 model Samsung Galaxy Tab A.)",
"I love the New York Times and have subscribed for years. I would love to see their content. However, after paying for content i can't see, I conclude that the app developers are intentionally sabotaging them. Why else would they make it nearly impossible to use? Between trying to regain access as an existing subscriber, being unable to stop a subscription (even if just to create a working account), to difficult navigation, to incredibly invasive ad experiences, I give up. RIP NYT. I'll miss you.",
"I've used the app for a year. The UI is consistently frustrating and buggy. Articles freezing, crashing, failing to load, losing my place when I rotate. 1 in 3 times the app won't come back up after a bit and I have to swipe it away and restart it just to use it. These issues are long-standing. I reported some of them at least once long time ago. I love the NYT journalism, but the WSJ app puts this one to shame in every single regard.",
"Inside the app is pretty nice, although I wish they'd show you past notifications so you can read them. Why you ask? Because the notifications don't bring up the story of which it was trying to alert you. Pixel 2xl, this app only opens the stories it notifies of maybe 30% of the time. The rest of the time it brings you to the home screen, to a different story, or the notification shows two different stories depending if it's expanded or not (although that's rare).",
"Simply said: not a user friendly app. Easy to get lost and missing some features you'd expect from a major news player. Convoluted is a better description. Click on a specific notification and you're unlikely to get there anytime soon, if ever. Too many notifications with little chance of getting to it expeditiously. There are other news apps that actually function. Still needs work. If you only want it on your phone forget it. Desktop? Much better. Only reason I stay.",
"The latest update destroys the usability of this app. It was already a vastly inferior experience to reading a physical newspaper, but now it is much worse as you can no longer swipe between articles. This is a frustrating experience where you basically end up mostly just reading headlines. I can spend hours reading the New York Times on paper, but I am finished with this app in no time. Gains a star for the excellent reporting.",
"I am constantly kicked out of reading to ""restart the app."" This happens several times within a 5 minute period and I get so frustrated I stop reading. I have tried the ""provide feedback"" option but have never received a reply despite including my email address (which is likely a marketing ploy). I have also written to Customer Service and nothing. When I called, it was suggested that I delete the app and reinstall. That didn't work either. Were this a free app -oh well, but it's not. If it's not addressed soon, The NYT will have one less digital subscriber and probably not miss me as much as I will miss the read. If I could afford the print addition, that's where I'd be!",
"Like the articles, hate the design. Several weeks ago, the progress bar disappeared on the articles. Turns out, some genius decided to make the progress bar white. A white progress bar on a white article doesn't show up. The whole purpose of that progress bar is to show where you are in the article. Until that is fixed, I will be an unhappy reader. (This is only a problem for Android phones, I should add.)",
"Whenever I'm reading an article, it'll reload itself (I assume to load more ads) and reset to the beginning. This is QUITE annoying. To add insult to injury, the scroll is completely janky trying to find where I left off. This has happened several times since I installed the app. I think I'm done with it. I like NYT, I think I'll restrict my reading of them to AMP pages on Google News.",
"Doesn't let you open downloaded articles unless you're in airplane mode. So if you're on the subway and don't have a signal, it doesn't work. Also, it's annoying that if you leave the app with an article open, then reopen the app hours later, it will usually have reset to the home screen. Last, any enhanced content it loads in a web view will reset the scroll position to the top of the page if you turn your phone sideways.",
"Absolutely LOVE reading this newspaper. However, recently it seems very buggy! Only about half of an article loads and the rest of the screen is black. When I go back and pick a new article it doesn't even load. It has nothing to do with internet connection because I have a good connection. As a paying subscriber this is disappointing...please fix quickly!",
"Over the past few weeks this app has not been reliably loading articles, giving just a blank screen. If I kill the app and restart it, I can get the article to load. But then it happens again 2 or 3 articles later and I have to restart the app again. App refreshes a lot, as noted by others. Can't say for sure, but the abrupt change in behavior may coincide with the last update. I've reinstalled the app once without any discernible improvement. This problem began on my tablet at the same time.",
"Let me start by saying the news content of this app is top notch. Excellent, informative and deep content that always appears to be well researched. The problems to me are twofold; stability of the app, and a push toward opinion rather than news pieces. This app crashes a lot on both of my Android devices. One or more times daily. They seem to be trying too hard to add video and other content, and pushing too many high bandwidth ads at the expense of having things run reliably. Now maybe it's just me, but I primarily use this app for pure news content. While the opinions of others are certainly interesting, I do prefer to form my own. This app seriously pushes opinion pieces rather than reporting. I am sure many people enjoy this, but not me. Let's please separate the two more clearly and consistently. Still, excellent reporting does still exist here, so overall, the app is worth it.",
"I've never complained about this app before but it keeps reloading and suddenly returning to the top story while I'm in the middle of another article. It's the only app that's doing this. Just uninstalled and reinstalled will see if that helps. If not it's a big problem. Also as others have said the ads are excessive. We pay for this app, why do we have to suffer through all the ads? Content is great. Fix the bugs.",
"Quality on the Android app has diminished significantly over time. I love The Times and want to remain a digital subscriber, but the state of the app is making it difficult to justify. Like other users, I've begun having issues loading articles and saving for later. A lot of the time, opening an article just comes up as a blank page. I'll back out and try again or close the app and try again and eventually get it, but that's a terrible user experience.",
"The constant pop-ups and redirects suggesting I subscribe are incredibly irritating because I am a subscriber and already logged in every time. I tried participating in a survey at the end of the article (I was looking for the comment section, no luck.) When I put the cursor in the text field the screen jumps up and down (best way I can describe it,) eliminating the ability to see the text as I type, then when I try to review it, I'm redirected to subscription ad again! Infuriating!",
"The app is horrible to use. Often links don't open the desired pages. You are then forced to look for them. But by far the worst thing is the constant refreshing of the main page, which turns white, tells you it is updating and waiting up to 30+ seconds or more before you can view another article. Sometimes the main page doesn't refresh completely, leaving you with a white page. Wouldn't be surprised that this doesn't happen on newer iOS devices!",
"Love the articles, obviously. For the app, it's easy to use and works consistently. My one criticism is that there appears to be a minor bug: When opening a link within the app, on the article that opens, the app sometimes does not have the three icons (bookmark/save, share, and ""..."" more) in the app header bar. Then there's no way to save for later or even get a URL so you can share the article.",
"I'm giving the NYT one star because even though I have contacted the developers (you never really talk to the developers but just a message taker) multiple times over a couple of years this problem still persists. If you open a photo or view a slideshow, the description obscures the bottom part of the photo. If it's a long description it obscures most of the photo. Once upon a time you could tap the photo and the description would drop down and disappear. I sure wish they would fix that.",
"I'm a long-time user, but the last several weeks the app has been behaving very strangely. The screen freezes when I try to scroll, I get half way through an article and suddenly the lower portion of the screen is blank, I try to refresh the screen and it hangs, etc.. I seem to be constantly closing and reopening the app to escape one problem or another.",
"This is one of the worst built apps from a professional company on the planet. Forget the news content. This app is slow, laggy, resets the positions in your article when you twist the screen or when it finishes loading an ad, and the widget has become completely nonfunctional. The top stories can take over a minute to load sometimes. Really just a poorly made application. The developers have no idea how to incorporate ads into content for performance. Lately it's gotten to the point where I give up and read news from elsewhere. Get new developers, NYT. You just lost a subscriber.",
"Great content, but I think I have to go back to using the mobile site. This app is very frustrating to use. The reason I'm editing my post and rating? I was enjoying the 2018 year in pictures when I left the app to do a search and was gone for maybe 30 seconds. When I returned, the page had to reload and sent me all the way to the top. The images also had to reload. Very frustrating.",
"Really am enamored with the articles and features that the NY Times presents... while I am reading these on my computer. Even though I am a paid subscriber (and have been for over a decade), I am continually frustrated by the app. Lately, it has been crashing frequently. I can no longer read Wirecutter because I cannot log in --- just see a white screen. Please fix this. A quality reading experience is what your subscribers expect and are paying for.",
"The low rating has nothing to do with the content, which I depend on. That's actually the point: The app has grown unworthy of the thing it delivers. First, it drains battery like crazy. This baffles me, since its main job - at least, the thing I want it to do - is to deliver text. Why should that be resource intensive? In this iteration, it doesn't even do that reliably, as articles chronically fail to load. I'm now reading the Times through another app. Not pretty, but at least it works",
"Two gripes: 1) For the last two months or so, have been getting at least 10 ""breaking news"" notifications a day, sometimes multiple notifications about the same thing with slightly different wording. Many of these notifications test the limit of what can reasonably be called ""breaking news."" I have all other notifications disabled. Please limit these notifications to actual breaking / new / important developments only. 2) Nighttime mode (white text on black background) is no longer available.",
"Notifications don't link you to the articles. It's so annoying. Good luck finding it. The searching function is terrible too. They should let you filter out the Reuters and AP articles. At least the coverage is great. I love the covid interactive material (graphs and maps). They don't work perfect within the app, but that's more understandable.... Unlike the notification linking issue.",
"Took away widgets - cancelling my subscription. I know there are other ways to use the app, but the widget was my way. I do not want email, I have more than enough podcasts and audio books already, and sometimes the alerts are just too much. Scrolling thru the widget wad casual and comfortable. I know it seems like a small change, but for me is a deal breaker.",
"Like many others, I find the notifications feature almost completely useless. About one time out of twenty, clicking on the notification actually brings me to the story mentioned in the notification - otherwise it sends me to the homepage for the app, and I have literally no way to guess where in the site that story might be buried. About two-thirds of the time, I can *eventually* find the story, after a lot of digging, but a significant portion of the notifications are just ""ghosts"" apparently - there may or may not be a story there, somewhere, but I can't find it. And notifications are one of the *primary* reasons I want the app - otherwise, I can access the main page and scroll through stories much more efficiently on my laptop. At a minimum, a notification ought to contain some sort of perma-link back to the story that triggered the notification, one that won't ""break"" simply because a newer story - even an unrelated one - doesn't disrupt the link. A consistently functional notification system would garner at least 4, probably 5 stars. As it is, 3 at best. ETA (March 24, 2020): Months later, and still no solution for this persistent and ongoing problem. NYT, I know you're swamped but your programmers shouldn't be. FIX this.",
"Feature set is lacking when it comes to actually browsing articles. The back button frequently takes me to the home page instead of the previous page I was on. This means I have to avoid clicking links or risk losing my place in the article. Since the front page loads so often, it eats my data. I can not use the app in this state. Reading the news is stressful enough without the app getting in the way.",
"About 75% of the time, clicking on a notification will only bring you to the homepage, not the specific story referenced in the notification. Very often that story is nowhere near the homepage, so you're left clumsily searching for it until you inevitably decide to just Google the event and read about it from a different source. If they could fix that, the app would be fine. Browsing stories looking for nothing in particular works well, but the notification system is absolutely broken.",
"The news reporting is excellent, but the app has a serious bug that appears related to the ads they embed in stories. You may be reading a story when a large swath of the screen is suddenly blacked out. You may or may not be able to scroll past the blackness, but it keeps coming back, and its boundaries jump up and down. When this happens, and it happens often, you pretty much can't finish reading the story. it is frustrating, consider that people are paying money to read the stories.",
"For most of 2018 the NYT app has crashed at least once a day. Lately the problem has gotten much worse with multiple crashes daily. Sending feedback has been a waste of time. Problem seems to be related to how the app handles ads. The app is otherwise quite good, but it's so aggravating having to reboot every time it crashes. Android on a Moto G5+.",
"Why remove the optional night mode? Literally makes no sense. If you're going to improve the feature, great, but don't remove the semi-working *optional* feature in the mean time. The app is blinding like the sun without it. I see in your patch notes we'll hear more soon, but it literally makes no sense to get rid of it in the meantime. Edit: maybe the night mode required manual work? And it was too much overhead? That would make sense, but honestly I'd take any night mode at this point.",
"Content is good, but the app is infuriating. If I tap on a push notif, it just opens the app. It doesn't link me directly to the article. Which means I have to search for the article manually if I want to read it. Really really annoying. To top it off, the search function is atrocious. It yields irrelevant articles. You have to type the exact words, which is difficult because the notifs are usually paraphrases of the headlines. 🤦",
"Terrible app design. Your place in an article isn't always kept if you switch to a different app or if you switch between landscape and portrait. The ads are distracting and frequent enough that you can have two video ads on screen at the same time, which is ridiculous considering the monthly subscription cost. The articles are worth it but you are better off using a browser.",
"The content is great but the app is in need of serious work. I can't get all the way through a story without the app glitching and sending me back to the front page with no apparent cause. As others have mentioned tapping the app notifications often fails to load the appropriate story and just dumps the user on the home page instead. Please fix this app, I want to keep reading these stories but it's becoming a real hassle.",
"The app is slow and a pain to use. Sometimes you click on an article, only to find that it's part of a list of headlines around a topic and you've been taken to the top of the list, only to scroll down back to the one you clicked on to start. I get multiple notifications for articles I've already read. Lately it just takes forever to load anything.",
"I think it's worth it for the arts and science information, alone. I don't read the news so much, but I do appreciate the slick interactive maps. It's very a visual experience, which for those who learn or are nourished in that way. As in most larger publications, there is some beautifully done writing and culture to consume. I love it, so far. The app has given me no trouble. Not at all.",
"It updates news only sporadically - sometimes up to 24 hours in arrears. Their tech staff solutions didn't work - in fact, they suggested I look at it on the web instead. Oddly, the puzzles section is always up-to-date. So for late-breaking news, I go to my apps for the Washington Post, Guardian, BBC News, Reuters, AP, etc, but hey, if I want to do the Crossword, the NYT is there for me",
"This is tough because of course NYT is the gold standard for news. No issue with the content. The problem is navigation. On Android at least, you open the app, pick an article, then start following links at the end to other articles. Now there is no way to navigate back home. Like, no home button, no sidebar, nothing in the vertical ellipsis menu. So either close the app and restart, or hit back back back back... Maybe the developers were trying to streamline for a clean look and went overboard?",
Frustrating notification experience. I'm close to dropping my New York times subscription and switching to The Washington Post. The issue with the notifications has been going on for quite some time and still hasn't been corrected. I will click on an interesting article notification but am then taken to the wrong article in the app. This drives me nuts!,
"Overall it's fine. But what the NYT app very desperately needs is a dark mode like every other major app, as well as the ability to select which breaking news articles deserve a notification. I'm receiving too many notifications of stories I wouldn't consider breaking news at all. If there were a way to choose which notifications we get based on font size of the headline, for instance, that would be perfect. I personally only want to be notified of the major headlines.",
Updated for Jan 2021: move towards live feed with mini articles on the website don't work very well on the app. Lots of jumping screens. Hard to identity what's new or old. Doesn't feel like the best way to convey news. Gimmicky. New issue is the removal of dark mode. Was a lab experiment but made the experience significantly better. Now it's gone. The Android app has continued to be a bad user experience. Prior issues were re: hiding sections and inability to curate personalized content,
"Usability issues plague this app, as others have documented. The main one that really shouldn't be so hard to fix and destroys the core reading experience: every time I scroll and the nav bar pops in or out, the offset of the whole article adjusts in the opposite direction. My guess is this is to avoid cutting off the end of the article. But as a result, most scrolling results in the entire article shifting randomly around. It is practically impossible to read anything like this.",
"The newest update to this app now has it refresh the entire content automatically, including all images and ads, every time you finish reading an article, which increases the data usage tremendously. Even when it is set to only refresh manually, it still does it, and there is no way to turn that off. I have a digital subscription, but I'm ditching the app and reading the news on my laptop or on my browser now. This app uses more data than all the other apps I have put together. Reading it in the browser loads faster and doesn't use nearly as much data. Please note that this is not a review of the New York Times content, which is always superb and well-written. Five stars for the writers and editors, just not for the app.",
"The app has always been unstable but over the past few months it has rapidly degraded to the point that it now just freezes and crashes after about 1 minute. Part of the problem seems to stem from nyt adding a bunch of graphics and other content for COVID that is preload caching on startup. Come on guys you can do better than this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling app and this did nothing to fix the issue. The ""COVID Risk in your area"" section seems like it might be the culprit",
"The rare app that actively gets worse with each version. It used to be you could swipe between sections while on the home page, and then swipe to the next/prior article when reading. Then they eliminated the ability to swipe between sections, and required to you manually scroll to the top of the home page and select a different section. Now they have eliminate the ability to swipe between articles, requiring you to return to the home page and manually select the next story. Why?",
"I've used this app for several years, especially since moving to an area where there is no delivery of the physical NYT to homes or stores. So it's invaluable to me and well worth the cost. The most recent update, however, is buggy. Some stories don't load, some take repeat attempts, and some are blank midway through. Please de-bug soon!!",
This app doesn't work well with my new Samsung tablet. I have been complaining to the nyt but they have not responded in a serious way. Clearing the cache has no effect but that is what they say to do. I can only read one or two articles when the ads and photos start blinking black and then whole blocks of black obscure the text.,
"Excellent, stable interface for reading articles. My one complaint is that there is no way to find text in an article. When reading a long article, I often want to find a reference I'd read earlier, and the only way to do so is to scroll through the whole article again--or to copy the share link to Chrome which has the find text feature. Recommend adding the find text feature to the app.",
"This app is really wonky. I tap on an article, and it takes me to a totally different one, often one I read earlier in the day. This happens about 3 out of 5 times. Usually I can find the one I want again, but not always. So crazy. Two weeks in a row I try to read articles from The Weekender and the links don't work. This week there is a brief error message saying it couldn't be opened for each article I tried.",
"Went from mediocre but functional (clunky could find what I needed) to complete trash with the most recent update. It's impossible to go straight back to stories I had been following and the ""for you"" recommendations are not as good as previously. 2 stars because I can still read articles. In this sense it is fulfilling the minimum requirement and not a total failure.",
"Great content but consistently terrible navigation experience. Articles jump around disorientingly as display ads load. Recently, navigating back to front page always takes you to the top, so you have to scroll way down to pick up where you were. Closing out of zoomed photos is only possible using back button, which is a cumbersome user experience. Save function appears in different places depending, I guess, on the kind of article? Overall, the fundamentals of the app are a kind of a mess.",
"Really disappointed that dark/night mode disappeared in the latest update. Too hard on my eyes without it. I also don't appreciate that my notifications don't bring me directly to the associated articles. The content is good but the app is slow and clunky, and the decent features keep changing or disappearing. Get it together, NYT app developers.",
"This app is incredibly buggy, even after the most recent update. Every fancy multimedia ""article"" ends up requiring a reboot and the intrusive ads often break the app (my phone is 1 yr old and not the problem). I just experienced a prime example of why I hate it: I hadn't opened the app all day but when I did, the Top Stories tab was entirely blank, even after repeated refreshing. I went to the Popular Stories tab instead, which was populated, and opened an article on heart disease. Halfway through reading it, one of the (constantly loading) video ads appeared to take over the entire screen, rendered it black, then froze the app completely. I am a paying NYT subscriber and as such expect better than this.",
"App is great when it works, but often has glitches. It seems like every time they fix one glitch (after 6 months of putting up with it), another glitch appears. Until recently fixed, I had problems where all pages would turn up with white text on black backgrounds. Now, the app struggles to refresh content and notifications only open to the main page instead of the article.",
This app has set the standard for digital versions of a newspaper for years. I have been using and subscribing to this app for at least eight years and been very happy. This last update ruined that. 1. The newsfeed widget is gone. 2. Searches from Google still try to open in the app but all I get is a blank screen. This is really disappointing NYT. It makes me question my subscription.,
"The Widget is what made this news app great. Replacing it with an excessive amount of notifications was not a improvement. I ended up having to turn notifications off because of the constant pings. Now I rarely use the NYT and have gone back to using the BBC app because they still have a great widget. It's a shame because I thought NYT had better content. Edit: The Guardian and Washington Post also have widgets. Not as good as BBC's and the old NYT one, but at least the have one!!!",
I love the Times but I am fed up with the number of times some site feature has caused frequent and persistent crashes with the app. This latest has been going on for a couple of weeks and makes it impossible to read the news with my tablet. It seems to involve location specific covid information embedded in the main page. I will give them a few more days to fix it or cancel my subscription.,
"I keep trying the app every year or so. It's just not as good as a browser. Getting back to the home page is sometimes multiple clicks. There are sections that are missing (eg, in the browser I can go to Sports, then go to ""Tennis"", or in the Well section I can go to ""Mind"" or ""Family"" - there's no way to do that in the app). It's just not up to par. Chrome will continue to be my nyt Reader for now.",
I like the interactive data visualizations. But there are some major issues. The app reverts back to the home screen automatically when the articles are updated in the background. This is very frustrating to deal with when I'm in the middle of reading an article and it forcefully exits to the home page. I have to search for the article again to complete reading it.,
"The app is frustrating sometimes. It's a pain to navigate. Those visuals that change as you scroll are wonky. There's no easy way to know how long an article is since there's no scrollbar. Articles go back to the top of the page if you make the mistake of letting your screen turn off for half a second. I turned on dark mode a few nights ago and now it's stuck that way; the alleged theme option didn't exist when I tried to switch back for daytime. At least there's the crossword, I guess.",
"So, the latest glitch (probably the result of another feature added with bad code or programming) seems to be whenever I return to the home page after reading an article it scrolls back to near the top and then ""updates"" which usually results in the app stopping, especially if the article contained a lot of graphics, images, or interactive features. Then when I contact them, I get the same boilerplate reply. Continually frustrating considering the amount of $ they charge for digital.",
"Good for news, but has some problems. Two things are really annoying. The first is that you can't search the pages! I skimmed a story, then wanted to find some specifics... No Searching on the pages! The other annoying thing is that, while you can scroll through the articles, there is no scroll bar to show your progress... You can't tell if you're near the end or the beginning of a story, so you can't budget your time. When it gets to be too long, I just bail from the app.",
"When a notification comes in for a new story, tapping on it will open the story. However, about 50% of the time, less than five seconds after opening the article you clicked on, the app will revert to the home page or some other story. Good luck trying to find what you actually wanted to read when that happens - it's rarely on the front page. Other than that very infuriating problem, it's okay.",
The content is good. The app experience is horrible. There is no easy access to app options. THERE IS NO DARK/NIGHT MODE! (And it is clearly known to the devs since they rolled it out for the crossword app) and every time you leave the app it jumps to the top of the feed. It makes for a very irksome experience. I may cancel my subscription.,
"Chat is broken and partly unintuitive UI (difficult to find things in the app). I recently had to chat in order to cancel my subscription, and the chat feature was completely broken. The keyboard covers up the conversation. If you click one of the response boxes, the keyboard disappears, and you can't get it back. It took me about 10 chat attempts to figure out a workaround (didn't click any boxes and just typed x + enter for a new line over and over until I could read the responses).",
"Really enjoy the balanced news, but a feature they have is quite annoying. When you exit an article, it takes you back to the first article at the top. Equivalent to being on page 20 of the paper, reading an article and have to start back at page 1. It's a race to press any article to stop the scroll to the top. It would be nice if we could turn off this ""feature"". My rating would be higher except for this feature.",
"Updated as usability is rapidly going down the drain. The three major faults I see are how stories are loaded (2 issues) and the lack of dark mode. The app loads ads in the middle of reading articles. It then jumps to the ads (that I've never clicked through intentionally) and you loose your position and have to find it again - annoying as hrll!. Many of the articles aren't downloaded until you click on them - doesn't work on the NY subway, duh! Get working on dark mode!",
"Any article with interactive content is unreadable. As I scroll, it randomly jumps around with no rhyme or reason. The recent article on Russian military failures was an extreme example - I tried valiantly for 5 minutes to read 3 paragraphs and eventually had to concede defeat: the app only skips to just before and just after them. I eventually gave up reading the article at all after 30 minutes of trying. It's giving me a headache. This is a huge problem I have seen for at least a year",
"I have over 300 apps on my tablet. This is by far the worst. Scrolling through articles is jumpy and unpredictable. Intrusive ads open in front of the text of articles as I am reading it. Page load times are incredibly long, ten or fifteen seconds is not uncommon, even though my internet connection is fast and strong. Grey bars flash in and out intruding on the articles. It often crashes five times while reading the paper once. The support team when contacted always blames the customer. They ignore what you say making everything my fault. If you read other reviews you will see I am not alone. This is a great newspaper, but the app is the worst.",
"The content on the app is valuable but the app itself has issues. I have the app on a Pixel 5 and an IPad pro and the issues are the same. The app is slow to load and slow to refresh. It almost never functions smoothly, most transitions are a step slow or briefly pop up loading animations. The layout could be better arranged and it doesn't offer a dark mode. Ultimately it still is worth the price of subscription. 9/28/23 : A dark theme that leaves the text black on white? What's the point?",
"This is the most frustrating app. You can't set up any shortcuts to topics, newsletters, or columnists you like. The search function is useless. I might as well get a physical newspaper, the app is hardly any easier to navigate or customize. If you send feedback in their ""app feedback"" function, they ignore what you say. They clearly employ talented people who make great techy interactive articles, maybe they should help bring this app into the 21st century. Needs a major overhaul.",
"There seems to be no way to narrow down from broad topics like Arts to more specific things like Fine Art. I end up having to rely on the save feature to hold on to articles after scrolling through posts about mostly movies and music. However, the link to Saved articles is burried more than 30 links down in the menu. IMOP this section is more important than the aggregated 'For You' and should have top level access. The search icon is also only on the sections tab which could also be top level.",
"The entire navigation and article delivery interface needs to be overhauled. The design patterns do not follow modern industry standards, and the experience does not feel even slightly personalized. This is the age of explainable AI and ML driven content consumption, I shouldn't have to dig through the recesses of the sections tab to get to the content I find interesting to me. The app should do that for me.",
"NYT has great reporting, but app's notifications have turned into a nightmare. I won't receive any notifications for days, then I'll randomly receive one. When I expand the notification, I am bombarded with all the notifications I should have received for the prior ten days or so. If I click on a notification to read an article, it doesn't open related article. Instead, it takes me to the latest news article. It's been like this for several weeks - I will be cancelling my subscription.",
I don't like the changes they made to the app. I thought the old version was more than fine. My least favorite change is I can no longer read articles in the horizontal position. Another major issue is with push notifications. Half of them don't lead to the article. A tip for users is to save the article and a lot of times it will actually save it. I do like that the app includes recently viewed.,
"If you like it, never upgrade! Every update makes it harder and harder to find the news you want. On the plus side, I spend less time reading the news now that I can't quickly jump to my favorite sections so I have time to do lots of other things. Also, considering that I pay $45 a month the ads are bloody annoying! I'm clearly paying you more for my eyeballs than the advertisers, so why are you showing their garbage to me? All that and now it crashes at least 1 time per article, sometimes 2!",
"Latest update a needless disaster. Some content reorganized seemingly for no other purpose than to make you learn the navigation button has moved from top to bottom or vice versa. Slower, buggyer, with not a single improvement over the last version, which was, itself, slow and buggy, but offered fairly straightforward look and route through the paper.",
"Content good. App very bad. No way to stop the app from refreshing after every action. So you stop reading an article and come back later, and it refreshes and sends you to the top of current news, which forces you to locate the article again and find where you left off. If I really care enough about the content, I go through a browser search and read the article outside the app. Pop up ads frequently displace content making it impossible to read. Wirecutter log on simply does not work in app.",
"App crashes constantly when reading articles, even right after clearing the cache (I'm using an updated Pixel 3, and have zero other issues on this phone). Often, you can't finish an article without it crashing multiple times, forcing you to re-find your article and your place in it each time. I don't know if this is caused by certain ads loading (it doesn't happen in every article, just most of them, and with a certain time delay), but the app is practically unusable as is.",
"Love getting alerts in my notifications. But tap any notification, even a brand new one, and it just opens the app to the ""top news"" page - which never seems to have the matching story. There's no search function. The only way to read the story is to remember the headline, type it into my browser, and ask Google to find it for me. All but useless, even though I love the NYT.",
"App bad, news good: I've had this app for many years and in the past couple months something has changed. The main page no longer refreshes on its own, articles sometimes just won't load, the comments section sometimes won't load, the main page sometimes freezes and I have to close and restart. It's annoying because the journalism is otherwise good!",
"It drives me NUTS that if my phone goes from portrait to landscape mode and then back to portrait mode, I LOSE MY SPOT IN THE ARTICLE!! This is insanely frustrating when reading a long article. There is no option in the app to lock to portrait mode so I may not renew at the end of my trial subscription, despite the wealth of fantastic content. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn't for that one INCREDIBLY irritating bug.",
"App is bogged down by feeds that make it difficult to reach full stories. You can't even reach today's edition of the paper through the app (customer support just directs you to go to the website on a browser, which defeats the purpose of having an app). They also removed side-swiping to get to the next article. Designed to be flashy and buzzy at the expense of just being able to just read the paper.",
"Doesn't work anymore. Sometime around late October this app basically stopped working for me. It loads slowly, always freezes, articles do not open. It has become useless to me. I'm none too happy about it either, as I used to read it all day, whenever I needed a break. I use the inferior mobile site now. I run one version behind the current version of Android. Pixel 2XL. Tried deleting the app, and sending feedback to the devs. My phone has several free GB available. Please fix the app!",
"The review is for the app experience. I enjoy the content, but there are so many issues with the app. The notifications don't match the content when you click on them. It just brings you to ""live news"", when my intent of clicking on the notification is to read about that exact article and not generally all updates about that storyline. Another huge miss is not having an easy option to search for content or authors. Needs major updates.",
"I used to love this app, but it seems really clunky all of a sudden. First my morning news briefing notifications stopped. Then all of a sudden, they came back. Except every morning, the notification is for the December 3rd briefing. I turned off the notification and turned it back on - nothing. Other notifications don't seem all that useful or even timely. I have often seen a news item before the notification shows on my phone.",
"All of your clever, artsy designs have made finding and reading the news almost unbearable. After clicking multiple 'headlines' hoping for the actual linear story, I'm stuck in hard to navigate, cutesy designs with captions flying over artwork and more links. Everything but the story in full form. It was a great story on Russia, but abandoned it because it continually kept flying back to the top of the story. Great journalism, overly engineered, unecessary design elements.",
"Generally great for knowing the news. If you aren's subscribed, it's still nice to let it update you with current important headlines. The big thing I don't like is how this app handles push notifications. If you press one, there's a good chance it won't actually take you to the article. Sometimes, you'll Instead be taken to the last article you read. It's then an annoying process to go back and find the article because the notification is gone and the article wasn't added to your recents.",
"Great app, great news. One bug that I've been seeing for a while: if there is more than one push notification from NYT, the text is repeated for each notification after I pull down to see the whole text. For example, if I have three push alerts from you, the preview of the text in each push is correct. If I pull the preview down to read the rest, the full text is replaced by one of the other push alerts. Hard to explain. Would be happy to send screenshots of what I mean.",
"News is fine but the app is awful. Reloads the cache while you're reading headlines. Oh did you wanna read that article? Now is moved, go find it. Also the ad positions ruin the legibility of certain articles. Yes, even if it's small, I don't want ads to track me throughout my reading. Also, why does side swiping, a motion that in any other reading app SENDS YOU TO THE NEXT PAGE, just put you in a new article? It's not intuitive and very annoying. Also I resent your native advertising.",
"The Android version of the app has many glitches, including the inability of some stories to load properly or at all. The text jumps around, which is frustrating to say the least. Please focus on making the Android version more stable. It is now almost four years since I wrote the original review and I thought it was time to try it again. I downloaded the app again about two weeks ago, and it still suffers from the same problems I experienced earlier, so today I uninstalled it once more.",
"dreadful. cumbersome and finicky. can't return to the same place when you click away to read an article, always returns to the top article. horizontal scroll is super sensitive and difficult to stop on the article you want. articles with fancy effects and graphics are not worth it, they are either unreadable or crash. simpler is better, NYT.",
"I've been using this app daily for almost 5 years while living in Manhattan and Queens and recently (the past 5-6 months) the app has gotten to be so unusable while riding the subway (and having spotty data connections) that it is not worth using unless my phone is in airplane mode and that means my Bluetooth gets interrupted. This needs to be fixed. What's the point of this app if you cannot read the news. What's the point of syncing the front page of stories if you're going to ignore the cache when you actually click on one. My workflow usually goes like this: board the train, pull out my phone, tap the daily brief notification, sit there forever while staring at a white screen until your network request that you shouldn't be making times out and the article finally loads from your cache (because it's actually available offline!). Please, for my sanity, load stories from the cache first and then update them in the background later. A former engineer of yours built a whole framework for fetching content from the internet with a layered local caching system, I recommend revisiting his approach.",
"The most frustrating app I have. I pay a NYT subscription. Stories show up in my notifications, but when I choose one, it just takes me to the default app home, not to the story I chose. Worse, I can't even search for the headline - there's no search option. So I scroll through every story - sometimes I find what I originally tapped on, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I forget what I was originally looking for. Its such a simple thing - PLEASE fix this. Take me directly to the story I tap on!",
"I should have read the reviews before I updated, which I did because certain sections weren't loading well. But the new format is horrible! The top scroll bar that had been customized to my interests is gone. I'm not sure why, since I could easily find other sections in the pull out on the left if I wanted to read them. Now, all the sections are accessed from a button on the bottom right and all jumbled together. For example, I never read sports, but have to scroll past it to get topics I want.",
"I have been a paying subscriber to The Times for over a decade but am seriously considering canceling my subscription because The Times is essentially unuseable on a cell phone or tablet. This was once a useable app. It is now more trouble than it is worth. It stops every minute or so, is slow to load and generally unstale. I repeatedly get errors from my Android phone that this app is slowing down my phone and I should allow the phone to put it to sleep to extend battery life.",
Update 7/8/20 - the app can't sustain itself for even 5 minutes. Can't even read 1 article before it stops working. Cancelling the subscription. _---------_ On a pixel and the app has started crashing very frequently. It occurs when I've been in the app for more than a few minutes. Might be because the auto refresh of news and scrolling can't be handled by the app.,
"The bar on the right that shows the position of the page relative to the length of the article is too lightly colored. It's invisible against the standard background and can only be seen when scrolling past something darker like a photo. This is not an issue when using a browser on the same phone. I've pointed this out via email, yet despite numerous updates no one cares to get these basics right.",
"A NYT digital subscription comes with good, clean presentation, high factual reporting, and occasional quality multimedia articles (of particular note was a 2019 article featuring maps and audio of those suffering in border crossings) that add up to a decent way to stay informed on US & world events. However, the paper does carry a substantial neoliberal bias, particularly in its op-eds, which I tend to avoid.",
"Great content, poorly executed software. The app suffers from recurring problems that the developers seem incapable of fixing - e.g., it doesn't display all of the text of some articles, and it crashes sometimes when refreshing. Plus new issues seem to crop up all the time... Yesterday, for instance, the swipe left/right feature to change sections stopped working. I wish there were a better way of reading NYT on a phone!",
"This app has (finally) become a decent, mature, functional app. The addition of a ""night mode"" or dark theme (as the rest of the world calls it) , even if only as an experimental Beta-feature, clinches it. It now functions very well indeed. And for the record, ALL ads are intrusive: 100% of them ', everywhere, all the time. (but let's work on keeping links live/updated)",
"Decent for reading the news. However notifications are inconsistent - I don't get the notification for The Morning every day, and if I have multiple notifications for different articles it will often click through to the wrong one. Also I want to have a permanent link to the Morning Briefing somewhere because I don't always get to it in the morning.",
"NYT, how many times do I need to say ""no, I don't want to read in the app""? I get my news from a variety of sources. Each one wants me to use their app. But NYT is the only one forcing me to cancel an intrusive popup with each article I look at. Is it really so hard to accept that a reader might prefer to use a single browser that they're comfortable with rather than a grab bag of conflicting apps bloating their phone's memory?",
"Reviewing this app to complain because I can't find anywhere else to say this. That the app automatically returns to the top of the page each time you return from a story is infinitely frustrating. Please go back to returning me to the place I left. As for the content, I have always appreciated what the NY Times offers and don't foresee ever not having a subscription. But please, please improve the functionally of the app!",
"I'm a paying NYT subscriber, and have been for years. Recently, they decided to insert a pop-up ad for this app on top of every single article on the NYT mobile web site, claiming ""the app is better."" Friends, the app is not better. The way I read the news is that I open a bunch of stories in separate tabs, and read them when I'm ready. The app only supports having one article open at a time. For me, the ONLY advantage that the app has over mobile web is that it doesn't harass me to use the app.",
"It's the Times, but the app let's it down The app isn't very stable: through multiple versions, articles fail to load and crashes are fairly common. Moreover, even though I pay for a digital subscription, the ads are becoming more and more intrusive, not to mention data hungry. All in all, a surprisingly weak effort from one of the world's great news organizations.",
In the last week the performance of this app has taken a nosedive. It either takes forever for article to load on my Samsung S8 or it only loads partially. There's nothing more frustrating than getting 3/4 through an article and have it suddenly cut off. I have tried updating my OS and reinstalling the app but nothing has helped. I will be canceling my subscription if this issue is not resolved soon.,
"Have been a user of this app for years...since before the pay wall. Several months ago, the app was changed and the malfunctions have increased. At this point, the menu dropdown is gone, I can't read opinion comments, and I can no longer swipe left to move to the next article. I am considering dropping my subscription since I read the NYT on my phone 99% of the time. FIX THE ISSUES...ROLL BACK TO AN OLDER VERSION OF THE APP!!",
"NOT A RATING OF CONTENT BUT RATHER APP They send notifications all the time, which I actually like. The problem is, their notifications DON'T TAKE YOU TO THE ARTICLE THEY ARE NOTIFYING YOU ABOUT. It is so extremely frustrating that it sends you to the home page of the app or a completely different article that has nothing to do with the notification they sent. The app as a whole is pretty intuitive except when it comes to locating Wirecutter. It is impossible.",
"I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
"I'd like to second the frustrations of the users posting the more recent reviews. This app has become very unreliable. I can no longer read most of the articles I've saved for later reading on my Android Tablet. I click on the article, and I get.....a blank page! However, on at least one article, I was able to get the comments to display. This blank article problem has happened on a good many articles recently. This was a good app to use once upon a time, but no more. By the way, NY Times......my Washington Post app works just fine.",
"The content of the NY Times is good but this app is poor. There are too many advertisements which consume too much mobile data. There are many bugs: sometimes I cannot scroll in an article, even on a good interrent connection images often fail to load, articles which appear on Google News cannot be found in the app, article links fail to load due to errors for no reason, etc. This app probably needs a complete rewrite.",
"My previous review described frustration with the cancellation of the Android widget. I have now uninstalled this app, because it is so much harder to use than NYT thru the browser. The app tries to control everything, funnels sharing through specific channels, and makes it difficult to share to a Facebook page. When I try to back up during sharing, or from anywhere, I am returned to the NYT homepage rather than the article I was just looking at. It's a navigation nightmare. We deserve better.",
"The app is constantly freezing. Often times when I click on an article, it just shows a blank page. In the cases when an article shows up, I'm rarely able to read the full article, as it'll freeze at some point while I'm scrolling. When it finally unfreezes, the rest of the article is blank. I pay for the content and I can't reach the content right now.",
"I can't open the app. I liked it when it was working. I haven't clicked for a while, but today when the News email came in, I clicked on a headline, and I got an error that says the ""App keeps closing."" I came here to see if there were updates, but there aren't. I'm a paid subscriber and I can't read articles from my Note 10 phone because emails open in the app and the app crashes after < 0.5 seconds. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I'm happy to update this review when this issue is fixed.",
"The new update has a big problem. If you scroll down a section, choose an article to read; when done go back to the scroll, it automatically jumps to the top of the page. It is frustrating, as if it were a print paper, you show an article to someone but before they hand it back they neatly fold it up, restack all the sections in order then hand it back to you. Why can't I just keep my place in the scroll!",
"Content is great! A combination of great reporting and fantastic multimedia delivery, with some extremely well done interactive graphs and visuals. 1 star off because links are often buggy. For example, links in older notifications often go to different, newer articles. Also, for about a week everytime I clicked the notification for the morning report it went to a morning report from the a week ago.",
"App was exceptional for the last couple years on my Pixel 2, content still is. The updated interface change that rolled out in Nov 2019 has slowed content loading to a crawl and I'm now considering canceling my subscription if it isn't resolved since my phone is where I access the news. Error notification helpful, but no follow-up and haven't heard about efforts to resolve. I have storage space, have cleared the cache, and am on fast internet connections.",
"Love the nyt, but terrible app. Shows the same headlines over and over, so I'm missing tons of content. And like everyone else is complaining about, the notifications don't always lead you to the article, and then it can be impossible to find it. So frustrating! I can't believe they haven't fixed these problems by now. I'm still a subscriber but I actually used another news app to scan the nyt headlines and access articles now.",
"This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like ""Download print issue"" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
"When the app gives you a notification on a news story and you click it, 9/10 times the app takes you to the main page. Effectively the notifications are useless. It's been this way for years. Even within the app itself, a main headline is not always a link to a story. It's rotten, poorly developed, and infuriating. Also no matter your political outlook, the NyTimes is increasingly ideology driven and fact averse.",
"The quality and integrity of reporting cannot be questioned. Jon Pareles on music is terrific. What must be questioned is the app's functionality. 99% of the notifications, when opened, take the user to the page where all the election-related headlines exist, regardless of actual topic. For a newspaper that dedicates so much and so many to digital, the Android app ought not to play second fiddle. NYT, please have your IT see what's going on. Thank you.",
"Notifications are broken. A preview for one story will show up in your notification, when you tap it to expand and see the whole headline, often it will change to a completely different headline. And if it doesn't do that and you tap it to open the story in the app, most of the time it will still take you to a completely different story, or the home screen of the app, in which case the story you wanted to read is often unfindable. Never been so frustrated by a news app. Get your s*** together!!!",
"I would rate this app much higher, but the notifications are useless. The App itself has a great layout, and is quick and responsive. However, if you click on a notification it will not send you to the story you received the notification for! It'll send you to the homepage. Really wonky and should be fixed.",
"Good, but could be better. If there was an option to have at silent notifications like the CNN app, I would like it better. I had to turn off all notifications because it was was going on at all hours of the night and morning. I use sleep podcasts at night so ""Do not disturb"" is not an option. I DO like the the reporting at NYTimes, but not enough to sacrifice sleep.",
"Terrible app! I have to dig for a search box. If I respond to an alert, I may see the newest stories, NOT the story I clicked. If I click an ad, then go back, I'm back at the home page, not the story I was reading. The lesson is: never, never click an ad!! Also, never accidentally hit the back button before you finish an article because a) there's no ""forward"" button, and b) you might never find your story again, even if you enter search terms YOU JUST READ IN THE ARTICLE. Gaaaah!",
This app doesn't really work well. It gives me article notifications. 9/10 times I click the notification and it dumps me on the main page instead of the article. I signed up for morning briefing notification and it doesn't show up. I don't want to have to dig through the main page to find it. The app itself looks great I just wish it worked better.,
"Great organization, but the notifications do not link to the referenced article. In fact, many of the notification topics can't even be found via search in the app (perhaps too soon to be indexed?). Please do what others do, like wapo, and provide a section of recently received notifications in the app. 6 month update: This is still not addressed. I left feedback in the app and they told me they were working on it months ago, yet still no progress.",
"Like many of the reviewers here, I also renewed my subscription through GooglePlay only to have the app refuse to recognize it. Contacted NYTimes customer support (which is also not great), didn't get a fix. Eventually they seemed to figure it out as I got access to all content back, but it took over a month. On the plus side, I learned that the Wall Street Journal is a less biased paper with a better app.",
"The app works well, and the notifications are generally non-intrusive and can be turned off. User experience is overall high quality; however, the lack of dark mode is an irredeemable issue. I'm keeping the app and subscription despite the lack of dark mode, but my retinas burn and suffer the consequences in the meantime. Also worth mentioning that your base subscription probably won't include the famous crossword, nor the other game offerings. Update: Dark mode is now here! I can see again!",
The most frustrating thing about this app are the alerts. Clicking one opens the associated article maybe 30% or the time even when being on WiFi 24/7. Or maybe it opens a page on a similar topic but you can't find the subject you click on without scrolling like a detective. Once you've clicked the alert it's gone so you have to rely upon your memory of what the title was and search is hard to use.,
"App constantly refreshes the screen, changing layout, image size, etc. Makes it impossible to view a report or to scroll through the page. If you see some article to read, you must instantly click on it or it disappears in the refresh shuffle, then you search, then it reappears if you are lucky in a different place, differet size, then whoosh, gone again. Rinse and repeat until frustration leads me to the website.",
"After having been a digital subscriber for a while, I've become disappointed by the algo-driven article selection and presentation. The top news feels is more akin to click bait than serious journalism. I much prefer the editorial control of the print edition but it's not available in the app. I've decided to discontinue the subscription and switch to the Washington Post.",
"Lots of breaking news articles pile up in my notifications. That's fine I guess, seeing as we're living in the end times, and it is happening in many terrible and newsworthy steps. But, when I click on one, I'd like to read THAT ONE. Instead it's a crapshoot what article will actually open up. It's only the correct one 10%-20% of the time. It seems often that it'll just go to whichever the most recent was. I'm paying money for this service. Fix it!",
"I'm a loyal Times reader and I understand the need to generate revenue, but the full-screen, full-color, video ads, often repeated three or four times in the same article, are wearing me out. The New York Times isn't Facebook. As a paid subscriber, I shouldn't have to be first a marketing target and only second a news consumer. Don't assume my loyalty to the Times has no limit. (Lowered my rating after a recent article included six large, color fashion ads. Next step is back to the website.)",
I have no problem with the layout or navigation. My problem is that the app uses up an incredible amount of battery on my tablet (Android) and even causes the tablet to keep restarting when the battery gets below 30%. It's the only app that does that. Have written to the NYT/android support but their only suggestion was to reinstall which didn't change anything. Very frustrating.,
"NY Times is essential. The news gets five stars. The app is flashy, but fails. The app needs qc and work. Fancy enough, but I find the app annoying, as if someone from NY Times didn't want me to read it. In particular, when I try to click on a particular article in the email message, I rarely get that article, I get something else.",
"Still almost a year and no fix. Thi is a rating of the app itself and not the publisher or content. I get a ton of notifications of articles. I don't mind, that's part of why I have the app and pay for a subscription. But when I click the notification, I expect to be taken directly to the article. Instead, the app just opens. If there were a search function I could take the extra step to search for the article. My final grievance is that my phone doesn't recognize the app as medium for NYT links",
"I've had this app from the beginning, but I like it less and have used it less for about a year now. A main reason is that it loads slow and is generally awkward for me, compared say to Google News. Just now, it also started playing audio of a press conference or recording when I opened a text story. I always hate automated video and sound -- I can open that if I want, just let me quietly read the story I asked for without unwanted sound I can’t immediately stop or worrying about slow wifi etc. Just do what I want, not what you want me to do.",
"Skip this app!!! I love the Times, but this is the worst app. I get notified of articles I want to read click the push the notification link and it sends me to the home page instead. If I finally find and try to open the article then the app tells me I am offline. I have to actually open the article in a browser if I want to read it. It's often not worth the bother. This app can't handle anything less than a 4G connection. It also offers no way to expand images or text for the vision impaired.",
"Its the NYTimes, so phenomal journalism and worth the download. That said, it's just an OK app, could use improvements in navigation (ability to read thru the paper and navigate like a traditional paper) and search (finding additional articles is tough at times, you only get what the algorithm thinks you want!). And finally...when can we have a dark mode!",
"NYTimes provides good news and opinions coverage. However they are not able to get a good handle on their app. The app has a lot of annoying bugs and doesn't work as intended half the time example, clicking on a notification does not load the intended article, lag in getting notifications, missing notifications to list a few.",
"The app loses track of where you are when scrolling through the headlines. If you open an article and then flip back to headlines it brings you right to the top, or goes blank and loads from a different place. In general it will frequently and randomly reload (probably the advertisements), go blank and skip around - up and down through the headlines.",
"Freezes up and then I get a pop-up asking if I want to wait or close the app. Sometimes it just crashes. No longer scrolls smoothly. Android 11, Pixel 3. I cleared the cache and rebooted my phone hoping for improvement. Didn't happen. This has been happening for about a month now. This app used to not be like this at all.",
"The ads are inconvenient: I am a paying subscriber and I don't want creepy ads. Today the video ad turned itself on without my tapping it, and turned off the music I was listening to in the background. The search function is terrible. Sometimes I cannot find a recent article to reread, even if I search with a key phrase I remember from the title.",
"Update Nov. 2019: This app continues to strongly disappoint. Video ads that autoplay (and, despite being silenced, automatically pause any music you're playing in another app) are just rude in a paid subscription, and they seem to be getting more frequent. Notifications are still unusable, and the most recent update makes it so even clicking on articles within the app sometimes doesn't work. This app clearly requires a total rewrite from the ground up. I'm likely to unsubscribe at this point.",
"Like others here, I am very disappointed that the widget I used to employ to put news headlines on my home screen seems to have disappeared in the latest version of the NYTimes app. Was this intentional? It appears that it was, as we are now encouraged to obtain our headlines as alerts instead. I don't want more alerts; I get too many damned alerts on my phone as it is. I want my widget back. Maybe this was just a mistake or some kind of bug. If so, please give some priority to fixing it.",
"What happened to the section scroll on top? This new version is so frustrating to navigate. I don't need an entire front page showing only one top story, and giving only 3 navigation buttons. Then, the Section button opens another drop-down list of sections. Put the sections back on top. It should be like the actual paper...allowing me to flip through section headlines quickly to see what I want to read.",
"Appreciate the content, but the performance of this app makes it almost unusable. Very high latency for any kind of UI interaction. Incremental rendering results in items moving around the screen for seconds after a refresh or article load. This leads to unintentional clicks. Even just moving back to a previous page takes seconds. Accessing sections is a two click flow, each click taking seconds to render. Appreciate new formats, but near-unusable at this performance.",
"Second rate app, horrible customer service. If you enter the app from one of their emails, there is no way to access a list of other adds. The app says you can download the articles but when offline, there is no access of all the stories. When calling customer service, all you hit is a brick wall. They could care less about receiving any feedback. I suggest getting news from elsewhere.",
"*update* I ended up uninstalling the app, and using APKMirror to download and reinstall version 8.0, which still has the widget and appears works fine. Newer is not necessarily better. Still no indication if/when widget will be back. ------- I've been using this app for years, and rely on the full screen widget to browse headlines. In the latest version, the widget suddenly disappeared. It's forced me to switch to WaPo for my news fix more often. Annoying.",
"I miss swiping from one article to the next, and I hate the front page constantly reloading. Especially since I have to go to it so many times now since you took away the ability to swipe through articles... Updating to say I finally cancelled my subscription after 6 years. I love the reporting but I hate the app. Specifically, I cannot stand the total refresh/send to top of the front page after reading every article.",
"It's a clean interface if you actually get to the right article. Whether from a push notification or clicking on a story from the front page, easily 3 out of 4 times it takes you to the wrong article, or just dumps you back on the front page. This problem seems to be in the last week or so. So whatever you updated, change it back!",
"The lead section of this app (top stories) seems to be updated only once per day, in the late afternoon. It is as current as yesterday's newspaper. It should either be dropped or kept current. The web version of the NYT, although dependent on a browser, is much better. Now the BBC app works as well as the NYT app, and is more useful even for US news. Disappointing.",
Can't use it at all because of the lack of a dark mode. Why would I even consider subscribing when I can't use the easiest way to view your content?! There's not even a way to force it into dark mode as I can with every other news app. My eyes burn after about a minutes worth of using it. Perhaps you should get with the times and provide a feature EVERYONE wants. Especially considering the unnecessary amount battery life drained by ensuring every pixel in my screen is on retina searing mode.,
"Last Update Broke Spelling Bee on Android. I used to be able to play the same puzzle on two different devices. Now, each device seems to be independent. Also, my results from the prior day aren't listed correctly. I don't see the entire set of words with checkmarks next to the words I used. Instead, all I see are the words that I used.",
"Yes, it works. However the layout is pretty chaotic. I don't see a real way the difference tabs help the layout either. There's no ""recently read function,"" or if there is I can't find it. And most importantly, there's no dark mode, which is crazy for an app all about reading. You would really think that would be top priority.",
"NY Times is a great paper and I planned to keep my subscription forever, but the most recent app update makes the app impossible to use in night mode, and there isn't a setting I can find to turn off night mode. The result is that I have turn the general brightness of my phone waaaay up to make the dark grey text stand out against the black background. This makes pictures, ads, and my navigation bar too bright to be able to look at the screen in low light conditions.",
I separate content from application. NYT content is great for me. The recent version of the app on my Samsung Android does not work well affecting access to content. An app has to work. I give the app 0 stars and will probably cancel my digital subscription. update: after a week working with customer service the answer is the problem is on my end. well...no. just cancelled my digital subscription. not easy to fo by the way.,
"Like many reviews here, article and image loading have serious, consistent problems. I think it's related to Google Play - tracking wake up path links, which I turn off on my rooted device. But I haven't experienced this level of consistent app failure as I've had over the past many months. Note to the developers; Stop focusing on tracking our data and instead focus on making a functional app.",
"This is a beautiful app, seriously. I don't know any other news app this beautiful. I love how opening it is like opening a newspaper to the front page, and how each section is along the top, and I love the font for the articles. The dark mode works perfectly for me so I can read without using much phone battery. There are kinks once in a while, and a quick email to the app team always gets a pleasant reply. Keep up the great work!",
"The latest updates make the app frustrating to use. As other users have noted, the app will scroll to the top of a section after exiting an article, meaning I have to repeatedly scroll back down to find my place if I want to read multiple articles in a section. The new lateral scrolling feature is difficult to use, and often leaves me struggling to scroll from one article to the next without skipping two articles at once or accidentally clicking on the wrong article. Please fix these issues!!",
"Top Stories don't load. Wrote to support and they said do a force stop, which works. But who wants to do that everytime they open an app? Out of the 56 apps I have on my phone this is the one that works the worst. Ironically, it's the one I pay the most for (via a digital NYT subscription). I'm giving it another week or two and then will cancel my subscription if no fix is released.",
"This app seriously sucks. Idk how you update an app and make it worse, but you did! I haven't been able to use the app in over a month. It keeps saying my device is offline, when it clearly isn't. I've tried force stopping, restarting my phone, and nothing works. What's worse is I still get notifications, but those got screwed up the last time I updated. Clicking any headline notification just links to the homepage, not the article I wanted. So, I've got a useless app now. Y'all need to fix it.",
"I agree with all of the other users who have been having recent issues with the app freezing, failing to load articles completely, or simply being unable reach any articles beyond the blurb on the front page. I loved this app for years, but it's a mess right now. Please fix it. Thanks. (Motorola Android user)",
"Very difficult to navigate after recent update. They used to have all sections at the top and easy to jump one to another, now they're hidden on another page all together and it's not intuitive. This update has made me use the app much less. The notifications are always a mess - getting duplicate notifications and not having them link to the correct article. I'll probably be discontinuing my subscription since this app was the main way I access the Times and this app has pretty much ruined it.",
"I really don't need to say anything, others have said it for me. Night mode gone and terrible navigation. Excellent content but for the time being I'll be using my computer and monitor to read the Times and avoiding this app until it is improved. This is a sorry state of affairs for such a great newspaper. P. S. Just downloaded the latest version today, still no dark mode.",
"I updated, naively thinking that the new overhaul would fix the ad-loading article freezing issue, and hoping that the ridiculous ""For You"" tab would be removed or made optional. Instead, the new app is an almost unusable disaster. What were these developers thinking??? Fortunately, I was able to revert to the previous version. Others aren't as lucky.",
"It drains your battery insanely. It's a news app, it shouldn't drain this much battery. Other than that it's okay. The app is mostly smooth but it does have stutter here and there. The dark mode feature is nice but it doesn't work consistently on all of the articles. Overall, for paid app that does something as simple as presenting text to read, this app is pretty mediocre",
"NYT used to be better than this. For quite a while now, the headline notifications that I press has been taking me to a complete different article on the app. I used to really enjoy the wide variety of reporting that was offered by NYT for decades but more and more I feel I am being steered to read articles curated by the editors. IF this is a bug in the app you need to fix it. Especially in times like these you need to be diligent in serving your readers without discrimination.",
"The newest version of the app took away all the navigation. There used to be a sidebar on the left you could swipe to get to different sections of the paper. That is no longer there. Now if you want to navigate you have to go back several pages to get to the front page to go to different sections or stories. The content, of course, is as good as ever but this app version is a waste of time.",
"Really buggy, not sure what the UX team and SWEs have been doing the past year with the other updates. Bugs: 1. Opening an article from the notification bar on android -> error of app unable to find article, takes me to the search bar. Not worth the time trying to recall and enter the article title to search for it and read it. 2. Opening the app via internet -> if I see an article linked in another website and click it, and then the default selection is to open the article in this app directly, same error of cannot find article, redirects me to search bar.",
"I want to love the app but there's two things ruining it. The first is way too many articles pushed as breaking news. More than any other news outlet. When everything is pushed as breaking to get app clicks, nothing seems to be breaking. It's the app who cried wolf. Second is that web based reading looks better than the app but we're pushed to use the app for browsing. Won't work.",
"I will regularly tap a headline notification only to be brought to one of the other headlines i had a notification for. Extremely, extremely annoying, especially when I'm saving articles for when i have a chance to read them and, when i finally have one, i might as well just write down the articles i ACTUALLY want to read interested of even trying to tap the notifications for them. In print form, if it says ""turn to page so-and-so"" for an article, I expect to find it when i go to that page.",
"I'm quitting solely because of the app and the customer service. I find myself redirected to a sign in page for every separate submenu in the settings. The last straw was when I looked into adding a subscription to the crossword puzzle. I got to a page that described the price and the cancellation process, which it said could only happen by contacting customer service. I'm not interested in that pain in the balls, so I back out without submitting. Then I get an email that I've subscribed to it!",
"App is very slow to load, with too many animations. It freezes frequently, crashing out to home page. Although I'm a paying subscriber I cannot post in the article comments. Despite NYT techs reassurance, reinstalling does nothing to solve these bugs. If the subscription cost more than $4 monthly I'd cancel, as that's all it's worth.",
"The quality of the app says nothing about the content and excellent reporting from the Times. Rather, this review is about the app only. Certain quirks in app are becoming more and more annoying. Things like refresh or ""Load more post"" buttons that won't go away, blocking the middle of an article. Switching apps and coming back can mean losing your place entirely. Swiping back results in a weird, no-man's-land interstitial. Things that just make very little sense and messes with reading.",
"Bizzare, frustrating bugs that make me want to smash my phone. When i try to expand the push notifications to read the full sentence, the notification changes to a completely differently story. And when i try to open an article from the notifications bar, it often doesnt load or takes me to the main page. Makes me use the app a whole lot less and im thisclose from unsubscribing.",
"The articles are as you'd expect but the app is deficient. Everybtime you switch from portrait to landscape or vice versa, the article refreshes and starts back at the top of the article. very frustrating particularly if youre reading a long article and have to find your olace over and over again.",
"badly implemented app. graphics often don't fit on mobile screens and are just cut off. some visualizations don't work and are just frustrating black squares. turning landscape to horizontal results in full page rerender for some reason, wasting time and loosing your place. slow in general. unwanted video and video ads in many places is frustrating for a paid subscription...",
"Too expensive. I can't claim to understand the economics of running a major news organization, but I do know that $15-25 per month is simply too much in today's digital media landscape. There are many far cheaper options for nearly the same content. While I love and appreciate the work the NY Times does and would like to support them financially, there needs to be a cheaper option. There is not a digital edition of any news media that I would pay this much for month over month. I simply don't see the value, especially as even with a paid subscription to the Times there are several other cheaper or free reliable sources of news that I would still follow, limiting the time I have to take advantage of this one.",
"Love the content but notifications are almost useless. Sometimes the notifications are blank, sometimes when I choose an article from a notofcation it takes me to the last article I read and not the one mentioned in the notification. Sometimes I will get the same article notification multiple times. They are more frustrating than useful at this point.",
"Paid subscriber here. Really irritated with a common problem that I have been having. The app will send a push notification to my phone with an article and when I click on it, it takes me to the app, maybe a front page of sorts, but not the article from the push notification. Really takes away from the app experience.",
"The app works for me, mostly.  But it eats up an inordinate amount of battery, sometimes to the point of draining it completely.  I'd decided to give up the NYT and was searching for another source of news, when I discovered that google news will happily serve up the articles that I've subscribed to, using a fraction of the power.",
"Terrible headline notification system. When I press a headline notification, it only very rarely takes me to the referenced article. This might be because the headlines are breaking and have no article, but the app doesn't distinguish between the two types of headlines which result in the user wasting time expecting to load into a full article and then not.",
"I wish there was a feature where one could view the layout of the daily print edition, similar to the WAPO app (instigator😉). I like seeing the way stories are prioritized, and seeing ""today's news"" and am sometimes frustrated when I realize I've clicked on something that was posted 36 hours ago, but is still presented like latest news, even if it is good writing and relevant information. I just like seeing something that resembles a traditional in the morning.",
"A for content, D- for functionality I can't follow up on each notification I u send, so it may be several hours B4 I lights out on a notification about an article that interests me. It's almost always long gone. I mentioned this at least a year ago and you responded, ""We're working on it."" How long does it take to apply a link? it's very frustrating. I can't find the news I want on your app. it's like, ""bait and switch!"" maybe time for me to switch subscription to Reuters or HuffingtonPos.",
"The new version of the app often fails to load articles, and is missing a scroll bar, making the article length a secret. I need the scroll bar to manage my time while reading. Now the only way to see how long an article is is to scroll to the bottom -- conveniently forcing me to see all the ads. This feels like a cynical attempt to increase ad clicks, and is insulting for a paid subscription. I really hope this is not the future of journalism.",
"Crossword has no way to access the title (which is often an important clue, esp. in harder one). Spelling be only reloads the new day if you close the app from the multitasking screen and restart. Though the design is clean, the incompleteness makes it a a poor replacement for the site. A bummer because I'd much prefer to use the app.",
"When the application works, its pretty good. Unfortunatly that isnt most of the time. The app constantly freezes when scrolling, sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes requiring me to kill the app. Articles stop displaying mid way through, displaying an empty screen for the rest of the article. Reloading the article has no efffect. Restarting the application only works sometimes. The frustration is maddening - made even worse by the fsct that I am paying for this content. Please fix this mess!",
"The New York Times produces fantastic content, i just wish that i could use an app that let me read it! The ads onn this app cause crashes do often these days that I typically need to close and restart this app at least twice before I can scroll through an article. The reason I'm here, leaving a review is because the app just crashed on be so many times that i can't get through the article at all!",
"Pros: ~The ""Real-Rime"" update coverage is impressive, the reference links @ the end of each article and links to past articles about the story, or similar stories, is fascinating (if an invitation to life hours of time reading!) and the archives are vast and wide-ranging. Choice of font size and the quality of photos is well above average. And very affordable. Cons~Loading time can seem interminable, the alert system does NOT provide a direct link to the ""breaking news"" 3/4s of the time.",
"I've been reading the Times as long as i can remember.. The app is soo frustrating though. I'll get notifications for articles that sound incredibly interesting. Nine times out of ten, I'll tap the notification and be led to a completely different article. This is my only issue with the app. But in my opinion it is a serious flaw.",
"Searching for articles is difficult on this app. I have better luck searching Google. I don't like the changes they've made with all the updates on one page. Once they changed that it seems difficult to share the articles or at least there are extra steps. Also, when I click on notifications it takes me to the wrong article.",
"Good content but glitchy app. Clicking on a notification for a specific article always fails to load the article (and the entire front page). I have to be exit and reenter the app and find whatever article I wanted manually. Also, pages will spontaneously reload and take me to the top of the page, making me have to find my place again. This will happen at least twice for each article I read",
"Doesn't work on mobile data. Must be connected to WiFi or I just get a blank white screen with a banner across the bottom that I am offline and the app is unable to update stories. Have worked with app support for weeks with no success. They just suggest uninstalling and reinstalling, and even suggested I ""upgrade"" to a version of the app that was a version prior to my current version. I usually just use my browser instead.",
"Scrolling halts and jerks. It's unpleasant to read when the text jumps. I try to follow the text with my eyes as I scroll down to read but it will stop and jerk so badly I often can't track it. It's frustrating to have to search back through a paragraph to find the place I lost. This is a common problem in many apps, it seems like I'm expected to ignore it but I just can't get used to it.",
"Giant step backwards - In my older version, I was able to ""select - check"" sections of the NYT I had displayed across the top of my home page, much as what still appears on the NYT home page web version. I could ""check"" ~6 topics which would appear on my home screen app as ""quick select buttons. I could quickly go to that section and scan the stories I wished to delve into.The newer version has removed this feature and nadded topics to follow.  GIANT STEP BACKWARDS ! I get a mishmash. SLOW !!",
This review is not about NYT journalism. Only the app. There seems to have been a recent update where they implemented a automatically hiding menu bar at the bottom of the screen. This literally ruind the app. It is so incredibly sensitive that the text you are trying to read jumps all over the place if you dare try to scroll to a new section of the article. This is my first review of an app in my life but I just felt compelled to tell somebody that the app is almost completely unusable now.,
"The app's UI is very very bad. I've also been trying, unsuccessfully, to cancel my subscription for TWO DAYS. I have to contact my credit card company and tell them to block the next payment because there is literally no other way for me to stop the $15/mo from being deducted from my bank account. I would not recommend this app or subscribing to the NYT in general.",
"Mediocre app. Significantly worse than Washington Post. NYT should just swallow its pride and license WP software. Example: you get NYT notifications of breaking stories. You click on it to read the article, and it's not there. It shows you a related article from 12+ hours ago; it's not clear the new article has even been written yet, as it's nowhere to be found.",
"Updated review: Overall, I love the New York Times. Great reporting. I can tell that the Times takes great care to be unbiased in their reporting and clearly labels articles that are opinion. That being said, the app is buggy. As an example, I get notifications when a new article is published, but the notification reroutes me to the home page and not to the article itself. Then, the description in the notification won't always match the article title, so it's hard to find the original article.",
"An absolute disaster on Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. The app has always been exceptionally slow; other apps on the same device do not have this problem. The new ""improved"" interface being rolled out is absurd on my tablet. There are only 3 navigation options: Top Stories; a tab for chosing ""topics"" you want to follow; and then a tab listing all Sections of the publication. I can no longer select sections for direct navigation access. Useless!",
"Greatest U.S. newspaper going, BUT, if you plan to access on an Android device, even new tablets, FORGET IT. The app freezes, locks you out, dishes epic amounts of ads -- poorly formatted and that interfere with content. I tried for months to resolve via costomer service. NYT is excellent at responding to complaints, not so good at following up. Please read other negative reviews, you'll find there's a theme centered around the app. Again, best paper going - with an app that will drive you nuts.",
"The reporting is good, but the app is barely passable. Constantly refreshes when going back to the homepage, arbitrarily freezes on just about every article. It's obvious that they're using WebViews in the app, but clearly they need to improve their rendering performance or switch to a different data transfer /display format.",
"Reporting is good, but app sucks. In the notification bar, trying to expand a banner notification to get a expanded look at a headline will sometimes change the headline all together and show the expanded view of a headline from earlier in the day. It's very annoying when I don't have to read the whole article but still want to know what's going on. Either dont give me a snippet in the banner or fix this annoying bug. Also the app frequently loads stories in dark mode, making them hard to read.",
"*Update* ""It's getting worse. I resonate with everyone else. Besides the messed up night mode, why remove the feature to swipe between articles? This is 2019, I don't want to reach to the top of my phone to switch between tabs. Night mode works immediately and then ends up with white article cards the second time I open the app and onwards. They also make it unreasonably cumbersome to unsubscribe.",
The app crashes every few minutes and has become essentially useless. It now always returns to the top. It fails to keep my place. It's very annoying to need to navigate back every time I finish an article. This is really basic so bottom line you broke the ap. Time to fix it back to the way it was.,
"Nicely streamlined news app that gives a good rundown of news going on, but on my android phone it continually either crashes or exits my current article to a loading screen, and then the home page. Reading an article sometimes becomes a game of finding a reopening the article I was getting through... A great app that I wish it worked reliably on my phone!",
"A 5⭐ app has gone way downhill & become much more cumbersome and unhelpful. The benefit of digital reading is quickly accessing all the sections no matter where you were. That's been lost. So has swiping between stories. Constant page refreshes get in your way. The enjoyment of browsing or deep diving through links has been destroyed. I feel like I'm using a clunky 90s app. Was the UI changed to help advertisers because it's hurt subscribers. Please ""unfix"" & restore what worked so well.",
The app itself looks and feels very well constructed and natural. I have yet to select an article that hasn't loaded or been incomplete but it lacks even elementary features such as a search tool. If you cant add even the most simple of tools to allow your subscribers to find the articles they want to read then why have an app in the first place?,
I don't use it enough to even just justify having the app or paying for a subscription. But cancelling through the app was annoying. Not hard but annoying. It kept logging you out. The chat doesn't work. You don't have a keyboard to write. You can't see the texts. You have to call. That's just too much! That's absolutely pointless. How hard is it to make it a press of a button?,
"The newspaper is first rate but the software is buggy and doesn't automatically refresh like it is supposed to. Moreover, even if you set it to download all articles in the background, it won't. But possibly most annoying is the fact that they just removed the widget without even telling us. Bring it back!",
"Notifications of articles I'd like to read bring me to completely different articles on completely different topics, and it's a huge pain trying to find the ones literally named in the notification I click on. Poor user experience. No improvements in the time I've seen. Annoying to click on articles I ultimately have a huge pain finding to read.",
"The font in this app is too small for comfortable reading. There used to be a text size setting for the app, but it was recently taken away. I don't want to increase the text size of all my other apps - they're fine. It's only this app whose text is too small. This app needs a setting to adjust the font size.",
"Really like the Times content, so had put up with the increasingly intrusive ads. But after the latest update I can no longer see pictures once I click in past the headlines. Most significantly that means crosswords and puzzles do not work at all, aargh! Reinstalled, cleared cache, still doesn't work. NYT please fix this!",
"The news is good, but the app is hard to navigate and when you tap one of the apps constant notifications, it takes you to the top of the front page instead of to the article you were reading about. The front page overall is useless to navigate, and is impossible to use to find anything.",
"Free version is okay however after having for only a couple weeks, while clicking on notifications to read articles you are subject to a full-page subscription advertisement every single time you do so. Not normally a problem in most apps as they can be dismissed. Not so easy here. With this app the only way to dismiss the ad is to use the 'Back' button and once you do so, you lose the article you clicked the notification to read and are brought to the homepage and lose the article.",
"The past few updates (Late Dec/early Jan 2021) have made the app totally unusable. Navigation is a mess, the main news feed doesn't save your spot when exiting an article, ads don't load until mere seconds from scrolling by them (pushing content around as they appear), headline notifications don't bring you to the story you're notified about...I've had it. Switching to mobile web access until this disaster is fixed.",
"I used to love this app, have used it for years without issue however in the past few weeks it has become completely unusable For several weeks now, when I receive a news alert from the NYT, the received page is covered by an opaque black overlay that makes the articles text completely unreadable I've been waiting for you to fix what I had assumed was a temporary glitch, however if you do not do so soon, I will be sadly forced to cancel my subscription.",
"Paying this much for a subscription, I expect a dark mode at a minimum. Please get on the ball with a dark / night theme. WaPo has this figured out and it's a much better value (they even include crosswords in their subscription). Great journalism, but disappointing overall value. You're 5 minutes from cancellation. Update 12/28/21: Tapping notifications never takes me to the correct article. That, along with the key of dark mode makes me think the subscription is no longer worth it. Cancelled.",
"Super annoying that clicking a link in the app (for instance, an NY Times cooking recipe) forces me into my browser where they want me to log in again. What's the point of the app if you're just going to force me to log in again on Firefox! That's stupid. Also ridiculous that they still serve ads even if you're a paying subscriber.",
"The app is infuriating - deserves 0 stars. An ""update"" recently broke it so you couldn't swipe left/right to go between articles. Then, a few days later, it started working again (except in the ""Today"" section) on one tablet, but remained completely broken on another. I have it set to download articles in chosen sections twice a day, yet often it will hang for a loooong time before finally displaying an article in one of those sections. I'm about ready to cancel my subscription - they have made a not-so-good app into a truly crappy app.",
"Love NYT reporting and Opinion, but this app crashes constantly! Maybe especially in the morning? Freezes up, won't scroll, screen goes black. Tried adjusting all the settings. I do use a VPN and disable my location - as their editorial lage suggests we all do - so maybe this contributes to ads crashing the app? Don't know. Android user; this wasn't a problem on my old iPhone.",
"The billing system isn't very amendable, you have to be careful what date you start your subscription because you'll get constant emails telling you to update your payment info if the payment hits between deposits or you run low. And apparently they can't prorate or balance charge you to adjust the date. It sucks when it makes an overcharge. Or maybe🤔 I just need to budget better 😁",
"Updated 31JUL2020. Love the articles. Please fix the puzzles. 😭😭 Notifications do not work. Click on one and it takes you to a different article. Examine every article available, and the one they notified you about simply isn't available. None of the games with properly anymore. Vertex shuts down. Spelling Bee rockets off a string of letters you didn't even touch and has to be manually restarted. The crosswords don't refresh properly. The acrostic clues are truncated. Sad.",
"One of the most important new organizations in the U.S. today. Their widgets seem to have mysteriously vanished, which is a shame; I'm reduced to Google News and Flipboard to get headlines on my home screen. Nonetheless, I'd say the NYT is indispensable tool for being an informed American. They aren't perfect (and neither is their app) but they're pretty darn good.",
"The new bottom tabbed version of the app is terrible! I hate that all of the content is clumped together now. I miss the pivot sections because I liked to browse through the Magazine section, opinion section, and technology section independently. Now I have to click a SEPARATE sections button and search through some exhaustive list of sections to find the ones I really want!! Please revert back to the other layout or give me the option to choose the pivot layout. The new bottom tabs are garbage.",
"I am so frustrated with the notifications from this app. Every day I get a notification for an interesting, intriguing headline. I click on it and the app opens in THE MAIN PAGE not the story in the notification. I then have to hunt for the story in the notification and I only find it about 1 time out of 10. It's such a basic basic feature. Why can't you get it right ?!?!?",
"This app is so... I don't know. It works great some times and I love the work the Times does but this app just stops working sometimes. I have a slow internet and when my speeds go slightly lower than normal the app says I am "" offline"" and just gives up trying to connect or load anything. No idea why. The video plaer also doesn't work. It only loads full quality video but I usually watch things at 140 to 240 p just to get a smoth video. Also it doesn't rotate? Hope these get fixed.",
"Spelling Bee no longer syncs with other devices. Every time there's an update, Spelling bee stops syncing with the web version and my iPad. It happened with the May update (which later was righted), and now once again with this latest update. Uninstalling, reinstalling, logging in and out does no good. My progress is synced across all other devices, just not with the Android app. It's annoying. And yes, I clear the app cache and storage.",
"Installed the free version, prepared for less functionality than a paid subscription. Read one article. Unable to read anything after that because all I got was a pop-up telling me I had to pay for a subscription everytime I clicked on an article. Don't advertise that this has a free version when it doesn't. Uninstalled.",
"Good app overall. Well laid out and appealing in itself. One very annoying problem: when I receive a notification about a specific article, and it interests me, i expect to see that article when I touch the notification. Instead it just opens the front page, and no sign of that article i was interested in!",
"This app used to download most articles so I could read them when not in wifi and no data signal. Now it only downloads a few, so if I want to read on the subway for example I have to go thru and save articles in advance. Which means it's useless for my purposes. Plus its insistence on updating after every article is really irritating.",
"App is broken. I got the same daily briefing push notification for weeks. Reinstalled the app today to see if that would fix it, and the button to log in doesn't work. App is poorly designed. A year ago there were beautiful, useful panes that I would swipe between, as well as a swipe right to bring up the main menu. Now there's just 3 tabs: ""All"", ""Some"", and ""All, but somehow even more disorganized"".",
"I really expected better from an outlet as prestigious as the NYT when I recently signed up as a new subscriber. However, this app crashes constantly. I reopen it and can't even get an article open before it crashes again. I don't have problems with any other apps on my Motorola (Android 7.1.1) phone. Please fix this!",
"The app largely works at giving you a multimedia experience when reading the Times. However, it's still not quite as convenient as a browser, especially when trying to go backwards AND forwards through the articles you read. It is gradually getting better at it, though.",
"Still not fixed after a long time, so drop another star off. Had always been a great app, but now it is broken. App doesn't work right since Android Pie update on Galaxy. Articles often don't click load right from the homepage or preview widget. Everything on the homepage is unreadable gray on white now, or sometimes it is black background and unreadable. I wish I could share screen shots. It is bad. Hope you guys can and will fix everything soon so I will be able to increase the rating score.",
"The Times should immediately assemble a team of investigative reporters to investigate why it can't make a good app. The situation as it stands is disgusting. My Times apps on two different Android phones keep freezing up. Maybe the Washington Post can do better. Update: The app gets worse and worse, very much a pain to use, freezing up more all the time. Does this paper have any sense at all? Doesn't it know it depends on digital subscriptions?",
"Mostly user-friendly app with a few MAJOR flaws. It relentlessly updates at any navigation, or if going in/out of service (eg, subway), gobbling up ridiculous amounts of data for no reason at all; app background use restriction doesn't stop this. Updates can push stories out and search function is virtually unusable. Even searching for recent stories by headline keyword or words yield strange hits; I switch to Google to find stories but then can't read them in the app.",
"Such excellent content and such an incompetent app. Crashes/freezes are common on my Pixel 3 with 75 Mbs+ connection speed. Night mode, without which reading in the dark is nearly intolerable, has been removed. I pay $10 a month for an unreliable app missing a basic feature. Meanwhile dozens of other free news apps with inferior content provide 100% reliability and a night mode that works. Please fix this before you drive me and other loyal readers away.",
"Makes it easy to scroll through and read the top ""front-page"" news stories and search for specific items or subjects. Also, when you Google something and an NYT story comes up in your Google search results, if you open that story it will give you the option of opening it in the app, which makes it easier to read and bookmark the story. Then you can easily return to your bookmarked stories, even monthes or years later",
"NYT breaking news alerts come in way too often. It needs to be broken into different categories. For instance, if there were a ""Breaking News: Deaths and Obituaries"" toggle that would be wonderful.",
"Such a disappointing app from such a good news source. I spent too much time looking for news the I want.Some days I get on the paper and all I want to read is anything new. I can see an article's a 5-minute read but not when it was published. Basically, I want politics, world news, US news investigating reporting &games. I don't want to see any sports celebrities.I don't how the ""For You"" comes up with an algorithm that gives me only articles about things I really don't care about.",
"Notifications are a mess. Even when you try to limit to ""breaking news"", NYT feels the need to interrupt you with notifications about college administrator being fired, and $0.15 raises in subway fares, and sports news. Are you kidding me? Also, when they do notify you if a story that actually is important, when you click the notification, it takes you to the app, but often not the actual story!",
"Last update screwed up the app. It kicked me out of my account so I had to reenter my login details, and now everytime I link from an email newsletter to the app, I'm faced with a huge subscription ad rather than the article. Totally sucks! If this is the new experience, I will be unsubscribing because linking to the app from newsletters is 90% of how I use the app. Terrible update, which I hadn't installed it",
"The app is decent enough but in terms of content, there’s too much editorial creep for my taste. On the plus side, I get free access through the library and free is the right price.",
"Stop blowing up my phone. Between emails and actual notifications I get about 20 a day to my phone from this app, even after going into the app's settings and trying to turn off just the ""15 ways to make jello pudding"" fluff pieces. I've enjoyed my subscription but I've had to completely mute the notifications on this app for my sanity. Everything else with the app is great but apparently I can't get just 1-4 a day... it's all or nothing. Will probably not renew my subscription next year.",
"While I find the New York times to be entirely too filled with way too much liberal rhetoric and one-sided viewpoints, the all is well done and configurable. You can find reasonable science and health content and the data is peer reviewed. if we could do with our the soon and just present the news, it would be a lot better for all.",
"After the latest app update, it tells me i don't have a subscription. I'm sure my subscription is still valid, but tried to renew, just in case i was mistaken. But it won't let me renew either. Some weird error message pops up.",
"Update sept '23. They STILL refresh the entire timeline every time you return from reading an article or switching to another app. It's exasperating and frustrating. STOP IT FFS! See bbc - they have a button that says ""updates available - click here to refresh""",
I wish the 'Search' feature were a little more intuitive to find; you need to go into the 'Sections' tab to find it. I also sometimes have trouble opening push notifications on Android. Otherwise the app is very well made and seamless to use.,
"Something in a recent update has broken persistent logins for me. Now I have to login every time I open the app, which is beyond annoying. Been using this for years, mostly with no trouble. And then someone pushes an untested update. I truly wish there was an easy way to downgrade versions on Android.",
"I love the UI, and it works great for me (both on my current Razr+ and previous 5G Razr), but the subscription option has disappeared from my Google Subscriptions, so I can't make this month's payment. When I log into the website, it tells me I subscribed via Google Pay and to go there, so I guess I have to let it lapse, cancel out for at least 30 days, and then try again. That's really annoying and kinda disappointing – but they still my Crossword sub, and no problem taking that $5! 🙄",
"Love the NYT, but this version of the app is beyond horrible. The largest text size is still too small, making reading on my Android phone very uncomfortable. And I deeply dislike scrolling left to right within sections.",
"Use caution when subscribing through Google Play. The New York Times does not honor the subscription on other devices or in browsers - this will be app only. Both the New York Times and Google's customer service defer the problem to the other company, so no responsibility is taken and there is no recourse for the customer. I would recommend either purchasing your subscription directly through the New York Times, or choose a different publication to use on your smartphone.",
"I love the New York Times as it is gold standard of news coverage. Sadly, however, the same cannot be said of their billing. The due date of a ""monthly"" subscription is apparently subject to change, without notice, on a month to month basis. I finally grew weary of getting email spam that my payment was due less than 3 weeks from my last payment and charged again, then again two weeks later. Thanks but no thanks New York times. Onward to the Washington Post app! 💯",
"I enjoy reading the NY Times. While some of the articles are written with a biased viewpoint, every article is usually well researched and well written and offers me a side of the story. I can balance that opinion against other well run newspapers to better understand all views. It would be nice if we could learn the facts without the reporter's spin, but for journalism to survive, it needs readers. I am highly satisfied with my subscription, just wish there was no limit to sharing articles!",
"The NY Times provides global news stories other than the repeated ones a lot of news outlets gravitate too. It provides a well rounded view of topics to choose from which will interest every individual reader. It's virtually impossible not to find what interest you through this paper. The insight the paper provides of our world we live in is outstanding. In addition, it's more than just a newspaper. Take a look. It's very reasonably priced which in itself is a added bonus for the reader .",
"Even after removing and reinstalling, the app doesn't display pictures. I have settings to automatically download pictures but nothing appears until you click on article and then click on each individual picture. Kinda not worth the couple of bucks i pay every month.",
"App is reasonable, except for the gigantic ad space shown even with a subscription. They have a dark mode, but show inline ads that are bright white on every page - index, homepage, articles, everywhere. App is essentially unusable, and not worth the subscription price.",
"7/17/23 edit: the app is asking me to log in everytime, isn't loading articles properly, and not registering the save article button. These ads are getting intrusive. Often click on ads while scrolling through an article. I can understand the need for ads but it should take less space.",
"One of my main news sources is NYT. I also like to share important news on Facebook and elsewhere to inform friends and followers and give them useful, up-to-date talking points and research they can use in their own conversations, feeds, and activism. So.... having access to the NYT app—which is very user-friendly and built for social media—saves lots of time and headaches. Whoever designed this app was top of the line: never any glitches, saves my userID/PW and is professional and intuitive.",
"Pretty meh. If you're going to nag paying(!) customers to use your app it should offer something the website does not. But instead the app often doesn't refresh automatically (and now has refused to refresh at ALL for 3 days), and there's no tabs like a web browser for opening multiple things you might want to read at once.",
"I don't know why I have to enter my password every day for this app. There should be a way to save your password or make it easier to log in. It doesn't even save my email address so I have to enter that too. No check box to save account info. For a paid app, that seems pretty basic.",
"I have been a lifelong subscriber of the Times. The app specifically has some accessibility issues (with resolution) on mobile devices. The Times also takes positions sometimes that I don't agree with, for example against remote work. However, this is in my opinion the best news app out there.",
"As a person who is always suspicious of a free lunch I like that NYT online is a paid subscription. However, I wish I had access to all of the content with that subscription. I don't think the newspaper would have survived if they charged by section. It is also supported with ads so wouldn't it make more sense to levet all of the content to drive up subscriptions?",
I've been a subscriber ever since it became digital and the pathetic Kindle version before then and printed version before that. We also subscribe to four other digital newspapers plus our local newspaper's print edition. And we don't watch TV broadcast news. it's the least and most that we can do to support journalism.,
"Hello, The news is very informative. Thank you so much for bringing the subscription this low. Please include an option to follow the article writer. When I read an article by a writer, I will want to follow the person, which is not possible now without the option ""follow"" the rest of the features are getting better and better every time.",
"While it's nice to have All Access for a Very Good Intro Rate, I only read the columns of One Opinion Writer. So why does the NYT make it incredibly difficult to find his latest Column--unless I follow a specific Columnist's Email that cones to me?! Losing points for not figuring out my narrow use of this Great American Newspaper.",
"Works well enough but it's surprisingly awkward to find articles - the priority seems to have been to make the home page look as much like a broadsheet as possible, but just personally I'd prefer ease of finding articles quickly with the addition of a search bar.",
I just subscribed with the $1 a week promo for the first year and my App keeps asking me to subscribe. I love the NY Times but this is very annoying. I am a paying customer and shouldn't have to be subjected to the Times continuing to solicit me. This is why I subscribed!!!! It's annoying....,
"Been an India-based digital subscriber for several years but now finding it impossible to continue my subscription following some changes in recurring payment rules in my country. No India-based card apparently will work for NYT payment as NYT is non-compliant with local recurring payment rules. Strangely, NYT will rather cancel a subscription than allow Indians to make one-time payments to continue their subscription. Use a US card is all that NYT's helpline can offer!",
"I subscribed to the NY Times the very first time I heard some idiot who later was elected president call it ""fake news"" . That statement from the biggest liar ever to occupy the Whitehouse was proof that there is some great reporting going on there. Thank you for your outstanding journalism at the NY Times from Florida !",
"I love the Times and read it every day, but I keep being logged out recently, several times a day. No 1Password integration so it's annoying to log back in. Been a paying subscriber for decades but this is making me not want to read the news or at least uninstall the app.",
The app suffers from bugs every so often. The latest one - which rears its ugly head from time to time - is where the app constantly says I am offline and doesn't reload despite having both data and WiFi. Sometimes a force stop fixes it but often it doesn't and I have to clear the cache or data in the file storage.,
"This app is so slow and frustrating to use. What's the point of giving me notifications if tapping them just opens the app, not the specific article mentioned? Not to mention, it takes 5 minutes to update every time i go to the home screen. It's not rocket science, just implement good UX design. As it stands, the app is a disservice to NYT.",
"Unable to retreive updated Google Play payment. I keep being told by NYTimes that I need to update my payment method in Google Play store - and it just continues to say that after updating my payment info. All my other paid apps switched to the new payment method registered with Google Play, but not this app, not NYTimes. 1 star until this issue is resolved.",
"Daily headlines in my hand. I just love the convenience of having award-winning journalism - real journalism - In my pocket all day long. I appreciate the breaking news notifications and enjoy the access to games for a very decent price, and not one tree was harmed. 💚🌱",
"Popups to upgrade are not good! I'm just a news subscriber but the popups to upgrade my subscription really ruin the experience. I'll be canceling in the morning. Yo Sultzberger, fire the schlubs that think that messing with subscribers is a good idea.",
"Although I subscribed primarily for the puzzles, the other content, news & the app itself, are of exceptionally high quality. The chat feature in Help is manned by very friendly, professional staff also. Even unsubscribing was a pleasant experience.",
NYTimes app doesn't open up when using a link to an article. Instead it opens in a browser. This creates problems with login. Please fix this issue.,
Some sections are hard to find. E.g. Wirecutter and The weekend selection of stories which I can only access via the email sent. Perhaps the links are there but they are quite well hidden.,
"Having a hard time navigating, but especially with the podcast component in the app. Controls for the podcast... disappear, and/or the podcast will randomly stop playing.",
"Could not live without my NYTimes. Reality is still reality, thanks to the Times. Loyal reader since my parent's required it of me in the 8th grade. I'm 56, so it's a life long relationship. I know whatever happens in the world, NYTimes will (accurately!!!!!!) tell me about it. It has been a comfort in these troubling times. Thank you NYTimes! ❤️u!",
I only read the nyt because I have a free subscription. Nyt seems to want to punish me for reading their paper. Constant emails. Newsletters to my work email I can't unsubcribe from. And an app that signs me out constantly and shuffles around content.,
"This is the absolute best news source/app I have ever used. Not only is the coverage of current events excellent, but all of the other helpful information about everyday topics is also good. I also really enjoy the high-quality daily crosswords. 😁",
"Smartest thing I've read about what's really going on in the US in the Age of Trumpism. If we lock him up, we'll get someone even more destructively clever, like Hawley, unless we fix the fact that the US meritocracy has become anything but over the last century: it's now a caste system with largely pre-determined outcomes, determined by birth. David Brooks has gradually, over the last couple of decades, elevated himself into the most sublime American essayist of the 21st century.",
"This android app is worth 4+ stars. However, why, after many months, is NYT audio still not available for Android? And btw, the audio section of the existing android NYT app is awful!",
"I love The NYT, but I am not feeling them right now. I was forced to cancel my subscriptions because for weeks on end my Sunday paper did not come, and my subscription included the physical Sunday paper. The Times' customer service could care less. It makes me so, so sad.",
"Can't log in, asking me to subscribe again despite active subscription. App is broken for Google login, don't subscribe as it will not work. Every time I log in it logs me out straight away. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling.",
It was so helpful so please don't be too much strict when it becomes to your own policy just because on my location and too unmindsets peopled who didn't barely think trices just because they want it application but me I suggest to you just provoke those people who can used this kind of application about was provened without testified.,
"Recent updates sign me out, requiring me to sign in again and wiping my saved articles from access within the app. Also, please remove the annoying point popup within Tiles. It ruins the game. Thanks.",
usually after chrome upgrades it does not recognize my annual subscription which runs for a few more months. asks me to subscribe. spending way too much time on that issue,
"NYT games are the threads that bind my day together. From the anticipation of what new challenge the morning's Wordle brings (and my daily competition with my son), to the satisfaction of breaking the ""genius"" barrier in Spelling Bee (without giving in to the temptations of Google), the NYT games fill the quiet mo.ents of my day with a expectation, fascination, and even a little joy.",
"App keeps logging me out. To make it worse, it won't allow me to use a password manager to login. I will not be renewing my subscription unless this is resolved.",
Too Bloated. Why Ads if I paid for the subscription? Remove Ads. Simplify the app and reduce or eliminate data collection. Otherwise will not renew.,
Great news source... but have been waiting for the audio app for so long. Android paying subscribers deserve parity in service. Three months and counting.,
I'm a Midwestern conservative and I like the fact that the Times covers the news in more depth and much better than the fifteen second soundbite drivel of other news media outlets.,
It's a shame & a pity that issues of gender & race inclusion weren't in the space between Wenner's ears nor those of his editors & publishers. I haven't read Rolling Stone since my 20s; good that Wenner has retired to perhaps make room for more inclusive eyes in the editorial desk.,
The Times app is clear yet complex. Super easy to navigate. Offers me the information I need to be an informed citizen. love it!,
App worked great for over 5 years. Very happy. Then in April 2023 the app quit showing any text-- just photos. Called and/or emailed NYT 6 times. No one could help me fix the problem. Now I have to read the Times in my browswer which sucks because I'm not able to access all the benefits of my paid subscription. Horrible customer service.,
"The New York Times is an excellent news source, great writing, insightful editorials, interesting and diverse selection of special columns and it feeds my brain rather than my ego. Happy to be a contributing subscriber.",
It's never a good sign when an app that you have a paid subscription with prompts you for review mid-article. The NYT is dead.,
"Excellent news source that breaks down stories into digestible facts and provides up-to-the-minute updates. Graphs and other visual aids make NYT my go-to for staying connected to what is happening. I will say though, that this is American media and the capitalist western agenda is sewn directly into the coverage.",
"So cool to learn about this. Although the hyperbole about the plants ""racing"" to sunlight made it exciting, reporting Doug Tallemy's nonplussed reaction made the article relevant. Doug Tallemy has been the US intellectual leader of native planting for a long time and it is very refreshing/valuable to learn about frameworks for native planting that are more specific and even extreme.",
"I have subscribed twice to the NYT and both times whenever I try to read it or the various newsletters, it tells me that I need to subscribe to the New York Times. Frankly, it's not worth the hassle.",
I like NYTimes but adroid notifications suck. I've activated the notifications multiple times but this app never sends me notifications.,
"Clearly the Android app is not a priority like iOS. Basic features won't work (like saving articles) but if all you want to do is read without a web browser, it'll do.",
The NYT has robust writing with articles flooded with facts and sources. The variety of subjects satisfies many curiosities that I didn't know I had. I subtracted a star because the Times has few articles that I can listen to when my eyes grow tired.,
"I do like the app. Lately, though, it's been doing this weird thing when I open an article. After the article opens, the screen jumps to one of the ads that are spaced throughout the article. It's as if they are trying to direct your attention to the ad instead of the article. Even if I start scrolling through the article a bit before the ad load, the article will jump to the ad when I'm in the middle of reading an article and I lose my spot, so I have to find where I left of in my reading",
"The app is actually fine but I successfully cancelled my subscription months ago. I'm still being charged only now with no access. No one has ever replied to my enquires. So basically, only subscribe if you're into unfulfilling, life long commitments. Update months later. Still no response. Still being charged for articles a can't read.",
"Excellent online news. great writing. Broad range of subjects covered by top class writers, journalists and independent experts.",
"What a garbage source of information. ""Breaking news"" notification are about someone kissing or something even dumber. Not to mention the extreme bias",
"Extremely solid app and very customizable. Only niggling thing is it sometimes tells me that I've been offline for 14 hours or whatever, when I'm clearly online with access to the full internet.",
"Utterly biased and opionated media that clearly differentiates between the developed and the developing world. A prime example is the France riots where the coverage has been dramatically mellowed down and frankly is quite appalling . If this had happened in a country in the global south, these same nincompoops would have cried from the rooftops. These racist 'journalists' should go back to their respective schools ( if they attended one i.e) and re learn what journalism is all about!",
"The news is balanced, up-to-date, comprehensive, and it reads very like the UK's Guardian. The handling of subscriptions is poor: seemingly over-focused on getting you to subscribe, (when you're a subscriber anyway) and you have to pay extra for crosswords and recipes, which is a pity. When I've been in touch, the respose team was well-informed, attentive and helpful.",
"The content is fine, but boy oy boy do they love sending unsolicited email, even when you have opted out of all of their mailing lists. They also make it way too easy to accidentally sign up for more mailing lists when you just want to use the app; they put popups with accept buttons where you're likely to tap, so you enroll in another damn list. NYT, what do you gain from irritating your paying customers?",
"I have been reading the NYT since I was a child. It's my go-to for news, entertainment, politics and fun such as news quiz and mini crossword etc. Getting digital now that I live out of state. I read and sometimes listen every day. The breaking news alerts are invaluable, keeping me well informed at all times. Thank you NYT. You all that put it together are so important to my life.",
Be careful with this subscription. I no longer used the app and so cancelled my subscription 3 months ago. Only to find that last week my subscription auto renewed and that I had been charged for a month's subscription. I have since been sent around in circles between NYT and Google Pay both claiming that it's the responsibility of the other to issue the refund. Was a huge fan of NYT but sadly now think that they are shady.,
"Update, Over 3 years later and it still happens!! I click on a breaking news notification only to be brought toa completely different article.What is the point of notifying me about an article only to click the notification and not be brought to that article? Every single notification brings me to the home page and cant find the article it mentioned. This app absolutely sucks and needs alot of work. Turned off all notifications because this is horrible. Why am I paying for this?",
"Do not purchase a subscription via Google Play subscription services. Two months after I did so for an annual subscription my account suddenly wasn't subscribed anymore. The NYTimes support team claims they can't validate the subscription because the information is stored on Google servers, and so they can't help. Now I'm left trying to get Google to make my NYTimes subscription work. Don't offer in app purchases if you can't make them work correctly...",
"Using the app for about a week now. I was hoping that by subscribing I could avoid ads. I don't mind paying more for that kind of feature, I just don't want to see ads. The ads are also just weird; my coworker was wondering why I was looking at a man in a bathing suit. I wasn't, it was an ad that broke up a portion of the article I was reading... The article search function is terrible. I was trying to find an article I know I've read before, but it was bringing up OCR articles from the 1800's.",
"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY! I purchased an annual subscription for the NYT all access through Google Play but the subscription never went through to my NYT account. I contacted both Google Play and the NYT app support and each told me to contact the other and neither connected the subscription with the account. Now I'm out the price of an annual subscription, told I'm not eligible for a refund, and still don't have access to the NYT crossword or news. 🤷",
"A great spectrum of topics and long form, thoughtful news. Sure it may seem like a certain perspective, but it's always a thorough, comprehensive perspective I seek for my overall news input. Getting quotes in news stories from experts is particularly relevant.",
NYT please bring back the sharing option for IG Stories! Loved that feature allowing me to let my friends see news headlines that matter to them!,
"Lets you save stories but when you try to view them in the Saved section, they do not appear. The search function is the most unhelpful and antiquated one I've ever seen, never finds anything vaguely related to your search or even recent.",
"the app is very functional, and sometimes even better than the website itself. a good balance to keep info available while on the go.",
"NYT, could you add a ""sports"" notification on/off switch? Also, frequently the header photo doesn't load leaving a dark grey rectangle in its place",
"I really really hate that when I back out of an article, the app brings me to the top of the feed automatically rather than back to where I was in the feed when I accessed the article. I can't be the only person who hates that.",
I got the feeling this app doesn't work well on Android. I pay an expensive subscription and I get a substandard app. When they have articles with pictures overlapping text the app crashes most of the time. Google Pixel 6.,
"its an excellent application, gives you a very good experience navigating all the information the newspaper have!",
"What's not to love about The New York times? Opinions, advice, recipes, newsworthy articles and I really love the font they use.",
"This and so much more! Now scooping Dx from terminology in EMR, or diagnostic reports. Problem relevant or not, once branded, it never goes away and adds bias to care and risk of assumptive (inaccurate) care.",
"While there are those articles unopened for comments, most are. I enjoy writing something which hopefully adds to what others write. Many contributors are both passionate and well-reasoned. One might surmise it requires some investment to provide for public commenting. I wish more news outlets might make it available. Who knows if consolidation is a real reason? We do need more of it. And no, I do not want a bunch of trolls running the boards. NYT does screen troll-E stuff.",
"The app is wonky and night mode suddenly no longer existed but it came back. It's a work in progress and I don't use it for surgery, it's fine.",
"NY Tumes is still the best newspaper in the US, if not the world. It is comprehensive, informative-news we can trust to be well researched and true.The website is easy to navigate.",
"David Sibley describes how to draw birds in the simplest and most honest way. I teach art to third graders who will love this. Just get the outline right, and the rest is just like a coloring book!",
"The Times. NY Times. I visit site each day. I do miss the print edition, though. To me, nothing compares to the Sunday Times print edition. I'm aging myself here.",
"Reliable, trustworthy, & affordable. Irreplaceable. Having problems with app?... try uninstall then reinstall. Excellent Chat customer care. Browser versions on Tablet and IPad work and look great. Caution, habit forming.",
Seems like any time there is an update. Says I'm offline. When of course I'm online. Ads even with subscription. And I see I'm signed in yet check settings I have to reenter user name and password.,
"The standard had been gold, but the crown slipped a bit. Haven't forgotten the selling of the Iraq War and giving a platform to disgusting Tom Cotton, among other things. The best at what they do.",
Every time I try to log in it acts like it's logging me in but doesn't. I am a subscriber. I can get in through the browser on my pc but not on my phone. I might just cancel.,
"Still buggy. Ads make an article advance and u have to scroll back. Would be nice if major bugs are fixed, its in the update.",
"Stand by for an inbox of spam email you don't want. Signed up with NYT and within hours emails from american companies were appearing in my inbox. Pretty obvious who sold my details, I'm in Europe. Read what they give you. Menus etc not easy to find. Not impressed.",
"I enjoy the puzzles and stories recommended in the app. It's intuitive and reliable, unlike some news apps.",
"Wide-ranging but, unfortunately Op-Ed pieces are put forward as news. The general fall of journalism, but the Times should be above it.",
"Best source of objective reporting in the U. S. on current events. Excellent source of information, entertainment, and discussion in all areas of human endeavor. Easy format to navigate and search.",
"Generally positive, but the app keeps telling me that I'm offline and will not update with the latest news stories. I'm definitely offline!",
"I really enjoyed this, especially since good public transportation makes a city more livable. Sadly, my Boston needs to ramp up its systems.",
Should have read the reviews. Not impressed and uninstalling. Glitchy and hard to navigate and poorly presented. Will go back to the 4 games I play once daily for free via the website.,
print and digital article titles/headlines do not always agree so it's sometimes difficult to find articles of interest.,
"Connectivity issues continue to worsen for this app. It frequently can't connect, thinks it's offline, etc.",
"great! plus, they rework the UI from time to time. things like this do need constant tuning. and they are attentive to that",
"Good app, simple enough to navigate. Needs a night mode, and better text copy handling.",
"For lovers of language, this is a jewel! As one who is only VERY superficially acquainted with Manga, the explanations were quite clear. Not gonna make me a reader of the genre but I have 5 grandsons!",
"So appreciate & admire the majestic use of native plants! I'm also encouraged as a plant enjoying person, to be more creative with how to place & manage growth. I'm making notes from this article. Thank you!",
"The NY Times is amazing! It has such great coverage on so many topics. Just to read it all, I would have to give up doing anything else!!!",
"Concise, focused and different ways to meditate. Simple and brief to longer and more intricate. excellent",
"I love the newsletters. I love the games. I love everything about the NYT, except their coverage of transgender issues historically, but they are getting better.",
Honestly expressing immense happiness about NYT for an excellent positive looking article on India reflecting the contribution of PM Modi. To my knowledge this is the first of its kind and a pleasant surprise since NYT does not seem to publish positive looking articles. Keep it up.,
came here for spelling bee but I really like the app. I used to get the physical paper and loved it but i couldn't read it fast enough.,
"Not always the most intuitive interface, but very stable and responsive.",
"Coverage seems to stick to the truth and allow the formation of informed opinion. This seems to have become unusual in modern times. 🤔 😳 Thanks, NYT",
"The news and articles in NYT are well written and show a dedication to professional writing. articles are current, relevant, and informative, without the many shallow topics that you find in other online news sources",
Wow. The nerve of charging android users full price for the same subscription but only releasing the audio app for IOS. Strongly considering cancelling my NYT subscription until this is rectified.,
Love it! Judging by the lack of lawsuits I'd say the reporting is excellent. And if you're looking for podcasts they're on Spotify.,
dark mode available only on the app to force more intrusive tracking behavior. No reason it couldn't be made available on their website.,
One of the only news sources I fully trust. I only gave 4 stars for the fact that I would love to have a few more free articles to share with my friends,
"NYT always interrupts your reading to have you login, open the article in the app, pick your nose, anything to interrupt you reading an article.",
"The app is OK, but it constantly kicks me out of the games. I have a games subscription. I will be playing Spelling Bee and it will randomly tell me I have to log in to continue. Then it won't let me play for a while until it decides to recognize me subscription again.",
It's wonderful to have the award-winning NYT journalism at my fingertips 24/7. I luv it!,
Terrible experience. Unable to organize content or follow topics or authors. Unusable. The website is somewhat better,
Newest version removes the option to update text size. They tell you to do it in your phone settings which of course does not adjust app text. Text in the articles far too small! Update - I contacted them again in April 2023 about this issue and got the same lame response about adjusting system settings. Ridiculous.,
"Not functional! I can change the setting and share an article, but I can't scroll to read them! I purchased a subscription because I was tired of being told I met my daily limit on articles of interest. However now that I have it, I can't read any article past the headline. Frustrating. NYT do better!",
"I ordered a NY Times digital subscription through Google Pay, associated with my Google email address. However, the NY Times didn't recognize me as a paid subscriber. Several MONTHS of going back and forth between the NY Times and Google resulted in no resolution, each pointing the finger at the other. I was denied a refund by both parties. Both are losing a customer.",
"this is the full content of the New York times at your fingertips, wherever and whenever you want it. The Times's reporting is top notch and puts issues into context, and the app also gives you access to special sections like style and travel and the games.",
"Everything fine but for the people working on the Numbers game Beta: the app freezes legitimately every time I open it. Sometimes I'll get to tap a few icons first but I have only been able to submit my result twice so far 😅 it's a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8, if that's in any way helpful. I really love the apps extensive functions and the other games 😁",
"The app keeps complaining that it's offline. It got stuck on offline two days ago. I couldn't fix it so cleared cache. That made the unusable, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now, it doesn't have Games section at the bottom. I have to scroll through the today's paper to the bottom to play games. It still complains of being offline at random times. Downgrading my rating.",
"I have a brand new phone with the latest processor, and this app consistently still has a problem showing photos and ESPECIALLY videos. The ""videos"" will just be straight up black no matter what I do yet I will still hear the sound. Awful. Guessing they ignore Android development and just focus on iPhones 🙄",
"I start every day with NYTimes headlines and feel informed about world & US news. Human interest stories, helpful tips in several subject areas round out my knowledge of many things. I appreciate the dedication of the journalists who investigate what's what and who's who. There's so much that I gain - it's hard to describe! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Thank You!",
The app is buggy on Android since the iPhone users take priority. Listening to audio via the app causes the app to crash. They also advertise an audio app...for the iOS. I wonder if anyone who works at the NY Times doesn't use an iPhone...,
"Bug: An update from some time ago has broken share tool. No matter which push notification I try to share, it keeps defaulting to the link details of the first story, *even* if I cancel it from the list. Edit: After many months this bug is still around. Please help fix - thanks!",
"You can only change the font size by changing the overall font size for the whole phone from the accessibility settings. Very pope design. Plenty of other font instances are fine and don't need to be bigger. The one that's too small is the NYT article font, but that can't be changed like other news apps. Boo.",
Getting the same problem with NYT games as this. I am registered with my Google account and i click log in with Google and it doesn't log me in and keeps telling me I have to log in.,
Keeps logging me out and doesn't support my password manager so I have to look up and manually enter my credentials every time I open the app.,
Horrible. The app doesn't recognise my subscription through the Google play store even on the linked Google account. It even asks me to create new subscriptions every time. After 3 paid subscriptions I stopped. Feedback resulted in no answer. I paid 100$ for absolutely nothing.,
"Great for news snippets, just -1 star, as not much updates on the comics/ graphic novels/ graphic literature in the culture section.",
one of the greatest sources of current event information on the planet. And - Very well written. If you enjoy reading your info this is still for you!,
Best source of news there is. And the readers' commens are way more thoughtful than any other site.,
I have had the privilege of visiting the site during construction. It is spectacular. This article only begins to describe this marvelous building dedicated to the arts.,
"Great news source, pretty terrible app. I get it, it's not like Bloomberg, doesn't cost 40 bucks a month, so I won't be passing judgement, but it is the case.",
"Fantastic article, explaining the involvement, for better or worse, of all the major players in the attempt to overthrow our government.",
"Whether you're old school like me & get it in print or it's digital, The New York Times has all the news 📰 you need & more.",
The app is steady but its hard to find the right articles that are matching with my interests.,
Clearly the best and most comprehensive coverage of any newsgathering organization in the country. It is go-to source for news of the day.,
"Consistently leans to the left, objectivity of writing depends on author. Still good reporting with broad topics.",
I am thrilled to be in a place in my life where I can both afford the luxury of a subscription to the Times and the time to appreciate some of their amazing articles,
"While bias occasionally seeps through, the overall objectivity, breadth and depth is clear.",
This would be a 5 but the internal search really doesn't work at all. You basically have to leave and use Google to find any article.,
"Really concerning article on navy's blatant inability to retool fast enough and well enough to overcome modern and near-future, very scary, warfare capabilities of likely opponents.",
"Old guy in Denver, for most of my now seventy years. Was lucky to travel some. Worked at printing, for a business at 75 Park Place. Stayed in Hoboken and came across and exited at the Trade Center, recall the escalators going up and up forever.... Good Work, Carry On!!",
"Bought & billed for all access subscription $3.99 a month, received game subscription in app, NYT said contact Google, Google said contact app developer, cancelled subscription, forgot about $4.",
"Usually clear, concise and truthful - as far as the truth is known. This is THE 'paper of record"" in the United States.",
"Not as good as you want it to be for how much it costs. The app is clunky, their games are inconsistent and they've ruined wordl. If it was free I'd still be annoyed, but I'd play. But for $20 per year I get too angry to enjoy myself. It's 2023, try using a robot to proof your work.",
"Meritocracy purports to level the field, but as this article points out, it does not. At least not as it is practiced in this country. Ditto protection under the law, justice, constitutional democracy, etc.",
"I subscribe for the contents which I think is great, however the App has much to be desired. I can't find any shortcut or navigation and have to go through the screen to find what I am interested. The link to the Athletic is all the way near the bottom. Once into the site, it is total lack of functionality. Wish NTY would spend some budgets on programming.",
"Wake up People! Our future depends on having humans who explore, examine, evaluate and end up learning to contribute to our Greater Good!",
"The era of both sidesism in legacy media is in full force at the NYT. Democrats ""plot"" to convince the middle class that they are working for them despite passing the most consequential legislation in my life time. The GOP has actual plots to make life more difficult for everyone except the rich and actively plot to undermine our democracy. In an effort to be unbiased the NYT has become more biased by not accurately stating the difference between the parties.",
"I love reading from the vast collection of intelligent, well researched articles from journalists of every stripe anytime I've got a free moment. I couldn't recommend more highly than the NY Times",
"working well, lets me know about interesting news and articles I'd otherwise miss. Enjoying it.",
A balanced and extensive reporting along with excellent articles on almost any subject.,
I am interested in a us-centric worldview and the New York Times provides an excellent survey for the money.,
The venerable NT Times will keep you up to date on a variety of breaking news and keep you informed!,
"After last update the app randomly doesn't recognise my log in in Games, despite being log in status being correct in Settings",
"I am a fan of John le Carée's works, and consider him to be, so far, the best writer in the genre of international espionage and political intrigue.",
"This article and the likes need to be told over and over again as to be allowed for all to know the truths, the good and bad, those unfolding, our history, past and present.",
NYT is a fact based news source which also has some interesting editorial and helpful to life articles.,
Something not mentioned in this article is overpopulation and the lack of remediation by agriculture needed to use water much more efficiently!,
Love the NY Times. Outstanding writers and astute editors.,
"Great journalism, app works great, I subscribed yet nyt continues to bother me to upgrade my subscription which is very annoying. I considered just giving three stars because of this, but it's otherwise great and I know they do need money.",
"I don't like the app layout and you get lots of ads, even with a premium subscription. Also the news is very negative, statically NYT is more negatively biased than any other paper, so I prefer The Guardian.",
Yes! We finally have dark mode! ...but now the app keeps losing/ forgetting my login/ subscription.,
the app is a little clunky but useable. I like the NY Times as a news source,
$20 for a subscription to news is unbelievable. There are other news outlets with articles just as good or better then the New York Times. This company is being run into the ground with this money grabbing scheme. Unsubscribing today and I urge all others to do the same.,
"Recently, this app asks me to log in all the time. So tired of re-entering my username/password. Please fix it.",
"Informative. Time to listen to the experts and begin funding these smaller, faster drones.",
Great app from one of the most comprehensive and prestigious news organizations in the world.,
"Cannot put articles in landscape mode, incredibly annoying.",
"Great articles, I love my algorithm for my feed, and great puzzles!",
A staple of news for those that want to be informed and in-depth editorials.,
Great reporting but wish they had the same audible option as Washington Post.,
Very immersive and professionally presented interactive stories.,
easy to use with great content for a affordable price 👌,
Broken since 08/25/2023. App hangs up when opening and nothing loads. Galaxy S20+.,
"Horrible Android Experience. Print an article to .pdf, and you get pop-up text and graphics that makes the document unreadable. Only happens on mobile.",
"Without an independent press and an informed citizenry, we will not endure as a nation. The NY Times is the gold standard and my go-to source for news and information.",
"One of the consistently best sources of news, with the usual imperfections, in the country. Really needs the option that the Washington Post offers for many of its articles: audio.",
Leaves out many important stories. Very difficult to stop membership. Cost triples after intro deal.,
"Great app, so easy to use, makes it very easy to keep up with the news. Games section is fun too.",
"Great Topical News, Good Links to Research and Word Games",
"Access to a newspaper of record is essential for an informed citizen. As a matter of fact, the more the better, right? NYT has been and continues to be one of the best.",
"First of all, I'd like to make clear that I think the New York Times' coverage is phenomenal, and that it's an essential part of my news diet. That said, this app does little to enhance my reading experience. Deep links do not seem to work; when I click on a New York Times link from Facebook, it goes to a blank page within the New York Times app, and not the article I was looking for. Additionally, when I go into settings and set my preferences for NYTimes links to ""ask every time"" instead of ""open in this app,"" NYTimes links seem to still automatically trigger the app (although it seems like this might be an Android issue and not one specific to the app?). I'm a digital subscriber to the NYTimes and I'm running Android 10, if this helps.",
I have read and trusted the Times since I was 16. Always solid journalism.,
"I love the NYT and their coverage but the app isnt great. The layout is confusing and difficult to navigate. Also the most frustrating aspect of the app is that when it sends you a push notification for a story and you click on it, it takes you to the latest news update rather than the story in the push notification. Cancelled my subscription as a result. Shame",
"journalism aside, this app is clunky and works well only occasionally. I'm often clicking a story notification only to find a blank page, and sometimes my articles aren't saved when i bookmark them. it crashes constantly. It looks nice but needs some quality control! otherwise, the fonts are beautiful and easy to read, and there aren't a lot of ads.",
"The app has a good layout but the function is lacking. The ""for you"" section is often not updated, so you instead must search for each column, either through it's publishing section or using the unreliable search. The multimedia articles are glitchy and malfunction, making for an irritating reading experience. And if you leave off an article and reopen the app later to finish it, you'll find yourself kicked out of the article due to a reload. There's also not a clear way to save articles.",
"The app is difficult to navigate. Keep the games separate. Bring back the old sections tab, stop trying to innovate by adding more pictures. You're a news site, not reddit.",
"The New York Times is one of the most thorough, analytical, ethical, and accurate sources of news. I read it every day.",
The depth and scope of the New York Times are without parallel (The Atlantic and ProPublica are close),
Why is Audio not available on the NYT Android app?,
"I've been subscribed for several years. I really miss night mode, even with its limitations. Some time ago, not sure if it happened in June, the dark gray slide bar within articles was removed... It's incredible how such bad ideas are introduced into the app... It looks like the guys who develop it don't really use it... Maybe they read Breitbart.",
"As mentioned by many others, it's a known issue that the app lacks functionality with FB. Whenever I try to open a story, it takes me to a blank page and then the home page. I miss most the stories I'm interested in reading. I've called in twice to report this, been promised a call back from IT to resolve it, but I've heard from no one. After months of this, I plan to cancel my years-long subscription if this isnt resolved soon.",
What a long strange trip it's been. And what's great is that through the music it will always be alive and well!!!,
Complete and unbiased coverage of events from around the world. And I'm not American but this is still one of the best sources available.,
"Useless subscription. I have been paying for years, unable ever to open subscription. Had Games which I also pay for on my phone which was stolen. Can't even do that now. A giant ripoff.",
People who pay for NYT don't want to see food articles with recipes they don't have access to because they didn't pay even more!,
"I like the variety of games, the NYT Cooking, and all the current daily news.",
"Subscription went through on June 9, yet the app will not recognize my phone and continues to tell me to subscribe.",
"I love the New York Times. I used to be a subscriber, back when ""The Daily"" first launched and the price was below $10/month. IDK if the cost of living is causing the editors at NYT to disassociate from the rest of America, but $17/month is crazy. The value proposition is there, sure. The NYT is the best journalism in America. Yet, as a DINK, mechanical engineer making decent money, I find it absurd to be ""priced out"" of a news service. NYT please lower your subscription cost.",
Terrible app. Constantly logged out or it fails to recognise me. So frustrating - I pay for this!,
"This is a comment about the new version of the App and not the NY Times. 1. Notifications don't allow you to read the snippets because they magically change when you slightly expand them to whatever snippet is the preferred one. 2. It's a huge battery hog - which is a drag for those of us who like to read lots of different articles. As an example, a 15min session takes over 10% of my battery...",
Stop asking if I want your app! I read on a browser and I'm quite happy thank you. I am this close to canceling my sub if you don't stop pushing your app every time I open an article. Stop. I don't want this.,
"NYTimes, it's all you need wrapped up in one app on the palm of your hand.",
"Outstanding investigative journalism that our country, our future as an un-Trumped civilization, depends on",
"the app doesn't correctly understand whether I'm online or not, and frequently needs to be restarted.",
thoughtful and well-researched objective reporting.,
very well designed . easy to use. intelligent content. very pleased.,
"App is difficult to navigate, seems to be designed to be rigid and unresponsive. The reporting and stories are top notch though, which offsets the difficulties.",
"Excellent and Important information about Reading ? Without reading , there is no imagination, no empathy , no learning, no experience ,no exploration , no understanding ,no creativity, no communicating, As it is now , intelligence will decline , as the people of the world become their cell phones!",
"I have the app on my phone already, but whenever I click 'read this in the app' from a new story, it takes me to the play store to install the app again! Very annoying.",
Absolutely the top source for news and everything else imaginable. Scrupulous in research and in correcting themselves. Excellent!,
Every morning I read the NYTimes. I'm a paid subscriber. This app is consistently bug-free. Easy to read. I love that I can share 10 gift articles a month.,
"it's my daily go to. some of the best written articles. Let's not forget about the best games, Wordle, spelling bee, and crossword puzzles.",
"I wish they would fix the app. When you click on the notification, it takes you to any other story but the one you're trying to read.",
"I really on serious, fact-based journalism to understand our economy, political issues, and world events. Thank God for the NYT, their strong team and standards.",
"I am confident I am getting the facts from the Times. I studied journalism in college, and I know all good journalists ensure their articles are as accurate as possible.",
Outstanding accessibility to virtually all areas of The New York Times . Superb layout and organization.,
"Very Informative, incisive analysis, great visualization of data in combination with the related news. Daring reporting!",
"Over the last year I really enjoyed the app! The news coverage is amazing, well organised, etc. Unfortunately (for me as an international), though, the app is tailored to Americans as the main page mostly covers news about the USA. It, therefore, would be amazing if there would be an international alternative to it with the section 'world' as its starting page. Because under these circumstances, I think I will switch to another newspaper",
"The app sucks. I have subscribed to the basic service using the phone credit but still cannot access it. After opening some articles, I was notified that I had reached the amount of articles I could read and later reminded to subscribe again to enjoy the basic service. What?! To make the case worse, I cannot get refunded as well. I love the NYT, but its app is simply unreliable. I'm terribly discouraged from attempting another purchase. The same thing might happen again.",
All pictures do not load simultaneously on homepage. You read the text and have to wait for the images to load. This despite the fact that I am on a fast Internet connection. Another issue for me is the lack of a 'Night mode' like in the Washington Post app. That app is miles ahead of this one. You need to improve guys or I'll just stick with the Post. Thnx. Update after few weeks: The problem of content display on opening the app has deteriorated. Pictures and even text takes ages to load now!,
"Not sure if it's due to a recent update, but the app is utterly broken. Keeps asking to log in. Once logged in, it shows a screen saying ""You are now logged in as , then takes you to a new screen saying that due to recent password change, you'll need to log back in. There has been no password change. I'm able to log in on the website with the same credentials and remain logged in without issue. App has been uninstalled and then reinstalled, as well as cache and data cleared.",
"An enligtening article. As a senior citizen, I took the challenge to learn about at least one psychedelic rather than criticize.",
An extraordinary institution that I wish came closer to the center.,
"Very insightful take on the real tragedy when one leverages another's NIL in a seemingly subtle fashion. Forensic accounts will be kept busy attempting to cross reference contracts, terms, definitions, and historicals. But beyond the pure economics, what about an Oscar, paid speeches as an adoption expert, a foundation, prestige, and notoriety. Ill-gotten gains? At minimum mercenary leverage. And if Mike was pushed toward a lessor school and the movie affected his draft status? Tragic.",
"Great content, but browsing experience is sub-par. The main category browser is just a very long list with no subject/article highlights. At the same time, suggestions at the end of an article are extremely predictive and systemized, so arriving at new content is a bit of a task. Content and content layout is top quality, though, so worth the money.",
The app has been logging me out every few hours for the last week. Seems like some recent buggy update,
"So much appreciation for the hard work everyone at the Times puts in to getting it right. So important now, amazingly.",
App now has annoying auto play video ads. Why am I paying for this?,
starts easy and then gets more complicated. interesting facts.,
one of the best sources of information of the digital age.I really like it,
"NY Times application is very mobile friendly. It makes very easy to navigate between news and sections, and they have mastered the notifications. This application is my favorite application in my phone. About the news, I have not read a bias one until now. They always include different sources, and aspects of a topic, which makes every news to be on point and very informative.",
"I had a terrible experience with an in-app renewal of the subscription and I feel frankly defrauded by both Google and the New York Times. I was charged twice for overlapping subscriptions, the most expensive of which I cannot even accede to, and the least expensive of which after much trouble and effort I manage now to access at least (but only) on the android app. Google('s AI, for lack of a better option) and NYT both refuse to acknowledge my issue, much less resolve it.",
Good content. You get used to the presentation and navigation then they change it. This latest version won't hold your place after going to a sidebar. It refreshes the entire contents and takes you to the top again. I refuse to pay an extra subscription fee for puzzles. That is probably why the mini takes so long to load. It will become a fee paid item too.,
Developers have yet to enable dark mode for games.,
"Great reporting and writing. I also love the Daily podcast. BUT the NYT app drives me crazy. If you leave an article and try to come back to it after more than a few minutes, there is a good chance the app will have closed in the background and you lose your place. If you are trying to get through some of the longer form material, this is a nightmare. Please update the app to keep track of your progress so you can return to where you left off.",
"This latest update is horrible. What one could do with a swipe before is now done with menus and button pushing. Comments are no longer displayed as an icon and instead require extra taping to reach via a menu. The night or dark mode clearly hasn't been tested for esthetics. Come on, guys. I'll add that recent, previous updates aren't great, either. The front page reloads each time you return from an article, articles refresh if you leave the app (ex. to use the share function).",
"Been using the app for years, but I'll migrate to the mobile site for the time being. As it stands now, the app is bloated and performs poorly even on good hardware. Articles fail to load or reload at the top of the page for no reason, and ads are more numerous and disruptive of the reading experience than ever before.",
"Sadly I cannot give this app 5 stars. On android (version 9, s10), I get notifications from the app, but upon opening the application, no content launches. Instead, I'm greeted with a message stating ""Device is offline. [then some suggestions to reconnect]"". This message persists on different wifi networks and when I'm using data. Clean installation and device resets do not alleviate the issue. All other NYT apps work fine.",
A most excellent and cogent summary of what is about to unfold,
clear and relatively concise news stories. I love it.,
Timely reports on major issues. App is easy to navigate.,
Saved articles are hard to find. The search engine is not accurate at all.,
Great app that delivers the news without getting in the way of the news.,
Less baised (though not ideologically unbaised) and more in depth and thorough other outlets.,
App has gotten better but I still think the UI is a bit clunky.,
Need a way to search current issue and back issues to find the story I want to read.,
The NYT provides a wide variety of quality information and content about many subjects.,
Great newspaper in print excellent digital rendering of that standard in an app.,
one of the best resources for news that I know. Good in depth reporting too,
"Barbara Kingsolver's journey, and how it shaped her writing and perspective on the world at large. can't wait! to read Copperhead. Thanks Ezra!",
Informative and concise. No B.S. That's what I always look for in my missives.,
I just canceled my subscription after being ask to subscribe when I'm already paying sub. Ridiculous.,
I read the NYTimes daily with special appreciation for the access on my phone using the app👍,
"NYT provides dependable, accurate and timely reporting on the issues of the day.",
"well done, fellow guardians, keep fighting the what? Good 1! have a good day! relish in your very own intentions.. GOD SPEED!",
Most recent update forces me to log in everytime I open an article.,
"Great and reliable news, all the time!",
Great news on all subjects. It's worth the price we pay for the news we get.,
Indiana Jones was fabulous I n way only George Lucas and Steven Spielberg could deliver I Loved it!,
variety of well researched and balanced news,
"The gold standard of both print news _*and*_ website mass media...certainly of The U.S., if not the world.",
The app is good even though it requires a lot more scrolling than other news apps. I like the interface except for the fact that more than half of the news headlines have a white background even in night mode and that makes reading at night a pain. The articles and content aggregation is upto the mark as its NYT. I just wish that it was a little less rough around the edges and the experimental features like night mode are improved quickly.,
Well written and easy to understand articles,
Nice stretch. I'm going to adapt for bad knees by sitting. Thanks.,
"Love the content but they are putting more and more of it into the ""live stories,"" which I find to have a pretty lousy experience. Everytime I open one, it scrolls up and down like crazy as the page loads. I will start reading and be interupted three times as the sentence I'm reading is shifted off screen. I wish they would just use native experience as they had for so many years. Putting content in web views is a huge step backwards 😕😭",
"I thought this app world be better; world class and leading-edge. Unfortunately, not. The NYTimes app on a smartphone is limited and aggravating. Even on a tablet, I find it more arduous than it needs to me. The journalists, content, writing, and perspective I appreciate. The app could use some work to make it more attractive, increase intuitiveness, and ease navigation to what I want to, or think, I should read. Regardless, I am a digital subscriber to the NYTimes and appreciate their work.",
"Best journalism on the planet, bar none.",
Fantastic source of news and GREAT articles!!,
I love this newspaper and look forward to reading it every day!,
"Content is excellent. On the whole the app is OK but please, please learn from WaPo. They have excellent content AND an excellent app. It's easier to use and more convenient for me as a user so I generally choose that one as my primary source of that reason. I do appreciate that NYT finally introduced dark mode which is easier to my eyes. Great improvement.",
"great way to read, cache, save, share etc.",
"I moved from Google News to this app because of glitches in my NYT subscription. Turns out this app prompts me more frequently for my login. Further to this, after logging in, it notifies me that I once again have 3 free articles left - as if my logging in 2 seconds ago wasn't meaningful. I've done multiple app reinstalls, cache clearing, etc. This is most definitely a NYT technology issue - verified by two platforms. I can't keep paying for a service I don't get.",
A refreshing and enlightening change from the UK press!,
"Disappointing NYT has a fancy Audio app for Apple subscribers, but we lowly Android users have to make do with this substandard alternative. I'm paying just as much, but they are treated to special perks. ""All Access"" is a misnomer.",
About as objective as the most biased local newspaper in your country. With ability to use fancy words somehow got world famous. Best of luck to you if you think they are about good journalism.,
"Read is constantly interrupted with messages to get the app, even though I am aleady in the app. Must exit article & reentry to continue reading. Please fix this issue!",
Hope you guys have a widget so can easily see the news from home screen without click the app first. It is hard for the first time found the search feature,
Allows unimpeded choice of the most important articles in The New York Times. There are so many quality articles it is impossible normally to know where to go.,
This is a pay app and it keeps saying that your trial has ended when you have signed in or whatever it is on the website also this should not be a pay app because people like this one and everything and need it for stuff💜! And I'm 😔!😁,
"As of Friday April 14th at 1:30 p.m., the app won't update because it's telling me that my device is offline. This is absolutely not the case. All other apps on my phone are working fine.",
It's too rigid and lacks basic features like Back navigation and the search icon is hard to find.,
"Excellent journalism, rag sheet app. Also doesn't work on tablets (only portrait mode) after all this time.",
Altogether solidly good. Some functions and some content are not intuitively accessible.,
"Simply great writing and reporting on a variety of topics spanning politics, culture, health and wellness, and entertainment.NPR, my favorite way to consume news media.",
"Ugh... consistently, I'll get a notification about some story, click on the story, and the story In interested in is nowhere among what opened.",
"STOP WITH THE POPUPS PROMPTING ME TO USE YOUR APP. I installed this just to say I will never use your garbage app no matter how many times you prompt me, and I will cancel my subscription if this doesn't stop",
As a retiree the NYT keeps my brain cells healthy and sparks interesting conversations. I am grateful for all of the talent and dedication it takes to bring the world to me. Thank you,
"Greedy, want subscription fee which I paid like all my site's a pay, but NY Times wants subscribers to also few full page ads too. No thanks. Bought into $1 week sale, which after a year goes to $6, but you don't get ad free on their android app. Greedy. Fortunately viewing subscription with the right ad blockers work great. I went ahead canceled after two days, and use month longer. Then back to ad blocking browsers. Yet NY Times to cheap to pay for verification checkmark on Twitter",
"The app worked perfectly until the update 2 days ago. Now the pictures won't load, either in the news feed or when you read individual articles. If you click on a pic, it will show, but when you go back to the article, it still won't show. The interactive articles don't work either. Using a Samsung Galaxy 7",
"No night mode, terrible reading articles. Cluttered ""home page"". I prefer just content with headlines, simple summaries where I can expand to bigger articles. This is just clutter, trying to look like a classic newspaper but that doesn't work on a phone. And if I wanted a newspaper, I would have bought one.",
Fine reporting on what I choose to read. Sports report excellent also.,
"After seeing several articles that I can only describe as fake news/ propaganda, I decided I want to cancel my subscription. There are only two ways to do so, either make an international call or use the in app chat. The chat system simply doesn't work. The messages sent by the other person can't be seen because they're hidden behind the keyboard. After minimising the keyboard there is then no way to get it back again. Tldr they have made cancelling your subscription as difficult as possible",
"Quality journalism at its finest. As an Australian who maintains a keen interest in American current affairs, the New York Times is an absolute essential.",
Ads on paid account are a no for me. I'll go back to read it on Brave browser on mobile which embeds ad blockers.,
Came here for the podcasts but they are nowhere to be found. Please add a tab for audio/video.,
"Disappointed. Very hassle to cancel the subscription. There are 3 ways to unsubscribe yet none of the methods are done digitally. They should have posted it in the first place before subscribing to the NYT app about the laborious effort in order for you to cancel subscription. Nonetheless I appreciated the content, it's very informative, relevant and reliable. There are only times that the app crashes. But, overall, I don't think I would recommend this app to others. Very disappointing.",
I learn a lot of new information browsing the NYT app. It's nice to be able to semi keep up with current events.,
Easy to use. World-class content.,
"Difficult to cancel the subscription! Decided to try the subscription-based membership in belief that it would be as easy to cancel as literally every other subscription I have ever tried. Ended up not using the app enough for it to be worth paying for and decided to cancel my subscription. Turns out that I have to call or start a chat during (US) office hours, being in a very different time zone I have not yet managed to cancel my subscription. Very disappointed.",
I am an avid reader and find great coverage across viewpoints. Thank you for quality writing and keeping me informed.,
we are print subscribers and entitled to online access. For some reason we keep being denied online access.,
I'm taking away a star bc I can't paste a URL into the search for articles (which is also buried) and my browser keeps losing the login.,
"Definitely needs a ""listen to article"" feature and a scrolling bar to indicate how far an article extends.",
"This rating is purely for the app, and not reflective of the quality of journalism that the New York Times offers, which is top notch. No questions. The app has several annoying flaws, such as the irregular sending of notifications (sometimes, I will not get them for several days at a time) as well as the very high battery usage, even when the app is not in use (Android will routinely send me prompts informing me, that this app is draining my battery)",
"Normally I would rate this app more stars but there seems to be a severe problem with the notifications! If I receive them at all they all appear at once and when I want to read the different headlines they all become the same. Urgent headlines or morning updates don't show up at all or at once. Don't know if that's a problem specific with Android, but I would really appreciate it if that would be fixed!",
"The only thing I don't like about the app is that when I click on an article from my notifications, if the NYT app is already open it just takes me back to the article I was already reading instead of the new article. Then the notification disappears so I have to remember what it said so I can search for the article. However, I have an older Android phone so I'm not going to place all the blame on the app. Other than this one complaint I find the app very easy to use.",
some of the best parts of the day are reading The Times,
"I was pleased with how reading articles via the app was a better reading experience than the website on Android. However, as a paying digital subscriber, the inclusion of advertising in their in-app videos concerned me. An inquiry via email to customer service acknowledged that advertising to paid digital subscribers is standard practice. I wanted to cancel my subscription as a result, but discovered their website does not allow for easy cancellation and asks you to call them to cancel. I live in Australia so this is not only a tedious request, it is actually a challenge and not a free call. My email request to customer service to cancel has been ignored. This is reminiscent of trying to cancel service with Verizon or Comcast. What a shame, as I did enjoy the app experience and love the journalism.",
"The access is great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because every time I open the app it tries to get me to play games, and that's not what I want the app for.",
very informative and worth updates and coverage of USA and world,
"Excellent newspaper and reporting. Recent digital subscription price hikes, however, are excessively high.",
NYT won't recognize when you subscribe via Google play.,
"App is good, but NYT a little too biased toward giving right-wing sensationalism a megaphone, with poorer coverage of current US administration successes and R congress failures.",
"Update: with version 10.9.0 ability to adjust text size has been restored to the UI. However, maximum text size is smaller than previously obtainable before removing and then restoring this feature. ------------------------- Inability to adjust text size has not been restored with latest update. Reaching out to android@nytimes (address provided here for feedback and questions) does not receive a response...nor does it here. Sounds of silence on this issue.",
Ads? No thanks. I'm paying for a subscription. With paid subscription there should be No ads. Good bye NYT App.,
The only publication I trust in a great app.,
Fantastic article about a wonderful President and man.,
"The most basic possible app. The content is good but the app is just a container for the website. You get a 3 categories menu in the bottom... And that's it. The Sections category is a scrolling mess without rhyme or reason where the newspaper's sections are mixed with your saved articles, recent reads, deals etc.. I would at least expect from a reading app to save my reading position in the article and allow me fast access to articles I've been reading.",
Horrible. I have a nyt subscription for years now every time I try to read an article it cuts me off and goes to subscription.,
Absolute garbage. Links in articles take you out to a browser and there is no search feature.,
"Great content, horrific app. You can subscribe through the app, but don't expect to actually get any benefits. It won't sync subscription my NYTimes account, so it's only useful on the single device for a while. Google says it's paid, NYTimes says they don't see any charge. Fun way to spend money, if you enjoy gambling.",
"It continuously froze up my older Android phone when I tried to actually read stories instead of browsing headlines. When I only browsed headlines, it drained my battery in an hour, faster than any other app I used. On a new Pixel 3a, it stops loading the article when I am half way through reading it, despite being logged in. I am 10 months into a very expensive full year subscription, and have NEVER been able to take advantage of it.",
"Love the access to wonderful, thought provoking articles as well as cutting edge news.",
"Really like the app except for one thing. If you tap on a picture on an article it is difficult to escape back to the article. Your phone's Back button is disabled, you have to use an arrow in the top left of the screen, and you often have to tap that space five or a dozen times to return as it disappears and reappears as if taunting you.",
Sometimes logs me out and loses my game progress,
"I have never installed the app. I'm just FED UP with the website continuously asking me to install the app for better reading experience, every time i open an article. It's truly annoying and most of the times the article is blocked until unless i close and reopen chrome. Moreover even sometimes when you click on ""no thanks, I'll read here"", it still goes to Google store. A ""genius"", the person who thought this annoying feature would actually push people to download the app.",
Hard to Navigate and email Content to Editors.,
why cant this app display in dark theme properly? this is a consistent problem,
"Frustrating app. The notifications don't work. A quick tip: If I press on a notification, it's because I want to read that specific article. Not because I want to be taken to your home screen to try and find it myself. I get that it's probably to keep you in the app longer, but it's inconsiderate enough of my time that I'm just uninstalling.",
"The low rating is for the app itself, not the quality of the reporting. The crossword mini is almost alwaya broken. Meaning, the keyboard does not appear fully on the screen. Also, I would like an ability to hide parts from my feed. I don't care to see recipes, for example.",
"When I go to article in push notification it doesn't take me to the actual article, so I have to hunt it down every time. I've submitted feedback multiple times and it still hasn't gotten fixed over quite some time. It's not always easy to find the given article out of everything showing up in the search, making this an annoyance when I simply want to go straight to the article.",
"This app does not work well, even on a Google Pixel. Pages take a very long time to load, and more recently, don't load at all. This is on a standard LTE connection. The only reason I pay for the NYT is so that I can easily read the news on my phone. But what's the point in paying for a subscription when the app barely works?",
"5/18/2021 update: even worse than it was in 2019. This app has gotten progressively worse at its sole value prop: load news articles. The app consistently gets confused in between interruptions of service and/or at random: it then will not load offline content that has already been downloaded to my device. It's unclear if this is due to ad content preventing the app from 'finishing' a page load or if it's just a bug, but it's progressively gotten worse over the past few years. Fix your app.",
"Notifications are wonky lately. I keep getting the same ones over and over even after clearing them. One day, no matter which notification I clicked on to expand, it opened the same (different) story, over and over. Please fix this so I don't have to turn off notifications!",
"Simple, well-designed layout, but fails in the user experience. Scrolling through the ""Today"" feed of articles is a major chore because the app doesn't load the ads before the ad space enters your screen. Then, when the ad is loaded, any content around the ad is jostled about to fit around the now-known dimensions of the ad. Similarly, the ""Today"" feed goes entirely blank for a quick second every time I return to it, making me lose my place − even if I had only been away for 2min.",
An embedded dictionary will be a good feature.,
"Too frustrating to use longer than 10 minutes. The app continually reloaded stories while I was reading, and I am a paid subscriber. I could get nowhere on these articles because I always had to try to find my place again, and sometimes while scrolling down the article reloaded back to the top again. Too frustrating to use longer than 10 minutes.",
I love the content but the app is a bit buggy. Whenever you click an article in the notification window it shows the most recent one in your feed rather than scrolling to the article you've clicked on. Not an issue if you read the article right away but definitely an issue if you wait a few hours to read the article.,
Great content on an easy to read platform. A pretty well designed app. The search could be more accessible and I feel like the curation of the headlines could be better adjusted based on the reader's history. It can be a bit homogenous. Other than that I have no complaints.,
great read. historical and current. each of us can encourage a child or adult to read.,
"Fantastic essay on Shakespeare! He put all of my own thoughts, and feelings, into words.",
"When clicking on notifications, between 30-50% of the time, the article I want to see fails to load and I get the front page of the app. Then, when I go to hunt for the article I wanted to read, I cannot find it in my tabs. Other than that though, great app. Please make Night Mode a standard feature and make it AMOLED black, not grey.",
"The app is flawed and dysfunctional. The advantages, you have when you log in by computer, are gone while using it on the phone, which makes the entire stuff useless. Please, take it into consideration, and make necessary adjustments regarding the problems the application has got. Thanks in advance!",
"Very bad app. When I try to read a NYT article posted on FB, the app is not working, it shows only a blank screen. I have to go to the app and search the title of the article and so on. Very disappointed never thought a giant like NYTimes could offer such a low quality app. Do not install!",
This app used to work flawlessly but in the last 6 months it's become increasingly broken. Articles crash and reload seemingly randomly. I believe it's because the ads now have so many graphics and animations that it crashes the app. As a paying nyt subscriber and a 3 year old phone I should be able to read simple news articles.,
"I have a Galaxy 7 Edge and have been experiencing the same problems that many of the other commentators have noted. I also have found that the ap is very slow to refresh. Just 5 minutes ago, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I still cannot download the comments in the top stories column. Another issue--the ads interrupt the reading of an article by suddenly downloading and inserting themselves right between the lines! Unacceptable for something that I am paying for.",
"the app is doing pretty good job in helping me reading the articles I would in the print version. I cannot give it a five star because of (1) dark theme disappeared causing eye strain, (2) device screen does not rotate to horizontal, and (3) the search is pretty bad, totally irrelevant; much easier to google an article, then read it on the app, than to search in the app.",
I love the NY TIMES! Thank-you all for all your great work. 📰,
All the news! Great editorials.,
"The app used to be fine, but has become a buggy mess. It's not possible to get through an article without some sort of issue with scrolling, or getting kicked back to the main page during ""updating"". I will be trying to use the mobile site until the app is fixed. I'm very disappointed.",
"Something is wrong with deeplinks! When I tap on a link from a notification or from Facebook it almost never takes me to the article. Pretty frustrating, especially since the app also lacks search functionality so I just have to scroll around and hope I find the article I was looking for. Huge bummer because the app has lots of content I want to read :(",
"Relatively easy to move from story to story, but I frequently receive notifications for new stories where, if I click on the notification, I am not taken to the story but rather to a front page. It's almost as if news updates we're being pushed to notifications but we're not being pushed to the app itself.",
"great information, all the time!",
NYT combines so much for us all to absorb in our own fashion and leisure. Wonderful to receive such insight ...,
"It tutns out I just needed some Tech support, and I got it. This app is fine!",
"Love the app and I gladly pay to support journalism today. Notes: 1) I do feel like I get signed out a lot more than other apps. 2) Please open up the audio features in beta. Accessibility via screen readers is disabled due to subscriber content flags. And if Google can't read it to me, and the NYTimes audio feature is behind a beta-wall... I don't have many options besides toggling over to my Washington Post app. (I happily support both of you.)",
"A year later from my last review - STILL NO DARK THEME! Why doesn't this have a dark theme? WHERE IS THE DARK THEME? IT REALLY NEEDS A DARK THEME! It's also hard to find stories mentioned in the notifications. I like the New York Times, I love the content and the opinion pieces, but it's literally the ONLY app in my phone that doesn't have some kind of a night mode / dark theme and as such, it's glaringly hard to read. As a result, I barely use it, preferring the WaPo and news aggregator apps.",
Use everyday. I would really appreciate it if you could swipe between articles. Would be much more user friendly. UPDATED: I have since started using the WaPo app and it is far superior to the NYT app. The NYT app continues to suffer by forcing a content-reload every time you navigate back to the Home page. It still lacks the ability to swipe through articles - which the WaPo app has. This is a real disappointment to a long-time user. I have to reduce my rating from 4 to 3 stars because of these shortcomings. It makes using the app a much more cumbersome experience.,
"While the app was fun while I used it, I requested a cancelation of the monthly subscription via email in May 2022. Based on their response to my request, they do not cancel subscriptions via email. I didn't catch that, so I was charged monthly until I just noticed it today, April 2023. When I talked to a live person, they canceled and refunded the current charge but not the past 10 months. I haven't used app since the original request to cancel. Beware when canceling.",
"I'm truly sick of an app which fails and has to be restarted three or four times for each news article I attempt to read. This has been going on for months. Now it won't load articles at all. Instead, it just gives me a spinning circle after I tap an article's headline on NYT. Everything else on my Android device works properly so it's not a problem with the device or my Internet connection. Please fix this soon, or I may have to switch to Fox!",
"I signed up while they had a special. When the price doubled, I asked for it to change to digital-only because I really only do the puzzles so they charged me $81 for the month with incoming credits of $41 and $25 for the remaining 2 weeks of the cycle. I couldn't play the puzzles the next day. They refused to refund my $25 and charged me for 4 extra days of papers, so I paid $106 to not do the only thing I do...but if I sign up now I can cut that cost in half! Stay away--it isn't worth it.",
*SO* many adverts.... you could easily forget you're also paying for it,
"Note this is about the app not the news content. The app freezes and is slow even on a strong Wi-Fi. I get the newsletter by email. When I have the app, what I click in the newsletter opens in the app and is so frustrating because things get stuck in the app. So I end up uninstalling it. Opening the article in Chrome is so much better. Have installed then uninstalled the app a bunch of times now. Currently uninstalled.",
"The games frequently glitch (sometimes the loading circle never goes away or the crossword app doesn't work right). And there's no way to search, you can only view what's on the front page or have to go through Google or different sections. It also doesn't keep track of what you have already viewed correctly. Both on the front page and in ""recently viewed"". Eventually recently viewed just shows the same 5 articles but still let's you keep scrolling.",
"Update, one year later: I turn off ""auto play video,"" yet videos still auto play. Annoying.",
"Aside from the fact that it serves up news from two or three days ago and refuses to refresh, simply claiming to be ""updating with the latest news"" while doing no such thing, its refusing to update its software while at the Google Play Store, and its refusal to allow me to save any recipes in the Cooking section (despite the Wirecutter section working just fine), it's really great - not; in fact it's such a useless pile of junk to me right now on my Samsung tablet that I'm uninstalling it.",
"I prefer to read NYTimes on mobile web instead of the app... But almost every article shows a pop-up that says it's ""better with the app"", and there's no way to disable them, even for paid subscribers, and no way to even provide feedback other than here. Ugh.",
"Pos app. They Insist on logging me into my old phone and wrong email. I like to read both sides of the aisle but spent 3 hours with 2 customer service reps, the second one who hung up on me even though I was polite. WHY can they not appropriate technology trained people. I only use my tablet for very specific things and they FORCED it on that so wish me luck when I turn it on and I suggest you get the paper version because their technology sucks.",
"Bring back the section swipe function! Why in the world did you disable it? Absolutely fed up with the number and selection of ads embedded into each article. More specifically - the SAME ADS that appear every 3-4 paragraphs. This means that depending on the length of the piece, I am shown the same image 4-7-9-11 times!!! I may be interested in the topic, BUT this bombardment it torture. I've closed the app, turned off the ads, nothing fixes the problem. NYT, please fix this!!! ASAP!",
Great paper and application. Love it!,
"The recent update is a step back. Gone are the titles at the top of the main page allowing you to go to the topic of your choice. This was especially useful when you were able to select which topics were highlighted. Now, everything is together and you have to go to another screen to find the you want to...blah, blah, blah. It's a terrible update even though I still love the paper.",
"Unbelievable. This app crashes constantly and there is zero support for assistance. I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled and sent over 25 screenshots to Customer Service. I also told them to cancel my paid subscription. 3 days later I received a response asking me to convert the screenshots from png to jpeg. It takes up way too much storage space - especially since it doesn't work. A major disappointment.",
"Signed up with a deal through Play that was supposed to include the crossword. Some issue had me being charged even though I paid upfront for a year. After getting it handled through two chats and a phone call, I now don't have access to the crossword. Zero chance I'll resubscribe after dealing with this. I don't even care enough to go through contacting anyone to get it corrected. Couldn't be more disappointed with how all of this was handled",
"This app has become pointless because notifications barely function. Pressing a notification rarely even takes me to the respective story anymore. Usually it just takes me to the home page and the story is no where to be found, or has a radically different headline than the notification implied. If I get multiple NYT notifications, they'll all become bugged when I try to expand them and every notification shows the same story. If this isn't fixed soon, I'm going to unsubscribe.",
"Edit2: well call me a lier because I just got two notifications with the same problem, ughh. Edit: Fixed with latest update. Old: The text in the notification are cut off. All I see are incomplete sentences. Cut-off-notification messages doesn't make me want to click it and find out more, it makes me want to uninstall the app.",
"I love the newspaper and your in-depth coverage. Thank you. My biggest pet peeve and major irritation is the way the app constantly, constantly updates. I hate it. It would be so much better if you could allow the user the option to update when they are ready. There's nothing wrong with reading news that's a half hour old.",
A lot of content to look at. The push notification feature doesn't link to the article which is annoying. To their credit when I reported it they replied quickly that it was a known issue and will be fixed in upcoming release. The game Spelling Bee puzzle part only let me play a few times before they shut me out and told me I needed the puzzle app??,
I am disappointed the latest update removed the widget without any warning in the release notes. The FAQ inside the app still refers to the widgets being available. I do not want emails or notifications. The widget was unobtrusive and allowed me to decide what I wanted to read quickly and efficiently. I am going to cancel my digital subscription as the app is useless to me now.,
"What is infuriating about this app is that it will push a notification of a story that seems really interesting and when selected the story seen is something else altogether and the highlighted story is impossible to locate. And trying to search for it? Good luck finding the search, assuming you remember a keyword to use from the notification and you're lucky enough to find out how to search. Trained me to ignore story notifications.",
"SO MANY ADS!! literally every 3 paragraphs there's a giant half screen ad. REALLY annoying. I'd accept it in a free ap, but when I'm paying a monthly fee, I expect not to have every article loaded full of ads like it's Buzzfeed or something. also, I was excited for dark mode, but it doesn't work on ads, they're all on bright white backgrounds, so scrolling through articles you get blinded by an ad every 3 paragraphs...not cool",
"Unable to find the NYT newsletters I follow very easily on the (if at all) on the app, which is related to the fact that the search capabilities are not great. All in all, the UX is decent but could be improved very much so to better cater to the interests of the end user imo",
"The new feature in the mobile app is pathetic. Instead of reading from the top, the app now forces you to start at the top each time you close an article, no matter how far you may have advanced.. this technique is also deployed by ESPN and Abc news. While it can be overridden on a browser, the app limits options to zero. Espn and Abc probably implement this feature for ad revenue purposes. I don't quite see what benefits the NYTimes gets from this feature other than making people unhappy.",
The content is very good however you will expect better App from such a big news organisation. Few things which annoy me: * You click on the notification to open an article but after a second the App reload and your article is gone * Difficult access to saved for latter articles * In big multi story articles or one with some animations scrolling become hectic - the page jumps up and down randomly and it is very difficult to read.,
"It's buggy and unintuitive. The search function is buried in the ""Sections"" tab. Older notifications don't actually open the article on the notification - they open the app to the homepage. Sometimes a notification opens the last article viewed instead of the article on the notification. Using the notifications for anything is often useless.",
"The journalism from NYTimes is worth paying for. From the topics to the beautiful figures and photos, to their way of writing... it's immersive and transparent with clear data sources. Their own invasive ads, however, ruin the experience. The journalism here is quality over quantity, focusing on important or interesting topics from a unique perspective and going deep in the research. If only ads were less frequent, and wouldn't occupy so much space within an article; their self-sabotage is sad.",
Unable to stop news notifications: uninstalled this app.,
"This app (released in 2010) is buggier than most swamps. I am Alpha testing a game written by two young guys that has fewer serious bugs. Twice in last year when I have reported articles are not loading, the ""fix"" is an unin/reinstall. Then I start being annoyed by notifications, because I forgot I need to go back and redo setting. Just now, an article I was reading went black for 5-10 seconds and the app threw me back to the original home screen. Pathetic for an app that charges subscription $$$",
App doesn't function well. Anytime I click on a headline notification it takes me to the app but never the article I clicked on. Same story when I try to launch through Facebook. It then doesn't bring up the content I wanted to read when I search for it either. Oh and if you click on one headline notification about 15 more all happen at once.,
"I want to like this app more, but there are some persistent issues: -Invisible location marker on the right scroll bar, thereby making it difficult to prejudice how long articles are or how much remains. This is a nuisance. -No dark mode, as others note in these reviews. I realize the NYT is working on these issues, but it's frustrating to see in a newspaper of this stature. The Washington Post has figured out these issues.",
"I absolutely love the coverage. However, the app is a buggy mess right now. Articles only load halfway if they load at all, freezing occurs frequently, it murders my battery life, everything everyone else has said. This is absolutely not an acceptable state for an app to be in. For reference I'm running an LG G7 ThinQ on Verizon's latest version of Android. Please fix this!",
the app used to present the news in a very simple interface. The new version is much like the website home page. I find the screen display now way too busy for a tablet. articles are all over the place. The new version also crashes constantly. I've reinstalled it twice with no change.,
The app no longer has a share button in it. So I can't get web address of articles to email or save to Pocket. I am dyslexic & cannot read serif fonts at all. So this app is now rendering my subscription to the publication worthless as it is completely unusable. If I try to read an article from the web in any browser the app launches &redirects me to it. Links from other articles in any browser go to this app instead of remaining in the browser. So this app is as useful as a bluescreen of death.,
"Their app is annoying. If I'm reading an article from Google News, sometimes it will authenticate my subscription, most times it won't. I lose interest if I have to copy and paste an article URL from News to the app or the web. Cancellation is an option. I feel the monthly fee would be better spent on the Atlantic.",
"THE standard in news. Been reading this paper for years. The comments section also sets the bar high. Well moderated. Erudite posters. I would give it five stars if the app was more reliable. Sometimes good, sometimes not. Other reviewers cancel their subscriptions when the app fails. Seriously? Go read the paper via the mobile website for a while, then come back in a while if you choose. There is no better newspaper. (""paper"". Haha!)",
"After subscribing, whenever I opened the app and clicked on an article, a message popped up that I needed to subscribe. Couldn't read the articles. Tried to cancel through NYT, but they said I didn't have an account and I'd have to cancel through Google Play. Google Play said I had to cancel through NYT. Seriously? Finally was able to cancel, but this was way too complicated. I'll read The Wall Street Journal.",
"Update Sep 14, 2020 - They broke dark mode again. Last time, the issue was resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. This time, no such luck. Update Sep 1, 2020 - They broke dark mode last night. The letters are too dim to read. -- Original review: Near-constant freezes and crashes on my Galaxy Tab S3. Seems to be due to ads. The app has become almost unusable since the last update. I'm seriously considering canceling my subscription since I can't read any article in its entirety.",
Best coverage of world news and fascinating human interest stories. And the games!,
"The apple version is so much better than the Android. Rotating phone often sets it back to the top of the queue. Videos won't play consistently. Now the latest version won't let me play crosswords, as it cuts off the bottom row of letters on the keyboard. Frustrating.",
"Quality of news and reporting as usual is excellent. Prior to this update the app worked great. Now, when I return to the main page after reading an article it scrolls to the top and I have to find my place again AND there is no night mode. Fix the bug and bring back night mode!",
"Best source of news there is, imo.",
"This app logs me out everytime I close it (sometimes even while I'm using it). It's hard to navigate and honestly not worth having if you have a subscription and can just get the same content online without all the hassle. It seems like an easy enough thing to fix, and you would think a company of this size would have the means to just fix it",
"It was fine until this recent ""upgrade."" The top had the sections to scroll across. Now gone and replaced by section bar at bottom right. Not an improvement. Plus the app got slower and loads poorly. The notification never takes you to the story, just to the front page. Great newspaper, lousy app.",
"Props are due! NYT is clearly game for the challenge of integrating traditional newspaper strengths — good old shoe-leather reporting and consistently exceptional editorial work — with new media formats. Some experiments have worked better than others, but that's a small price to pay to chart a course where no one's been been before. The NYT app is slick, its navigation intuitive and some clever tech makes segues between, or combinations of, seemingly disparate elements seamless and natural.",
"In the last few weeks, the app performance has been consistently getting worse. Now I'm unable to finish reading a single article without the app freezing and crashing. Reading the NYT via app has been getting discouraging, first with the dark mode getting removed and now the constant technical issues.",
Callaway built unique performance Corvettes. I've had the pleasure of having driven. R.I.P. life well lived.,
I enjoy nytimes but taking away even the glitchy night mode and not replacing it makes no sense. I read it most commonly in the am and the lack of this feature makes the whole app feel quite dated. Also while the design is simplistic is hides a lot of good articles buried in it's sections and selectively filters out what they think is important,
"Click Bait Alert! It's a *terrible* app. It teases you all day long with notification headlines. But when you click on the notification, it throws you right into the general app, and not the story. This forces you do scroll down indefinitely, looking for that juicy story, but you'll rarely find it, because it would rather have you get hooked on their other stories, instead of the one it had you click for. #clickBait",
"Too many ads for a subscription app. There are so many, and they are all so distracting - movement, color changes, videos - it's impossible to Simply read the news without mistakenly clicking on an ad while trying to scroll only to find yourself launched into some hideous offer you have no interest in. I frequently consider discontinuing my subscription because of the ads. Finally, the read offline option is spotty at best because the app pauses, times out, and crashes if it can't DL ads and pho",
"The app used to be reasonably navigable with section headings across the top that you could scroll through. They've just eliminated that and now one is left clunkily going to a side menu to find the sections of the paper or having to scroll through a ""for you"" section. I just want all the news, not news customized for me. An ""upgrade"" asked for by no one. Totally disappointing.",
the Times is an essential read every day,
I find the NYT so informative on such a broad array of topics that I can enjoy every day. There's always something new to learn.,
I support the NY Times and am happy to invest in a digital paper but this app is simply awful on my device. It lags on load each time I open it and prompts a crash report. I'm not sure how such a simple app can consume so much memory as to cause this type of instability. Improve the QA and I'll keep subscribing.,
"Scrolling is broken. You're supposed to be able to to quickly scroll a page and stop the scroll with a quick tap. Try this in any other Android application. But in NY Times app, it's constantly clicking me into articles I don't want to read because it interprets the tap that I use to stop the scroll as a tap-to-click. Makes this app very annoying to use.",
I enjoy the well written articles and love the games!,
I love reading their articles each morning.,
"Terrible app. You've been taking away capabilities to the line where the app is utterly useless. No search function, I go to an opinion writer's page and before I can click on a piece an ad pops up in front that I can't close. Sometimes there's a share button, sometimes not. DO YOU NOT LIKE HAPPY READERS AND FREE PUBLICITY? Deleting this trash app. The website is better (and for journalism WaPo is better anyway tbh).",
"One of the most trusted news sources in the US that's been around for decades. Clean interface, easy to use, well-written articles, and appropriate ""breaking news"" notifications that can optionally be turned off. I had a problem with the Share button and after weeks of ignoring it, I finally emailed support. I got a reply the next day and it was fixed two days later. Well done. This is my favorite news app.",
"Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
"Very useful app and wonderfully presented content. However, the spelling bee sub-app is wonky. Too often it streams the last letter until I exit back to the hub or top stories and then come back in, when it happens again. Seems to be more often of late. Not too long ago I knew I was safe when the loader spinner got stuck. A visual nuisance but I would not have letter repeats for the duration of spelling bee. Just where is bug tracking? Latest install of Times app on up-to-date Android.",
"This new version is terrible. After I installed the update, it could no longer recognize that I was online. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I tried hard and soft resets of my tablet. Nothing changed. Each time I start the app, it gives me a message saying device offline, please connect to the internet. I've written numerous emails to the tech staff there. I have a Samsung nook tablet. If you have had this same problem with your device, please post your experience. Thanks.",
"The app nagged me to subscribe, even though I was logged in to my NYT account, which is still billing me for a subscription. Silly me trusted it and renewed my subscription though the app anyhow, and it charged me through Google Play. There doesn't seem to be a way to reverse that, though. The NYT customer care said they can't do anything because they can't find that charge, and they're refusing to help me sort this out. My advice: don't subscribe through the app; it'll rip you off.",
"Was working fine until shortly after the latest update on April 2. Since then, it's become buggy for me. Can access content on 4-5 stories; after that no story content, only reader comments. Cleared cache/data, uninstalled/reinstalled, checked permissions, data & wifi access. A world-class paper needs a commensurate app, or at least one that doesn't fail. Please fix!",
I'm a NY Times subscriber and used to love this app. But in my opinion both it and the NYT website have gotten progressively worse over the last 6 months. I'm particularly disappointed that they've recently eliminated the bookmark function that allowed saving an article for later reading without having to open it.,
"New update lacks night/dark mode. Also irritatingly jumps back to the very top of the main page when you finish an article, this requiring you to scroll all the way back down to where you left off. Update seems to have worsened the app--i found it easier to use and more versatile before.",
"worked great till 12/13/18 update; Top News does not load. Still love the tech and Sundays msg sections. Wish they would re-enable the text to speech, was great for the car. Nite mode is great. 6/5/22 - I was told over a month ago that the entire app would fully load when you sent it to the once a day. It's still not happening.",
The app's night mode was working really fine . Not sure what happened suddenly. I am now unable to have a good reading experience using the night mode. Now the white text against the black backdrop has now been replaced by a very washed out and an unclear dull greyish text. Is there a way to fix this problem,
Podcast fail in android auto! It does not remember your place in the podcast. There is no ability to get back to where you were except to listen to the entire thing again. No skip forward or backward except to go to the next or previous episode. Very poorly designed. Impossible to use.,
"In general, the NYT mobile app is consistent and good in both function and navigability. The cons: NYT via a desktop browser such as Chrome offers demarcated categories the mobile app doesn't, most notably the World section. Via desktop browser, sub-categories of World news are offered, i.e. Asia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, South America, etc. Whereas on the NYT mobile app, it's just World general and the end user can miss a lot of articles that aren't as readily apparent in the demarcations.",
"I tried to submit app feedback through the app but it wouldn't let me. So I guess my complaints will now be public which could have been avoided. Double notifications for the same article happen often. Even more often is two different articles I get notifications for will change when I open them. If I get a trump notice and a sports notice, clicking one will often lead to the other instead. Love the app and the nyt but for how much money you have, fix your consistent bugs.",
"Updated, hoping it would fix the random crashes- now the app doesnt function at all, just opens a blank black screen and hangs there. Reliably an awful app to have to read the NYTimes through before, it is now literally unusable. Good job guys. Edit: entirely uninstalling and reinstalling the app got it to work again.",
"This app kind of sucks. I get notifications for breaking news stories. When I tap on the notification to read the story it's no where to be found. I scroll down the entire list and can't find it anywhere. Then they limit how many articles you can read if you don't pay for a subscription. Sorry, not paying for this pos app. Unistalled this one. Bye bye NYT",
"Downloaded the app and compared to my girlfriend's UI... Completely different. Very confused about why we have different interfaces. Mine sucks- it's almost to the point of one of those over simplified newsboards. Couldn't find the search bar, sections aren't easily navigable (no side bar), poorly designed. Let me choose my interface!",
"The auto-refresh the app uses makes for a very frustrating experience! After reading an article, returning to the home page gives you time for another cup of coffee, but I can only drink so much. Please let the reader decide when to refresh content... We know how apps are supposed to work.",
"This app is actually a significant downgrade from the website experience. Notifications are amateur-hour. They notify you of an interesting story, but inexplicably do not actually take you to the article it notified you about. Super frustrating experience, makes me want to actually unsubscribe to spite them. Then, once you are in the app, you can't actually search for anything (be it the article that a notification just duped you into clicking, or something else you are interested in).",
"Worst unsubscription process ever. You have to either call them or chat to a bot. Then you get passed to an agent, and mine kept me waiting after responses. Took at least 10 minutes to cancel my subscription!! App content is great, what you can expect from NYT, but can't see why they have to make the opt-out process so complicated. Hoping people don't bother and just stay subscribed? Shouldn't the content do that though...",
App is slow and buggy. Articles take 45+ seconds to load (I have fiber internet). Content constantly jumps around as I try to read it because ads are loading late. Pressing back to exit an article shows a blank screen? No way to choose favorite topics. Will probably cancel my subscription because of all the usability issues.,
"I fully support U.S. aid to Ukraine. But why is Ukraine not also following U.S. intelligence and military advice, resulting in what this and many other articles detail about limited success in the war?",
quality and independence.,
"Love the app and the journalism is second to none but when I wanted to cancel the subscription (a seasonal thing for me) I could not do it online. I had to call a toll free number and speak to two people at the Times, the second of which was persistent. Twenty minutes later that sweet taste of loving the app and journalism style turned bitter. Now I have to look for a new ""go to"" app for my news come next Spring.",
I'd rather pay more to a small farm than to suport this or else stop eating pork!,
I love the variety and honesty in this publication! The ads are not a problem. The satisfaction is worth it,
"The app makes playing the games impossible. The mini crossword has a ""subscribe here"" banner across the whole bottom covering 2 rows of the keyboard. Worst part about that is that I already did subscribe. The Vertex game is also super buggy, I can't connect lines from top to bottom because it keeps thinking I'm refreshing the screen. At least it can play the tiles game cleanly.",
"I just subscribed to NYT and was so excited to see this on my phone, but its messing up my phone big time. Screen freezing, then black, then colored dots dancing on the screen. What? Where is quality control? Testing? Anything? Im uninstalling - at least the mobile app. This needs to be sorted.",
"As a paid service, it's lack-luster in a few key ways. For starters, if you're going to suggest an article in my notification bar, the application should open to the article you suggested when I click on the notification. Secondarily, the fact to opinion ratio of these articles prompts me to believe the New York Times is info-tainment profitting primarily from subjective takes on abstracted concepts rather than providing ""the news."" Lastly, we should have the ability to ""pin"" live updates.",
"Well worth the small fee. No bells and whistles, just straight forward great journalism. EDIT: (6 months into this) Bummed that my subscription went from $4/mth to $17/mth with no warning. 8 payed for subscription to support The Daily but I hardly listen anymore and $17/mth has no value for me. Edit 3/23/2023 I'm deleting the app and changing my review from 5 stars to 2. I'm a regular subscriber, but for some reason, every time I open the app, I'm prompted to pay for a subscription.",
"V. 9.1.3 for my fire 8 tablet, modded for Play Store, is an epic fail. Seems like the developers for nyt have no clue about how humans actually want to read a newspaper, or how to program an app. The section tabs at the upper left are now gone, and moved to the bottom, and these are less than useful, and require an extra step to access content. The ""For You"" feature at bottom of screen should actually named ""F#@% You"" for all its usefulness. Version 9.1.2 was much better, and easier to navigate",
"My sister's husband had FTD and recently passed away. He was 62. Your article compassionately shone a light on the hardships the family faces, especially the children. Thank you. I am unable to find the words to describe what her family endured. I'm in awe of my sister. As the caregiver and mother of 3 children, she deserves to be recognized as almost super human.",
"Great overall journalism, especially in a difficult time. Please continue to investigate and share your stories, perhaps written without the ting of sounding left leaning. We know where we stand political already. I'd prefer the facts only without the paper looking as of it's taking a side politically. Please continue to share information about technology, health, science and other topics. I love to know what's happening all of the world. The NYT is about the only paper that provides all this.",
"The app is great. I was exposed to the print version of the NYT since 1966. Of recent late 2016, some articles have been written that give me pause. I mean by this that they have an obvious slant which I do not agree is fair and balanced. It had a higher rating when I grew up. Not sure if it is editors or ownership, but this newspaper is not my trusted source for news. It is better than most.",
Introspective reaching into history which is our future. Only through the truth will we learn and move forward.,
"The new update has made the app almost unusable. It's constantly refreshing and fails to load articles. I'd also like to be shown a few videos, magazine articles and international news on the first page. The managers of the app should understand that app users don't want a replica of the print newspaper. I find far more recommendations for NYT videos on YouTube than the app.",
Ads when subscribed.. No thanks ill use a browser.,
"Sadly the app doesn't do justice to the content. Sometimes sluggish, often freezes. The removal of page swiping was a retrograde step. Impossible to subscribe to newsletters as too much of the sign up dialog box is off screen. An increasing number of distracting animated ads is ruining the reading experience.",
"Absolute garbage ""news"". After dealing with it for a week, 90% of the breaking news notifications that popped up on my phone were trash talk about President Trump. This is not only shameful for an organization of your stature, NYT, but a complete disregard for actual news that has a relevant effect on American's lives. Disappointing. On a side note, the app functionality and asthetics are great, which isn't that big of an accomplishment. Still probably more news worthy than what you publish.",
"Because of character limitations I'll just list the issues out. 1. Notifications come through email and app. No option for one it the other. 2. Notification links don't link to actual stories. Most link to a landing page, leaving you to find the article you're looking for (often under a different title) 3. Stories aren't sharable. Share links point to ""top level"" articles, so once the story you share is no longer the most recent, it is no longer the story that gets shared.",
"Excellent writing, news coverage, features and photography merged with use of dynamic online visual aids, such as interactive data charts and maps. Then bringing a story to life with exceptional photography from all over the world placed behind the storyline as it moves for greater effectiveness. I believe NYT has developed an unfolding multi-dimensional online creative experience way beyond newspaper print. Bravo!!",
"Reliable reporting with well-documented sources and links to corroborating stories. Fun word games, too!",
"I wanted to subscribe for 1 year, but all subscriptions automatically renew unless I remember to cancel. That is an obvious money grab in which the NY Times is gambling that I (and other subscribers) will forget to (and even how to) cancel automatic renewal. I also noticed that this app is generally rated poorly in relation to other news apps, but I do not sense any responsiveness by the NY Times to address the issues listed, such as challenging navigation between notifications and articles...",
"Even after I sign in it doesn't allow me to read the articles and tells me to sign in. Before I use up my free articles for the month, it sometimes opens them in the app and sometimes in it's own browser (not external browser exactly but like FB has when u click on a link). I am uninstalling and using chrome so I can have my paid unlimited access.",
"STOP NAGGING US TO GET YOUR APP. It is not better! I prefer the website. It's less buggy and lets me open multiple tabs. And I do not appreciate getting a pop-up on every single article I read telling me to download the app. I say no thanks, you should respect my choice. Trying to shove it down my throat leads to one star reviews.",
"I am having a lot of issues with the notifications and the crossword. I only get some push notifications and often it will be the same notification over and over again instead of whatever news story should actually be pushed. The crossword for the past 3 days has hidden the last row of my keyboard... So if a word has z, x, c, v, b, n, or, m I can't solve it. 😥",
"App is harder to navigate than the webpage. I'm deleting the app to make sure the web experience never opens an app instead of a webpage. Hard to go back, hard to find navigation pane, hard to read. Final straw was I once clicked a link in a Google search that opened this app while reading my phone at 11pm at night. I felt like my eyes were cramping and burning with the sudden bright white wall. It hurt.",
"Almost perfect. This app is incredibly well put together providing an unlimited amount news and information resources. It has everything from the latest updates from breaking news coverage, to weekly dinner recipes, to entertainment and sports news, to one of a kind podcast. The app is so well done, I'm left wondering, is the New York Times a tech company? The only thing missing at this point is a dark mode. Without it, It makes using this app in low light conditions before bed a non-starter.",
"Horrible new version. while the removal of the side swipe between sections was annoying (and with no apparent good reason), removing all favorite sections with one huge section list (in some random order) is incomprehensible. do any of the ui designers actually use the app on a daily basis and is there any usability review? btw: saved article feature is also very buggy in the last months with some articles unremovable and other articles shiwung as black empty pages where only data wipe fixes it",
"Forced to do an update because the previous version was no longer supported. Now my top stories are interrupted by an ugly ""election 2020"" box, and my headlines widget is gone. Was happy with it before, now just annoyed. UPDATE: Wrote support about hating the blue ""election update"" box, they replied that it can't be removed. Have changed from 2 to 1 star now. Update: worse with every releaae, now hangs often when loading and sometimes ""share"" and ""save"" buttons are missing (reload article restore",
App will not allow me to write in the comments section using my Lenovo tablet. I can read them alright but can't comment.,
"The app has had trouble on and off since I began using it several years ago. After a long stretch of good functionality, it now forces me to log in every time I tap a notification, despite the fact of my tapping ""keep me logged in.""",
"Using the app on a tablet, ""may not be optimized for your device"". OK, does that mean it should crash every time it loads an ad? Because it's no exaggeration that that is what the app does... I just tried to load an article on wireless charging; 6 crashes and counting for that page alone.",
"The widget. Where is it??? Bring it back! Quite frankly, it was the most relevant and useful part of the app. Otherwise, I can just sit down in front of a computer and go to the website for the news. And no, I do not want even more notifications. If this was a mistake, I definitely hope priority is being given to fixing it as it is clearly something many of us found very useful. If this was no mistake, then NYT's app developers need to get their priorities straight.",
"Good newspaper, kinda bad app design. I've had this app for a few years now and they still have yet to implement a dark reader mode, and the app doesn't seem to work well with phones that are set to automatically switch to night mode every night--my push notifications to NYTimes become blank and cannot be read.",
"Long time NYT digital subscriber, downloaded app just to leave one star review. Prefer to read NYT in RSS feed (still working) and browser, which NYT is trying hard to break. About six weeks ago clicking on most stories on mobile browser generated a pop-up to read in app which had to be selected ""no."" About two weeks ago login cookies started clearing more quickly, requiring me to login multiple times each day to read. This must stop!! Or I will unsubscribe. I don't want the news in your app!!",
"Read the other reviews about subscription problems -- they're all true. I renewed my subscription through Google Play, but the NYTimes app cannot find the charge. I'm now paying for a premium subscription that I can't use. Spent multiple calls with both Google Play support and NYTimes, and both refuse to help me sort this out and keep playing blaming the other service for data issues.",
"This app has very poor functionality. It doesn't retain your place in a story, or sometimes the story you were reading. If you rotate the screen, it jumps to the beginning of the story when it should keep your place. Navigation is missing, if you open a story from social media, there is no way to get to the home page or any page within the app except suggested story links at the bottom of the page. The top white banner overlays my phone's notifications bar. One of the worst apps on my phone.",
"A constant stream of the best reporting anywhere on the planet. Invaluable in a time where the free press, a bedrock American principle, is being assailed at every turn. I'm a very proud subscriber. The app is excellent. The games are great brain training as well.",
Professor Loeb is trying to push science beyond its capacity. I wish him well.,
"Love the content but the app has become unbearable. Herky jerky freezes while scrolling, losing your place when ads load, Android messages saying the app has stopped responding, plus when I go back to main page after finishing an article, it scrolls back to the top. If only I could downgrade to the version from a few months ago :(",
"Every update is worse than the one before it. I'm now unable to read any articles--when I tap a headline, I just get blank space, sometimes with a clocking wheel. App causes battery to run very hot. This is an excellent publication that I want to support, but the terrible app is really making me consider unsubscribing.",
"good interface, easy to read. App doesn't crash. But I wish they would do a better job separating NYT Cooking from the regular food category. It is not included in the regular subscription, so why link cooking articles inside a regular food and dining article? I read an article to the end and I was interested in the content, but it ended abruptly with a link to a NYT Cooking recipe (recipe wasn't disclosed in regular article)",
"App stopped functioning 7/23/20. What happened? Now when I open the app, I get a blank page with a loading wheel, then a popup that says ""Device is offline. Please check your Internet connection and try again."" So the app is completely useless for me. Any popups will occasionally take me to the correct article. Otherwise it just crashes. Why am I paying for a subscription?",
"what's not to love? Fair and reasonable writing, unbiased thought and opinion. Educated, researched, vetted, thoughtful , articulate and heartfelt writing. Simply, one of the last pillars of democracy.",
"The app is great if you want a new paper app. The New York Times totally SUCKS if you're trying to cancel your subscription!!! I've been trying for 6 months now, numerous emails, and they keep charging my PayPal account while sending me placating emails saying that they are ""looking into it""! Used to love 'em, now I despise them!!! Even if I thought that I might have renewed at a later date, they've ruined all chance of that! Uninstalled, now un-freaking-subscribe me and stop taking my money!",
Great app for news but I find that sometimes the reporting is biased towards America(ns).,
This app always asks me to subscribe even though I am signed in and subscribed to all access. There is no fix if you use Google pay to subscribe,
"Well made app, extremely dynamic, great citation, and even has some opinion pieces for you Americans that like that ✌️ Edit: is there a way to turn off the status bar cover up? Super irritating. Case: you have a few spare minutes to read because you're early for something so you start reading and then have to keep pulling down from the top to keep track of time. You get engrossed in the story and are then late because you don't have your clock at the top of the screen like other apps.",
"This is really a rating for the NYTs customer service. I ordered a subscription through Google Play. OMG!  Can't login to the NYTs. It keeps asking me to subscribe even though I have a subscription. They can't figure out why. After 4 attempts, emails and calls to customer service, I'm cancelling. Too bad because the journalism is outstanding. Just inept customer service.",
"Not the worst app in the world, but the way it jumps around with touch scrolling, reloads things randomly, and loads huge sections with multiple articles and feeds, failing to smoothly just navigate to the one you're trying to read, makes this a rather difficult app to deal with when all you want to do is read the news...",
"generally ok,some of the fancy graphics freeze on my old tablet. Good reporting usually.",
"This app is becoming unusable. Articles are failing to load. I reported it, sending screenshot of an article that was blank after the first 20% and they just said clear cache. That is not fixing the issues other than slightly improving for just the next session. I am a subscriber who can't see your content, how long do you think i will stick around???",
Font size adjustment doesn't work. This is a basic accessibility feature.,
"Great app & I feel the notifications are valuable. The thing that puts me off is that if a notification is interesting and clicked, you are taken to the website, then BOOM, silly signup screen over the top of the story and you cannot view or read the story unless you create and account. No use to me as the handy notifications are effectively click-bait that I can't read unless I hand over my personal details. I'll pass, thanks. Uninstall is best.",
A luminous piece of writing. A movie review as great art.,
"The app has worked very well for the past 2-3 years. Now it's getting to the point where I don't want to open it. Headline links won't work and app constantly updates when I return to home page, makes for clunky, annoying experience!",
"The content is great, but please provide a ""text only option"" for your glossy feature articles. I just gave up trying to read ""Putin's War"" as the page jumps to a new location every time I scroll,which makes it impossible to to read. These comments apply to most other glossy articles. Please, less gloss and more focus on the written content of the article.",
"The app is really quite slow, but worse though I have selected for articles to be downloaded for offline use (as I commute through areas with poor data coverage) the app stalls as if it is trying to communicate back to some server online. It really feels like some poorly utilised analytics software, set to block article loads till it logs back to base the user experience. UX 'story', app uninstalled.",
"I really do thank the NYT for being a source I can trust, and a source I can afford while I'm in college. The app works seamlessly. Maybe a few small issues. If I've gotten a few article notifications, sometimes the one I click on isn't the one that pops on my screen. Still, I love this paper and I love the app. Thanks for the truth",
"I like the New York Times and the app. A problem with the app is that NYT notifications on my Android phone don't open up the article in the app and it is hard to find said article. Very frustrating. NYT app said they fixed this problem, but it's still not working for me.",
"An incredibly unreliable paid app that gets worse every year. The top stories stopped updating regularly about six months ago, and I'm frequently met with a blank screen that won't refresh. Reading cached content on the subway is nearly impossible. Stories refresh and start at the beginning every stop as my phone comes in and out of service range. The two stars are solely for content. Clearly nobody at the Times uses the app.",
Please fix the notifications... there is no point in sending me push notifications for articles that when clicked just take me to the homepage. I either have to save them and then remember that I saved them or search in the app for the article that I wanted to read. Useless. And if I can't use the app I'm not going to pay for the subscription.,
"I had to reinstall the app to get past the paywall AFTER I paid for a subscription. The path to subscription from the app is poor UX. I have to go to my account settings which takes me to a browser (chrome in my case). Then when I try to purchase a subscription I get bounced back to the app, where I'm asked to login (again) and logging in via Google DOES NOT WORK here. There is some sort of authentication error for this particular flow. Very frustrating considering I'm trying to GIVE YOU $$$",
"This app is kind of crappy. It freezes frequently. Sometimes content won't load, even after repeated restarts. When I tried to cancel my subscription, the NYT agent took 20 mins locating my account, and when I asked to speak with a supervisor, he told me it wasn't NYT and that I should contact Google. I called Google and they had nothing on their end. Called NYT again, and finally the rep found my account. An hour of needless hassle.Save yourself the grief and don't get the app or subscription.",
"Around 80% of notifications say one thing and then a different headline once expanded in the notification bar. They also all appear at once. However breaking news alerts are chosen is a mystery to me. NYT Cooking should be in the same app, and account management should be more robust within the app. Loading could be smoother.",
"I keep getting the message ""The app has expired"" even after I have updated the app and the icon changes to a green color with the words ""Beta"" on it. I have to uninstall it completely and then reinstall. After that it works for a day or two and the story repeats",
"What the heck happened??? This was a really great app, one that I would use several times per day. I am a suscriber, but very recently, within the last week (April 22 on) this app has become terrible. The articles wont load, and I have tried everything including uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. Please someone fix whatever is going on. I need my news.",
"NOTE: Google Pixel 2s: if you see dark dark grey text on a black backdrop (as opposed to the usual white backdrop), uninstall and reinstall the app. Worked for me. Great app, works well, solid design. Don't like that I get ads but they're not too intrusive. Would prefer if they posted less garbage Tom Cotton OpEds lmao.",
I rate this app very low because of the non-existence of any audio to help visually impaired people. The Washington Post has an excellent app where many of the top news stories conclude audio. I've been waiting almost 2 years for New York Times to come up with something similar,
Android version app does not run well on Google Pixelbook. Stories display wih missing characters. Not sure who to contact - Google or NYT. Works fine on my Pixel phone. Reads fine using browser. Needs a fix. Not sure how long this has been going on but for several weeks - previously worked fine since I started with the Pixelbook a year or so ago.,
"Great reporting horribly delivered. The quality of the articles is great, but the delivery is an exercise in frustration-at least on the Android app. As others have mentioned clicking on a notification frequently takes the user to either the wrong article, or the main page. The search functionality is also broken.",
"The Android app crashes very frequently to the point of being useless. This problem has persisted for months now and despite my regular feedback on the app's performance (or lack thereof) the only response so far was to empty the app's cache and, if that doesn't work, uninstall the app entirely. Which I now have do regularly to be able to use the app at all. It's honestly hard for me to imagine how this app could possibly be any worse; any developments bringing the app closer to approaching mediocrity would have to be considered a success for their (paying) customers at this point.",
"I can't believe I actually pay the NYT to use this app. Make it work properly! I can't even open an article without having to relaunch on a regular basis. Haven't you figured out these simple actions by now. There have been bugs with the app and website for years. I'm ready to cancel my subscription. I also use the Washington Post app, and it works flawlessly, it can be done!",
"So many, so MANY ADDS in this app! Though I love the NYT, the content, the format, the length of the articles, and I am subscriber, this app makes it extremely difficult to read an article on the phone! They even push more than one visible add into one screen of text! I object and refuse reading a screen of text which can fit TWO adds! I want to read the news, the analysis, the reviews, the obituaries, NOT the adds! UNINSTALL! PS. I am not a serial complainer, this is my first 1 star review...",
"The app experience is nice. However, why does it use so much background data? 15 days into my monthly billing cycle it's used 400MB of background data! For any app and especially a news app this is ridiculous. This is a problem for me since I don't have an unlimited plan. For comparison the WSJ app has used 6MB of background data in the same timespan. I've turned off background data on the app for now so I hope it doesn't adversely affect the experience.",
"I have uninstalled this app & review is to warn others to find another news source. My apps update automatically which as many other reviews attest to, the May update was the death knell for The NYT. If, the breaking news push notification actually linked me with the corresponding article, I was suddenly greated with a new block of subscription options?????? After weeks of emails hoping to resolve this & getting nowhere, I moved on. Save yourself the aggravation; find a different app!",
"I like the New York Times but they need to do a better job with Google play subscriptions. I tried to cancel my subscription and I could not. When I went to manage subscriptions Google sent me to New York Times subscriptions which told me I need to cancel through Google play which I could not. I finally had to delete my credit card on Google play so I wouldn't keep on getting charged. Also, there are way too many adds and annoying pop-ups. I want to support good journalism and news papers but they need to get their act together.",
I can't even get to my paid for subscription via this app. All I ever get is a message to retry entry.,
"Stop ruining the mobile web for this trash. As a long time subscriber, this application and its entire team is causing me to reconsider my subscription ever since the mobile web experience has been ruined by frequent pop-ups pushing people to use the app. Well, it's incompatible with assistive technology for the visually impaired, huge for a glorified web page, laden with annoying ads, and reeks of spyware. If I could give negative stars, I would. Any positive review was written by a simpleton.",
"I open NYT when I wake up and when I go to bed. These times incline me to bookend my day with current events, but these are the times of day that the Stark white background is most jarring. I can turn down my screen brightness and apply my blue light filter and wear blue light glasses but I wish there was a night mode or an option to change the theme to paperback beige, newspaper gray, or an obsidian black. Readers are offered the ability to change fonts, and that would be the ideal location",
only newspaper that still gives the news as they are,
Best of the Lame Stream Media!,
Much more than the best news source.,
Obviously a true friendship- nice to see and hear about,
"I'm very impressed with the NYT, and nearly two years since acquiring the app ( first as a free six month trial run, then monthly ) I can truly say, I'm enjoying NYT, and hopefully, a little while longer, besides, it's worth it ( like the news should be...and the truth behind the headlines. 👍! Keep up with the great work ).😉!",
"Love the Times, hate the app.",
"Great app, with excellent usability and fantastic writing. I wish the Europe section could be set to home though. The widget has also disappeared for me in this latest update. It is one of the few well designed news widgets, but it's missing for me now. Is the feature being removed or is this a bug?",
"Still blocked by paywall. I subscribed to an intro rate in the browser, link to my Gmail account, it shows up under my subscriptions, but I'm still blocked by the paywall. Doing a great job of confirming my avoidance of news-related subscriptiona there, NYT.... Submitted a help request via the App, will update this if it is fixed. **Update 1/15/20** Support contacted me, said that they've been having other users see the same issues. Their suggestion didn't work, still blocked. Get a refund.",
it is how I keep up with all the madness in the world with sane writing and journalistic integrity.,
"The New York Times runs in tandem with me as well as the Washington Post as staples of truth in the cloud of what has become a dichotomy of pride stricken sycophantic sick behavior in America versus the justice that keeps corruption and lies in balance through checks in order, reason, logic and objectivity. Just as the judicial system we have in society and in government, facts are facts and I thank you for them. I learn more everyday from you ladies and gentlemen and I thank you for truth.",
"Now a WaPo reader for my news--that's how bad it is! This app and the website keep crashing on my phone. At best, I can view headlines. No links to articles work. Avoid like the plague! Hey NYT--I hear that digital subscriptions are now your #1 revenue source. Not for much longer if the digital products continue to seriously underperform.",
I love everything about The New York Times. Having it on its own app is just convenient.,
"Outstanding news organization, timely reporting of news, excellent feature and sports coverage",
"App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
1.99 and the paywall went down. I do a lot of social media and being able to read the NYT articles is important to be able to keep up with whats being talked about. I live on the West Coast so certain sections are useless to me but hey that's always been that way. Like having the paper right in front of me. And no trees were harmed. Win/win.,
"This is my favourite, most user-friendly newspaper app.",
Only way to make this article better would be include some reseller information.,
"Edit, Jan 2020: app worked well for a few weeks; now back to being unstable with unending load times and blank articles. Edit, Jan 2020: Why does it take forever to get the app back in order?! Even after six weeks, load times remain insanely long, app keeps crashing. JUST ROLL BACK TO LAST WORKING VERSION! Edit, Dec 2019: seconding other reviews; latest update makes app crash, presents 'empty' articles, does not allow to scroll saved articles. Content is great, but product completely unusable.",
The articles are great but seeing as the app seldom loads the articles and instead shows a blank page it's pretty useless. I've removed it as a first step in ending my use of ny times as I can't stand by a news organization that can't figure out how to actually get news to people in a reliable way.,
"I get newsletters all the time that I read from mobile apps, but emails don't open into the apps. They open into web browsers where I'm not logged into my times account.. I know so many apps who've solved this feature, so I'm rating NY Times poorly until it is resolved. It may seem trivial, but it ruins the app experience for me.",
Love having the paper at my fingertips. But when you lose that $4 rate and it goes to $17 sometimes you need to take a break. And on the app I hate the cancellation process. Tried the chat and it didn't work. Had to call and wait on hold for 10 minutes to speak with someone.,
"Used to be a great app, but recent updates have made it more frustrating to use. Scrolling now stutters because of frequent ads loading. App crashes regularly. Search function is very poor and doesn't find half of what you're searching for. No longer my go to app for news.",
"I would put 5 stars for content. However the app is so bad and useless, that it is a one star. If you are not connected to the internet, forget about reading the times offline. It just doesn't work. So forget about enjoying the times on your Android tablet or ipad in the train, plane or the park if wifi is unavailable. Thinking of stopping my subscription as it is a frustrating app",
I decided to subscribe so I would see no ads but the app is riddled with them. You see the same amount of ads whether you're a subscriber or not. I'm more than willing to pay a premium for an ad-free experience. I suppose I'll have to go back to the ad-supported Flipboard that doesn't show as much ads as the New York Times App.,
Numerous usability and excessive advertising issues over past few months as noted by other reviews. Now autorotation is stuck in portrait mode which is the deal breaker for me. This is what a paid subscription gets me on Android? iOS version works fine on my iPad but I do most of my NYT reading on my Android phone. Unacceptable!,
"Quality content, awful app. -Bookmark button doesnt show up on pages with comments... why!? -Speaking of comments, they fail to load probably 75% of the time. -iOS has a NYT cooking app, Android simply redirects to the NYT site; we deserve an app too! -Articles freeze while scrolling, requiring the user to exit and find the link again. -Articles in push notifications are often hard to find without a direct link. -Scrolling is wonky, sometimes speeding to the top or bottom of the page.",
"Recent updates have broken notifications: clicking on a mitigation does but always result in the selected article opening up. It depends on whether the app has been opened recently and has pulled an update. If the app has not updated recently, then a click on a notification will only open the app but not the selected article.",
NYT is good journalism. Worth the money if you have only 15-30 min a day to read the national news real quick.,
"Edit: Since the widgets disappeared several months ago, and the app has gotten buggy, I will be cancelling my subscription. After more than two months, the developers clearly have not listened to our requests and concerns, so I feel no need to keep paying for a product that I don't use, and is not user-friendly. The widget disappeared after my most recent update. That's what I largely use to review headlines and decide what I want to read. Beside that, the app is fine.",
App has been broken for months. Impossible to load articles from Facebook or push notifications. Considering cancelling subscription. No point paying for something you can't use. UPDATE: Nearly a year later and the push notifications are still entirely screwed up. Really pitiful from such a large media organization.,
"Update: version 9.29 was buggy, and sadly version 9.30 is no better. Pages never load properly. The last two weeks have been hell. Fix it! As others have said, app on phone frequently crashes, and website on phone is not much better. Desktop version is stable.",
"I use the app for notifications, but it should allow me to open the articles in chrome from the menu. I have to click share the article, copy the link, then delete out the subject of the email after I paste it in the browser. also, if there are multiple notifications on your phone it only opens the latest notification.",
"Subscribed with the all access pass in early November, since I use NYT cooking and Crossword I figured I may as well bundle it all. When I go to view my profile at nytimes[.]com, it states I have a basic subscription, even though it's linked with my Gmail account. Basically I paid 130$ to have a non-functioming NYTimes app and I no longer have access to the puzzle or cooking applications.",
"The app is fine. Nothing special. Good quality, as expected from a paid subscription. But I am getting sick of being nickled and dimed. Extra money for the crossword. Extra money for wirecutter. Extra for recipes. It just goes on. I paid already. I want to support journalism. But wringing more money by creating evermore fire walls is painful. Probably not renewing. I'll find a less greedy source. The NYT is not that special",
The news are rarely up to date. Articles available on the web often don't show up in the app. (Or it is possible their algorithm for choosing articles to show in the feed isn't working). A simple functionality to e.g. locate daily briefings would be good. Search function also appears off.,
"I recently bought a year digital subscription, partially because of articles shared on Facebook and wanting to support journalism. But this app is clumsy. I had hoped it would be more like a literal newspaper, but in digital format. Please add some kind of e-reader capability and PDF style digital copies of the print version!",
"Update: After the latest update the popups now take me to the correct story, updating to 5 stars. Not sure if the problem was adressed or my phone was just bugging out. This app has everything you'd expect from a scrolling news app. However when you show a popup for a story on my home screen, then I click on said popup as it piqued my interest, and it simply opens the app to the main page and not on the article I wanted to read....it makes me want to end my subscription.",
Usually can't read articles - clicking on an article displays blank page with loading icon forever. Clicking on an article notification almost always either opens the wrong story or shows no story at all (navigates to main page or shows previously viewed story). Scrolling frequently stutters or refuses to move. Restarting the app or my phone doesn't help. Neither does updating nor reinstalling. These issues force me to use the mobile website which is very frustrating.,
"Great but 1 nitpick. When you get a notification with a headline and you click/tap that specific headline, it doesn't bring you to that article, it takes you to the front page/top article/headline. So you try to scroll through to find your article of interest. Most of the time I don't end up finding it.",
"Good content, but the app has many problems. Not only does clicking on a notification NOT bring you to the article that the notification is concerning, but it even when you go through opening the app on its own and click on an article there, it doesn't always take you to the article you clicked on. This is especially common with newer articles. There shouldn't be such fundamental problems with such a basic app, especially when you're an outlet so large with the money to pay decent developers...",
in App videos do not play and images cannot be clicked on to magnify... fix needed!! Update 12/1/2019: The app is now glacially slow to load. Saving items takes a loooooooonnng time!!! Its almost like some server somewhere is grinding much too slowly... Big fix needed!!! Us paying readers need better service!!! Update 8/1/2020: only 2 lines of the keyboard show up in the crossword or mini crossword!!! This is unacceptable!!! I am reducing rating to one star now...,
"I have a subscription, but I still am not getting full access. Perhaps there are levels. The covid data is timely and factual. Articles I have already read do not leave my feed. The Today feed doesn't refresh every day. Still, it has good reporting in classical sense; so, I am willing to support the paper.",
Great articles but dismal interface especially with longer articles. Trying to read one is a frustrating experience as it jumps up and down by several paragraphs when there are background pictures. I often end up rereading the same content a few times trying to find where I was. 😡,
Unable to access place to enter password. Previous entry did not allow me to play a complete game of wordle.,
"Articles take forever to load, especially if they contain more ads. The ads also mess with scrolling and the page will jump backwards when an ad finally finishes loading. I'm already paying a monthly subscription - why are there so many ads? And if we have to have ads, why can't you make them a smoother part of the app? Honestly, this just makes me dislike both the advertising company and NY Times more.",
"Terrible. No way to turn off advertising, even for a paid subscriber. And the ads are tracked across my normal web browsing. Also, no way to set the home page to the international version. Guess this is more for a US audience right? I just signed up for a subscription, which I'll now cancel",
"I don't want to write a one-star review for this app because I want to support good journalism and I'm fine with paying for stuff that adds value to my life. Lately, however, this app has been unusable for me, and that's not hyperbole. If I can get an article to load, it's usually only half the page; content isn't refreshed to keep pace with the website; and app crashes are a near daily occurrence. NYT, please fix your app so I can go back to supporting your great work.",
"Felt like it was taking over my phone and my email. Don't have time to just be stuck in a ""newspaper"" all day when there are other things to read and other things to get done! Also felt like many of the articles have a very liberal slant, I always thought news was to be reported not tweaked and ""created in your own image"".",
"I'm from NY so I live having access to the NYT. However, I find the content to be nothing more than what I'd expect. I've never thought that there is something amazing included in the digital experience. I don't mind paying. I just wonder how much commitment the board have to their future.",
"I just appreciate the old fashioned reading of the paper. Still would prefer page over digital, but there are benefits for sure! (On time delivery for starters!) I also appreciate the new, limited article sharing I can do. Genius for marketing their subscription. Easy to find articles of interest also.",
"NYT please disable automatic video and audio playing. When I open the app to read an article, the last thing I want is a video automatically starting to play at full blast. PLEASE STOP WITH THE AUDIO AND VIDEO AUTO PLAY! Thank you!",
"Previous comments: excellent range of news and news analysis, balanced with a selection of stories about personal and social issues. Also, access to puzzles, entertainment, recipes, and literature. I find myself turning to my NY Times subscription on the app at least once each day.",
"Hard core NYT user that keeps getting frustrated that the app just doesn't reflect what the online version is showing. The app keeps placement of the ""Top Stories"" out of sequence in my opinion. Which makes me constantly have to go back to the online version to read the current top story. In other words if NYT thinks a story is worthy of being the ""top story"" front page of the online version it should simply reflect the same in the app. The same seems to happen in the other categories too.",
"Like the NY times alot especially the historical content,and the podcasts. It's easy setup an account. But not easy as to cancel, you have to make a long call, similar to cancelling a Sky Subscription. Which would put me off from using it ever again.",
"This is driving me mad! Since several days now, I am blocked from reading the Times by a pop-up that tells me to upload a new version of the app. If I use the provided link, it tells me I already have the app installed. So I uninstall, look for a (new?) version, and install this. After one or two sessions, the same thing happens again. I do NOT want to install a new version of the app for every time I read, so if this continues, I will have to abandon the Times. Please fix!!!!",
"As a paying subscriber, I expect much more from the Android app experience. For the last couple months at least, the home page does not refresh for hours and I'm unable to click into any stories on the home page. I gotta Google the headline then have my browser open the story for me - hugely inconvenient and honestly you're screwing up actual views of stories - which I assume is a very important metrics - by allowing this bug to persist.",
"The app is very easy to use, summarizes sections, and is almost as good if you are old fashioned and like this rustle a paper as you make your way through it. I can easily share news via text or social media. Also, it has Dark Mode, which is very easy on the eyes.",
"The NYT is the paper that you have been looking for. All the news that you need to know in one place with amazing journalist that seek for stories all over the world. Only one hick-up; the subscription is expensive. It has went up three times since I've been a subscriber. Is the journalism worth it? Yes! But for the readers, it is pressing our pockets. At this point, it is up to $18 a month.",
"some glitches on mobile, better on desktop, but the games are fantastically challenging and fun",
"This is a swindle. If you are an existing NYTimes subscriber and renew your subscription on Goole Play, you will not be able to use your subscription on a browser. I tried every possible support from Google Play, The New York Times and even the developer. No one could fix the problem and Google Play refused to refund my purchase. Beware!!",
App is not user friendly. It doesn't save your spot. The scrolling bar is invisible unless you pass over a picture. My saved articles disappeared for no reason. Recent articles and saved articles are buried in menu and not easily accessible. Recommendation system is average at best.,
"I never get the morning edition of the paper until morning is long past. Instead I am forced to read yesterday's nyt or else The Washington Post which does arrive early in the morning. the Android app does not fill my entire screen and leaves a big space on either side. Somehow, the Android tablet application has really deteriorated over the years that I have been reading the nyt.",
"Can't do crossword since bottom line of keyboard doesn't show. Have tried Uninstalling app and installing, also restarting phone. No finger swipes do anything except shrinking the puzzle. No effect on keyboard. That's my reason for low rating. News etc are excellent. Problem likely started with recent update.",
"In general, it gives good news. HOWEVER, you literally need a subscription to do literally anything. You can't even read more than the headline on articles without subscribing. It's super inaccessible for people (like me) who just want good and accurate news but can't afford to get a $7 a month subscription which then goes to $16 a month after a year. This is a really big company, so I'm honestly shocked they charge THAT MUCH for a subscription so you can actually read the news.",
"Was working great until recently, last few days I keep getting a message that I'm offline even when I'm not (and I have it set to work offline anyway, so that shouldn't even matter). Formatting is all weird and images won't upload. Haven't been able to access new content for several days. I'm on an Android phone.",
"When I click a notification, it opens the main page, not the article. When I open the app after a few days I'm bombarded with 10s of notifications all at once. Notifications are for inconsequential articles and very distracting. Fix the notifications plz!",
"The app used to work just fine. In the last month however, I can't say that it works much at all. It usually fails to load the article, and if it does manage to load it, it renders it on a black background with dark text. This usually happens when you open an article from a news alert notification. Also, the comments rarely load, and this has been true for months. The app is basically unusable right now. If they don't fix it soon, I will cancel my digital subscription. It's that bad.",
"Annoying Bug For some reason, if I try to open an article from earlier in the day on my notifications, it instead takes me to my most recent article in notifications. Please fix this, it can be somewhat frustrating to chase down an article after it goes off the virtual front page.",
"App has stopped working on Android 4.4 - App worked well until 26 Nov., 2019, then stopped updating anything except Top Stories. After reinstalling I now get an annoying splash screen; after pressing ""Log In"" I get a blank template of the app with no content at all. The NYT itself is great, but the app is dead.",
"The news coverage is great, however, the app sucks. It is constantly trying to get me to subscribe when I am already subscribed through Google Play Store. I have written the New York Times about the problem for several days. They sent me a message about how to fix it, but it didn't work. They are not responding to repeated emails to fix the problem. I still can't access many articles.",
Update 27 Mar '20 - funny 'tech' section no load 26 Mar. '20 - still buggy & filled w/loading problems. Can't trust will work when want to read. Clear NYT isn't focused nor wants to fix many long known problems. Jan. 2020 - App slow to load. Hangs. App refuses to open 1-in-5 articles. Have set to download artickes and still it doesn't. Will not refresh feed nor load 2/3rd of an article's pictures. Ads in app cause slowdowns in scrolling and crashes. Howcan a media company not get this right?!,
Edit Jan 2021: Continues to lock up daily on my new Pixel 4a just like it did on my new Pixel 3a and every other android device I've used it on. Original review: Locks up after a minute or two of reading. Every. Single. Time. I keep it installed for the notifications and simply read articles in Firefox. Would be great if it just worked though!,
"The June 29, 2021 update disabled any updating of the news. I can't find any settings that might have caused this, or that might cure it. It makes my NYT subscription worthless, so I will soon cancel it if nothing changes. I tried updating the app, but that didn't help.",
the app works well and the content is great,
"11/22/19 -Like others, I was forced 2 install this app, and can now get no news although I am paying for the NY Times. Not happy. 2/26/21 - the app started working during past year, but for past month has been repeatedly shutting down every time I open a news article and very often just as I read headlines. I am a very long term subscriber to New York times and very unhappy with this.",
"I don't like the updated version, where is the dark mode function?? It's unfortunately pretty much unusable for me in white... Also the navigation is very confusing, I miss the save button and easy access to saved articles and today's paper.. Hoping the next update will get better again.",
"Be warned before subscribing: The only way to cancel your subscription to the NYT is by physically calling up a real human person and complaining to them that you would like your account cancelled. The NYT would rather pay somebody a salary to sit at the other end of a phone than just putting a cancel button in the app, just so they can keep you paying them your few dollars per month for a little while longer due to the inconvenience of unsubscribing. Dirty, underhanded, customer-unfriendly.",
"Bought a subscription via the app through Google. Have never been able to access subscription. According to NYT there is no subscription, and there is nothing for them to access. Apparently Google/app developer doesn't always 'tell' NYT about new subscriptions. NYT says I have to contact Google. Google says to contact app developer. App developer says clear cookies, then to contact NYT. This has been going on for months. Ridiculous. If I could give negative 5 stars I would.",
"As an international (trial) subscriber I wish to view the international edition of NYT (INYT). There is no option inside the app to do this. Instead my entire home page feed is US specific articles. If I open my web browser and search INYT it will open today's edition inside the app, with the content I wish to read. However there is no way to navigate here within the app. The ""world"" section is no substitute - it is missing many of the articles. Terrible content discovery and user experience.",
"There is always a prompt dialog to open the news article in the browser. Every. Single. Time. Why am I even using the app if I want to open the article in the browser? As soon as I click on any news article, the prompt comes up asking if I want to open it in the browser. So irritating. BTW, I'm a paid subscriber.",
"I still trust the New York Times as a publication but the app is the worst. I've subscribed to the Times online and have been using the app for a very long time and it still has the same problems. I'm giving this app one star because every time I've written to the app developers in the last 2 years about this problem, I get the same response and still no change.",
Love the reporting...the app is terrible. It doesn't work well on my Samsung Note9. All my notifications come in at once. Usually 20-40 notifications at once. I can't click on articles individually from my notifications. I also can't seem to find a place to search names of articles. Please make it better. I am a paying subscriber.,
"Loving the app! I enjoy being able to get the news quickly or read when I like, or even play the games. All on the app. it works great now. There is one thing still giving me a little trouble and that is the sharing of articles. Today I couldn't find the sharing button very easily. Sometimes it doesn't go thru either so, not sure what I might be doing wrong. It could be they aren't a paid subscriber maybe? This was a Covid article though and I thought those were free to everyone. Still, love it!",
"The app has, on several occasions attempted to log me in online and on the app simultaneously. My account was through Google Play, but the interface between Play and the NY Times app is not functioning correctly. This meant the app would stick in an infuriating cycle of continuously trying to re-load the article.",
Looking forward to the audio feature for Android. Auto download audio would be awesome!,
"Fraudulent charges: cancelled my subscription October last year but just noticed that NYT is still charging my credit card EVERY MONTH since then. Apparently it's not enough to unsubscribe via Play Store, you have to manually contact customer service to stop the payment. The process of getting in touch with their customer support was long and difficult of course. Becareful when you subscribe and double check the terms.",
(IS): The 9.27.1 version fixed the problem with remembering your place. Back to 5 stars! (WAS): Great paper but the 9.27 version stumbled so it doesn't remember your place after reading each article. Looking forward to a quick fix for this annoying glitch.,
I am a NYT subscriber. When I click on news links in Facebook it takes me to a blank page in the app. When I click on news articles in Google it takes me to a blank page in the app. I can only really read the news if I go directly through the app. Great articles and reporting. Wish I could say the same about their IT department,
"This used to be my go to app for news, primarily because its headline widget was on the home screen of my tablet. For some reason the widget option was removed and I am really not happy about it! I have unintentionally stopped reading the Times because of this. The Washington Post's widget is now on my home screen, but I'm not as big a fan of their writing as I am of the Times'. Disappointed by the removal of the widget.",
"Great newspaper, but the app isn't particularly navigable as far as I can see. When you're reading an article, there's no link to the homepage or other departments. If you started at the homepage, you can go back to it. But if you opened the article from another app, the back button above the article minimizes the NYT app. When you bring NYT back, it's still on the article. If you want the homepage, you have to close and restart the app.",
"What happened to night mode? Why does it have to update with the latest news every time you finish an article? Why do half the headlines take you to the horrible ""live"" section? I've subscribed to this app for over a decade and it's been good for maybe six months of that time. WHY CAN'T YOU DEVELOP A SIMPLE AND STABLE APP?!?",
"Times reporting & writing is always excellent. But huge, sticky & frequent ads greatly detract from my reading experience. Moreover the screen frequently pops & jumps as the ads load degrading the experience even more. I for one would be willing to pay more for an ad free experience.",
"Subscribing via Google Pay is A SCAM! There are so many complaints and neither NYT or Google appears to care. They are accomplices, no doubt. I'm taking this to ECC.",
"Update 4/7/19:  Even worse now.  Unbelievable that the nations ""newspaper of record"" that publishes ""all the news that's fit to print"" and supposedly recognizes all news is going digital cannot (or apparently will not) get the basics of its app working.  Constant freezes--almost certainly involved with ad placement updates..  NYT subscriber for 50 years.....  Constantly freezes on Samsung Galaxy Tab A. Has gotten worse over last few years.",
"Since the app had been redesigned so that it automatically scrolls back to the top after completing an article, it's very annoying and inconvenient. I prefer that the page remains at the spot where the article is accessed.",
I think this app is beautifully designed. The app alone was so good that I had to subscribe to NYtimes. This is one of the apps which gives sufficient emphasis on user experience. Really cool visualization and clear layout and division of sections. Cheers to the development team. Cheers guys! It is a pleasure reading NYT through this app.,
"Good paper, lousy app. I can't believe it's gotten worse over the last year instead instead of better. The constant buffering as the ads try to load makes it very hard to scroll smoothly.So frustrating! And why is there no dark theme yet?? PLEASE can't the developers look at The Guardian's excellent app & use it as a template?",
"best source of news, period.",
The app has had some struggles recently but the removal of being able to swipe to navigate across sections with the latest update is a bad UX decision in my opinion. Now one needs to tap the section name which is just a poor approach for efficient navigation in an app. Please bring back swipe navigation.,
"Used to love this app, but since the February update, it is nothing but frustrating. Can't get through an article without it freezing, stopping, and kicking back to home page. Please correct these issues or revert to the former version.",
"reliable, facts and science based news",
"Used to work, as of June 2021 does not work at all for Android, won't hook up to network but still takes your subscription money. I'll change review and keep subscription if they fix it promptly. Otherwise, buyer beware. Used to be fine. Now a problem. Also can't seem to use certain password managers which is frustrating.",
"Drains the battery and overheats the phone at an astounding rate: about 25 or 30 pct usage in 45 minutes of reading. Several complaints to NYTimes app team have not resolved the issue. The Times was my main source of news, but I have had to switch to the Guardian as a result.",
"The app is so glitchy. News notifications-you click and it takes you to the main page, not the article. If I click on an article from Facebook, instead of taking me to the article, I get a blank page. While I like NYT's content, but they need to step it up with the app.",
"The widget is great - easy to scroll through headlines quickly and decide which articles I want to read. The app itself - I wish there was a setting to make images smaller in Top Stories, or something so I could see more than one headline without having to scroll. I feel like I spend more time scrolling than reading there. The other sections are better. -Update 8/25/19: and now the widget is gone. Why would you get rid of the widget, NYT? You don't want a presence on my home screen?",
I cannot subscribe via the app without the app crashing over and over. I called Customer Care who were unable to resolve the app issue. A benefit of subscribing is being able to download articles using my home WiFi and taking my reading on the go. Without subscribing you only get a few articles to read and download until you are cutoff and asked to subscribe.,
"The app is acceptable except for the notification issues. Every morning this week I'm getting ""The Morning. Make sense of the news, every day, with David Leonha.."" notification. The .. is literal, I can't expand the notification, so no options to dismiss forever, so it keeps coming back. Not to mention the headline-to-article-link confusion. Click one headline notification, get shown a different story. If I wanted bait-and-switch I'd get my news from politicians.",
Still the best News organization on the planet with a fantastic app to go with it. My only suggestion would be to have more options for offline viewing. I'd really like the option to download everything online including video even if that may take longer. Just a suggestion.,
"The app stopped working properly a few weeks ago. It now either doesn't display any content or refreshes every few seconds, making impossible to read articles. Technical support made several recommendations to fix it, but nothing worked.",
"Love the reading material and sorry to agree with all the other reviewers who complain about app stability. Since about a month ago, the app has been crashing and freezing every few minutes if not seconds. No other apps on my phone are exhibiting this behavior, so it has to be the NYT app itself and not the OS",
"Would love to give you five stars, because you're my favourite international news source. But I have two complaints. One – the mini crossword section is no longer accessible from the app. The section link shows up, but does nothing when clicked. Two – what made you remove the widget!? It was perhaps the app's most useful feature!",
"Somebody broke the app! Was there just an update? I've noticed over the past few days that not all articles will load, and the site is constantly refreshing. Lately it's been hit or miss whether an article would load, but the number of articles I can actually read had been diminishing every day, until today, when no articles will open. I've already deleted and reinstalled the app, to no avail.",
"The steeper the climb, the greater the rewards. GO LADIES 🏟️🥅⚽",
"Scrolling is often broken. It stops in the middle of an article as if you're at the bottom of the page. Scrolling up and then down again usually fixes it but for an app centred around text articles, this is a really bad experience.",
"I feel like cancelling my subscription due to this poor app. It frequently sends alerts and when I select the alert, it shows me a different story or tells me it can't find the story and tells me to search. Tonight, they send me an alert about delayed caucus results. The alert opens an article marked Live Update that is timestamped hours ago and has nothing about the delayed results. The app is probably designed by the same people who designed Iowa's.",
"Note all the recent negative reviews. I'll click a link and I'll see something I read previously. Sometimes I'll get a blank page. I tried canceling my trial subscription as it doubled in price to $16 a month but had to run a gauntlet of redirects (you have to cancel by phone) before I spoke to someone who of course said I could renew for a year at the trial rate. If things don't improve soon with this app, I will probably spend a half-hour to an hour trying to cancel my subscription again.",
"Long time NYT reader. Recent app releases have slowed content loading to a crawl. Taking minutes to load a normal story on a regular basis. NYT the news outlet is great. This app is not working anymore for all intents and purposes. If you want to compete against Facebook and Apple News as primary mobile news streams, you must fix this app.",
"I don't mind the ads on feed, but videos have 30seconds unskippable ads even for a 2 minute length video which ruins my video experience and force me to never want to open another video. The news are good quality though. Edit: The app is also buggy. It takes a while to register a click sometime.",
"Very easy navigating, never glitchy. Most articles are offered in more than one link. I do miss the old ""widget,"" which showed only headlines. 😪 Every section of the print newspaper is cross-referenced in a dedicated tab called, what else, ""sections."" And order up your own curated content in the tab section ""For You."" (Cooking, Wellness, Dance, whatever.) NYT responds to email requests, suggestions and complaints, too!",
"I love the Times and will continue to subscribe. But the ads are getting WAY too big and frequent for a service I'm already paying a lot for. I don't complain about free apps with ads, nor about paying for an ad-free app. But I think the NYT is going over the top.",
"I constantly get notifications for articles that I want to read, but just get taken to the main headlines of the app when I click them. When I use the search article function of the app, it's a 50/50 shot of whether I'll be able to find it or not. I love NYT, but the app makes it very hard to follow the news",
have used it before and is very impressive although it is the New York times with an excellent rep. app is only for the newspaper itself.... which is not a problem if your not doing critical thinking and need to see different newspapers to get your own thoughts on a story.....to see some other opinion even if partially biased. Very good work now especially.,
Edit: Almost a month after my original review I still can't get the articles to load. Dropped to 1 star. This app is a disappointment and the adds are disruptive. Original: Since the latest update the articles won't load. I enjoy reading your articles I do not want to give this app a bad review but this is not the first time an update has caused this issue. Many of your paying readers are unable to use the service and for some of us this is the only reliable source of news we can afford. Ty!,
"This apps has been around for many years and it still doesn't work right. The experience for offline reading is simply horrible. I wish NYTimes would invest a bit more on this app, as the app is putting me off reading this valuable source of news. The BBC app works perfectly offline and yet its content is free.",
"NYT sets the standard for journalistic excellence and interesting quality content. I read at least one thought provoking article every single day, with a good mix of topics and light hearded or serious options. The app is also very nice and we'll laid out, and the subscription coat is very reasonable. Full marks on every front.",
"Don't bother with the app. 90% of articles are unviewable unless you have a subscription (which is £50 a year). Newspapers are a public service so I don't really understand why they do this, especially when most of us don't mind adverts. I do enjoy their journalism, but the fact most articles are unviewable becomes tiresome, especially with the invasive popup asking you to subscribe after you begin reading.",
"Ya'll think you could design an app that actually pulls a story up from my notifications? Don't care to sift through other stories to find the story of interest to me from your notification. Otherwise I'll just turn notifications off, then eventually cancel because I don't use it. Your call... I know the loss of two bucks a month will devastate your economy...",
"I gladly pay a monthly NYT subscription fee, but have been locked out of the app for weeks. Every time I click an article I'm prompted to subscribe or create an account, but once I log in the paywall pops up and blocks me from viewing articles. I've un/reinstalled the app, changed my password, etc., but to no avail. Good journalism, awful app.",
"Good, but where's the widget? Most news apps have widgets that will give you the news headlines on your home screen without having to open the app. Furthermore, these apps are free. While the NYT is a free app, you have to subscribe to get unlimited articles. As a subscriber, I expect to be able to get what I can in a free app on a subscription-based app and more. They had a widget but removed it without explaining why. I'll stop my subscription unless they bring back the widget. It's stupid.",
"Great, except for the extremely annoying bug that notifications often open up the wrong article, or no article at all. I've been poking the support team about this for 9 months now, and there's been no progress. Please fix!!!",
"Borderline unusable. Disabling video autoplay does not work, this plus articles riddled with animated ads makes for a very distracted reading experience. Makes *very* heavy use of CPU, storage and battery. PLEASE provide an option for NON-video ads and content only. Worst app on my device.",
"WTH! Scroll/position bar was removed again. Recent update removed the scroll bar showing where you are in an article. Now impossible to see if article goes on and on (some do) v.s. almost read to the end. I now only read first few paragraphs, 'cause there's no way to tell how long it goes on. Bring back the scroll bar!",
"Excellent app. Negatives / changes I'm waiting for are: 1) home page constantly refreshes and you can lose your spot; and 2) right hand scroll indicator is gone, so it's impossible to know how long an article is and how far you are through it.",
"Wow, you updated the app and broke it. Slooooooow. Doesn't load half the graphics. Mini crossword doesn't work. Maybe you should stop charging subscription fee until you fix it..... Used to use it several times a day. Now it's just a source of frustration. When you're update takes you from five stars to two that tells you something isn't right.",
The new UI is terrible. It forces you to select sections to acces a new section. And always go through it to navigate between them. Please bring back the old favorites tab at the top. It was way easier to navigate in the app.,
"CONSTANTLY throws you out of the article you are reading, as it updates the site. Tried every possible setting to stop updating, to no avail. Also crashes frequently. Customer support is nonresponsive. In short, it sucks.",
"I have enjoyed the NYT for many, many years up until recently. Unfortunately, I will be unsubscribing because the app and website has become harder and harder to use with the accessibility software I require. As a blind person, I have no use for a subscription I cannot fully access. Farewell, NYTimes.",
"I really love The New York Times. I really like the app. I get annoyed over one tiny, stupid thing - the Wordle streak randomly resets to 0 even though I do it daily and have never not gotten it.",
"Hoping the low review will get some programmer's attention: the app constantly gives me notifications for stories that look interesting, but then when I click on the notification just takes me to the front page, where it is usually impossible to find the story that made me click the notification. Did nobody ever actually test clicking on notifications?",
"I like some aspects of the app. I don't like the constant scrambling updates. If I get interrupted in the middle of an article, the app boots me back to the lineup. I also dislike that I keep getting signed out of NYT browser pages but finding older articles on the app is a nightmare.",
"The app looks and navigates great, when it works at all. It constantly finds new ways to break, though, to the point I've nearly given up on it as a paying subscriber. Utterly inexcusable, most of all for a mainstream news organization as stable and well funded as NYT.",
"The latest update has problems! Revert to the previous version till you fix it, NYTimes. The games display with the.lower part of the.keyboard chopped off. Perhaps NYTimes is not aware that the current version of Android now does not allow for an.easy way to hide the action bar. Crappy update.",
"There is too much spam info and articles. NYT should not only adapt what it was a News Journal but it should explore new possibilities in a improving its digital platform. In my 10 months of subscription there was only one article that I considered amazing. I don't recommend this source; additionally, it's full of left democrat bias, which I don't find bad, but they should always contrast with the right perspective to make an balanced article.",
"Please bring back the top sections that you could scroll through. The new fromat is harder to access and more time consuming. Some notifications on android are buggy in that the first sentence appears for one article, but if you scroll down on it, another one pops up. Thanks!",
Great app and quality journalism!,
"App is a good start but has room for improvement. I love when scrolling thru is interactive with the the content; its a nice touch. Wishlist: (1) morning brief should be available at the top of the page in the morning hours, and similarly the evening brief in the evening hours. (2) i want to pick what news i get notifications for (ex: turn off stocks, sports). (3) ""for you"" tab should let me pick categories the first time/for set up, but then just show me articles from those selections.",
"Overall I've been enjoying this app, but after the most recent update I've been receiving excessive background data use warnings every day, even when the app is not open. The first day after the update it used 2.25 gb of data! And I only read one article and had the app in use for about 8 minutes.",
"The reporting is superb. The app itself however annoys me. In particular, stories embedded in longer threads, like elections or coronavirus, redirect and load poorly and slowly, need two ""back"" to return to the original link, and sometimes don't even load properly.",
"I am overall pleased with the app, using it for many years. About 6 months ago DARK MODE was removed ""to be updated. I have contacted the developers twice, who assured me an update was forthcoming. For some of us with visual issues, the dark mode is essential. The developer needs to make the option avaliable asap. Thanks",
"Putting news content aside, this is a very difficult subscription to manage. I paused it once successfully and when I tried to again I was told by customer service the option is always there - they don't know when or why it goes away. Due to this I cancelled my subscription of course but couldn't even get a refund (on the day it resumed that I contacted them bc of their own problems!).",
"A truly crummy app for a great publication. Regularly chokes up, truncating articles half way through, then cannot load articles at all. Several times a week needs to have all memory wiped out, then deluges notifications. Despite being a paid subscription, has distracting video ads that autoplay and suck data. Really, just get the newsprint and donate the paper to your local Humane society after you have read it. Much less frustrating.",
"Without fail, every time I click on the push notification for a new article, the app just takes me to the home screen. Never to the actual article from the notification, forcing me to dig through all of the stories myself. Terrible user experience, not convenient at all",
"As others have written recently, the app is slow to load, does not refresh to the latest content on its own (have to swipe down), reloads articles while reading them thus losing my place, and most of the time the comments are unavailable. And even when they are, the replies to comments are not threaded with the associated comments thus making it impossible to read conversations as a related series of posts. The app had this feature some years ago but it was removed with a major ""update"". Sigh...",
"Where did widgets go? Why get rid of a feature that was so useful? I was fine with occasional articles not loading and the app crashing, but removing widgets only serves to further distance us from regular browsing of the content. ** Just updated the app again, hoping they'd bring back the widget, but that was apparently optimistic. Also realized I haven't opened the app on my phone once since they removed the widget.",
"This app worked so wonderfully well but has recently become hot garbage. Notifications lead to the wrong stories and upon opening the app, I am bombarded by notifications that seem to have been withheld. Not to mention the ads. I only read on my phone so this is enough for me to cancel my subscription and give WaPo and their app a try",
"Reliable, trustworthy news based on facts. NYT will sometimes reference other reliable sources such as Reuters and The Washington Post. Not opinionated propaganda like Fox News. Newly, updated app has a long list of section titles, inclusive settings such as select font size, excellent book reviews, crossword and other puzzles. App is easy to navigate.",
"While I've been generally happy to get my NYT ones by app. It seems to have some bugs. Often when starting up, the current day doesn't come up. Today I'm looking at Top Stories section and enter n I tap on any to read more it bounces back to the original screen. Very annoying.",
"Did the last update break something? Was stuck on previous day's news with false notice that I was offline. Reinstalled app; it opened once with current news but now it won't open at all with repeated crash notices. UPDATE 06/04: bugs appear to be fixed. UPDATE 06/08: just like that, back to broken the same way it was, originally.",
I enjoy the content of the NYT and subscribe to their online only edition but may cancel because there are way too many distracting ads. It's almost one after each paragraph and some even autoplay video or animation. Will developers one more month to make changes or I'll be switching to another news outlet.,
"After the recent updates this app will often not load articles and, if it does, it takes a long time. I have had to ""Force Stop"" the app in the settings to try to get my phone back to regular speed(it worked). Not recommended. Good luck trying to cancel, their ""advocates"" will keep you waiting for a long time",
"I'm not sure what is happening with this app. No stories will load through push notifications or Facebook. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Cleared app cache and data, also cleared cache and data for Facebook and still not working. Very frustrating. And I am a digital subscriber!🤬",
"Paid Subscription still limited article views. Purchased a monthly sub from Google Play and when linking the account was hit with a pay wall. After 5 links, I was asked to 'subscribe' again. Cancelled the subscription now but still required to pay the first months cost. Unable to view any articles despite paying for it. The subscription integration needs to be fixed.",
"As noted elsewhere, for some ill-conceived reason, the font size adjustment has disappeared. Fonts everywhere else on my phone are larger, so when I use the phone's universal font setting to enlarge text, it simply makes nytimes text barely larger, and everything else huge. I have never seen such a stupid backwards move on basic app functionality. The Guardian, Financial Times and BBC News apps all offer a font adjustment option. Restore font size adjustment.",
"Half the time when clicking on an article, I am taken to a completely different article. This happens both in the app and from notifications. Please fix this. This is still happening even after a couple months. Seriously? You guys can't figure out how to program links?",
"It worked well for a couple of years. Now articles don't download. If they do, they stop letting me scroll down. If I can scroll, I'm only able to read a few paragraphs and after scrolling, the rest of the article is missing. I uninstalled/ reinstalled, but that didn't make a difference. Really disappointed.",
"I'd like a view of unconventional articles. Selection of deeper reported articles, off beat subjects, international but not Britain or US centric but more about view points from outside America that tell me about the world beyond our perspective on it. Recently NYT had a podcast about evictions that was new to me, that had emotional impact, and felt important. I want those articles to be collected and easier to find.",
They recently changed the app. The new version sucks for tablet users. You used to be able to have favorite sections that you swipe through. Now there is a tedious process to switch sections and you have no preferences. They destroyed the experience.,
"I purchased a subscription through Google play, after my free trial expired my card was charged for the subscription, however neither the app or NYTimes desktop site would recognize me as a subscriber... TWO hours spent on the phone with both Google and the Times only to have the 2 parties point fingers at each other. Long story short, subscription is canceled and NEITHER the Times or Google will give me a refund (will dispute CC charge). Not sure who to blame here, but, buyer BEWARE.",
"Taps on external links and notifications often open the app to an error page. When connectivity is lost, it dumps you out of the article you're reading. This app is impossibly bad for the high reputation the New York Times has. Edit: Lowering my rating to 1 star now. This app is atrocious and unfortunately, shows no sign of improvement. I'm uninstalling it in favor of the mobile web.",
They seem to want to simplify the app but in doing so broke many things. It chews through phone battery and push notifications no longer lead to articles. The recent update made it harder to find New York Times content. Not sure what they were thinking.,
The app is ok. There's a number of articles where NYTIMES will add special effects or animations. These articles will glitch often resulting in a poor scrolling experience. I've opted to reading the times on the mobile browser. The special-effects/animations seem to work seamlessly there.,
"It used to be a great app. In the past 6 months, articles linked from facebook and even my phone's notifications simply don't load. Great content, but it means nothing if the articles simply don't load. Please sort this out, it's been many months.",
"New app update and ads are real shite. Totally overbuilt for more ads, not more news! Totally brought down the speed compared to the old app and the ads now dance around on the screen as you scroll. I recommend using a browser instead. They are faster and they can collect way less personal data (better privacy).",
Nothing against the contents but unfortunately the app somehow manages not only to become super-slow itself but also make the whole OS unresponsive until I kill it. Also pretty much every time I open the app it fails to render any contents (I'll just see a white page with headers only) and I'd have to kill and restart the app.,
"Shoving all content except top news to a separate section of the app hides the poor navigation experience of this developer. Still unable to properly link to an article from notifications, plus who hides search in 'Sections' instead of 'Today' where the app opens? At least the app has cleared the hurdle from completely unusable to minimally usable; frustrating as the location that ends with double hockey sticks. So disappointing.. app experience is the worst of any newspaper.",
"Just 2 or 3 days ago, after Android OS update, the crossword puzzles become unusable. The last row of the keyboard is not showing, so I can't type in the answers. I suspect the same problem with the keyboard display in general. Can you please fix it. Thanks",
"I get alerts for interesting stories and click on them only to be brought to the full NYTimes instead of the specific story I was interested in. This leaves me basically sifting through the entire paper instead of linking directly to what brought me there in the first place. Very annoying, considering cancelling my subscription.",
"It's the Nation's Paper of Record. What more could I say? App functionality is very clean for me but we have a subscription, so unlimited +cooking+puzzles, etc.. On a guest login it gets frustrating when you find something amazing only to discover you are out of articles. But no matter, it still gets five stars.",
THEY FINALLY ADDED A DARK MODE!!! Sorry but still -1 stars for it taking soooooo long to invert black and white...,
"Okay app, but not dependable; all too frequently fails to load an article while popping up a message, ""Device is offline, blah, blah, blah"" when device is demonstrably online. After several complaints about this the NYT app have not fixed it. When it's working it works well.",
reading the Times is essential to living a good life ✨️ 😌,
"They just shifted into night mode and there is no way to turn it off without turning it off for my whole phone. It's super hard to read the news in white text. Their spelling bee game has been broken for over 4 months. My last email about it got a snippy response, but I pay extra for games",
"Great Content, Annoying Tech. As many have commented, NYTimes app is poorly engineered, with laggy ad loading and willy-nilly autorefreshing that hangs the app, hides articles you were about to click and even breaks internal links to wrong article or no article. Sections are arbitrary with many hidden corners not indexed. How much of my subscription dollars are used for such a weak product? BTW not a FREE app, subscription required, false advertising.",
"Great journalism, terrible app. There are FAR TOO MANY ads that freeze up the screen, cover content, and jump to the link when you try to swipe past them. It's so frustrating when trying to read an article. I uninstalled the app and read it on a browser with adblocker.",
They broke night mode and navigation is more broken than ever. Touch nav is jumpy and when you leave an article it takes you back to the top of the main page instead of back to where you were. Can't believe how much we pay for NYT to get such a poor app experience.,
"I love the NY Times but this app has been useless since my phone updated to Android 9. When I click on news alerts, 90% of the time I get ""Article not found"" so I'm going to turn off alerts (I also have WaPo which often has the same stories) Also, when my phone is in ""Night Mode"" stories that do load are dark gray text on black, so basically unreadable.",
"I am a futurist. My colleagues may laugh at me, but I believe that the New York Times brings knowledge to me that I could not not have dreamed of in my wildest flights of phantasy. While I still read articles in print for a reason, the digital copy of the piece on the Corona program just knocked the wind out of me... in a good way. Thank you for redefining learning, knowledge and curiosity for the digital age, @nytimes! No, wait, I meant: !!!",
"For LOVE of GOD if you send me a push notification teasing a specific article, clicking on it should bring me to THAT article. Not your front page. I keep getting notifications about interesting headlines, clicking on them, and then ending up at the apps homepage unable to find the article I wanted to read. This. Is. Infuriating.",
"The app notifications were bit much, annoying me to the point of reminding me I should cancel the subscription. Be warned before you subscribe - they force you to cancel by phone, text, or chat. Tried text first. Got several bot apologies about the wait time. Literally 18 hours later a rep responded. Abandoned that and switched to Chat-based cancel. That only took about five minutes, but I had to spend some energy saying ""YES I'M SURE PLEASE CANCEL NOW"" to a rep whose been trained to hard-sell me into staying active. Cancelling my cable TV was easier.",
"Content is great, of course, but there are so many glitches in the android version of the app. Recently and most vexingly, when expanding notifications they all show the same headline, making it impossible to choose that choice bit of news you just saw a reference to.",
"Content is excellent. Compared to other news apps though, this one is not user friendly. Bookmarking feature is horrible. Try to make it too high end and it misses the mark. Luckily most of the content feeds though to other sources.",
"If you enjoy receiving news articles daily that are aligned with your personal interests and views, then this is an amazing app! I love the fact I can download offline copies to my Drive to read later when I'm in transit, ect. The New York Times remains a timeless place to stay abreast of current events. I highly recommend it!",
"Paid for subscription, got confirmation of the payment. Logged in via Google. Subscription not recognized. Changed password, subscription still not recognized. Submitted assistance request. Awaiting response. This was the reason I unsubscribed a year ago (double billing for non accessible app) and thought Id try agin. Needs a certified user-focused UX team to redesign for easier subscription logging.",
"NYT really needs to advance into the 21st century by providing a ""dark mode"" option. They're struggling in readership so they should make the interface more friendly toward the readers. The content is great but the stark bright white pages are literally an eyesore.",
"Everything the other users are saying: notifications take you to the main page instead of the proper story, expanding notifications fills in text from a different story entirely, and clicking on any link from fb brings me to a blank white page. Pathetic that a professional service I pay for has an app which is continually this broken.",
"A good news app needs two things, in addition to being simply legible: a share button, and a search bar. On this app, the former is mostly unavailable, even though serious searches will reveal one occasionally. As for the latter? Ancient manuscripts reveal that a human sacrifice will reveal one, provided one has a PhD in computer sciences. Is the Newspaper of Record trying hard to ensure the hoi polloi can't use it?",
"The app is not very comfortable to use. When reading an article and changing the scrolling direction, the window scrolls to another place uncontrollably which is super annoying. When I go back to an unfinished article I have to scroll back and find the location where Ieft the last time, which can happen if the article is long.",
"This review is of the app itself. I pay for a prescription because the NYT are the best in the game for content. But this app is absolute garbage for actually making that content available. Push notifications are inconsistent but the worst is when I do get a notification and I tap on it to load the article, it simply doesn't. I have to clear cache and close all apps and then go to the app to try to find the article, and then sometimes can't. I shouldn't have to work that hard to read content I pay for and if it continues, my subscription will be cancelled and this app deleted. Honestly, NYT should be embarrassed by this app, and the other recent reviews appear to agree.",
"The new update has screwed up my single most used feature: the save for later tab. Now when I open the tab to look at saved articles, I get a never-ending loading wheel. At first I thought it was a poor data connection, but it's been days since the update, and I've never successfully loaded that page.",
"One of the top 3 newspapers in the USA, without doubt. if you like crosswords or other word puzzles; that subscription is a much better war to keep your mind sharp than looking at social media or any instagratify. The only dissatisfaction with the app is have to login into the nycom website to use it everybtime.",
"This app keeps billing me while asking to subscribe and closing off articles after reaching my monthly limit (as I pay there shouldn't be one actually). I would like to keep reading the paper, wrote to customer service but they are unable to help and say the problem is getting the app via Google playstore. I can't even cancel my subscription through the help desk. So I uninstalled the app and hope they will now stop withdrawing further monthly payments without me having to write any more on this.",
"Lack of a dark mode has been a long- time issue (patience is wearing thin at this point). Hence the 3-star rating. Layout & performance otherwise is fine. As an independent, I'd prefer more balanced reporting on, especially, issues that impact politics.",
"For a while, they had fixed whatever it is about the app that causes my battery to heat up, but the August 20 update screwed that up - hot battery is back. I can't do the crossword - the bottom row of my keypad is off the screen. What gives? The ads popping up everywhere - I know you need the revenue, but gees.",
"there are no simple certain answers. life is complex and often difficult. beware those who offer an easy way, a one way only.",
"App is generally excellent, though a recent update removed the ability to swipe left/right to switch sections (similar to swiping while in an article). Really, really miss this feature and not sure why it vanished - please bring it back! Edit: After a month with no response (to either this review or the android@nyt email), I'm docking another star. Still one of my favorite news sources but needing to use two hands to switch categories is a pain.",
"This app randomly refreshes articles and scrolls them to the top while you're reading. The mid-article ads load and reload while you're reading, causing the article to jump up and down which disrupts smooth reading. Overall unsatisfactory reading experience, despite the otherwise good reporting and articles.",
"Bait and switch notifications. Infuriating. It puts a pile of notifications up with snippets or headlines of stories, but if you tap on any of them it does NOT open the app to the story, it just opens to the main app feed and in many cases the story I was interested is nowhere to be found.",
"The NYT app keeps me up to date on everything, everywhere!",
"This is just a bug report: my Moto 5g UW's screen becomes unresponsive if I have one article open and any other article gets posted or edited. I then have to cycle the screen on and off a few times until touch inputs are accepted, then I can unlock my screen, and your app loses my place in the article and kicks me to the 'home' screen in your app. Not app related, but your reporting on the American West, particularly the intermountain west leaves much to be desired.",
No more night mode. Night mode was great for catching up on the news when I went to bed. Not happening anymore since they removed it and I don't need to sear my eyes with bright white everywhere when getting ready for bed. Put it back!,
"Negative: There's no search function & no word tagging system. This takes fun away from the reading experience! Seriously! Positive: App reopens the same article that was on before. Reading experience is good (Font/spacing, line space). Bookmarking/Recently viewed tabs are useful too.",
"Constantly asks me to log in, tells me I've run out of free articles for the month (even though I have a paid subscription), and tells me I need a subscription to read offline. I log back in, read half an article before it randomly revokes my access, lather, rinse, repeat. I'd hate to have to end my support for the quality journalism that is the NY Times, but new bugs with this app have really been testing my patience these past few months. The app used to work great. Please fix it!",
"Good app overall, but it's annoying that when a story appears in your notifications and you click it, it takes you to the homepage instead of that story. Then it's difficult, if not impossible to find that particular article.",
OFFLINE READING FEATURE IS USELESS. The app offline download entirely does not work. This is new York times and I'm a new Yorker despite refresh several and selecting download articles most articles do not work unless u have internet despite loading way before I get on train. The app has worked this way for several months. Very frustrating for something i pay monthly for,
"Good if you want to see real-time news only, or want to browse the 39 sections for an interesting article. The app doesn't have a search feature if you wanted to look up an article from yesterday or earlier. I appreciate that the app does have dark mode!",
"Use the app on my phone and love that version. On my Chromebook, the appearance of the home page is small and not sizable on my touchscreen. Hard to read. Don't like the Chrome version. News content, as always, is exceptional.",
Every update removes functionality that is useful. If you have installed the app and you like it: don't ever upgrade! Also soooo many animated ads. Not only are the ads annoying to look at they load after the article and then push content off the screen. I pay more for my subscription than advertisers do for their ad placement (NYT publishes their revenue numbers) so why am I getting a degraded quality product?,
"A good app overall, though there are too many intrusive ads for subscribers. Updates in the first part of 2019 caused many bad problems including daily app crashes/restarts and articles not loading when selected. Problems were eventually fixed in Q2 2019, but took a long time and a lot of complaining from the community. Hopefully they will be more responsive in the future.",
"The NYT is awesome but the app is absolutely not. 1. Finding stuff (again) is difficult 2. After removing inconsistent dark mode, the solution now is no dark mode at all!?? 3. I have the latest snapdragon with 12 TB ram, yet the maps and animated stories are buggy, if they work at all. 0 stars for app, 5 for nyt content...",
"Impossible to search for articles, and when you get notifications, expanding the notification will change the article you get when clicking thr notification. This makes it impossible to read full headlines of some articles, and has been more of a problem recently.",
"Latest: a 'crossword' ad for TUMI causes the focus to scroll to the ad when it appears, even if it's halfway through the articles. I then have to scroll back to where I was reading. The crossword in the ad is buggy also! App is sluggish and glitchy, redrawing/reloading content after finishing articles, or displaying a blank screen with a never-ending spinning cursor. Horizontal sliding lists of articles are virtually impossible to control, not to mention hiding content.",
"Similar issues to other customers; app botched up paid Subscription & still only able to view limited articles. There appears to be no way to fix the issue. Great idea, but their app designer is seriously dropping the ball. Somewhere. Uninstalling/Reinstalling. Maybe that will fix the problem 🤦🏼‍♀️ Edit update: uninstalling/reinstalling did Not fix it. It's still stuck saying my order is pending and will be available soon. 30 minutes later.",
"Awful! This update cannot go away fast enough. It doesn't open, crashes immediately. I've been contacting the customer care people for 4 weeks, get the same boilerplate response--update the app, your OS might be old, etc., when their own report shows the current update and OS. Why did they get rid of the nighttime mode? Ugh. I've been a subscriber for 11 years, guess they don't care!",
"App does not show notifications until I open it, then it floods the phone with scores of notifications all at once. When I click on a notification, it takes me to the home page instead of the article/notification that I clicked on. Android, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",
"I had the app for three years. Loved it. Then I had such trouble getting it to renew my subscription this year that I stopped trying and cancelled it entirely. In addition anyone who comments that cancelling the subscription, as an international customer is very difficult, is telling the truth. Non existent customer service.",
"NY Times coverage of news around the world is not only interesting and thought-provoking but arrives digitally on my phone. It is great to read good journalistic articles by investigative reporters. And I always search through the editorial/opinion articles, reading both those I agree with and those I don't, thinking about their viewpoints. And Tom Frieman's articles are always the first I read. Jefferson said a free press is vital to a democratic society. So true and needed today.",
"Two huge issues with the app: Latency got awful and developers have done little to fix it. I just stare at a white screen while the app is loading. In Oct 2019, they put a permanent ""news alert"" at the top of the app, which you cannot remove, for the 2020 elections. I can't believe they want us to live like that for a year. It even has a nagging reminder of how many unread 2020 election updates you have. NYT has decided to follow Facebook and try to force people to engage w meaningless content",
Recently this app has become unusable. The app loads so I see the headlines but articles fail to load. I get the loading symbol without the article actually loading. - even if I leave it for 5 minutes. I have had to go back to reading the NYT on a windows tablet. I am a paid subscriber.,
"There is simply no coverage of the country, and the world, that matches that of the Times. While I find many of the Top stories on SmartNews interesting, the online renderings of the Times and the Washington Post, provide me with the majority of the news (other than that in Tulsa and Oklahoma) I find both interesting and useful.",
"The app freezes, preventing the reader from scrolling through and reading the articles. This is frustrating beyond belief. As much as I enjoy the content when I can actually read an article, I'm cancelling. I cannot find Wordle in the Games Section. I thought it was purchased by The Times and should ne availanbe.",
"The bug was fixed for a few weeks but now it's back. I love the NY Times content, but the app needs attention. Latest update broke crosswords (half a keyboard), spelling bee (letter repeats endlessly & you have to quit the app to stop). Did you do any testing??",
"Feels very clunky compared to other news apps, The Guardian in particular. Loads slowly and awkwardly, takes you back to places you didnt want to be at and really difficult to navigate the live news sections. Oh and for God's sake get a night/dark mode set up!",
"Too slow and unreliable and glitchy. Inefficient: A far worse experience than a web browser, and there is no attempt at tabs or an equivalent. WaPo's app allows story to story navigation, yours does not. No way to copy/paste text from a story.",
"The New York Times app does not have a clear way to cancel a digital subscription. Despite having a manage subscription section, no conclusive cancellation option is available. I believe it is purposely designed to be difficult for the consumer, in order to trap them with a monthly subscription of approx $15. Calling NYT directly was also unsuccessful -- was told to call Google Play to cancel Be careful w/ this app. Google has been notified of these evasive and potentially unlawful methods",
"New York Times is an intelligent outlet of world affairs and national interests. It covers almost all sources of convenient truth: science, technology, literature and daily happenings. It's readable, comprehensible and enjoyable. I measured the fog index of the NYT, and have found that it is so, for its fog index of 10 is the best: it's not a text book and it's not a gossip magazine. New York Times is an excellent example of today's source of needed info.",
"I love the experienced journalism that I see in these news articles. My only gripe is that, as on the website too, there are ads even though I have a subscription (All Digital Access). That being said, that might be because the subscriptions are very affordable (at least for the first year) for me as I am a teenager paying for this myself. Anyways, I love the NYTimes, Games, and Cooking. Check 'em out! Not sponsored in any way.",
"Slow, laggy, buggy. Was good a year ago, since then is a pain to use on all phones I've tried. Focus on giving us articles, not podcasts and immersive media. Recently the main section disappears after loading! I uninstalled and now use a browser to read.",
"The misrepresentation of facts is too frequent The app, like the website, seems to want to direct everyone to the subscription page. I can't ever just open article links because it'll redirect to the subscription page to ensure I'm subscribed, then just redirect me to the main page. I guess I didn't want to read the article I was linked to. They also don't allow the viewing of coronavirus articles without an account. Hire some better web developers while you're hiring some better journalists.",
"I hold The NYT's journalistic standards, & record for accuracy in their reporting, in high regard. Esp. so, when it comes to reporters' determination to keep a neutral stance, concerning political commentary. With any high profile news source, there will be an occasional error, as it is an unavoidable part of journalism. It is in those times, that we learn who the true professionals of the industry are. Quickly acknowledging & correcting a mistake is a cornerstone in professional journalism. 5⭐",
"the NYT has great information and thoughtful pieces. the app makes it easy to view them and brings relevant articles to your attention. the only issue is that occasionally you will hit a notification and it will not bring you to the actual article you were interested in, instead just bringing you the home page",
"Please please fix your notifications. I get a long list of them and clicking on one in the middle doesn't actually take me to the article from the notification. It's incredibly irritating. Love the quality of journalism, just fix notifications.",
"I've had a Times subscription for about three years now and I'm so grateful for it. As for the app, well I'm still getting used to the new layout but once you think about it, things are logically arranged. The dark theme is a nice option, and I like being able to download all stories offline when I go off the grid.",
"You know what I love? Getting push notifications for a story, going to that story and exiting out, and then never being able to find that story again, ever. This app is FANTASTIC at dumb stuff like that. Also, half the time you click a push notification with an interesting headline, it takes you to some other story and you can't find any evidence the headline in question ever existed.",
"Great content but the app needs work. It's 2022, why is it still impossible to view video in landscape mode in Android? What happened to the Dark Mode option? There needs to be home button, pressing back takes you back through every page you visited, often forcing me to reload the app. Please address",
"This app is ok for reading the main stories and playing Wordle, but my ""For You"" section seems to have a buggy algorithm and fails to show me any personalized recommendations. It only shows me articles from the Food section, which I barely read. Also, the developers should make Saved Articles and the Search function easier to find.",
"Lies. Your push this app as free. Well, of course, who's software isn't free, to enable you to pay them. You immediately start pimping your subscription, and counting down very few ""free"" stories. Of course they're not free, because you're pushing ads through them too. There's nothing wrong with charging for a product. But don't prominently call it ""free"", then immediately hold your hand out. At least wait until the honeymoon is over.",
I really loved the app for access to a few headlines but If you show me the headline let me reaf the article! If I wanted full access I would not mind paying the subscription but that is not what I want so I gave the app 2 stars because almost everytime I clicked on a notification from them I was taken to a site to subscribe in order to access content 😒,
"Insightful reporting; always on the ""scenes"" that matter providing perspectives not found elsewhere. I don't have to agree with said perspectives and yet still have access to the crosswords and other games and quizzes that help keep me sharp at 73 . . . I think.",
Been using it for several years. Lately I've noticed that in some cases it won't let me read the end of an article because it insists on scrolling to the bottom of the screen where there is an Ad-Click advertisement. Very frustrating.,
"Tried to bill me twice. I paid for a subscription in Google Play and had subscribed since 2017 which was still active, but the app suddenly started asking me to register and pay, blocking access to articles. So I have cancelled my subscription and uninstalled the app. Time for a Washington Post subscription instead I think.",
I am really upset. I have been a digital NYT subscriber for years and used to love this app. But for the last month or so I have NOT been able to read any of the Comments secrions. I have reported the issue at least one week ago and there is still no resolution. How hard can it be to fix this? It's been working for years now all of a sudden doesn't any more? Please het thia fixed!,
"This is worst app. Everyday i had to reinstall after i read each article. I got help after numerous messages. 1-20-21 App still wont stay on, my phone is fine (every other news app). I still have the same problem. No one has fixed this although i let them know its not fixed and i have to uninstall/reinstall. Same 2-13-21. 2-19, App has worked ok for 3 dys. Then stopped. 3-22-21 problem ongoing reinstalling app after every artcl. Im done. The ap takes too long to reinstall. 4-2 nit openg no help",
I pay extra for the Games and the only ones that work are the Crosswords. The Tiles game only has about 5 games that they recycle through over and over. The Spelling Bee goes crazy sometimes and starts spewing out letters randomly. The Vertex won't allow me to connect the points. I do not recommend!,
"I often get alerts for a news article. Upon clicking the alert, the app opens but to a different article. I suspect it's taking me to the latest news as opposed the one I clicked on. Either way it's useless.",
"What a wonderful news app. Since years I have tried so many apps and none of them come close to how good this one is. Not CNN, not Google News, none of them are good. They all have the same limited variety of news, shallow and tedious. While your app is wonderfully fresh with a wide variety of topics and opinions. And the overall app design and functionality is super modern and nice. Thank you.",
Bad engineering meets good journalism. Crashes at least 5 times a day ! Very poorly built app. When you tap on the edit sections button it crashes. And then it crashes every now and then. Redefines bad engineering. Much worse experience than the previous app. This update has made the reading experience really poor.,
Frustrating...I paid for a digital subscription & kept getting notifications saying I was still unsubscribed despite having already been billed. It was only after I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app that I was able to access the articles I paid for. That is unacceptable for such a famous brand as the NYT... Tip: 1) invest in app developers who know what they're doing 2) make unsubscribing easier (you can't even do it in the app) 3) professionally respond to negative reviews!,
"This is an edit of an earlier 5* review I did in 12/2020. I have been happpy using the app on an Android 8 mobile since then until recently. I discovered that the app, now version 9.61.0 installed 5/3/22 has been using up far too much of the resources on my mobile. Apparently using 50% of battery even if the app is not in active use, and had accumulated about 850 MB of data. Clearing the data, stopping the app and switching over to a direct interface with Chrome eliminated the problem.",
"Every time you go back to the front page from an article, the app will try to reload content and you have to wait for it to load, this throw you off balance, making you have to retrack where you were on the front page No dark mode Can't see a list or delete which sections contribute to the 'for you' section I guess Apple users are more important than the Android plebs to the nyt",
I hate & like this app at the same time. One minute there seems to be all kinds of articles you want to read. But then the next I notice I don't use it forever. Sure enough as soon as I stop paying for it because it don't seem worth it articles will start popping up that you want to read and then you'll start using subscription again and then it's like they fall off map I don't know,
"Overall all, good app, but the push notifications don't work correctly. I'll get a notification for an article that looks interesting, and when I click on it, it opens something completely different.",
"The New York Times is far better than any news paper I've ever digitally subscribed to. Your monthly prices - which I have been receiving for nearly two years, are awesome - and your customer service staff always is always able to answer any questions that I may have in regards to questions that I may have about anything published, in regards to my daily digital subscription. Your news teams are ""on everything important"" in our world and no one else can compare to you!",
The content is great. A To bad you can't read it without a web browser. This is the absolute worst app I have. It crashes constantly. I mean every 3-4 minutes. It's awful. How can a major news source put this garbage out? Awful.,
1. I have a subscription through someone else that it stopped recognizing even when I'm logged in with the right email. AND 2. It now plays LOUD commercials upon opening the app and there's no way to stop it. I went even be using it as a free version anymore.,
"The app frequently freezes when I scroll past ads. The content and organization are getting is, but the s makes my reading experience very frustrating. I'm a long-term NYT subscriber and recent convert from IOS to Android, and this issue is new to me.",
"Does it's job allowing me to read NYT articles. But there are a few issues: - There are too many ""Breaking News"" notifications for NYC news. I don't care about NYC politics as I don't live there, so those notifications should be a separate category. - The ""For You"" section doesn't actually contain articles from any of the topics I selected to follow",
"It sends a lot of push notifications. I usually ignore them, but on occasion they seem worth reading, so I will click on it...and a completely unrelated post will load. Meanwhile, the notification is gone. So...yeah. Irritating.",
"The App is good, the news and stories are Fantastic. But when I wanted to terminate my subscription, I found: + App has No 'My account' option + NYT online, has No option to terminate and MUST call someone? Why make customers incur call charges? Why Design the whole experience so difficult? Is this the last experience the organization wants to leave with the customer? Do want the customer to miss something positive and to return back? Only online way to terminate easily is at PayPal end",
"Love the content, but recent updates made this app unusable. Crashes constantly, can't even read a single article before a crash. Often can't load articles, just get a blank screen. Breaking news alerts display wrong description when expanding notification. On Galaxy S8",
"Yikes this app sucks. No place to change settingings, the text on articles is often so pale I cannot read the article. Notifications are not working either. If you are subscribing to read news on the App - don't bother - the only piece of code the NYT made sure works is the constant ads in your face.",
"A well-implemented newspaper app. Articles well-presented, with relevant links afterward. Some articles include multimedia elements, which look good. I wish that it had the option for a Dark mode, as that is my preference",
"I wanted the free app, but shortly thereafter found I was being charged for NYT. I have been trying to cancel by calling NYT and Google play. Neither one seem to be able to help me cancel my subscription and I keep getting drained of money per month. I HATE THIS! How can I cancel once and for all? Directions are useless!",
"This is probably my most used app. I love the NYTimes. I'm trying to read on the way to work today, and most articles won't load. It looks like sections are now no longer updating while I'm at home unless I specifically update each one. I'm not so sure about these most recent changes. :(",
"Subscriptions are bugged. I paid for All Access through Google Play but can't access my subscription. Now both New York Times and Google customer service are giving me the run-around, and I'm out $200. Unacceptable. I found at least a few other users having this same issue on Google Play forums and see no resolution.",
"I don't know why the Times follows predatory business practices, but find it absolutely unacceptable. A (one click) subscription via app is possible, but canceling is only possible via chat (with an obscene waiting time) or a call, plus the chat bot asking for information that apparently was not important when starting the subscription.",
"They don't advertise it, but should you decide to cancel your account they will make you call and sit in hold. There is no way to cancel online. Even after holding, they 'encountered a system error' that prevented my subscription from being canceled. All obstacles to keep you paying.",
"I'm always finding in depth articles in the NY Times, that other news organizations never seem to print. Maybe because of staff reductions and other budgetary reasons, they can only print the most trending of issues. Keep up the good job, NY Times.",
"I cannot believe that such a great app does not have a night mode. I like to read during the night, but the white background is so bright. Also, if I'm paying a subscription, I better not see ads. I expect ads in the other news apps where I don't have a subscription, but it makes me wonder why I even pay a subscription if there's still going to be ads.",
"Why is the NYT android app is constantly locking up? Fine scrolling thru stories, but once you open one, more times than not it locks up, have to quit the app and start over. Only app on my phone that does this, never happens with any other, including WAPO. All app versions are current. HELP!",
"Love the range, depth and sometimes quirkiness of the stories. I go to standard features like Metropolitan Diary, Modern and Tiny love stories, and Sunday human interest with a smile...and the puzzles! Investigative features are always thorough....balanced and critical to keeping society and its institutions and power players on toe tips. The Times is essential to my day...and to my life!",
"Do NOT purchase through the Play store. Get it directly from NYtimes. Buying it 3rd party means NYtimes will not help you with any glitches you may have with the app. App loads and crashes and does not link to account so you still have ads. NYtimes say it's Googles fault and Google says it's NYtimes fault and on and on in circles you will go. NYTimes is amazing. 5 stars. The app, it is horrible and mainly the lack of accountability for an account when you pay $120 plus dollars. Sad.",
"The app is great except for 1 minor But very annoying bug . I use it on an Amazon fire 8. When I go to an article and read it and then return to the section.The app takes me to the top of the section. So if I'm down near the bottom of the section and read an article, when I finish, I have to scroll down to the area where I was again.The more articles I read, the more scrolling I have to do. LOL",
"Easy to navigate, almost no bugs. The one downside is that they make it /really/ difficult to cancel your subscription; you have to speak to a person during US business hours, which is highly inconvenient to some of us, especially in Australia!.",
"App suddenly keeps telling me that my device is offline, and can't upload new content. My Internet connection isn't an issue. Was working fine until 2 days ago. I am using an android. Update: happened again 1 month after the above review. Further update (5/22): app no longer working.",
"Navigation is miserable - because of the large ads and inserts in stories I constantly jump out of a story by mistake while scrolling. If advertisers are getting paid for my ""clicks"" they're overpaying. And it continues to get worse in this regard. This is the only app where I experience this.",
Print subscriber for 15 years. I read a lot of articles in the app but the last update made the articles difficult to read in the app. It has a poor choice of font. It needs a clean San serif font with a way to change font size. Changing the system font to max is still a smaller font in the app than could be set with the old version. WSJ app is has much more readable font and has a wide size range option. Please put font control back in the app.,
"I wrote a two-star review in 2021, but the app is much improved since then. It still jumps to the top of the ""Today"" section too often, but my other complaints are mostly fixed. It's speedy enough, stories load as you'd expect, and night mode works 95% of the time. I still don't like the back button on the bottom, but that's forgivable.",
"App notification does not bring you to article unless you immediately open the notification. Should any time have passed and another notification arrives it brings you elsewhere. Also, there is no search option for articles similar to what the Washington post app offers. Due to the above I do not utilize this subscription much and I like to support the times although it is frustrating to try to use what I am paying for.",
"While reading, stories disappear. The app requires that you find the article again, click on it, and search for where you left off. Then, it happens again before you finish the article. In addition, there are many ads.",
"same problems as reported in all other recent reviews. App was great but is completely broken as of a month ago: articles don't load, articles that do load are cut of half way through. app freezes and refuses to scroll, or only the add banner scrolls. if this is not fixed by the time my subscription rolls around I will have to cancel it - great articles are useless if you can't read them...",
"Great paper, but horrible app for Android. It crashes constantly, with no remedies or fixes offered. It just crashed 3 times reading one article. It seems to crash whenever moving over the too numerous ads. All of this with a paid subsription.",
"The app is quite good as far as design and interaction. I am getting that notification issue, though. Not unusable, and they seem to take me to the right article. Unfortunately, I keep going back to the NYT to see how it's doing, but there vast majority of the content is opinion articles that don't explain much beyond the author's/editor's opinions. Not angry, because most 'news' is that way today; just disappointed by how I used to be able to use them for school reports.",
"Hello, lately I haven't been able to open any articles off the main page of the app such as my daily briefings. The screen flashes and no matter how many times I press the link it won't open. It only happens when on the main page.",
I've put the app on hold since the Jan. 15 update; read on the web instead. App now returns to the top of the page every time I finish a story. It's aggravating to repeatedly scroll back to my place after each read or browse. Please fix!,
"Subscribed during a sale where it was $4 per month. Unfortunately the account didn't sync up right and whenever I logged in on the app or site my account info came up as a nonsubscriber. Tried to contact NYT, who told me to contact Google Play, who then told me to contact the developer, and developer never responded. The customer service has been non-existent.",
Latest widget update very irritating. It scrolls too quickly to read the headline. (Better if it didn't scroll at all - that's what the buttons are for). Also the text is unreadable if the background image is light-coloured.,
The screen goes empty while the app updates/refreshes itself after you read an article. So you read an article then wait several seconds on a blank screen while it says it's updating itself. It's f frustrating and unnecessary to watch blank screens waiting for an unnecessary update.,
"Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor. As the ethics and mores of that platform have become those of the paper, the paper itself has increasingly become a kind of performance space. Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions. —Bari Weiss | Also, still no dark mode. ☹️",
"The app updates keep breaking. The first ""enhancement"" that disabled swiping left and right to switch between sections was a clue that the design team doesn't know what it is doing. Now the app keeps scrolling to the top every few seconds. Pathetic.",
"It's OK, but consistently fails to load from NYT links _and_ even notifications properly into the app, instead opening them in an embedded browser and making you have to go back, at which point the page often stalls for 10+ seconds to load, and at which time I'm already annoyed and trying to leave.",
"The app misses the thrill of surprise discoveries reading the paper version, but has continued to improve. And as long as I am able, I will subscribe to one edition or the other, because of the fine work being done at the institution.",
"I'm changing my rating. The news is first rate, but app needs an update. It always goes backk to the top of the page after you read an article. You have to scroll all the way back to where you were every time, which is annoying.",
"Content is good, but there's no way to access stories from today's paper. This is the main reason I pay for the NYTimes. I want to learn about what is in the news, not just some list of articles curated for me or just what's most recent. I want to see exactly what was in today's paper, and there's no way for me to tell. The web address to view this says it doesn't work on smartphones. Um, it's 2021, how can it not work on smartphones? Wsj app does this perfectly",
"The user interface is great. Just wish the app didn't generate so much cache on its own in the background. When not clearing the cache for a week and not even opening the app, there is easily 0.5 GB waiting to be cleared.",
"I particularly enjoy how the New York Times has stepped up its reporting here in California. I used to think of the Times as East Coast centric, and of course it has significance there and throughout the country. Their California Report is comprehensive, sharing bits from local news agencies, and uncluttered by pop-up ads, unlike so many of my local papers.",
"Good reporting and good app. Their ""leftward"" bias has gotten a bit worse, which is to be expected perhaps. But in the past year there have been times when I know their reporting was misleading. If you're careful and treat their content with a grain of salt, it's worth reading. Good coverage of international events. The app is a bit slow and caching could be better though.",
"Mostly good, but here's a big gripe: When I click on a notification about a particular news item, it's hit or miss whether I actually get to the referenced article or just end up on some top level page. It can be very frustrating.",
It seems that other readers are having my same issue of subscribing via Google play only to have the app and customer service tell me that I need to subscribe. I shouldn't be paying for services for months that I can't access. Tried repeatedly to resolve. Have been a long time reader and will not be seeking to subscribe again.,
"Notifications are wonky for Android users and automatic theme switching isn't available, in late 2020. I want to read the NYT all day everyday but hate having to switch manually everytime to dark mode in hidden experimental setting. The #1 paper in the world needs to pay their app developers better.",
"Frustrating experience on Android, I've already updated via App Store but every time I open it says this version has expired. I cannot swipe right swipe left or do anything. Uninstalled and installed again with the latest version, the error still happened.",
"What happened nytimes? This used to be such an amazing app but now it is laggy, busted, and aggravating. Whenever and click into a news story everything is in dark mode. Click back and it crashes. Reopen the app and it works but forgot to refresh the front page. I don't even dare click a linked story that will take me into the app because it will say I'm offline and not work. I've tried submitting support tickets but they simply get closed. Why am I still subscribed?",
Times is easy to read. Editors have broken down big stories into summaries and sub stories with summaries. I can read as deeply into the details of a story as I like. The assorted newsletters provide segmentation into subject areas I select. Very nicely done.,
It would be a good app if the news came in less tan 21 hours after it happened. We are paying for it but are not receiving what we paid for. We paid for full up to date access but are getting very stale news on the app. Also we don't get that many notifications even though all are turned on.,
"10 days gone and yet no errors fixed! come on guys.. it's a paid subscription and I'm unable to login the app. 28th Feb- The latest version as on 28th Feb is failing to launch.. despite the update, the app shows errors and forces to further update the app which is not even available! please fix it. error message: this version has expired. please upgrade. (no upgrade to this available on play store )",
this app is a pile hot garbage. regularly freezes for several seconds and i get a 'not responding' error. articles i an reading will regularly reset to top of page if i switch apps for even a few seconds. not impressed. love your news though,
"NYT app includes an option to not autopay videos and has run several articles on how to stop this in browsers. Now they have have started overriding their option. They seem to think this will generate more ad money, I suppose. I will end a decades long subscription if it continues.",
I signed up for a subscription and this app still won't let me see more than 5 articles each month. the amount they charge for the full year subscription that I have is not worth five articles per month. you can read that many without a subscription. They will take your money and still deny you access. there is no sign-in or log-in page when they deny you access to what you paid for. This app is a ripoff. I plan to call the (if I ever find the time in my very busy schedule) to request a refund.,
May 2021 update is horrible. Unable to scale within app. Usable to access app to try to make changes to display. Previously worked fine. No display of actual paper layout. It forces going through its display articles. Very disappointing changes,
App can be easily hacked. In general the online NYT's subscription service is iffy. Reluctantly having to cancel online subscription. App really is bad news: articles no longer coming on emails; log in to continue to read is not working either. The quality of journalism available online via email and app also not at print level. Disappointed.,
"Great journalism shadowed by broken app. After installing the app twice to try and fix the issues, the For You tab on my app doesn't work! So I'm not able to see articles suited to my specific interest. It's really annoying to have 1 out of 3 tabs not work at all!",
"In spite of being a subscriber, there are ads within the articles. This is inappropriate for a service that is $8/mo. for the first 12 mo. then $12.95/mo. (I believe) after that. I'm also a subscriber to the Washington Post, not only is it cheaper, there are no ads in articles. The only reason I stay subscribed to the Times is that they have very high quality journalism, otherwise I would have cancelled it the day I subscribed.",
"When my phone opens ny times links that open with the new York times app, it asks me to login. This app is behaving like a regular web browser when opening articles from it's own website. Update: downgraded to one star. Now I when try to read any top stories, they won't open. Opening ads of course works fine.",
"Multiple versions of this app, including the latest, cause massive battery drain on my pixel 3. I love the ny times, but it's going to have to be the web version only on my phone for now, with the WSJ being the app of choice for breaking news notifications.",
Love the app when it is working correctly. Recently started double billing me AND blocking my access to stories ( sending up a screen telling me to subscribe). I have confirmed my subscription and emailed help through the app 3 times in a month with no response whatsoever.,
"This should be a five star review. But recent updates has made the app useless. Constant crashes, won't connect to network, constant errors. I have enjoyed this app for many years, but at the moment the subscription is a waste.",
"Even though I am a subscriber the app is annoying and hard to read with all the ads appearing on the screen. I do understand that good journalism needs money to operate, but two ads on the screen of the smartphone most of the time is just too much.",
"Lots and lots of notifications. Trying to open one to read an article usually causes my phone to hang with a black screen. When. It does work, it's fine, but it's just too frustrating to roll the dice every time.",
"this app is very frustrating. crashes frequently, sometimes requiring reinstall to read articles. i pay a subscription for the great content. i suffer with the app because i must. i have zero problems with the ms news app. so i wind up reading it more though i prefer the nyt content.",
"Has worked great for years. However with the recent few updates coupled with Android 10 I only receive notifications after I launch the app. Pretty absurd for a paid service. Tried wiping cache, restarting my phone, and reinstalling to no avail.",
"About a week ago the app just wouldn't open, no matter what. I contacted NYT 3 times and got no contact. Tried uninstall and reinstall, and was invited by the store to install a free month's trial. I paid in advance for this app , and I loved the NYT, but I need to do something to make these guys work with me forgive me my prorated subscription back.",
"app is buggy to say the least. I needed to change my subscription, then bugs just increased exponentially. I get they don't what you to pay less but geez louis. The only way to cancel is to talk to a rep, I choose the text one. 1.You can't see what you type 2.You can't scroll up or down at any point it just shows current messages 3.They transfer you like 3 times 4.Obviously a bot, why even bother to pretend ""Derry"" is real if he doesn't respond to any of my text except to ones w/keywords",
"Frequently gives notifications for interesting articles. But, when you tap on said notifications, all the app is capable of doing is bringing you to its home screen. It is never able to actually bring you to the article you tapped on. 50% useless...",
Why doesn't the app contain the feature to read the days paper as it appears in print? Its 2018 and I still have to go to the website on a desktop to get this feature. I may not be into buying a physical paper every morning but I still want to read it in that layout on my phone. All other major papers in the country provide this feature but the NYT doesn't...why is that?,
This is a terrible app with fancy graphics that don't work right and detract from reading the news stories. The graphics makes the text constantly jump to other locations while reading a story making it terribly frustrating to try to read through.,
"I tried to cancel a subscription to NYT on Jan 1st, a day after it autorenewed on Googleplay (I'd tried to cancel through the app before, Little did I know this can only be done through Googleplay) So I contact NYT, who point at Googleplay, and then Googleplay, who say a decision will come in 1 to 4 business days. 5 business days later, no contact. So I contact them again. They deny me a refund, steal $200 because of a miss-clicked button. Trillion dollar company BECAUSE of poor customer service",
"I subscribe to the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal as well, but still feel the need to maintain my NY Times subscription. I prefer the physical subscription option, but it has grown a little too expensive for me, so I appreciate the electronic options, especially during special offers that make it accessable to anyone. It remains the national newspaper of record.",
The application crashes a lot. The app needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled. On a Samsung tablet the installed fails to put an icon on the home screen. To open the Times app you need to go to the play store to open the app .,
"I like the NYT from a news point of view, but I also like to try different news organizations. So I switch between them. I won't be back with the NYT though because they make it such a pain to cancel. They say you can cancel at any time, but they allow you to sign up online, no problem. When it comes to canceling, they force you to talk to a person so that they can hustle you into remaining with them. It's not even an easy process, and it just feels kind of gross.",
"Love the games, but several links in games, such as the one to the community comments in Spelling Bee, don't work. I have to go to my browser to get there, which is a pain. Fix the link and I'll edit my review. Also can no longer have game and hints open in separate windows at the same time like I used to be able to do. Hate that change!",
"I really enjoy the reporting of the Times, however, like many others I left a poor review in August when the android widget was removed for seemingly no reason. Since then the widget hasn't returned and the app has generally declined in quality with constant freezes/crashes. Sadly I will be cancelling my subscription which I've had for years. Surely someone from the NYT must be reading through all these 1 star reviews and seeing a theme? Apparently not. Add the widget back and I'll resubscribe.",
"I love the New York Times because it's one of the best newspapers. But I have one problem with the app: Instead of sending me notifications when they're new, I get the latest 30 or 40 notifications all at once every 10 days or so. Do you guys know how to fix this? I'm using Android, the latest version of the app.",
"#1 At such a high price, the NYT Crossword should be included in the subscription for the newspaper. If I buy a hard copy of the paper I get the crossword. #2 It's EXTREMELY difficult to search for past articles. That is unexcusable and should be resolved immediately.",
"I pay for the subscription and I also allow notifications. When I see an article I like in notification I click on it but it doesnt take me to that article. It is really frustrating as I can never seem to find the article I got notified about. Instead it is usually just news on Trump. Please fix this, I am about to cancel my subscription over it.",
"The articles are well written, informative, and constructive, unlike 100% of free apps, including premium apps, too! It also has a number of addictive games, podcast, etc. Definitely the best and most reliant news source today, hands down! And if you haven't already, check out ""The Weekly,"" by the NYT. It's 30 minutes of informative, mind opening TV, about stories from around the world. The NYT is doing everything right! Subscriber for life right here! Worth every penny!",
"I want to give a negative rating for one of the worst apps in the world. (This rating isn't for the paper but the app.) Doesn't let you unsubscribe like any other normal app. I just found out I had two email accounts where I have been paying. Paying two times for the same service, I don't know why. And all I want to do is cancel my service. The app takes you to a virtual agent. Why does it hurt to just have a cancel subscription button? Just add a button to cancel service like Netflix. Jeez!",
"I enjoy the app as it does decent push updates. however, I have had trouble saving my preferences and sometimes have to sort through to find content I would like. The convenience of the mobile layout is great UX",
Horrible. Links do not open. Logins are never stable. FB links are slow and pathetic. The Washington Post is far superior in tech and overall performance and ease. Canceling this subscription after only one month of terrible results and tech assistance.,
"Stories, often longer than one would expect from a publication designed to entertain (for circulation and advertising returns), usually contain extraordinary detail gleaned over hundreds of hours of investigative journalism by teams of highly competent writers and editors. This is news reporting at its best. And the app manages this material well.",
"As a recovered leftest I find it essential to get to the current mindset as quickly and easily as possible. It's a great looking, smooth running app. Quick and easy to find the well written pieces that ridicule traditional values and scorn patriotism. Worth the 4 bucks a month to get to the heart of the manufactured hysteria.",
"Say what you will about the perceived political bias of the content, but the application itself is great. Solid interface, and lots of seamless links to outside applications - in a recent article, it had an Instagram AR (augmented reality) component.",
"Great newspaper, decent app UI, but the push notifications are absolute garbage. They don't take you the story that it mentions and sometimes when you expand the notification, it turns into another story altogether. Awful.",
"They removed the widget that was working fine and distinguished this app from other news apps. Recent updates have also been buggy, in that when I try to open an article from notifications, sometimes the app opens showing the article I was previously reading.",
"Poor navigation interface. Difficult to go back to the start page. Hitting back will navigate to previous article and eventually just to cause the application to exit. Very annoying, often have to restart the app to deal with this.",
"Nov19 Android Facebook Load Solution: For those who's Facebook articles won't load with the app running in the background, simply uninstall the app and login into your account via the NYT Facebook landing page. DO NOT reinstall the app - it's useless. Articles on Facebook are posted in the order they are published. I was just about to give up my subscription, but then found this work around. Review is for the App, and not their exceptional content and reporting.",
Disappointed. No ability to mark articles read so I don't have to scroll through them again and again. No way to indicate preferences for content - especially filter out content I have no interest in. Search capability is limited. Overall a poorly designed app from a prestigious publication.,
"My biggest complaint is that it sends me alerts but when I click on them, it takes me to the last article I read in the app, not the article the alert was about. And no obvious, good way to find the article. I've taken to reading the title of the alert and then using Google to find the article.",
"No darkmode. Even in the lowest screen brightness setting, the app is screen brightness is not sutable for night time reading. Bad Notifications The notification are filled with great articles, but if tap the notification, the article does not load. The user is taken to the main page and none of the articles are nowhere to be found 😭 Font size Unable to decrease or increase fonts Communication No direct link to the the author Twitter handle",
"App is readable and decently organized. Has the features most people want (text size, save article, etc). It does suck to have to scroll thru three ads in a short article when you're paying for the subscription though. Seems kind of abusive.",
"Good content, threadbare app. Really needs a night mode or dark mode. Pretty basic for a news app in 2021 really. Use it less because it lacks this basic feature. Update. A year later and zero progress on implementing a dark mode. Just shockingly frustrating!",
"While overall the app is great, a bug with notifications keeps the experience from being satisfactory. On expanding a notification to read the whole thing, the text changes to a different headline. I'm on Android P, Samsung S10.",
"The content is excellent, the notifications are broken. They look fine at first, but when I expand them, or click through, if there's more than one they all change to the same article.",
"The app gives notifications of news stories of interest. However, clicking the notification only brings you to the front page, not to the story. So then you have to navigate to the search page to try to find the story.",
This app has two problems. One is it doesn't have auto scroll so repetitive stress injuries to the thumb will ensue. Secondly the app won't retain a download of the paper so it constantly seeks to refresh content resulting in a whiteout.,
"The app itself is just about fine. The problem I've is the payment model; the impossibility of canceling the subscription. I realised I am not making sufficient use of my susbcription and decided to cancel, but the NYT has made cancellation almost impossible. Neither on the app nor on Google Play there's a single click option bh which you can cancel the unreasonably expensive subscription. I'd appreciate if the NYT can show some benevolence and assist in cancelling the subscription.",
"I had a very bad experience of purchasing NYT subscription on Google Play. The NYT app showed me a discounted offer of INR 1750/Yearly but when I made payment it deducted 5200/- for yearly subscription. I had chat with NYT app to resolve this issue and get refund but they put the onus on Google Play team saying payment is deducted by them so only thye can issue a refund. So, I contacted Google Play to refund the amount they said it has to be done by NYT app team. Both blamed each other.",
"Great reporting, clean layout, good app functionality. However I wish NYT wouldn't double dip: even though you've paid the subscription fee it still shows ads in the app. If you've paid to subscribe you shouldn't have to see ads.",
"The app seems to continually update the content, making hard to read through. As for the content, its quality is in the toilet. Even the hard news articles seem to be opinion pieces. And the style of writing is that of pretentious literature instead of the ""who, what, where, how, and why"" of a newspaper.",
"This rating is for the NYT experience, and not for the app. As mentioned by the reviewer below, NYT has an issue with the discounted subscriptions from India. I called their 800 number and after 30 minutes of hold I am told they have an issue with India subscriptions and the workaround was to get a gift subscription, where I would be paying US rates. Waited a few more days. No fix yet. Looks like NYT does not want digital subscribers from India. Uninstalled the app.",
"Overall I never have any issues with the app and access to the stories. However, recently it appears that occasionally the app will use excessive mobile data rather than the wifi. Trying to troubleshoot to validate this.",
"I've been a nyt reader for 40 years. I even sent my kid to the ""school of the nyt"" over the summer. Great paper, amazing content. Horrible app. Crashes constantly on Samsung tablet. Stories fail to load from ""top story"" menu. Reporting a problem does nothing. Hard to fathom how a great paper can be so technology inept.",
"app is horrid to use. locks up tablet for minutes when starting. have to restart app (android says app has stopped responding) or worse restart tablet. considering canceling my subscription. ps articles have many many many ads injected, another pleasant surprise from the people at nytimes. find another way to read news.",
I like to flick through articles and select ones to save for later.. it's happened twice now. I bookmark the articles and they just don't appear in the saved for later section. Definitely a bug. Hope it gets fixed.,
"I've been a NYT subscriber on the Kindle for more than a decade, but now forced onto the app, which is a big step down. For the same price, the Kindle edition was ad-free. The Kindle edition also had basic functionality like ""how far through the article am I?"" and ""goto next article"". The app is much much worse than the Kindle edition.",
Pretty good app BUT the notif behavior is mildly infuriating. Most notifs show an interesting headline is like to read. But invariably I click on that headline to be taken to the app home page instead of the relevant article. I also get a LOT of notifs and frequently they stack meaning I can't click one anyway. Would love some sort of notif inbox where I can actually find any of the articles in the notifs.,
"Awesome looking and slick app! The problem is that all notifications about European news don't link to the news itself but to the main page. What's more, oftentimes I don't receive any notifications unless I open the app directly and then all of them storm in like they've been held up behind a dam.",
Keeps forgetting my subscription info. And I don't know why they removed their headlines widget from Android. Also not a fan of the new 3 tab interface. Like the dark mode though. Only some of the images from each article load even on a fast internet connection.,
"Many stories do not load, just an endless in progress indicator. This app isn't free-- you have to be a subscriber -- so you are sometimes not receiving the product you paid for. Besides it is really frustrating to expext to read a story and it isn't provided.",
"The NY Times coverage is both broad & deep. It is the standard by which I judge all other news sources. As a news junkie I subscribe to multiple online news reports & listen to a variety of podcasts & radio & TV sources. But when I don't have time to indulge my news habit for hours I rely on NY Times for accurate & incisive news. I read it online when I'm in a hurry. I sit with the tactile joy of real paper & linger over a 2nd cup when I can, before jumping into another crazy day.",
The content is usually boring and just kind of meh so I when I had to get a new credit card I decided to cancel my subscription. For some reason you have to chat with customer support to cancel which immediately told me they were going to somehow take advantage (should be a simple button push to cancel). The customer support person I was chatting with told me that they couldn't cancel my subscription because my last payment hadn't gone through. So basically they wanted me to pay them to cancel?,
"Riddled with bugs. Error messages loading links from external apps or notification drawer, back button navigation sometimes exits the app, video links missing from app but present in web browser.... decided I'm better off just using the web browser and uninstalled this app. Samsung Galaxy S9+",
"I use this app both on my Win10 PC and my Android cell phone. For about a month I have had issues with one or both devices not recognizing that I have a bona fide account. I get a message ""do you want to open an account"". But I already have one!",
"It's 2022 and there is no night mode. The whole point of this app is reading, but they sure don't offer much in formating and making it easier on the the eyes. A 3rd party news aggregate app, like Pocket, has more features while not being subscription supported.",
I was trying to login with my email (not with Google or Facebook) account (I already have a free account with NYT) after installing the app. After three perfect try (I mean with no spelling mistake or no lower case | upper case mess up) when I found out that the NYT app still going nowhere other than just requesting to log me in I figured that I had had enough.,
It is extremely laggy and seems to want to refresh constantly despite most of the content being multiple days old and primarily opinion. Not much news at all and a surplus of photos at best tangentially relevant to the content. It also is too parochial for most of America.,
"The journalism is good, but their billing department is terrible. TWICE they have told me they cannot charge $1 to two different paying methods that work perfectly well for everyone else. Therefore TWICE they canceled my subscription. Their attitude is that it's my problem to find a solution, and trying to contact them is painful and takes an enormous amount of time. Every medium keeps asking for money to support journalism, but one of the biggest is incapable of having a proper billing dept.",
"The content is great, with excellent investigative reporting. but the app malfunctions in many ways.. and often. It is common and frustrating to click on a link and the story never opens. the app also sends notifications for routine feature stories of no urgency.",
I see no way to revert to dark text on a light background. The description of how to get rid of dark mode does not match the menu I see. Times roman fonts are too thick to be easily readable in dark mode. Maybe time for a (gasp) font update so the app works in the 21st century?,
"From a usability standpoint, it would make more sense to swap the placements of the search and setting icons. As it is now (search on left, settings on right), it's not intuitive.",
This app stinks. When i click on a notification to take me to an article all the text and background are the same color and i cant read it. If i go back to the home screen of the app it works fine but now I've lost my article. I will not be renewing my subscription.,
"It work, but it's notifications don't. When you get a notification, if you click on the link, it opens the homepage, not the article. This needs fixed as even my Washington Post app notifications at least do that correctly.",
It's frankly bewildering that this is the best the New York Times can do. No search function and the Most Popular articles have remained the same since I installed the app. Refreshing has no effect. Get it together.,
"BRING BACK THE WIDGET! I love the NYtimes and many of its sections and their app works great. It's clean and smooth which is what you look for. However, they recently removed the widget. PLEASE BRING BACK THE WIDGET!!",
"Bring Back the Widget! The good news is that NY Times app support replied to my email about the missing widget within 2 hours - on a Saturday! The bad news is they confirmed the widget was removed in the latest version of the app. Minus 1 star for removing the widget, plus half a star for the nice, quick reply from app support!",
"Buggy, Bad Support, and Bad Customer Service, but Great News! Purchasing a subscription through Google Play is an issue when a subscription through their website. Neither NYT or Google Play would refund money. Ads shown inside the app are annoying. Once I become a Beta tester I had no way of removing myself and their Android support is unresponsive.",
"After years of being a reliable app and welcomed source of news, the latest update crashes before main page opens, impossible to read most news. Please fix, remember ""Keep it simple"" the latest bells and whistles don't impress me.",
"A barely functional webview of the NYT website. The only advantage is notifications, but half the time notifications just take you to a blank page and you need to restart the app for them to work again. Articles often refresh halfway through reading them.",
The app is a battery drain for Galaxy S7: 8% in 20 minutes is really impressive these days; the phone also got noticeably hotter. Cleaning the app data and trying again did not help. I am also not happy with how the app is tracking me. After deleting the app data I found out it still kept state even though I was not logged in.,
"Great content in portable format, but TERRIBLE (non) functionality, especially for navigating and reading comments and trying to add them -- constantly freezes up, jumps to different point in comment thread and loses comments you're trying to add. Via Android. NYT fails to get technology--again....",
Great publication. BUT now (3-27-22) tring to review Covid news while drilling down the page jumps around sending me to the bottom. Even if I quickly tap on (e.g. case map) an item it scrolls all the way down again. I was in portrait orientation on my Samsung Tab S6.,
"This app is constantly shutting down on me. I have done everything recommended to fix it to no avail. I enjoy the NY Times but am close to cancelling my subscription. It does it, too, when I open from a browser.",
One of the worst apps and customer support services I've ever used. The NYT is a great newspaper but they haven't adapted to the digital age. Don't waste your time with their app or with a digital subscription. The Washington Post is also a great newspaper and their app is much better.,
"fantastic app functionality! Very clean view, ads rarely are in the way of what I'm reading. The text fills out the screen nicely when an article is opened; really allows for a pleasant mobile reading experience that is hard to come by.",
"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I purchased the all access pass from google and the app does not work - I can not access my account. All I can access is a free trial to the cooking application. When I reach out to NYT they tell me I do not have an account and that they can not cancel and offer me a refund. When I reach out to google they can not offer me a refund. Both companies have failed at customer service and simple app development for NYT is not good when it comes to Android phones. Very disappointed and out $175. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Waste of money, time and energy for absolutely nothing in return.",
"Update (10/3/2019) in the latest update some articles won't load even with good internet connectivity. In addition to occasional bugs, I don't like inline ads. Usually it shows the same ad over and over again for weeks. Why do I have to see them if I pay for the subscription?",
"Refresh will drive you mad. If you're 3/4 finished with a long read, app's autorefresh will take you back to the main page every time. Then you have to scroll scroll scroll to find your place. Especially frustrating when using a recipe. Also fails to load main page about 30% of the time.",
"As described by so many others, the issue isn't the content so much as the app. It is terrible. Just with the basics, it is slow to scroll, flickers a lot, and I can't recall the last time I used it when it didn't crash and restart.",
"I stopped getting push notifications, so I had to re-install. Hopefully that works. Also, the search is awful. It doesn't correspond to headlines at all. I have to use a Google search to find an article rather than the app.",
The journalism is great but if I turn off notifications I should not still be getting alert tones and push notifications on my phone. I have turned it off 3 times now and then I get another alert and go back in and see that the notifications are enabled again. What is the deal on that?,
"I'm a reader in London (that's England) and I find here exceptional, balanced, educational and stimulating journalism. I dont agree with all of it of course, but if you take offence or it makes you think, its surely doing its job very well indeed. Please keep it up NYT! To be cherished.",
"Amazing app, as an app developer myself, I notice little technological details. Love how the tabs are navigable via the drawer menu. I'll be using that app pattern for my own work. Love the bookmarks, history and the daily briefings. Amazing news source!",
"Dear New York Times android department, I like your newspaper. I enjoy reading your articles. However, when a notification for an article crosses my mobile screen, and I click on said notification, I expect to be linked to the article in question. What I don't expect, is to be linked to the front page of your online newspaper, where I then have to dig through to find the article I am interested in. First world problem? Yep. But also, easily correctable with a little effort from your team ~",
"Pretty expensive. Some good native digital content, which is enjoyable. Unfortunately articles can automatically refresh multiple times. In those cases, I must scroll down to wherever I last was.",
Always excellent and trustworthy news. I am always impressed by the high level of the articles they share. I have my favorite columnists like Gail Collins and Paul Krugman. And I am totally addicted to the crossword puzzle. We subscribed because we wanted quality news and we have been consistently getting it.,
"Since I installed it I've started to have problems opening some articles, going back to the previous one, etc. It was easier to navigate through NYT articles with my regular browser so not worth having it.",
App is ok but problems with Android integration. I receive a morning email briefing from NYT which links to NYT articles. I used to be able to click the article link and have the article open in the NYT app. That automatic function to open the link in the app no longer works. The link will only open NYT in a browser. I checked the NYT app settings and the app is set to open applicable links but this is no longer working.,
Having a lot of issues lately. Articles freeze often and in middle of article screen is blank forcing me to close out and re-open app. It happens a lot! Now comments won't load on any article at all. This needs to be fixed!,
I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A which is very nice and works great with all apps except this one. Whenever I get to an advertisement in an article the screen goes black and I have to exit the app. I going to be cancelling my NYT subscription because I can't read the paper on my tablet...,
"The notifications are useless. I get a notification of a specific headline but when I activate it, I am taken to the home page of the New York Times, never to the story. And nine times out of ten, the story I am looking for is not on the home page. Very, very annoying.",
"One of the best news services, however it's from the USA so they refuse to use the metric system, which makes reading anything including measurements annoying. Also, the notifications don't like being messed with, turn them off and you may never get them to turn back on.",
"Used to really enjoy this app but when I try to read articles, it takes me to a broken page. None of the games work. And if I want to read an article, I have to type in the title of the article on Google & then * HOPE * that that link works. I'm gonna end my subscription because what's the point in having something I can't read.",
"I've finally uninstalled this app. The ads make it impossible to do the mini crossword and the Bee. I can do both on the website. If your app is so broken that it can't do what your website can, there's no reason to install it.",
"I love this publication and app. the newsletters, the round ups at start of and end of day. its good to have a vetted reliable source of news on my phone. well worth the subscription fee, which is almost always on sale if you look",
"Mobile news done right, layout and functionality across devices is always on point, and updated regularly. You also get the occasional little embellishment when a story lends itself to a nice visual effect or bit of additional functionality. Bit upset the widget went but apart from that superb.",
"There is no way to see today's paper. The articles are often interesting but are clearly targeted at what they think are my interests. The 'today' section includes articles repeated from several days ago. I would like to see an option to view today's print edition. In a NEWS app, I want to see the (relatively) unbiased news of the day, not human interest stories targeted at me.",
"This app is very buggy. It often will say I am offline when I am not (all my other apps work just fine). Impossible to update without logging out. It never stays logged in, and frequently asks me to subscribe when I'm already subscribed. About to switch to another publication.",
"Only works partially. If I launch app from my home screen, it seems to work. But when I click a NYT link from Facebook, the app tries to open but then sits there with nothing but a blank screen. So I have to kill the app and just open NYT from the home screen and try to search manually for the article I was trying to link to open from within the Facebook app.",
"Edit - this issue has been fixed. I've used this app for years, but the last few months NO articles will load when I try to open them from Facebook or the push notifications. I just get a white screen. Why am I paying money for content I can't read??! I have an Android phone and already uninstalled and reinstalled the app to try to fix the issue and it did not work.",
"App has serious loading issues, contacted customer support was informed to uninstall and reinstall the app which done and then the problem of slow loading of the app resumed. It has been a long standing issue that needs to be resolved. i have other news app on my phone this is the only app that has this pronlem poor.",
"It is very sluggish and almost always has to reload data in between articles. I absolutely love the New York Times paper but compared to other newspaper apps, I find this app very, very frustrating.",
"Love the content, but the app behavior has gotten horrible. Freezes up regularly, then get a system popup telling me the app is not responding. Seems to happen when it's trying to load content. Pixel 4 with ads blocked.",
"I used to read the NY Times but now I'm a digital only subscriber. I like getting notified on my phone of important stories that I may have others missed. They cover long term corruption, in-depth international stories and have the best writers. I plan to subscribe for the rest of my life. Even if I didn't read it or couldn't. I'd still subscribe just to support their work.",
"The New York Times is my go to for news outside my country (I am Canadian). On Saturday, they even have a ""Canadian Letter"" feature that is always a good read. I have a digital subscription, I think it is worth it for the depth & breadth of journalism they provide. Plus, the News Quiz every week is fun.",
"Had problems awhile ago with the app not loading articles. It's working well now. Just a side note, lookout has recently started notifying me that it's blocking malicious links when I open the nytimes app - it's not causing any problems but I'm not sure what that's about.",
"The sideways navigation for related articles has a new bug; poor sensitivity for swiping. It either doesn't move at all, or it swipes over by 2-4 articles, rather than sequential. It used to have much better sensitivity.",
Like NYT; hate the app. Fails to load half the times. Doesn't refresh fast enough. Most if the notifications don't load the actual articles when clicked upon. I am going to look for alternatives to consume this content.,
"I may not always agree with some of the opinion pages, but overall this is still the best paper in town. The electronic version is very interactive and innovative. I love to go back to the articles I save and i also love that I get good recommendations on what may interest me.",
"Somewhat frustrating as articles can sometimes be shared, sometimes not. Hard to set up personal news feeds, so I end up navigating uselessly. Having said that, the content is undeniably exceptional.",
"What have you done to the app? For the past few days, when I hit the back button to return to the main page after reading a story, it scrolls all the way to the top #1 story instead of returning me to my previous place. I uninstalled and reinstalled and the same thing is happening. Beyond annoying. Please fix.",
"The Times usually gets the stories to me before any of the other news apps I have (BBC, NewsVoice, and a couple others.) I have read a couple opinion pieces that I strongly disagree with, but nobody is perfect, I guess. Anyways, if you like your news delivered quickly, with easily verifiable sources (so no Lugenpresse, oops I mean Fake News here), check this out, for your health.",
"Could be better UI. Not sure why it needs to run all the time. Anyway, paying for my subscription through Google Play is seamless, and makes accessing NYTimes on PC, in-app, or mobile browser incredibly easy.",
Purchased another 1-year All-Access pass through Google Play this time and it hasn't worked for 3 months. I've submitted multiple requests to NYT and Google about both just point the blame at the other. Looks like others have experienced the same issue to no avail.,
"Where did the widget for the home screen go? That was my only access point to the NYTimes. I can't be bothered to open the app and scroll through all the news. That's really annoying and if the widget won't come back, I'm really thinking about cancelling my subscription...",
"I pay for a digital subscription, and read the NYT daily. I rely on the app for when I am on the go. The current version of the app makes it almost impossible to use. More often than not, I can't open the actual article. This is terribly disappointing.",
"love the articles, of course. but the app is trash. every single time I open it, I have to close it at least once and try again because no content loads. this problem didnt exist on my old phone, but it does on my new one. it's so irritating",
"Too many ads by far! The app is mediocre to begin with. I only tolerated it for the content, but the ads every few sentences are ruining that too! Probably won't continue my subscription because of this app. WaPo is a good comparator (for app design).",
"I keep get many error messages ""NYTimes app keeps shutting down"" 8 even when I haven't used it in weeks. Love the NYT, so I've been patient, and will look for solution when time allows.",
"Easy to use- even ""pleasing"" somehow. The articles you've already looked at appear greyed out, which is helpful. The app makes it all easier on the eyes somehow, I don't know. Like good sneakers, it just feels good, cushier, in the app. Easy to find my way around. I am good to go.",
"Great app, were it not for the ads that crop up inline, slow everything and drain the battery. Naively I thought that paying a subscription would spare me that, now I find it more comfortable to log in a browser and enjoy reading great content with the ads locked out.",
"Stupid app, first of all does not refresh after an offline holiday of 6 days. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, now does not allow me to login. All these issues for a paid subscriber. Slow to load, suddenly stops working on WiFi, only mibile data works. Will cancel my subscription.",
"You would think that, having disabled notifications for the Tokyo Olympics in settings, I would stop getting notifications about the Tokyo Olympics. Instead I'm constantly getting notifications about the Tokyo Olympics. Apparently the only way to stop getting nuisance notifications about this thing I don't care about, is to disable notifications entirely, thereby rendering the app useless.",
"Content is great but the app itself is janky and frequently freezes then crashes halfway through reading an article forcing me to reload the app, find the article again and scroll back to where I was. Running on unmodified Pixel 4a so it is not due to hardware limitations",
"A great newspaper. Even if you don't align with their political bias which is decidedly liberal, there is plenty of high quality reporting and analysis covering international news, arts, science and technology. They have some nice addictive games like the Spell Bee and the crossword for an additional subscription.",
"After you read an article, instead of the app letting you go back to where you were on the main page, it takes you back to the top. Why?? Please restore to the more user-friendly design! And the link for the custom coronavirus tracker has stopped working.",
Great App. Read a lot. Only minor improvement I might recommend is making a heirarchy for the sections or something to make searching for a particular section easier. The list is just a little long. Maybe alphabetical?,
Absolutely unusabel. I try to click on stories and it immediately goes back to the home page. I also had to log in 6 times and restart a ton of others to even get it to load correctly. So sick of this. Cancelling.,
Really enjoyable app layout. Top notch news content. Would like if there's an option to download podcasts in app. Also would prefer if a more obvious design distinction would be made between opinion articles and factual news reports.,
"I like getting NYT headlines, live comments on breaking stories, videos and recipes. I do wish that when I expand the nyt video To full screen, it would rotate to view it horizontally. It will only show in regular vertical orientation.",
Great coverage but app doesn't eliminate advertising. Really annoying that the video ads will cause the screen to not scroll correctly either. Paid app with advertising. I guess it's like the actual paper in that regard. Wish I knew in advance.,
"So, I have a NYTimes subscription and I get several news letters from the publication, the problem is that the links in the newsletters don't go to the app but to the browser version of the NYT so I have to log in every time to read an article or search for it manually in the app - annoying and time consuming",
"The best reading to educate and inform! it offers a variety of viewpoints that reflect our diverse cultures and people. It's like exploring rooms of ""time"" with windows into the past, looking for answers , healing & hope, printed on pages, recorded in digital forms.",
Should be 0 stars. Paying print subscriber for decades. Switched to digital after leaving NY area as price here prohibitive. App crashes or fails to load every day. Used to be good. Care more for increased graphics than functionality. Can't use graphics if they never load,
"Great content, mostly, but the writing in the articles (not the headlines, just the body) has recently become very faint and more difficult to read. No idea why this happened or how to fix it. Please fix or let me know how to fix.",
Suddenly the app has stopped functioning. Often articles will take 2 minutes to load or not load at all. Other times only half the article will load. I have cleared the cache uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail. Very frustrating.,
"beautiful app, I love the minimal style. also works seamlessly with no bugs and runs smoothly, updating fast. maybe navigation to the different sections could be made more intuitive, e.g. brought to the main page",
I have subscribed for 3 years. Now I read an article and the app tells me I've reached my limit of free articles and takes me to a screen to subscribe with no option to log into my account. Everything is Google play store shows my subscription is active. I'm this close to getting out of NYTimes altogether.,
"I find the NYT struggling with it's mission of journalism for the truth. Their editors and publisher keep falling on this illusion that objectivity equates to all opposing sides being equal and worth of storyline time, even if they are lies. This type of journalism is nothing but gaslighting and is one of the current vehicles for a distorted culture and mental health issues in this country accelerated by the trump era.",
"Really enjoying the app so far. I get a lot of notifications, but it's all from categories I have decided to get news from, and it's really easy to just swipe them off if they're in the way, but also simple enough to pique my interest often and keep me engaged in current topics.",
"Overall, a good app. However, please have the app open the correct story when I click on a notification on my phone. It seems to just take me to a random article and I have to the search for the actual article I wanted.",
"I'll be reading an article, and the app randomly goes back to the main page, almost like it refreshes. It's incredibly annoying. UPDATE: The same issue is happening much more frequently.",
"It's very tough to use this app with out the option for Dark Mode. All my apps are generally set with a color tone of dark, but the NYT doesnt this option. Given that most of the background of NYT is app its extra painful and blinding that they do not have Dark Mode.",
"The app is ok but Android notifications don't work well. When there are two notifications fired for 2 different articles, they end up getting updated somehow so that the most recent gets duplicated and I can't see the older one.",
"I really like the UI. When you open the app it's just articles, it felt like I was reading a physical paper. Subscription is very reasonably priced and it's easy to pause or cancel if you need.",
"I have attempted to cancel NYT, several months. I cannot access my account, since I never was informed of my account number, or password. (The monthly $4.00 charge is now being offered for $1.00.) I have contacted NYT to cancel...they cannot find my account via three email addresses I frequently use; to no avail. They say they will track my monthly charges via my bank account, yet they are not following through, it seems. Canceling anything should not be so difficult. Is this a Google issue, or a NYT issue? Please cancel my lost account!",
"A recent update changed the accessibility settings such that I now have to use the largest global system font settings, which makes all apps have huge text except NYT, which has barely readably small text. If I reduce the system font size so that other apps look reasonable, this app is unreadably small.",
"Amazing reporting interrupted by pervasive, more-than-one-screen ads. If you turn off autoplay, the ads still do. In bad reception, I spend more time loading a video ad than I would to read the article.",
"Slow. When I click on a story, Takes forever to load and show the story; Seldom get past headlines. Should find ways to separate video & hi-resolution images upload from text. My phone Snapdragon 818. Works fine on WaPo",
"I feel lost in this app after recent updates. I can't find the news quiz, can't find my account settings or profile, and the search functionality seems broken - it's showing me content from 2021, even if I click ""newest"".",
"When I tap on notifications about stories, the app shows a black background with black letters with no way that I can find to change it. Very annoying. If you click on the app, it does work correctly.",
"Does not work on my Android 10 device. The apps opens but nothing loads and I get an error message that reads: ""Device is offline. Please check your internet connection and try again."" My device is connected to the internet. Well, for the mean time I'll be using the Washing Post, I guess (mwahaha).",
"'For You' section is frozen. It used to work great, now the For You section is a week old. I uninstalled and reinstalled but the problem persists. The For You section reports on events that are 1.5 weeks old. Even though it says ""you're all caught up"" it never refreshes/reloads to new, news :(",
"Excellent news app and wider package. But a paid app that is this expensive should not contain ads. Articles are often broken up by ads every few paragraphs, including ads for NYT offerings that are already paid for (??) This is like Facebook advertising sofas after you buy a sofa. And this ""meet our subscriber"" ad thing was interesting at first, but now it only ever shows that Questlove guy. Do I really need to see him popping up 3 times in one article?",
"On the Android app, there is no longer a scroll bar to the right of the article. It used to be there. You cannot tell the length of the article or your position within it. At least this is the situation on my Samsung S10e. The scroll bar feature is available for iPhone app users.",
"Nice clean UI, easy to navigate, buggy notifications. Sometimes I get duplicate notifications, but when I click on one of the duplicates it takes me to another page. Usually one of the notifications will lead me to the original article.",
"Loaded the app to play Wordle, but to me there was no logical, direct way of getting to the game, and trying to navigate around is counter-intuitive. It's easier for me to go to their website through my browser and play that way",
"Excellent journalism but really awful app. It's slow, buggy, fails to load and crashes often. Notifications stop working randomly. It's unable to open NYT links from Google. Please make it better!",
"Garbage. Absolute garbage. The writing is great, which is what we're here for, right? But they try to make articles multimedia, or just fancy, which simply means that they don't scroll smoothly, or sometimes at all. They need to stop gilding the lily and just let us read!",
"DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR PAENT INFO, CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE. Bought a subscription by simply signing up, then tried to cancel... Only option is waiting on phone a chat to cancel. The chat messenger that comes up was broken on the app bc they place ads over the text box so you can't use it. I had to uninstall the app, then log into the website on my browser. Then they kept me on and refused to cancel while they tried to upsell me. Took over 30m!!!! What a waste of time!",
The android version has many glitches. Constantly reloads pages while in the middle of reading articles or watching clips. Very distracting. Please fix this!! The design of the app is great however.,
News is great. App is horrible. Google reads my news to me while I drive. NY Times does not allow it. Open in browser opens app. Annoying. Please fix. Please allow read aloud. Otherwise I'll get my news elsewhere.,
"Keep getting message device is offline but it isn't. All other apps working fine. Logged off, cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled - still doesn't work. Nov 2, 2022 I needed to update my credit card to provide a new expiry date Did the update but message came back saying ""invalid"". Contacted support via chat andcthey were useless. Thus card works fine everywhere else - Costco CANADA Mastercard.",
"The app looks beautiful, but it's pretty simplistic. Also, I am extremely disappointed that I can no longer change the font size for the app. Still three stars, but it's hard to understand how such a savvy company as NY Times has such a clunky app. Maybe they need to invest in some better designers and developers? Does anyone else feel this way? I pay a lot of money for this subscription.",
"WHY IS THERE STILL NO DARK MODE?!?! it's 2022. NYTimes customer service thinks it's still only called ""night mode"" and won't implement it. Also - there aren't many features to make the app easier for users. There's a ""save for later"" function that's poorly implemented and it's difficult to browse articles effectively. I'd expand on these in a user survey but pretty sure the team managing this app doesn't know what those are.",
"I have recently uninstalled the app due to the amount of huge ads that take up the entire screen. Why am I fed ads on my subscription in the app but not in the browser? I've created a shortcut instead, with the only downside being is no dark mode on browser version.",
"Articles with text that floats over images as you scroll are impossible to read. They're janky, bounce around and scroll past what I was reading. I skip them now. Also I get a blank screen when I hit back from a live news page.",
"I love the Times for the article details & background. Their graphics are unparalleled. But this app keeps resetting to the front page, if I set the phone down a min or I'm 20 min into my sudoku. I hate that. Same on my old phone too.",
"Very slow to load images. Freezes constantly mid-article to try to load ads, often several times per article, sometimes to the point of a full crash. Absolutely drinks battery.",
"The app is fine. What is unacceptable is using tense to suggest that the Black Lives Matter movement is in the past, when it is very much still going on and deserves to be treated as a current and urgent issue. Reporting on the movement as having passed implies that enough has been done, and that the world can move ahead in the news cycle. Enough has not been done. A lynching and another unjust killing of black men of color have both taken place in the past week. You must do better, NYT.",
"Stupid, compulsory purchase even though you can get there articles on the net for free. I think they should bite the bullet, make it free to read, and have a premium version that gives you settings, removes ads, change the theme, join the club or whatever and channel in readers that way.",
How is this app so poorly designed? I'm constantly reopening an article and the it resets from the middle to the beginning of the article. Picking up the same article you were reading 2 hours ago in the same place seems like a pretty basic function.,
"Only issues are 1: is that the notifications sometimes bring you to the wrong article or just to the home page. 2: Lack of dark mode. I'm no app developer, but this can't be a difficult fix in 2022; my eyes hurt. Usually very strong journalism, so 5 stars for that - but the app is lacking some basic features.",
The worst interface for customer care ever. This is clearly on purpose. It is not enough to espouse liberal causes and pay lip service when you're own service is incredibly fraudulent. Why is there no option to cancel subscription on the app? Must be a simple addition right??? Why do I have to wait 15 mins on a call with customer care to only hear 'thank you for your patience you are second in line'? The chat option on the app has no text input!! How am I supposed to type???,
"Excellent but not for night time. Great app, not too much notifications and I especially like the Start you day routine. But please add night mode option as some articles I save to read for later in the day. Thank you for implementing the dark theme option (Update).",
"Good app. Decent features to flow headlines and read more. Ad heavy with ocassionllal load lagging even as a digital subscriber, random bad contrast between ads and topic. Ad loading during reading losses text position. Actively developed and bugs getting fixed Getting back to home screen in one click not always possible. Seems to mostly remember where I left off on reading. Better than most other news and social media apps.",
"Cant sort by date. Why can i only see 'top stories' or 'for you'? Who picks what a top story is? I just wanna see the articles in the order they're published. That's a very simple request yet this app does not have that option. I checked all over the settings and nothing. That's absurd, i hope someone can prove me wrong and show me how to sort stories by date. Thanks",
The content is top notch but if I try to read one of the rich media articles it jumps around randomly making it impossible to read and causing extreme frustration. It's worse than not having the app at all.,
"WHY IS THERE NO SEARCH FUNCTION? So many times, there's an article that I remember, or see referenced (in a non-clickable form, looking at you Instagram) on social media. I'd LOVE to be able to find & read it in the app, so I don't have to remember my account PW in yet another browser. Nope. NYT wants to ""curate"" a stream of articles FOR you, but don't you even think about wandering off on your own.",
The app is good. It's not actually about the App. It's regarding subscription and the app's inability to sync my subscription which I did through browser from NYT website. Everytime I'm opening to read an article the app is asking me to subscribe first. It's irritating. Address it.,
"I love the New York Times, but why can't you see comments on the app version of the publication? I talked with the chat folks and they suggested that I try several steps, including logging off and signing back on again, uninstalling and then reinstalling, and nothing has worked so far. I want to see the reader comments on the app, because it gives a greater perspective on me story. But the only way to do that is to go to the website version! Can someone help me please?",
"NY Times wraps facts in propaganda, then overcharges for it.",
"App keeps making ne log in, very painfully.",
"I purchased a subscription on Google Play. The NYT allowed me to log in, but did not recognize me as a paid subscriber. The message was "" you have run out of articles"". The software issue seems to be account validation with Google. The support desk was eager help but could not fix it.",
"Victoria Guardino (The New York Times Customer Care) Nov 29, 2021, 10:21 AM EST Hi Javier, When purchasing a subscription through Apple or Google Play, you are paying them and the NY Times gets a portion of that payment. The issue is that when purchasing through them, the subscriptions created aren't always integrated into our system that holds all subscribers information which then makes it harder for us to help users when they have a problem, like this example with you.",
"Nice app, but it'd be nicer if it could switch to website view, or as near as possible.",
"amazing coverage, quality app. able to request update notifications for certain breaking news",
works well except for the for you section,
"Enlightening and sobering. The realities of national and global population growth cannot be ignored, not only water policy.",
"Sorry, the NYT wants me to pay to look at a couple articles a month. The news is everywhere. Nothing is exclusive anymore. Offer me 10 bucks a year because I live in a flyover state, and I might use this (OK $12 - $1/ month). Besides, after this last year wants to listen to or read news anymore? Just asking.",
"There's a lot to love about the NY Times. The reporting is great and informative, which is why it's a shame that I've decided to unsubscribe after 3 years. The fact that the paper is being taken over and controlled from the inside by a group of ""woke"" bullies has soured me on the paper. Veteran journalists are being fired for morally questionable actions done in the past--such as using the ""n"" word (which was wrong) when explaining why someone was being disciplined for using said word.",
excellent detailed reporting!,
"I want to buy the Indian Subscription but I am not able to do it. Not am I getting their offer price. I cannot get their 600 INR offer. I think you can have a great base of subscribers in India if you put a little effort. Plus you also tend to project India in a very negative and a trivial light. Please improve your Indian Correspondence, because most of the time it lacks depth and thorough research. Otherwise the app is great and usually first source of information for international news.",
I Love the Times! Truly informative!,
"if you can get a deal, digital subscription is worth it even if you can't read it everyday.",
"Worst query system ever. Investigative journalism has an app that resists queries. Do your queries with Google , artificial intelligence is better than no intelligence. Then there are the truly frightening ads that reflect any web activity from any browser. I have learned to hide my tablet in a drawer. I much prefer to sign on online and view the remarkable NYT on a browser.",
"Hands down, the best. I didn't say perfect. I said the best.",
"Great app. NYT has some great journalists and they aren't afraid to dig in to get to the bottom of a story or start a fire storm with their investigative reporting. 45 hates NYT for a reason. Because they aren't afraid of him and not afraid to report the truth despite the constant bashing of ""fake news"" from the current administration. Fake is when its false. Thank you for uncovering this president further & further. Keep at it, the fun just started with impeachment proceedings! 🍑🦵🏼",
"We all need to support journalism, it's key to a vibrant democracy in America.",
App is intuitive and easy to use.,
"Never subscribe! Besides their questionable editorial, good luck trying to ever cancel your subscription - there is no easy, automated tool. You must chat, text, or call a representative and it seems like they only have one person on the job. Be prepared to try, try, and try again over multiple days.",
"There's something major wrong with this app. Its been fine for years, and now you can read headlines, but you click on the story and you get an endless bootloop. Unless they fix this, don't bother to download.",
"It does not allow you to log in. I'm a subscriber and with the other NYT apps (Crossword, Cooking) I have no problem whatsoever logging in. It's very FRUSTRATING. This refers to the app installed in an Android tablet. In a cell phone works just fine",
The NYTs has been my news source since I was 12 years old. That's 62 years. I have always found it the best of the best. However over the last several years I have found it. much more biased off of the editorial page. I am looking for an alternative non biased source of with equal reporting quality but have been unsuccessful to date.,
This app is collecting significant data in the background while idle. My firewall has this app communicating with social media and ad tracking sights almost hourly while not being used. This is also why it's using so much battery. I'll be cancelling my subscription and deleting,
"App often hangs opening articles. Sometimes closing and reopening app helps, other times not. Update: They fixed this previous issue. Ultimately I found the reading experience with so many interstitial ads unenjoyable.",
"the app used to be great, but now it is slow, it freezes and crashes regularly, and it often fails to load the full article. i will be canceling my subscription this month if it continues to not work.",
"App is fairly buggy, crashes a lot, gives me notifications that can't open articles or the articles are mystically gone despite me clicking on the notification almost as soon as it came in. Probably going to uninstall before my free membership is up due to how awful the application is.",
Simple and easy to use. Journalistic work on a huge standart - I dont think I have to explain that further. The App in itself looks and feels professional. And meets all the requirements I'm having for a always-on-the-latest-stand newspaper.,
"There is a big issue on the note 10+, when an article is opened from the facebook app, the ny times app displays a blank page. It was previously working on my note 9. Please fix ASAP. I have had to uninstall the app because of this.",
"App frequently replaces the text in notifications with those of other stories when you have multiple stories, clicking on notifications usually sends me to lists of articles rather than the article it listed, and the app forgets my login info. At this point I just use it to read notifications rather than articles.",
I thimk it is a horrible app. I downloaded it because I trust The New York Times so much. But after trying to use it I could see this is a WORTHLESS APP! I'm totally shocked!!! After a few minutes of trying to use it to see the video of Amy Klubeshar & not being able to... I immediately uninstalled this worthless app!. If this is truly from The New York Times... then I'd like to invite thrm to put this worthless piece of junk where the sun does not shine!,
"The content is great, but the app is subpar. They got rid of nightmode, and when you exit an article, it brings you back to the top. It has sketchy scrolling as well.",
Paid subscription but app shows adverts (and plays advertising videos despite normal video play being turned off) and drains data. Layout of news stories makes browsing difficult. Free websites like the Guardian make a mobile friendly site that is far superior.,
Half the articles won't display when you click the link. Have had numerous conversations with support to no avail. Extremely frustrating and disappointing. Would not recommend.,
"I love the articles and easy accessibility through the app, but the only reason I can't give it five stars is that the display really drains my battery. I can't figure out how to change the screen display from its current White to a dark mode.",
"Good work and covers many things. Seem to be unbiased also. Only thing is that the concentration is US. But they seem to get scoops of local Indian news also. Clearly they give an international view of other countries. Recommend a digital subscription, worth it. You get a good international vision.",
"I like this app and publication, but when I get multiple notifications and try to expand the notifications, it ends up showing the same summary as the first notification. It sure is annoying to have to open the app each time.",
7/12/21 upd i see ads & popular news ONLY. 5/14/21 Emailed dev. App is worthless on android. Is app worse after 5/4/21 update? I'm missing most of the Top News. Starts with Opinion & missing all above that. Crossword grid hasn't worked for MONTHS. Clicking back to top news is wonky with refreshes! Subscriber and still not a fan of app. 1/4/21.Mini crossword is missing the puzzle grid! Click back to top stories it goes to the top of the page leaving me to scroll through to find where I was.,
"Saving articles in this app is always a horrible experience for me. The ""Save Article"" tab is located in different places in different articles, and I can't seem to find where they save to I'm the app. I'm unsure if others have found a better way around this.",
"Simply one of the 4 or 5 best newspapers in our universe, broad in its coverage, accurate in its facts...thoughtful in its editorials. Yes it is ""progressive"" in its general outlook but there are lots of shades of opinion expressed in it. It is a treasure chest of information and an adventure to explore daily ...and it is courageous.",
I love the content but I pay 11$ per month and still have 5 ads per article. This is purely unacceptable and degrade the experience a lot. I'll cancel the subscription with regrets. I have the feeling to pay for seeing a bunch of ads.,
"After 11/18 Update: Suddenly I'm missing the entire bottom row of QWERTY keyboard in Crossword, which renders it useless. Uninstalled/Reinstalled, Refresh, Text Size...nothing fixes this. I'm paying for these games and now cannot play! Please respond!",
Beautifully designed News app - reading and navigation is very pleasant. Even ads rarely feel distracting. I only wish they had more international content but it was only 20$/year in my region(Thailand) which is very reasonable!,
"The interface sometime is frustrating but the new, analysis & commentary are incredible! No matter what your political position, every day there are interesting stories (and, no, I not live anywhere near NYC).",
"Total disaster. I often see 2 copies of the same giant ad in a row. News stories are often just blank white space. Content may suddenly appear later, then disappear as i scroll. Complete waste of time.",
"Fix your dang app! When I tap on a headline notification, it should take me to that story - not to the home page and not to a different story. Period. Look, the news is stressful enough these days without misleading UX errors.",
"The first 3-5 minutes, it was actually very good. The feed is nice but when I was reading an article the app suddenly went blank and logged me out. Happened twice. Uninstalled after only 8 minutes. Your app sucks!",
Very hard to navigate overall. Clicking on a notification doesn't take you to the article but to the home page...often times can't even find the article after that (and the search function was removed or hidden),
"The app works just fine. Anytime my Android is on, I can go on the app and read the articles with no problem. The categories are Most Popular, World News, U.S. News, Politics, Business, New York News, Sports, Arts, Magazine, Photos, Technology, Health, Science, Climate and Environment, Food, Books, Movies, Theater, Style, Celebrity Weddings, Travel, Real Estate, Automobiles, and National Obituaries. There are no pop-ups unless I want them.",
"Fantastic app. I couldn't figure out a flaw after using for so many weeks. But I've got one suggestion. A dark theme. As more apps keep bringing this feature on the table, NYT shouldn't be a laggard in that front. It'll minimize the strain on eyes. Once dark theme arrives, all 5 stars would be visible👌.",
"It's more important than ever to support honest, independent journalism. Sounds like a long-overused cliché. In reality, its importance is difficult to overstate. Truth is losing the information war. NY Times, please keep fighting. You are all absolutely necessary if this toxic tide is ever going to be reversed.",
"The app needs attention. In the Account chat function, there is no input field and selecting any screen option permanently hides the keyboard so the chat can't proceed. Account Management requires password entry at every screen. NYT great content though!",
"I want to like it but it constantly has issues. Now, the widget has now disappeared from my phone entirely. The app often won't let me click on a story, freeze, crashes, etc.",
"No longer holds my place when I return after reading an article. The app scrolls all the way to the top, then I have to scroll down each time to find where I was in the list. Extremely irritating!",
The app flickers incessantly on the front page for news stories that have some type of animated or video content in their headline. Makes it impossible to read the page and is really annoying.,
Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless.,
"I have a paid subscription and the app still has paid ads everywhere. While playing spelling bee, the app frequently never fully loads and displays a circular loading progress bar that never finishes spinning unless you click save and return to the hub.",
"The newspaper and the app are great. Don't show me ads when I am already a subscriber. Make the subscription more expensive if you have to, but do not show ads to customers that are already paying you. The adds are a new thing and they should be removed immediately.",
"Freezes mutiple times and the freezes always happen everytime you get on. EVERYTIME without fail. And I guess turn off your auto rotate because it will restart the whole article. And no, paying for the subscription does not help at all.",
"Constantly reloads. After each article, the app goes completely white and takes a few seconds to reload. I've tried turning off the reload refresh setting to no avail. Terrible user experience.",
"Fantastic journalism; lousy app. To be clear, I love the NYT content and am proud to support quality journalism. I'm talking about app. The paid subscription still has ads, for the NYT itself, to ask you to support it, which you already are, by paying subscription. Why pay for subscription to remove ads if your screen is still going to be covered with an ad? I suggest the app makers look at other quality apps like The Guardian for inspiration on how a paid subscription app should work.",
"New update is a step backwards. Harder to navigate, can't swipe between articles in a section. Freezes more often when internet is lost (which happens often on the subway). Please fix!",
"Plus: access to NYTimes articles Minus: The app itself It has not changed in years. It is very slow (compared to DW), uses lots of data when mobile, and is not nearly as polished as the Apple counterpart (trust me if you see the Apple version you will feel very cheated)",
"Well developed, good news app. Only one noticeable glitch. Push notifications will often take you to the wrong article, and will also flood your phone if you open the app when you haven't for a while.",
"The battery drain is real. Since installing this app, my battery drains at about 10% per hour. That said, I have an older pixel 2 xl so that may play a part. Also, the app is no longer updating to show new articles. I have to use the website to look for news now. At least it's a free app.......",
"7/20/2020: fixed. Back to 5 starts 6/1/2020: Bad Update. Won't even open. Just becomes unresponsive. 7/10/2019: It just works, really well. Reliable, doesn't have bugs, loads fast. Already subscribed to the Times, great extension of print/web.",
"I subscribed about two hours ago. So far NYTimes app and web version have not recognized me as a subscriber. NYT help person on the phone told me NYT can't help me because I went through Google Play, and that I should have subscribed through the NYT web site. This is a waste of time,and it's too bad it involves a reputable company such as the NYT.",
"If you accidentally rotate your phone slightly and it switches from portrait to landscape mode, it loses your place as soon as you rotate back. Have been asking for a fix for months. Come on, NY Times, please fix this already.",
"Always asks for a subscription, more often then not when I click on an article, even though I am logged in with my local library's ""free pass"", and the pass is current for the week. Also doesn't open up current article from Chrome to the app. Always takes me to my last read article.",
Excellent journalism and generally good app. Terrible experience cancelling a subscription: you need to either chat live with an agent (but the chat does not work properly) or call a phone number. Unethical Dark Pattern you should change immediately. Even more so when your journalism criticizes (rightly so) other companies for similar sneaky behavior.,
"Janky and slow on a modern phone; just trying to scroll through an article is painful, and navigating into articles and back takes several seconds. I find this extremely distracting and unpleasant to use.",
"The news is great, as is the opinion section (I subscribed for Paul Krugman). Did something happen to the Android widget? I switched phones, and now I can't find it; it was a great feature, and I hope this is just a bug. Its return would bump my review back up to a 5-star. Thanks!",
"App is so so. When expanding notifications in the notification area they often morph into a different story. Notifications can also become backlogged, popping up a dozen at once when the app is opened.",
"Extremely difficult to cancel my digital subscription. Instead of having a cancel button like other apps, I had to go through a chat bot and waited 10 mins to talk to a human who sent me an essay convincing me to stay. What a painful experience.",
"The top articles, plus information... truth in reporting. It doesn't get any better than this. Additionally, if it is an opinion, they tell you it's an opinion. Thank you, New York Times. As a retired, limited mobility individual you bring my world to me - this means more than you can imagine. From Florida, Thank You again, MMC",
"When I pay for a premium service, the last thing I want to see is incessant, intrusive advertising. Can you say ""double jeopardy""? I'm uninstalling the app, and will most likely cancel my subscription. Having ad content shoved in my face constantly is insulting, and does not override the Times journalistic value.",
After reading a few articles it becomes impossible to load any more. I've deleted the app and reinstalled and still the same. After a year and a half of no problems now it keeps crashing.,
"Despite having paid for the monthly subscription, I cannot access materials. The subscription pop up is displayed and on clicking shows that I have already subscribed. I have written to the app feedback, but no results. 4th day. Pathetic and disappointing.",
I value the attention to detail and the quality of data and research,
"No search function, no full content",
"Real reporting, real facts, opinions noted as such. Like the news used to be before ridiculous politicization.",
"This app works very well on my Huawai Media Pad T3 10 even on a slow 3Mbs connection. Takes about 6 seconds to initially load, but after that all articles load quickly, no lag, no lockups. I experienced none of the problems noted on several of the latest reviews. The sign up process was quck and easy and they have a special first year rate. I went to the NYT to get more balanced and professional articles unlike the mixed bag of bubbled up blogs presented by Google News.",
"Beware the scam. I registered for NYT under a special USD 10 for first year. I accepted this, but opted to pay via Paypal (my paypal account is linked to australian credit card, but i dont live in australia). These guys then proceeded to deduct AUD20 forn my paypal without informing me (a 50% increase in the agreed upon price). And they also informed me that future annual subscritptions would have a similar price increase. So be wary. I wont renew my subscription becuase cant trust these guys.",
"Seems to have issues keeping me logged in. I am getting the banner over the story that says ""You have used up all your free articles for the month"" or whatever, I'll log in for the billionth time, and it'll take me back to the article with the banner still over it, disallowing me to read it. And I know my account is good, because I can read the stories when logged in on a computer. In addition, still having the issues with push notifications not redirecting to the story that it's about.",
Discovered 10 months of recurring monthly charges for this service from Google Play. Canceled on NYT website immediately after reading one article while Google Play proceeded to ghost charged me for a service I didn't use on a platform I never used it on. I didn't even have the app downloaded.,
Why does it suddenly say my device is offline every 5 seconds? I've already uninstalled and reinstalled it twice on my phone,
"I was a long time supporter of the Times, but their shift to a definitive leftist bias over the past few years has made me step back from viewing them as a trusted source. Still a great tool for research and keeping abreast of particular events but nearly everything they print now needs to be filtered out of their lend they've applied to what they call ""journalism.""",
"The content and the layout are great. However, offline reading does not work. What is the purpose of having offline reading settings if the content is not available? I live in New York and read news on the subway, which will be fully internet enabled in... 2032. Could you guys provide real offline functionality until then please?",
"New York Times supplies some of the most informative, real, unbiased articles available. I get more from them than almost any other source of news. The writing is superbly researched, written and executed. I have never been let down by New York Times and I highly recommend them to those that wish to educate themselves, stay informed, be aware and keep their heads above the cacaphony of misinformation that we are forced to endure on the daily.",
The New York Times covers the news in depth and with excellent detail and balance.,
"I've been a subscriber of the NYT via Google Play for 3 years. Over the past year, the app no longer recognizes my subscription and asks me to log in before I can read articles. NYT customer service tells me that I don't have a subscription and to take it up with Google. Not worth the hassle, NYT no longer deserves my money or attention.",
"Facts and in-depth reporting have been essential during a time of corruption, lies, and an attempted coup by none other than the US president himself. The paper has made mistakes in the past yet without all of the brave reporting I'm not sure where this country would be now. I'm appreciative of this and many other publications here and around the world helping hold down democracy. Without the free press, we would be an authoritarian country. Support local newspapers too they are essential.",
*** If you want the NYTimes go directly to the NYTimes*** Do Not get this app through Google Play.  This app was clearly not what I thought I was buying on day one so I called Google to get it worked out.  They suggested I call the NYTimes  which I did and since it did not show I had an account with them they sent me back to Google Play - Wash Rinse Repeat during the week.  Seven Days later I spent another hour on the phone with the Google Play call center in the Philippines and asked to cancel my $125 subscription since I was not getting the features I expected.. They said no  I could not get a refund because it had been more than two days.  This despite my call on day one.   Now I have cancelled the app on line but it will not expire for one full year!  So I am paying for a product that is not delivering as promised.  This is certainly not customer service and is a bad omen for the future of Google.  And I still have to spend $150 to get the NYTimes account I expected initially.,
"This is a great app, and a nice Adjunct to the paper addition. I've used this app for years, relying on the widget to give me real time news. I woke this morning to discover the widget is missing. Please tell me this is a mistake and not permanent. Give me back my widet, please! I've replaced my real time news widget with the Washington Post for now, but please bring back the NYT widget. It's the best!",
"Some of the really low quality articles are making me rethink my subscription. Way too many Trump articles. It's like they haven't moved on. I'm sure he loves the attention, but I'm sick of that guy. Not much on the current administration nor the economy or inflation. And the latest article saying mental illness and gun violence doesn't go hand in hand is just dangerous. It would be great if users could curate topics that interest the user. And why is there no dark mode?",
"NYT app crashes about 60% of the time, soon after startup. The Wall Street Journal app never crashes on the same phone. Why would I ever buy a subscription for the New York Times when their app is so unreliable?",
Really attractive and useable. Only complaint is that tapping the notifications doesn't take you to the specific story. It just opens the app to the home screen. Otherwise very good.,
Excellent article about air quality. Al Gore has been right all along.,
Can't read it anymore. They took away the ability to enlarge the font size. Content is no longer accessible. Plus the app over rides attempts of accomodation via phone settings.,
"NYT sends regular emails to resubscribe. Eventually, after ignoring them for several years, I decide to resubscribe. I follow the link provided in the latest email. It tells me ""an error occurred"". Why ask to resubscribe if the link doesn't work?",
"Absolutely horrible. They nag you repeatedly on the mobile version of the website to download the app, then you get no additional content in the app while giving up personal information for their reselling and analysis purposes. I already pay for a subscription, but apparently that's just not enough, they need to sell my information as well.",
Works pretty well. sometimes confusing how to save articles as the save button my show up in different places depending on type of content. Also find the search bar hard to find...finally found it in the sections menu option,
Comments almost never load. Sharing ofteb doesn't work. Overall just generally pretty buggy for a major app. I enjoy reading the articled but the app needs a lot of improvement. I often need to read through the web browser to find what I'm looking for.,
I want my old version back. You cannot read an entire article or go to the morning in review without the app freezing and then going off entirely. I am a paying NYT subscriber and am getting totally frustrated! Please fix it!,
Really horrible execution on this app. The night mode doesn't work for direct links into the app and the scrolling is often inconsistent and frustrating. Doesn't hold a candle to the Washington Post or axios apps.,
"Edit: this app has vastly improved. After years of avoiding the NYT paywall by using incognito windows, I finally wanted to pay for the quality journalism I've come to love and expect from them. I got super excited to finally be in the elite club of my friends who had the app and unfettered access to the site's content. And the app is amazing... when it loads. I waited till this last update to write this review, but content still loads slow. Bummer, but I'll still pay to support.",
"One of the better papers but sometimes falls into familiar journalistic ruts such as the Both Sides game. Or tone deafness such as chasing after Trump voters but seemingly never asking Hillary voters anything. Deep investigations are usually great. Arts, Science, ey al sections are fabulous. As are the puzzles.",
"I love that there are articles and op-eds on so many different topics. I can read for hours learning about all so many different topics. World news, local news, education, COVID-19, TV, movies, technology, business, the list is almost endless.",
"High quality content for peanuts. 60 rs per month is a great deal. More than the app, I listen to podcasts which are free anyway. Op-ed section is slightly biasing itself towards the left but very often, the news is on point and unbiased.",
"Easy to use app. Homepage features 10 or less top articles, then you need to look around. I do wish it was a little easier to search for specific topics/subjects, but it can be done.",
"Been glitchy lately. I get a notification that has the beginning of one headline, but then when I expand the notification, it is a different one. It seems to take me to the original headline's associated article.",
"This app used to work fine, but now it's extremely slow and doesn't load content reliably. Please fix it or I will be forced to cancel my subscription. UPDATE: I just removed, then re-installed the app and things have improved a bit. Let's see if that was a fix. You can't expect millions of subscribers to do this do you?",
"I really like the way the NYT viewpoint, with high standards of journalism that I feel I can trust. I like the reporting of stories about the rich diversity of cultures that are represented, and not only in NY. It is mind broadening. The app works well, too.",
"Good, reliable app overall. Search is so so. Dark mode was a very good idea and I hope it is back soon. Without dark it is much too bright for my comfort. Looks like other experiments are also gone.",
"Recently, after an Android security update on my Samsung Galaxy s8, the widget has disappeared. I haven't been able to get access to a replacement and would like it to be reinstated and its disappearance explained. Thanks!",
"Love the NYT but the app is ridiculous - everytime I push the link button to subscribe to NYT the app closes out and prohibits signing up!! That's been for 3 days now. The disruptive ads are those that say ""you've used up your free articles - gives subscription pop up and then refuses to let you subscribe!",
"Love the app. Content is one of the greatest. So many sections. The only ask I have - took me forever to find ""Saved for later"" as it was hidden along a long list of sections. I would expect it in some more common (user) area.",
"What really irks me is that when you tap on a news post or breaking news notification on your phone, it just takes you to the main page of the app and you have to manually search for the article. And often times it's really hard to find!!!",
"Even after paying for my digital subscription and working with customer support, I'm not able to access articles and am repeatedly asked to subscribe. I was also told that digital subscriptions cannot be refunded so basically this seems to mean that I gave to forfeit my paid amount because of buggy issue with this app. 😡",
"Straight up truth telling. Incredible investigative journalism. Broad range of interesting topics. I really like being able to customize my favorite topics, politics, science, health and climate, for easy access. Simply the best.",
"I couldn't praise the NYT enough, so I need only say that subscribing is definitely worth your money. The app is generally good, apart from the ocasional crashes and some issues with notifications.",
"The app is borderline unusable in it's current state. It does not actually save all the content for offline reading instead either never loading or saying ""device offline try again later"". And yes my settings are correct.",
"Its The Times, so the content is great. That said, I dont like the recommendation section and find the world news an afterthought in the apps layout. Id love to have more control over the tabs of the app.",
"The widget was a huge part of why the NYT app turned into my first reads. I've been using alternatives ever since, and I find myself in the NYT app a lot less. Pulling the widget without a replacement ready to go was a pretty bad call.",
I like the non-opinion politics articles and that's about it. I had to install this app on my phone because the mobile web address won't recognize my account. I pay a monthly subscription but I see as many ads as I would on a free news site. There is no search bar or any way of bookmarking stories.,
"If you load an article from anywhere outside the app, it says it can't load the article and to search for it instead. usually takes 4-5 tries for it to load. unusable unless you have it on its own.",
"Considering nyt's resources, I'm very surprised how inferior this app is. As soon as the phone tilts the story reloads to the very top! And without internet, text Is not loading. The guardian app doesn't have these issues. Amy story loads without internet. And is faster this app.",
"I live in rural Alabama, where I can only receive NYT paper subscription by mail, often missing timely news coverage. With the app, I can have up-to-date, superior NYT journalism at my fingertips in a few seconds.",
Great overall. I wish there was an easier way to quickly navigate without having to sometimes use the 'back' button' to get from an article back to the main page.,
I subscribed but when I attempted to read an article on FB I could not. If I found an article on FB then searched the app 9 out of 10 I could not find it without being very specific. Otherwise I love the journalism :),
"Great app! Only wish I could see which articles I read on desktop reflected on the app (with the faded headline). Also, wish there was a way to see which articles were in that days paper organized together, like on desktop",
"The ""For You"" section just keeps saying ""an error occured"" and not loading, reinstalling didnt help. Sometimes it says im offline when im not. The ""Most Popular"" section shows a loading spinner for a second, then it goes away and the screen is just blank.",
It keeps updating to a beta format and I have to reload for NY Times. Its in English and yes to your other questions. Ready to drop subscription. I have an OPPO phone and called NY Times and no help. If you don't have an I phone there don't know what to do.,
"I do love the NYT, but like tolerate the app. When you get a notification, of time has passed and you click on the article it doesn't take you to the article. I find this highly inefficient.",
"Just one year ago, the times was an opinion rag; in my opinion. The Times, has changed and, the return to it's roots is why I'm paying for access. My social security is less than $10K annually and my medicine costs almost that, plus the property taxes and government mandated auto insurance ... and I give money to, The New York Times, every month because I feel they earned it. Need I say more?",
"I am paying for a full subscription, and the app will not let me connect an account. Clicking ""connect account"" does nothing. I will cancel permanently if this is not addressed by the end of the month. I'm on a Pixel 5.",
Love the New York Times but hate the application... Seriously why can't they take a look at the Washington Post and follow them to build a robust application that works. This clunker is like a 1910 Model T in comparison. Who are their developers at the NYTImes. Wow. Wow its a hot cesspool despite the awesome content why does it have to block out everything else and then you can't navigate away. Its a POS. Use the web browser instead its actually way more functional......,
"Uninstalled due to lack of ""night mode"" as NYT customer service calls it. It's supposedly coming soon, but I'd rather use the mobile site in dark mode than the app. WSJ and WP have both had dark mode for a long time. NYT app development is behind the times.",
"Well-written, concise articles. Keeps one on top of things.",
"The New York Times is a newspaper like non other. I live in Michigan, read obsessively and I have not found another news source that competes with its coverage of the world. In my book it is the ""world's newspaper"". At the very least it is the USA's top news source. True it does not cover current local events in my city, but get beyond that parameter the NYTIMES has no match.",
"Frequently I find NYT articles that feel more like an opinion column with headlines intended to spin up emotion and stress instead of an article intended to convey facts. I despised trump, but entire headlines and articles were dedicated to White House turmoil rather than actually talking about the policy that day. the bias and drama aren't very palatable, but at least the facts are sourced. I'd like to find a paper that doesn't feel like a propaganda arm. The writing is high quality.",
"Pretty bad user experience. The app is slow, sometimes articles disappear, carousels are difficult to swipe. To enjoy the great NYT journalism, the mobile website is a far better option.",
If you are interested in accurate news then the New York Times is the read for you. When our genius president came to power and started talkin about fake news this would be the opposite. The New York Times has always been the real deal. Because I am not paying for the application I am plagued with pop up advertisements but that's what's to be expected.,
"Updating my payment is *impossible*. The app gives me messages that they couldn't process my payment. So I click the ""Update Payment"" button, which takes me to a page saying my payment is invalid, and links to Google Play support to update my subscription. The link just takes me to Google Play. The NYT is not listed in my subscriptions. The site has nowhere to let me subscribe through Play. Fix your system: all you need to do is retry payment, and it'll go through. Incompetent web devs you have.",
"The website kept telling me it would be better in the app. I just want to read the news, I don't need better notifications and I definitely don't want you watching over my shoulder as I read to optimize engagement. I pay you a subscription and put up with a ridiculous number of ads as it is but some greedy genius decided to ruin the experience even further to push a pointless app that nobody wants. Will uninstall once this review is posted",
"used to love the nyt app and availability on my phone. in the last 2 months though it has gotten slow and weird (freezes constantly, screen flickers, ads are super annoying). I pay for a subscription but plan to cancel because it has gotten really bad.",
"The scroll bar is only visible on dark backgrounds, such as images. Very disorienting when reading long articles (Oneplus 6, Android 11). I was quite happy with the beta app while it was available.",
"It's America's paper of record. Ask your grandparents what a ""newspaper"" was, and why they were once an important pillar of civilization.",
"So many parts of The NYT are solely worth the price. All together, it's a bargain. The opinion columns make sense of the news, the crossword puzzles and other word games are the best in the English language, and the in depth articles the finest in world of journalism.",
"Overall, I like this app. HOWEVER, today an ad from NBC advertising the Olympics is autoplaying, even when I'm not on wifi. This is unacceptable behavior, and I will abandon this app if this isn't fixed, and fixed quickly.",
"""This app may not be optimized for this device."" You ain't kiddin'. No good on Android, Oreo. Shame, it looked like it had lots of promise, too. Aw well; everything is falling apart these days. NYT sends emails with headlines and leaders. There is about a one in ten chance that one will be able to read the story. The rest of the time, it is ""Sorry Charley, only the finest albacore accepted here."" The screen is darkened and a pop up asks if you would like to view your options: no more.",
"I love the comprehensive, compelling articles! Keep up the good work!",
Love this paper. But the app constantly has a bar on the bottom that says Suscribe to NY Times even though I'm alresdy logged in as a subscriber with All Access. I don't like that it's blocking part of my reading area and screen real estate when it doesn't need to. It should know I'm a subscriber.,
"I only installed the app because the website keeps popping up prompts for it. When I first ran it I was given 2 choices: create a new account or login faster with google smart lock... Useless. I am a suscriber but I don't use a gmail account. First page next is ""For you - daily recommendations."" It might be good for people who want to read the ny times ""better"", but me, I don't care. I am uninstalling it now, I have wasted enough time.",
"What the point of removing night mode when you cannot replace it immediately. Couldn't you just leave it in place until the replacement was ready? What shoddy app development is this? Agree with most of the low ratings from anapp development perspective. Good journalism, but lack of professionalism to outsource the app and website development to a competent tech company.",
"For the am'ts charged... This app & it's UX could -and should- be sooo much better. It is not enough, for the content to be solid <--> excellent. I have gone into more detail about this in the past, apparently no-one cared. I see the avg review score has since fallen - quite precipitously. Doubt I'll be renewing...",
"Giving this 1 star because the mobile site constantly bugs you to install the app. Once I say 'no', the site should just leave me alone. I'm a paying customer, NYT should be giving me a better experience, not annoying me into submission. The only reason to so aggressively push the app is to make it easier to collect data from the user.",
"Search function is poor. They leave a lot out from the subscription, constantly asking you to upgrade for $, many teaser articles. Wish paying for a subscription was enough to satisfy their greed. Extreme liberal bias. So liberal, they do not ever notice. Medical coverage not researched well due to novice medical expertise of some authors. Extremely hard to share articles, they do not want you to discuss anything without paying more first.",
This 14th Amendment piece is yet another pin to deflate the bombastic balloon that is Trump. If only...,
"I love The New York Times, but unfortunately I can't afford a subscription so now I just get a tease from great headlines because I have read all my ""free articles."" I'll be deleting this app but that's just a personal thing, if I could afford the subscription I'd keep it and use it regularly, probably so much as it could be a problem lol.",
I read it everyday and is my primary source of news. Warning to MAGA people. It contains actually facts.,
Great writing! Timely reporting! Wonderful columnists! Paul Krugman is the best at economic/political analysis! David Brooks brings humanity into the political realm. I love reading the Times on my phone because I get updates and breaking news all day long. Thank you for providing all the news that is fit to print.,
"Well this app is redundancy on top of redundancy. Not only you can see the news in tv, pc, or mobile browser for free, you can also pay real money to see the exact same news! But here's the catch, on top of paying Real Money!!! You'll also see ads with it!!! If this is not journalism in the 21st century I dont know what is :D. 1 star cause no dark mode.",
very disappointed. Switched from IOS to Pixel 3 and find this app crashes or hangs almost every time i use it. Very frustrating. I can read the headlinea but often when clicking to the story the page does not load. kind if useless.,
"Mini-Crossword has been fixed, but now the top of articles (title and first paragraph) are in white, making it difficult to read. Now the dark mode seems to be missing.",
"Decent for news but the search functionality sucks and if you want to cancel your subscription you have to uninstall the app first and do so through the browser, because their chat function in the app doesn't work with the Android keyboard properly so it's useless",
iOS favoritism. Android app is 2nd class and audio app not available. Please fix.,
"Beta version is not even working and it was a auto update to beta version on my phone, once updated it no longer worked, reason was version of app has expired and had to reinstall app, now i had reinstall like 5 time, i had tried to change the setting in app but still it was automatically updated, I just want to read decent news, opt me out from beta version it is useless",
"I am an avid reader of the NYT and I use this app quite a bit. It appears that Dark mode has completely disappeared, which is frustrating because the Washington Post app has Dark mode across the application without any issues. I would give it 5 stars at least for what I use it for if there was Dark mode.",
"I haven't been able to get articles to open at all. I can see titles for articles, but after trying to open them, the content is not present. I paid for a subscription that I really need & this is pure frustration. Please fix this app!",
I never understood the need to download a news app until I've used the Times'. I find myself preferring it over time on Instagram or Twitter. Quality content in such rich formats and crosswords and so on. Highly recommended!,
Constantly updating. Very annoying. So are the videos. I have asked the app to not auto play videos. They play anyway. Too bad the app doesn't live up to the journalism.,
"NYTimes articles are the gold standard for vetting stories to give information closest to the truth. if you are a skeptic, skip any opinion articles, and compare the research NYT articles require before publishing with your 'trusted' source of news. An honest comparison will show you very few institutions are at the NYT level. I am an independent, and don't view myself in the woke camp.",
"The talented writers give us all the news, good and bad, in a well written, straightforward manner. Yet there is also a deep compassion for the words written, bringing forth the human experience in every story.",
Generally a stable and accessible application. I would like to see a feature like the Washinton Post's e-version of the day's physical newspaper to help remove my reading biases expressed by the search algorithms.,
Refreshes every time I go back to main page to select another article. That means scrolling down Again to the section I was in. Plus ads are slow loading so text on page moves just when I go to pick an article. It has become unusable.,
The full keboard is not displayed for the crossword puzzle. My phone is a Galaxy S9 with the most current update. It is really difficult to work a crossword puzzle when you are missing 7 letters of the alphabet.,
"Since the update on 2/22/2021, half of the keyboard in the crossword and the mini are missing, with no option to scroll the screen up to access the lower part of the keyboard. Using Samsung S10.",
Worst app ever! I have never had an app that crashed fives times in a row upon opening. Nothing wrong with the tablet. Must cancel. This after a couple of years of no problems.,
"I get alerts about particular news stories, but when I click an alert that interests me, it doesn't take me to the story, it just opens the app. But then I can't even find said story when I scroll through the headlines.",
"App has inconsistent notifications. I never get a notification for some things I want and can't find them in the app, e.g. the Morning Briefing. There is no search function or easy way to go from one section to another.",
I pay for this and notifications NEVER take me to the article. Edit: a year later and same issue. Notifications on this app are incredibly annoying. And now I can't find a way to change my subscription type so I'm just cancelling,
Update is terrible. You can not easily swipe between articles or sections. Push notifications do not load. Home screen is not the equivalent of the front page. Useless is kind. Honset description obscured by inability to post expletives.,
"I love the NY Times. My dad was a NYT reader and no matter where he was always found the Times to read. I am grateful in this digital age I don't need to go in search for it. I like the variety of stories, the opinion pieces and the recipes. In this crazy time we are living in it is nice to have a reliable source of news.",
"NYT App is a dumpster fire. No dark mode, buggy, battery-draining, poor/inconsistent menus. This is the embodiment of bad mobile app design. The eye strain from reading for more than 5 minutes is unbearable.",
"The latest update ruined the app. It won't load, or if it does it crashes immediately. Reinstalling fixes the problem, but only for a day or so, then it crashes again.",
you tap on a notification and it opens the article with picture highlighted. the text is blacked out. Even if you tap on the text nothing changes! Disappointing for paying every month!,
"I love the news, so I will give a high rating, but the crossword games are unplayable in the app because the keyboard is under the phone's back buttons. This is part of what I wanted to enjoy with my subscription. And they have no way to give them feedback so I can't even tell them that the app is broken.",
Fascinating! Like a plot to a disaster movie- only more plausible and real!,
"Excellent, high quality journalism in an easy to use application.",
I love many of their podcasts but lately some of the NYT reporting has been disappointing,
January 6th was an insurrection! Any spin to try to play victims is categorically untrue! A full viewing of the videos will make it clear!,
Exceptional reporting. High quality journalism. Worth every cent.,
Absolutely fantastic app from perhaps the best newspaper in the world.,
"Well written article. thank you, NYT reporting the differences of the two African American justices viewpoints on race history. I hope to see more reporting like this.",
"absurdly buggy. long articles will randomly reload and scroll back to the top. tapping notifications frequently brings up a blank white screen, an error, or an entirely different story.",
"Quality News! The best,indepth and comprehensive analysis,ever!",
"App doesn't refresh, I see the same headlines 5 days running.",
excellent article .very helpful visuals. I'll give it a try,
"this app is the absolute worst way go read the times. like honestly half the time it says you have a subscription (I do) and won't let you read anything, the other half itll crash, upon relaunch and trying to reopen the article it'll just launch in browser. ABSOLUTE TRASH",
"Consistently great reporting: factual, penetrating and consequential.",
mostly unbiased news source with an user friendly app.,
"This has become the most frustratingly unreliable app since the most recent updates. Articles frequently do not load, and this morning the entire page was blank when I opened the app to read the morning news. Simpler was better.",
The For You section doesn't load. I am a subscriber and it says an error occurred. The only way i can get to all my saved content is to login a 2nd time and then click on manage subscription. Absolute rubbish.,
"Still the paper of record for our country. Great editorials and a broad range of excellent op-ed writers. The morning summary is as essential as a cup of coffee. The ""Well"" section is always interesting and informative.",
"Never crashes. Loads quickly and cleanly. App is well Laid out and easy to navigate. the notifications usually are specific to what you choose in the app, so no worthless notifications.",
"I read the Times every day, often using this app. The app is easy to use and generally bug- and glitch-free. Make no mistake, I prefer reading the Times on my laptop and desktop, but the app is convenient and usually reliable.",
"BEWARE: if you want to cancel your subscription they make you chat with a chat bot in a browser window, then you have to wait for a specialist... with the browser window open (can't leave the page or it will disconnect the chat). I waited for 10 minutes and then i gave up. We should be able to cancel our subscriptions on the site.. without needing to talk with a specialist, is this a cult?",
For some reason this app doesn't process when I am reading for free through my library. On my Chromebook there's no problem though. It doesn't really make sense because I'm logged into the same account on each device.,
"Keeps crashing with no explanation in all aspects of the app, and if it doesn't crash, instead it goes to the home page, leaving whatever I was doing. Terrible.",
"Can't connect my account for ""full access"", the button literally doesn't work in the app. When I tried to login on the website, it just created a new account and doesn't recognize my subscription, even though I got it through the Google account I logged in with.",
"Poorly designed ui, though looks pretty. One example is the inability to go to a specific article, even if I have the link. I would have to try and search for it. Maddening",
"Usually great with excellent articles and puzzles... when it works. Lately it crashes constantly, hard to even finish an article. Five stars if it decides to start working again.",
"This review is not regarding Nytimes but the app. They built one ridiculous app. Which has to uninstalled and reinstalled again every couple of days as the latest version is available. It doesn't auto update, or if you update manually does not recognize the update.",
"Two very annoying disruptive and distracting behaviors. 1. Asynchronous, un requested refresh while reading the overviews causes resets to the top of the page. 2. Scrollbar jitter while at a static area of an article as ads alternately change layout on obscured areas of the screen.",
"Recently I have noticed that the New York Times changes Like the Wind. At one time they were the Great Grey Lady, not anymore. Better to invest your subscription money into a newspaper with some intestinal fortitude. Also the app sucks.",
"I subscribe to the new york times and was looking forward to using the app. It only wants to let me log in with my google or facebook accounts . My account is under something different. I cannot get past the login screen asking for my google or facebook accounts. I have had to uninstall the app and use the browser instead. As a subscriber, I am disappointed.",
"The best thing that I did during the pandemic was to get a subscription to the New York Times, and start reading articles not only about the pandemic, but about all sorts of things, including an article today about how exercise appears to make older adults brains and memory work better than when we remain sedentary. What a wonderful resource this publication is, it makes me more informed about and connected to all things in this world.",
"Frequently stalls and does not load articles, loses all content when phone moves from portrait to landscape or vice versa. This app makes a digital Times subscription almost a waste of time.",
"l am very conservative but have found the NY Times reporting and opinion articles to be consistently thought provoking without the emotional fear mongering rhetoric and untruths propagated by so-called conservative media. In these difficult times, we need truth more than ever. I will continue to support responsible journalism and opinion pieces as an essential institution of our democracy.",
"Poor operation of the app. Every time I click on an article, I get an error message "" nyt stopped working "" and it closes the whole thing. After paying for the service I can't use, I'm ready to change to the Washington post. .",
FRAUD ALERT! I've cancelled my subscription and several times NYTimes tried to bill me afterwards. Even after twice escalating and getting a promise that I was removed from their system. Exceptionally abysmal. Do not subscribe!,
Ads cause lag. Anytime scrolling over an ad the app lags and stutters and sometimes I have to restart the app to get it to work again. The developers need to fix this issue - it's been a problem for years.,
"Displays ads despite me paying for a subscription. Also there's a very annoying bug that sends me notifications even though I have it set to ""silent"" in the app's settings.",
The morning briefing notification rarely shows up even though it is checked. Often pictures are not shown either. More notification options would be great and additional categories like smarter living.,
The notifications headlines rarely ever link to the article and there is no way to search. It drives me crazy. I finally just turned off the notifications.,
"Problems again and again. This app is so buggy recently, for over a year it was great but now stories won't load until I delete and reinstall it. After a couple weeks the same thing happens.",
"Impossible to read as the app is updating frequently. Impossible to get through an article. Not returned to previous place in an article after an update, nor for that matter, to the same category. Infuriating.",
"Okay - love articles... don't mind the Breaking News can be redundant BUT so hate that when I click a notification it often does NOT go to that article but, instead, the lady article I had open. I am done with that article... show me the new one I clicked on. Duh.",
A great newspaper with top notch reporting that both informs and expands one's perspective.,
"always reliable, always on top of news",
"Notifications need work. Constantly getting notifications that link to the wrong story. Super annoying. Also, says it is up to date until the minute your plane leaves the ground.",
hangs and crashes about 1/3 of the time i use it. this has been my experience on the last 3 phones I've used it on. ok when it works. perhaps find another way to access the Time's important content.,
"Some of the best news in the world that's unfortunately marred by a heinous amount of ads. Nine ads in the middle of a single article is beyond insane, especially for a paid subscriber! Use a web browser with ads blocker instead.",
"Problems loading stories I'm experiencing the same recent problem other users are: failure to load a story or, if I clear my phone cache first, leaving only partial stories. I keep checking the play store looking for a fix, but none is available. Please resolve. I miss my NYT.",
"Doesn't allow for one or two articles a month anymore. Just a way for NYT to keep their claws dug in. Previously, there was a reason to use the app for the occasional article. People won't pay for individual articles *ever.* Once *all* articles are behind a paywall, NYT will lose relevancy as a mainstream news source. Just ask other paywall news sources (oh, you can't!) When people stop sharing NYT links, NYT will die. See if the printed copy will support you then. RIP NYT",
"The New York Times is not news. It's filled with opinion pieces that present themselves as news. It serves only to destroy the idea of American exceptionalism, and to ""reframe"", to use their own term, American history. They focus ten times more energy on promoting stories that paint this Nation as an evil entity, and hardly ever focus on the good that the US has and continues to do for the world and it's people. The New York Times is nothing but a propaganda machine.",
"I've been an NYT reader for awhile, however after switching to Android the stability of the android version of the app is TERRIBLE. Articles almost never load and I constantly have to resort to using the web version to read anything.",
"Can't cancel subscription because ""device is offline"" even though I can load all the news and otherwise access the internet.",
"The app doesn't have a short cut to the front page (or maybe I can't find it). I always have to press ""back"" through all articles I've read since last time that I've been on the front page to get back to the front page. So I've given up and just use the website.",
I Marcos Turner I am getting what I am seeking when it comes to NYTimes in the sense of breaking down concepts in a article form; merging comprehension and bringing fourth understanding to the followers; listeners (y.t.d) year-to-date..,
"Two new updates/features I have to give a big thumbs down to. I don't like that you now have to go to Settings to see if there are any comments on an article -- an unnecessary extra step. Far worse is the new ""For You"" section, which has replaced my ability to arrange the site's sections the way I want. Don't take away users' control over their own reading experience. Don't be like Facebook!",
"Fascinating. I have been sleeping with my mouth taped, as recommended by my DDS. better for my sleep and the dry mouth.",
NYTimes app fails to adapt. I can't even provide a review without limitations. I have google news app. the google app is quick and ahead of nytimes. i have to rely on google news to let me know what ny times has reported. ny times doesnt always alert it's buyers of new stories. they pick and choose.,
"Generally decent news app, but ads load slower than text, disrupting the newsfeed scrolling. Bigger issue is how much storage it eats up in user data. Not sure why, since I have very few personalized settings.",
Overall easy to use and navigate on a small screen. Few persistent glitches like not fully downloading content for offline reading and notifications consistently linking to the wrong articles makes me only give this app four stars.,
This app has gotten really bad recently. It closes randomly and freezes up. Overall the user experience has gone from great to terrible. I will be using the wapo app until it is fixed.,
The app would consistently hang when opening articles from email. When this happened I would get a blank white screen and it would not respond to the back button. I gave up and uninstalled it.,
"Overall excellent experience in using the app. Only one major drawback is that the free subscription of the newspaper is too low, it should be increased because there are a hell lot of avid readers across the globe using this newspaper.",
I've been using the app for years without promblem until a week or two ago. Now app crashes regularly and/or functions differently from day to day. Mini-crossword crashes everyday.,
Bring back the ability to adjust font size within the app. Having to go into accessibility to change the global font size is not acceptable. This is a nonsensical change that degrades the usability of the app.,
"This app is an easy, fast way to find out what is happening in the world.",
Worked well on my Galaxy S9. On my new s10+ there are numerous errors and display issues. The text is often unreadable. i get errors that article could not be retrieved. Basically unusable now.,
"Night mode gone. Forced scroll to top. Way more crashes, especially with games. NYTimes is great, this app *was* ok. This last update made the app terrible. Please roll back the last update, it added nothing and broke so much.",
Get rid of the autoplay ads. They pause any audio I have on in the background. This causes me to not read the nyt when I have audio on. This means I'm now looking at the ads even less. Get rid of autoplay ads.,
"NYT journalists deserve a better app and so do readers. If it weren't for superior content would rate lower. Works on my LG 6 phone but no longer Galaxy tablet. What gives? Update 6/12/2021: after a period of normalcy, no longer loads at all. Update 8/15 After working for a couple of months now getting an ad blocking content that insists I subscribe. I am already subscribed and signed in.",
"when it comes to a thorough analysis of the news, and incredibly deep and meaningful data, the NY Times has few peers. The one thing I would like is for more diverse, left and right, opinion pieces to encourage healthy debate",
"I love the NYT and it's app. especially, now when we need so much truth in media and reporting. I subscribe because I want to support the newspaper even though I know paper newspapers are on the decline. it's my way of saying thank you . thank you for everything they do.",
"Please refine your definition of ""breaking news"". I had to turn this notification off due to regular updates about e-cigarettes and other non-breaking news. Now unfortunately, if there is real breaking news I'm going to miss the notification.",
started happening several months ago! the app/article will 'reload/refersh' on its own. also will slow down to a crawl then crash! am using Android phone. nytimes help your subscribers by getting a real programmer instead of a dabbler!,
Breaking news tends to be news that may be breaking but is not necessarily important enough for a news alert. It gets annoying. Is there any way to adjust my sets for specific news only or is it either or off? Because right now it's staying off.,
"Glitchy, at least on a Galaxy Tab S3. Scrolling is so bad that at times I cannot get to the end of the article. Content, of course, is great, but the tech needs work.",
Got a new phone when the one with my NYT subscription was stolen. There was no option i could see to enter password... I think i might have accidently agreed to pay for a second subscription. It shouldn't be this hard!,
"Since updating app, articles won't open! When clicking on them, screen flickers, then nothing. Have re started phone. If I can't use the app, will end my subscription!!",
"Between the NYT, Wall Street Jounal and Minneapilis Star Tribune, I get a comprehensive and comparative view of the days news of the world.",
"First 24 hours of running, DuckDuckGo app tracking blocker stopped 365 attempts by NYT to sell my data to the following tracking networks: DataDog, Google, comScore, functional software and Twitter. More than any other app on my phone. If NYT can't make a profit off the money I pay without selling out my data for pennies literally hundreds of times a day, you're going to lose both my money and my data.",
"Dear dev team—please debug! App was fine for me until the latest update. Once I updated, the app slowed my phone down and was burning through my battery even when the app itself wasn't open. Love my NYT subscription, and have enjoyed the app so far!",
"I trully adore the NYT!!! To the point that I close an eye on the fact that sold me a 50p monthly membershio (0.05 gbp) and it rather charges me £2. Its journalism is worth much more, so it's fine, and I hope the increments they get go to salaries rises for their amazing journalists. Their monthly news briefing is great (even if since covid arrived in Europe and US it's a bit too much its covering). I also love the fact that they're advertisment is OK: I will even subscribe to a service they advertised, clicking on their advert in the monthly briefing (as soon as I get paid in a few days). it's not outrageouly disgusting as the advertisement that I get on CNN, which honestly revolts me (CNN adverts are powered by Google, and I get adds with photos of dirty toilets - vomitable - of orange staff coming out of ears - really really revolting - and rasors!!! I'm a woman, I never ever browse such items or disgusting staff!)",
"I love the content, but this app uses way too much cellular data. I selected do not autoplay videos in settings, and yet videos still autoplay. It seems most of my data savings settings are being ignored.",
the mist detailed and unexpected news in the world,
"As a yoga therapist who works with assault and acute trauma, this is essential reading. I hope all fields of practitioners see this article. Thanks to the author for her devoted work. Diana Tokaji, author of Surviving Assault.",
"When this app is working its beautifully laid out and easy to read. Unfortunately, it is often unstable on my new Samsung Tab A and either crashes or reloads causing me to lose my place.",
"All media has a bias as it is written by humans who form their own opinions. The NYT is a very strong, healthy news organization and I love both the reporting and opinions. The app works great, capturing links and redirecting to the app for better content. A monthly subscription that can be shared with one other, is a great deal.",
"The daily summaries are so great, and the variety and depth of topics available are so exciting that I wouldn't like to live without it. Highly recommended for factual critical and broad journalism.",
"Frequently fails to start,often closes when you try to move to a different story or even scroll down the page. Have reported this, uninstalledand reinstalled multiple times. Doing so now after multiple issues today.",
"this is the most affordable high quality resource I know. you can share articles to friends for free without having them log in or join. Because I live in central Connecticut, I also have a subscription app to Hartford Courant- which has an advantage of highlighting local news- for a more expensive price. NYT is such a deal.",
"This app is always buggy. Articles fail to open regularly. For a paid subscription, you'd think the app would work better than most free applications, but maybe my expectations are set too high for a news app...i just want to read the news",
"The app is great for a weekday read, but I still read the paper edition on Sunday. The NYTIMES facilitates national and international connections to the arts, politics, science, world events... and helps me understand WHY they're relevant and important. The Times influences HOW to think, but not WHAT to think.",
"Love the paper, hate the app. When I click on a breaking news alert, it takes me to the main page - and often that story can't be found. It's incredibly frustrating.",
"The app occasionally suffers hangups/failure to load/that sort of thing, but it's rare and overall the value of having easy access to the Times, especially in these strange days, cannot be overstated.",
"Well you see, there's right wing and left wing. This one is left leaning most of the time(which is fine) and extremely left for certain content (Strong prejudice to the point it becomes ""just hatred""). As a media, factual analysis should be the norm. But, certain bias is expected of almost all news outlets. American media is probably the worst of them all.",
"The stories/content doesn't update regularly, which is frustrating considering I pay for the digital subscription. I have to go to the Nytimes website (outside of the app) to read updated headlines.",
"The widget got removed and i can't find it anymore. I can't believe why it would be removed, it does nothing to change the functionality of the app and just ruined the experience for me on Android. Going to uninstall it because that's the main reason I had the app on my phone.",
I've tried several times to cancel a NYTimes subscription to no avail. It's seemingly impossible to cancel and i keep getting jerked around by Google and NY Times both pointing fingers at each other. Google's cancellation instructions DON'T WORK!!!!,
"Articles are great. Viewing experience is ok, not great. Doesn't present as a paper, instead topics. Do not purchase a cooking subscription before verifying the app works on your device. There are no refunds.",
"It's a must read paper only if balanced with non navel-watching rags since it seems to studiously avoid both Bronx and Caribbean news. Its news focus lacks recognition of Latin American nations' populations despite their large numbers in the Bronx, in New York City and in the rest of the nation. it's no wonder the Bronx was the last borough to receive Covid19 vaccines. The NYT blindness adds to the deafness of the city government's general neglect for those same migrant groups.",
"Total waste of money. I paid for a year's subscription but neither the NYT app nor website recognizes me a subscriber. Google account won't link. This is a known issue since 2019, but NYT can't fix it and Google Play refused refund request, so I'm out sixty bucks.",
"I prefer my lectures at church on Sundays, not perusing a news site (sic). I can't hold the developers accountable for the slanted news presented but... there's not ONE response from them below to anyone having issues with the app that THEY are responsible for. Not one. I don't see that often, and that says a lot. If they don't care about their own app, why should I?",
I keep signing up for the New York Times through Google I've already paid them two times in one month and when I open the app or try to read online it says that I need to subscribe and shows me payment options. Even though I've already paid twice this month!!,
"Customer support cancelled my entire subscription and that option is no longer offered. The app is not great, the same problems aren't fixed for years. I think the company is too busy buying Wordle and moving into new media to care.",
"I really like the NYT widget, but they removed it several months ago. I really want to see the return of the widget. It's already programmed, I never experienced any bugs or issues with it, and I don't see the reason why it's no longer available.",
Very glitchy app. It frequently crashes or reloads articles while I am in the middle of reading them. Newest glitch is that the articles don't load when I open the app or a new section of the app.,
"Not objective in the writing, just way too influenced by the thinking trends of super liberals...i.e. Super judgemental. The app is annoyingly forceful about subscribing. The content layout could be better for mobile. Not enough multimedia. And then there is that whiney reporting thing again.",
"I may suggest hundreds of missing features, but I'll tell you to just go check out the Guardian app! New York Times is the best newspaper ever, how come you don't have the best app! You can do much better than that.",
"I canceled my subscription because it does not look good visually. It doesn't have a dark mode, and there are four to five advertisements displayed in most articles. The Guardian Newspaper app is my new go to for news.",
"A faithful representation of the web online NYTimes, the app makes quick searching and reading convenient, and notifications highlight key stories for later reading. For one living abroad, it adds value to my subscription, while helping me stay informed.",
"The July 2020 update now cuts off the bottom of the screen, which is a problem for the games and some graphics/charts (like the covid maps). Please fix.",
"The nytimes app is a terrible bandwidth hog. Reading a few articles a week results in over 100 mb of downloaded data. Of course, that data is only used for advertising as the news content is of high quality but insignificant in size. Bombarding paying users with ads and wasting their mobile bandwidth is fairly reckless behavior.",
"My toddler pressed two buttons without me noticing and suddenly I was subscribed to something costing me money every month. Don't even know what it is. I know I shouldn't leave my phone unattended, but there should really be more safety standards than this. At least a confirmation by email. I'm very disappointed.",
"I can never follow links into the app, even from the apps own notifications. They always glitch and return to the homepage. Then I have to search for the story if I'm interested in reading it.",
"The app and login system are just bad. I'm constantly logged out, and it never opens the app from a story, and tries to get you to install the already installed app. Super glitchy. Still true as of early feb.",
"Just uninstalled and reinstalling. The app has started scrolling on its own, unprompted. And I was recently unable to read anything on a flight, no idea why. Think there are now some bugs that need sorting.",
"Great content. Pretty good app. Content aside, the measure of a news medium's app is based on whether they can render the content correctly, which this does well. One slight Improvement would be making it easier to scan the different sections.",
Wonderful source of reliable and trustworty information!,
"To put it simply The New York Times doesn't understand digital editions. I told them many times, but they just ignore it. A great injustice to their excellent reporters and a pity for readers.",
"When you click a new notification, it doesn't always bring you to the article in the notification. Support says they are aware, but how long could this really take to fix? Others here say this issue has lasted for a long time.",
"Terrible customer service. Tried cancelling the service and instead was charged for another month. Took multiple attempts and talking to three different representatives to properly cancel the subscription and never recieves a refund because after being assured by several customer service reps, I was told that NYT does not issue refunds. You can keep my $17. This is the scamiest set up I've ever seen. New York times should be ashamed of this practices just to make a few bucks.",
Total battery hog. It's incredible that an app meant to replace a static piece of paper can be the most resource intensive app on my phone. Just use the website.,
"Without a doubt the worst app I have ever used. It crashes at least twice a day, and freezes on a regular basis. I have paid for access since the NYT raised a pay-wall, but constantly ask myself ""Is this really worth the aggravation?""",
"The app is quite buggy. is doesn't cache frequently while on WiFi and plugged into power, theres lots of times when I just can't scroll down or ads load while scrolling, anf sometimes it just won't load any articles.",
"While I'm a fan of the NYT, the app no longer works properly on my Android. Words disappear halfway through a story, or the content won't download at all. PLEASE correct this. I need my NYT fix!",
"App on my Chromebook is really problematic. Sometimes I can't scroll down an article (little ""hand"" icon appears) and lately the photos don't load. Am uninstalling it and going in via browser.",
"app is fine but every single article fails to load from push notification and instead of providing an easy way to try to load again, the push notification is now gone and there's a search button and i have no idea what the article was about and it's never on top stories or popular and i start to wonder why I'm paying to stay up to date if it generally doesn't work",
"Not perfect, but unlike its critics, it publishes a correction whenever it misses",
"Happy with the content, but the app itself is overly buggy and badly optimized. Doesn't feel great to pay for a service and the app is so amateurly developed, especially from a name as big as The New York Times.",
"Love the NYT but the app is unusable. Can't load a single screen most of the time and can never find notifications. If you have a galaxy phone, stick with the mobile browser version.",
"Has stopped working for me. Everytime I open it it says the version is expired. I uninstall and reinstall from play store, next time I open I get the same error. No problem with my account as web works fine. Have uninstaled and will not reinstall again",
"Please, I need help and find no way to get contact with customer service. I paid for NYT subscription on through google play and now i get no access to my subscription on my account. When I contact google they say the developer must sort the issue out. The once I was able to contact NYT customer service they say google play must sort the access issue out. Meanwhile I have no access to the service I bought.",
One of the best newspapers in the world I subscribe to the digital edition it is a fantastic newspaper especially it's extensive foreign reportage it has a lot of different sections great coverage of America Business it has two magazines a great travel section good science section a wonderful read every day. Very Highly Recommended 10 out of 10. 😃😃😃💘💘💘❤❤❤👽👽👽🤖🤖🤖☠,
"Tge daily briefing never loads when I click the notification - article failed to load,retry. And the headlines of all the articles do not display until after I click on the blank white space where it should be, go to the article, and then go back to the cover.",
"The latest update doesn't seem to load articles properly. It takes so long to the point that I have to keep closing the app, open the app, and find the article I wanted to read to again. Please fix this.",
"The NYT provide excellent reporting that is a given. The app is great at delivering that reporting to the palm of your hand. The app is uncluttered, clear and easy to read and navigate.",
Can't access Times through app as it keeps indicating I have reached my limit for the month. The only options it gives are options for a new subscription. I have been a subscriber for years. Customer service suggested I access through Google.,
"Far too many notifications and no settings option to prevent them. So only option is to tell Android to block them all, which works fine but it's such a strong indicator of very poor app design.",
"Half the time when attempting to sign in the app displays ""no connection"" yet the phone is showing that I am on my wifi network at home and my mobile data is on. The other half it logs me in but will not show content and I've been subscribed for 4 months now. Really bad app. Rates a negative 5 stars.",
"The New York Times holds your credit card info and forces you to renew your subscription forever unless you can then on the phone to ""justify"" your decision to cancel. Terrible customer experience.",
Lot of left wing oriented articles,
App is glitchy. This prompt for a review popped up sooner than the articke I was trying to read. It reloads whike I am in the middle of a paragraph and sends me to the top of the articke or back to the home page. Iy hurts my eyes when it does that. I hate these aggressive prompts for reviews. Each business that sends me emails asking for reviews gets a one-star review from me.,
Unable to log in to subscription on the app since the update. I get logged out with app update and now it won't let me log in. Can't read articles I'm paying for. Very frustrating. No response to messages sent so far...,
"Love the reporting, hate the app. Now when I scroll an article, the app goes into oblivion. Ads have overtaken the news. Unstable. Difficult to read. Headlines go to unreadable font after opened.",
Great app but having to call in order to cancel a subscription sucks (although I did get a good deal out of it). Trying to emulate the WaPo's way inre to digital subscription might hold the Times in good stead.,
They make it really hard to unsubscribe. Wastes so much time unsubscribing. UX dark pattern. Very consumer unfriendly. Ruined my experience with the app. Will never subscribe again. Just add an easy link to unsubscribe or pause the subscription. Don't be evil!,
"Refuses my login, no help from support. Good thing NYT does news better than it does android apps. I put this app on my phone and tablet, but in both places it refuses to log me in. On my desk top I can log in fine. If I access articles via Google news, the Google News App is able to handle my credentials, and negotiate with the NYT web site and present articles. But not via this app.",
"a year after my first review, on a new phone with updated Android, this app continues to provide a horrible user experience. text hops around seemingly randomly. you have to chase paragraphs up and down to try and read them.",
"Articles always fail to load and when they do they are often too dark to read. This app is a battery hog. I wanted to hear the news so I opened the app, turned my brightness all the way down and listened. After 2 hrs I was at 50%. I can get 9 hrs watching YouTube with the brightness half way.",
"Uninstalling since it completely ignores the setting to not auto-play videos. Submitted query to app team and no resolution. So many ads auto-playing videos, I can't read the news which is the reason I subscribed.",
"The app keeps glitching. I download the app and then it stops opening and keeps shutting down, so I have to delete it then and it has been a year and still keeps doing that.",
ponderous. elephantine. update: 2/1/21. this app has become so sluggish over the last few updates that it feels like it runs backwards. digital subscriber since the Times first went on-line -- will revert to browser-only.,
"The content is best, but you have a big opportunity for improvement on the opinion section (the reason I subscribed). I'm surprise to see you don't give direct access by autor or blogs and the only way left to access the content is through the chronological blog roll or the search.",
"Please fix the daily crossword. Lately on Android the keyboard doesn't come up fully, making it impossible to play. Also, I pay for subscription and there are too many ads.",
"Despite having paid a monthly subscription the app logs me out automatically whenever I browse through the news, and because I can't log in, the app keeps notifying me that my free trial is over and that I should buy a subcrisption. Terrible, terrible wait to spend your money. Quite infuriating.",
"Good news, bad app. The notifications never go to the correct article. Plus i subscribed within the app, was billed in google play, but it's still not letting me view the articles and thinks I'm not subscribed!",
Thoughtful articles in a desert of alarmist headlines,
"This is a rating purely for the app (average) not the journalism (first class). Layout options are questionable. Why is the search tool hidden away? Why is the ""For You"" section not seemingly personalised or at least have the option to select topics of interest. Could be a better user experience.",
I'd give it five except for one terrible problem. You get alerts and when you click them it rarely takes you to the story it's alerting you to. It drives me crazy.,
"App is now very buggy, it used to work fine. Since 7.2 update I can no longer view comments (spinning progress indicator only). Also others have noted, screen now often freezing. Please fix!",
The widget merely needed tweaking to allow decreasing the font size or perhaps a format change. It didn't deserve summary execution. Please resurrect it - without it I am unlikely to renew my digital subscription.,
"Love the content, but the app does not work well on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. I always get errors when loading articles from notifications and the color of articles is often off, as if the content isnt properly loading.",
"Worse experience and customer service, I paid a whole year in advance and neither Google or NYT could help me. Google blamed NYT and NYT blamed Google. I have never had any problems with Google so my best bet is that the bug comes from NYT. I recommend to stick to another news source which doesn't scam people.",
"I've been a subscriber since 2019 and pay monthly through my PayPal account AUTOMATICALLY. For the last ! been unable to access articles, my saved articles, favorite sections because the app nor web does not recognize me or my login. But display my account number. I phoned Sunday morning (at 0719am) and spoke with a young lady for nearly 30 minutes, she escalated issue with 'ticket' number but problem persists. I need this fixed. Or get my trusted news elsewhere taking my money with me!",
"App is just terrible. For one most breaking news stories are apart of the ""LIVE"" feature which means they are always posting stories there and they pin certain ones so even if you click the notification for ,say, a Ukrainian story it will take you to the live feed and you'll see the pinned story first. Then if you want to change any settings or subscriptions you have to do it on their website you can't through the app why just why let us do it through the app. 0/10 only subbed b/c my cc pays",
"The app constantly says expired and to download latest version, no matter how many times I download the latest version. I'm paying for a subscription. I don't want to cancel but I won't tolerate this much longer.",
"Dear NYTimes app development team, Please listen to your readers: 1. Restore Night Mode as an option. 2. At least allow readers to disable the ""snapback"" feature (i.e. snapping back to top of page and refreshing after every article read.",
"The credibility of the NYT, in your pocket, plus access to the digital archives. Can't remember if it's $4.99 or $9.99 a month. Either is a bargain Minor quibbles with fonts sizing, but no big deal 😀😎",
Thanks for a most informative article on the ecological impact of the end of the sugar industry and the context of the fires.,
"The articles are fine. Which is to say there's a lack of proofreading in any online news outlet these days. Sad for NYTimes, who deems to holds itself in such high regard. But more importantly, where is night mode? Seriously. Where, and why, did it go?",
"Just bring back the app you used 6 months ago, it was better in every way. Been waiting for months for Dark Mode to come back. Seems forever. Uninstalling. WHAT HAPPENED TO DARK MODE!!!!?? Wish you had noted it in advance,I wouldn't have updated. 2 Thumbs down ↓↓",
"As a paying subscriber, it's outrageous that HALF the front page is advertising. The TOP half. So i open the app and the first thing i see is a big advertisement, not the news or the headline, an ad for shoes. Scrolling through the news provided me with full screen ads every other article. WHY AM I PAYING TO LOOK AT ADS??",
Everybody is complaining about how hard it is to unsubscribe from NY Times & others complain about constantly being directed to the subscription page when they're trying to click on to an article. I think you guys (NY Times) are hurting financially because you've lost a lot of customers due to being so politically biased. You have shot yourself in the foot. LMAO You suck.,
"This app makes ""reading"" the paper more like holding the physical paper in your hands. I feel less guided and likelier to read articles I have been overlooking/missing when using a browser.",
"The only issue I have is it's impossible to play the mini crossword. The third row of the keyboard isn't accessable, even after changing font sizes.",
Slow. Tapping push notifications doesn't always take to the correct deep link. Back button doesn't work if you multitask away. Poor quality from a household brand name.,
"Over half the time, the notifications fail to load the associated article. I like receiving the headlines as notifs, but if the story is a day or two old, it simply doesn't load",
Real problems with this latest version of the app. Takes too long to load or doesn't load at all. The puzzles are so glitchy as to make them unplayable!!,
Works well. Easy enough to use.,
Among my top 3 go to sources of real news and thoughtful opinions.,
The most biased name in news. Period. Keep the rest of my year subscription. You disgust me.,
"if you do not read the NYT you will be scrolling through an avalanche of news. So let the Sulzberger family spoon feed you the latest news, op-ed, opinions and other articles of interest.",
It's fast and easy to use.,
My NYTimes subscription is OBNOXIOUS. WHY DO I HAVE TO LOG INTO MY NYTIMES ACCOUNT EVERY TIME I USE GOOGLE NEWS OR ANYTHING TO READ IT OTHER THAN FLIPBOARD. I DON'T KNOW ANY FRIGGIN PASSWORD AND IT REFUSES TO LET ME USE MY SAVED PASSWORD.,
"Excellent, authentic, and necessary",
An important way to learn about the news from well written and researched articles.,
Why did they revert back to the old UX? No tab for games anymore??!,
Up to date news and information,
i love my subscription!!! especially like Morning Read,
Still some of the best reporting on both sides of the pond.,
"Fine, but everything is locked behind a paywall.",
Always relevant and interesting.,
Check out NYT pitchbot on twitter which regularly calls out the Times for normalizing nazis and fascists. Click carefully - they often promote MAGA white nationalists on the editorial page.,
This newspaper has been telling us the coldheartedtruth about our country since the first day and contributed to our freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.,
Can't live without my NYT every single day. Only way I can keep my sanity being stuck living in Texas.,
This is essential reading that inspires me and gives me hope,
A fascinating piece of writing.,
they have great stuff and do good job!,
My daily go-to. App needs a 'home' button tho,
Amazing original content.,
This article about this amazing man touched and saddened me. Two of my children attended UC Davis and I'm sure we saw David Breax many times coming in and out of Crepeville. It warms my heart to read about the way people in the town responded to him positively while he was alive and with respect now that he is no longer with us.,
Upd: app works again on tablet. Thx.,
"I love the NYT's, it starts my day off right.",
"There's lots of new, which I like. What I dislike is: I get a news alert, I tap on it and it opens in the app, but then it goes away. Not to be found. Frustrating and time consuming looking for it. This needs to be fixed.",
Uninstalled from all devices. This app consumes more battery than every other app combined. Not recommended on a Samsung Galaxy S7. Also content is sometimes so full of Google ads you can barely read the story. Also crashes regularily while reading a story. Better app verification by code developers is required!,
"So buggy. Clicking on a notification never loads the article just brings you to an error. Clickiy an article from the widget gets an error too although that one at least has a ""retry"" button that works.",
"Sadly I'm seeing more and more of the anti-China bias so common in many major news sources today. I feel conflicted as the NYT does produce many incredible articles with impressive research, however, these articles are lost among ones that are produced primarily to promote a western liberal narrative. Good reporting is thus wasted as it gets lost within a sea of incessant agenda-based posting that one has to filter through. It is sad to see such genuinely great reporting being wasted like this.",
"The main page refreshes so often that if you tab off the app to share something, the whole feed resets on you. Feels like I lose the sense of a paper and is replaced with a dopamine pipeline.",
"I've been mulling over whether or not to finally get a NYTimes subscription, but have currently decided not to. The app signs you out practically every time the app is closed, making personalization utterly painful to deal with.",
"This app freezes and crashes consistently. often I'll be reading an article and scrolling will stop working, then the app crashes and I've lost my progress in the article.",
"Always very informative. Great place for breaking news, back stories, updates, and expected events in the future. Easy to read without taking away the integrity of the hard working, well seasoned reporters.",
"All of a sudden the 'dark' setting is almost completely unusable. It's a dark gray background with only a slightly less dark gray text. I appreciate the addition of a night mode, but it would be nice if it was actually usable!",
"NYT produces great journalism and high quality content in general, but they're showing ads despite me paying $17/mo for access to the app. I'll likely cancel the subscription and just use AP since, even though AP shows ads, it's free.",
"App DOES NOT work with Samsung Chrome book. Articles don't load/scroll properly and crossword doesn't load at all.. I have sent 3 emails about this since early June and all I get back in response is ""we will look into it."" Extremely disappointed.",
"Not sure what happened with the app,but notifications have become useless as unless I open them right away they never take me to the actual article mentioned in notification, just to the most recent thing I read or most recent update on the topic.",
Uses too much storage space even at minimal settings. Needs a setting for zero content to be downloaded for offline reading. Could be more responsive going in and out of articles,
"Honestly, I was a bit upset when they started charging for subscriptions, but the money is definitely worth it given quality of news and Web UI/UX design. Great work from the NY Times team.",
"I like the content, journalism etc, but I do not like junk emails cluttering up my inbox. I unsubscribed from everything I could find & still received nearly daily emails. Not cool. So not cool that I cancelled my membership.",
"What happened to the print version on the app? I want it back! Also, not a fan of the sections changes. I just want a list of the sections, not pics of what you think I want.",
"I never write reviews but this made me so angry. They force you to make an account - OK, but they don't let you DELETE it. You can't read anything if you don't subscribe so they entrap you by forcing you to subscribe and making it very difficult for you to unsubscribe and delete your account. You can read stories online about their dirty tactics",
You will never run out of interesting things to read,
Forced to subscribe to the Times when an undergrad freshman half a century ago. The rest is history. Is there a comparison that can be drawn? I dont think so. A class by itself? Yes. The app? The app brings me closer and on the fly.,
The app isn't working for me. I have been a subscriber for 10 years but it's not allowing me to log in. I hit the paywall when I try to read any articles not directly associated with the pandemic. Love the Times reporting but will probably have to rely on the Washington Post now.,
Awesome resource. Tracking the elections - tracking the pandemic across the country down to individual county - invaluable. Keeping news up to date by using all the current technology to make this a great place to gather information!,
"The app is very poor, forcing you to return to the main page before viewing the next article. The articles dealing with factual issues are filled with editorial comments. The times does a good job of finding out many of the things that it's important to know in today's democracy, but they have lost their way in the rest of their reporting.",
"News are ok but app sucks. 90% of times when there are multiple notifications and I select other than last one it still loads last article, one I wanted disappears and due to sucky nonexistent search I'm just frustrated that I can't read article that picked my interest. Please fix this ffs",
"I like the New York Times, but even though I don't like the majority of things Trump does, says or stands for, I think the NY Times is overly biased in their coverage of him and his failing administration. Also, unsubscribing takes over 10 minutes while you wait for a robot in a chat to process the request, which is what inspired me to leave a review in the first place.",
"Fix notifications please! Most articles don't open when i tap on any individual article notification; instead it opens the main page. UPDATE 12/29/2019 Downgraded from 2 to 1 star. A developing story won't even open correctly. NYT, hire a better app developer.",
"On the web, the NYT gives me incessant reminders to use the app, but there is no ""find in page"" option or easy way to open in a browser, so the app is a downgrade from the browser.",
"Updating to 2 stars - Bring back night mode, remove ads for paid subscribers, load saved sections upon exiting / relaunching the app. Content is great, but delivery and user experience is equally important as a digital subscriber.",
"The news content makes this app appealing, but it crashes so often that it's hard to read a single article. Others have mastered this. Fix the blanketyblank app!",
"The leading American news paper. I find the news paper to be fairly centrist, you might find some left or right leaning opinion pieces, but overall its a reliable source for news. One of several news papers I subscribe to. Including multiple news sources, especially outside of your average television media, is important in today's political climate.",
Removal of night mode is the reason for the 2 star review. Putting it back will get a 4. Making it work perfectly will get at 5. The content is great and I like using the Times as a source. Just a bummer the dark mode was removed,
Nothing against the content/journalism but the app is a CPU and data hog. My Pixel 2 gets hot reading news and 15 minutes of reading somehow used 100MB of data. And there are still ads even if you have a subscription. So many ads.,
"I'm a paid subscriber to the Times but it keeps preventing me from reading with these annoying popups. I'm sure these apps are collecting data or something that it's always harping on ""big tech"" about. Terrible user experience.",
"Love the NYT: reporting is consistently top notch and opinion pieces are thought-provoking and interesting. The app itself, though, is a clunky beast that refreshes every single time I read an article.",
"Never glitchy, easy to find the story(ies) I want.",
No reading outloud option. The news and opinions are biased (left-leaning) I do like the ability to comment or at least SEE comments and they are sorted by popularity great for research. No option to listen to articles and there are commercials sprinkled throughout even if you are a premium supporter. I recommend a VPN to block them within the app. Surfshark works well for that. It's not my favorite news source I use it only for research and to gain the perspective of others.,
"the app is super easy to use with a really enjoyable user experience, and very reliable. and, of course, the quality of news coverage for so many issues and topics around the world is second to none.",
"I can't log in to my account in the android app. Once I press log in via Google account, it freezes up - it looks like it's loading. but nothing happens. This way I can't use my subscription. Also, when I do log in to the account via the website, it claims that I'm not a subscriber, while I am. Its a complete rip off!",
"Extremely low quality app. The IOS version is pretty flawless, but this turd can't even consistently load articles, stay logged, or load the correct article referenced in notifications. Embarrassing.",
Can't read in landscape mode or have not been able to figure out how to autorotate the app. Settings menu is bare bones so I use the Wall Street Journal app when I do get a chance to read in my phone.,
Constantly crashing even when reinstalled and have not been able to open let alone read headlines. Only get notifications. Several pleas for assistance have gone unanswered...............,
Full of good information and great journalism,
"Since an April 10 update this app fails to update the news on a ""regular"" timeline. 19 hours? Very annoying as a paid subscription. I've installed and reinstalled the app each week with no success. Very disappointed. I now just go to the website.",
"Fails to handle links from online sites and other apps. Fails to handle links from its own notifications. No I don't want to browse the entire catalog to find the article that caught my attention a second time, thanks",

"Love them or hate them, they are one of the pillars in the US's Media machine, and among the top in the world. Reliable news source with very competitive rates. Spot on reports with balanced articles - relatively speaking since balance is another topic altogether.",
"The app is okay, but when I tap on a push notification about a particular article, I wish it would take me to that article, and not the one I was reading last. Then the notification disappears and I have to hunt around for what I want to read.",
"Love the content. App is nice, but could be a little bit faster, and it would be really awesome if it can save the position in the saved for later articles",
"when clicking an alert in the notification panel, the app gives and error msg, not being able to load the article. click ""retry"", same thing. I click back, and article appears. this happens each time. Samsung Galaxy s9+",
"Excellent Journalism. app is uneven. recent iteration has news ""updates"" that happen too often and lock the interface. still, one of the finest for Journalism.",
App has no dark mode even though it is becoming an industry alternative standard. I have Fuch's dystrophy and the white background and grey font make it extremely difficult to read this paper on the app. Please add dark mode. It'll also help people reading at night ..,
Good content. The links to activate the content are weak.,
Patricia continues to be one of the most insightful writers at the NY times.,
"Thanks for the real, factual and interesting news and current events!",
"In the post Trump world, we find that the very things we took for granted as the bedrock unquestioned values we could always count on, like intelligence, logical reasoning, and integrity, have been denigrated and undermined by Trump and his minions. The New York Times maintains these values to the highest degree. It's no accident that Trump singled out the New York Times as a specific target, because they represent the best of America. ...exactly what he specifically sought to destroy.",
It is super annoying that this app asks all the time to sign in with either its account or my Google account,
"Pithy characterizations using cultural signposts. Serious fun, thoughtful and possibly inducing thoughts about the nature of being a United States American. (Everyone in the Americas is American, to take over American for just one nation could suggest an essence of territorial Putin-esque possessiveness).",
"The Times delivers, as always. Worth the subscription!",
I can't figure out how to listen to articles. Perhaps it's only available for Apple. I'm going to cancel my subscription,
"I used to be a fan of NTYT until it published one of the eye catching news about my country, Philippines. The news didn't present two sides why there were trials between the network and the government and what were the reasons why the network in my country was shut down. It must be very interesting news because it's worldwide yet TNYTs got only one sided information. I hope they won't print such bias news. This turned to be fallicious report.",
Text size too small and can't zoom in to photos,
Pay for subscription app won't link and keeps trying to get me to repurchase new subscription 😑,
"Clarity, calm, maturity and reason that stands apart.",
Purchased all-access but am unable to access anything from the NYT.,
NY Times has always been one of the most highly respected news outlets in the world.,
"5 stars until latest Android update (Pie). Not compatible with new ""Dark Mode"". Notification stories fail to load when selected, and articles sometimes load with a black background and dark grey text within the app itself.",
I strongly resent that I cannot for my subscription price get cooking but worse than that and the reason I knocked off a star is for all of the teasers that lead to a story on cooking when I click for recipe then I'm informed I must subscribe but I do subscribe to the times online news service I live in a town where home delivery which I used to get is so expensive and it's ridiculous at least you are still giving us all beer a small version of a crossword puzzle that's the other reason minus-1,
an amazing article that concisely summarizes and connects so many dots,
User friendly app. Easy to share articles.,
One of the very best sources of journalism out there.,
it's said that no news is good news. NYTimes is the exception 👍,
"love the app. it would be great to give the option of a text size slider rather than the current ""small, medium, large..."" discrete choices.",
"Haven't upgraded my rating from lowest possible in the past year. This app is an absolute resource hog. It routinely locks up my phone with its content updates. I subscribe to support their journalism, but getting really sick of this garbage app.",
"All of a sudden, horizontal swipe no longer works to move between stories, eliminating main value of app. What happened? Might as well use browser instead.",
Not everyone is being accounted for starting from the top to the bottom. Cameras are stationary and people has figured out how to maneuver expecially people that share common grounds with Hi-Tech technology.,
I used to enjoy reading the NYT and even defend it as one of the best non biased publications out there. I can no longer do this. It has become a mouth piece for radical leftist propaganda now. It has deeply saddened me to see the journalistic integrity of the Times plummet over the past few years.,
"This app displays articles written by journalists. It's similar to a newspaper, but better. You can save articles to read later, the subscription is affordable and the coverage is far and wide. My favourite feature of digital NYT is the interactive articles. They are essentially on par with The Daily Prophet, the living newspaper from Harry Potter where mugshots scream out.",
"Uninstalling as its determined to get me to sign up. I realise I'm getting something for nothing but prefer to support apps by receiving a reasonable level of ads, NOT by creating an account. Others will feel the opposite way, all good!",
It's a horrible app. Links don't work correctly. The UI is atrocious I'm not really sure what these people are thinking. there's no excuse for a news organization with the type of revenue that the New York times has to not have a functional app in the year 2020. It would have been an embarrassing app in 2010. Epic fail.,
No way to disable personalized ads (same irrelevant ads over and over). I'm done! Articles tailored for me are of zero interest to me.,
"So janky! When scrolling, the page stutters so much. Usually because it's loading an ad. Terrible experience for paying subscribers. Tried clearing data and reinstalling, but not better.",
"app is decent. but forces ads on subscribers. because of the ads, i find it a better experience to open articles in a mobile browser with ad block rather than using the app for anything other than offline articles.",
"Frustrating beyond belief, have to log in each time I close app, can never find a previous day's edition. I use this app perhaps once a week, just not compatible with samsung I guess.",
"Desperately trying to stay alive in the digital era so now you're charging $5 a month to look at any kind of recipe or anything that's not some bs thrown-together daily article?? No thanks, I'll run a pop-up blocker and screenshot my favorite recipes so I never have to come back here again, thanks!",
"UNINSTALLED! This app just keeps getting worse. i can't read any articles. I just get the spinning wheel (hello 1990!) and if I sign out it's a neverending loop of signing in, change your password, etc.",
"(April 2019)I've had the app for a few months. It worked fine until recently...articles won't load. It seems I'm not alone with this problem. (Update June 3, 2019) Yesterday, the app wouldn't open...just a flash on the screen. Today I uninstalled, and now it won't re-install.",
"I just cancelled my subscription because of the latest Android update - removing the section scroll at the top makes it ridiculously difficult to browse articles. Customer Service only said ""we'll pass on your input to developers"". Too bad, NYT is one of my favorite news sources and clearly NOT listening to users.",
I have really enjoyed my subscription. I get to read the headlines on notification to see if want to read it. I stay informed and the part I love is that they have a covid tracker that you can select any state/ county you want to follow. I have 3 states and 2 county's I watch daily. I trust this paper and that is why even though I live in the West Coast I subscribe to this paper.,
"Horrible app.. paid subscriber, don't mind their journalism efforts but the app experience is unbearable, thought this would be improved so that you can atleast read an article it gives you a notification about.. but Nooo, think I'll stop paying for something that makes me want to pound my head into a wall, before I even get to the frustration that is the news",
"Push notifications never take you the article directly but to the home page instead. Pain to search for it manually, if you can find it at all. The fact that there are video ads for a *paid* subscription is also pretty ridiculous.",
"The mobile app is excellent, perfectly suited to my Android phone",
"Sometimes it logs me out which is annoying. I think that is more when I click a story via Facebook or Twitter. Other than that nicely presented, professional looking. And easy to navigate.",
"DO YOU NOT READ EMAILS!!!!??? I subscribed to the NYT a few days ago, but I subscribed twice by accident.  One subscription was made for Basic($53.09). And the other was made for All Access($78.75). I sent an email to you days ago to that effect but there is no reply. Most ANNOYING! Two payments for one subscription is ridiculous! PLEASE RESPOND!",
"I was getting their free daily emails a couple of years ago and when the 1st impeachment trial started I wanted to be in the know and I signed up for a subscription, best move I made. good coverage of all the bug topics. I've been a subscriber ever since.",
"I am stuck with old news from NYT. Every time I try to open the app, I get message that my device is offline with a request to retry. Retrying doesn't help. All my other online subscriptions work fine.",
"There content is top notch. The app is incredibly power hungry, devouring 2% power per minute sometimes, while just reading and scrolling an article. Please fix your inefficient code!",
"It baffles me that a news site/app intended for reading does not have a ""dark mode"" or ""night mode"" by 2022. They clearly don't care for the readers experience. Will likely end up canceling and sticking to wapo with their more functional app.",
"I've been videotaping the City during these last days of lockdown. As sad as it is to see her empty, it's also a dream to have her all to myself. Soon, my long shots of empty streets will end. Well... except on early Sunday mornings, where it looks as abandoned as a SF set. :)",
"I don't know how the app is, but it's incredibly annoying to have to endure a prompt to use it maybe 10 times a day on web/mobile. The prompt fills the whole screen so its very invasive. Please reconsider your Web design",
"The Times brings new and original stories each day, not rehashes of old on-line stories that you read days ago. It is also one of America's few news outlets that provides real international news analysis, not just international PR pieces. Keep up the great work!",
this app keeps asking me to download the latest app when I already have the updated version. emailing the support takes a long long time to resolve your concern and takes quite a longer time to get an update for the cancellation of my subscription. I deserve a refund here and they haven't even got back to me for that. disappointing,
"This app is a great way to access the news! I'm not a payed subscriber, but everytime I'm in the middle of reading, a message pops up and says Subscribe to read more. It is really frustrating! Please fix this! I'm deleting this app! So useless",
A daily publication of international standing and importance.,
My top news today: 2 big ads. What am I paying the monthly subscription for? This has been going on for at least a month. The right thing to do is refund or give people free subscription until this issue is fixed.,
"I love the nytimes but the app isn't very good. It is very slow and it gets stuck often. My phone is not the best, but I don't have this problem with other apps or when I load the site in Chrome.",
Finally decided to pay for the full puzzle after years of the mini. Worked for two days now it looks like I never subscribed. Won't let me log back in. It's my Google account so not a credentials issue. Can't find an email for support. WTH?,
"I am an online subscriber and look forward to the good, informed writing I get from this. I was particularly interested today in two articles: 1. the article about Mr Sheehan's role in the Pentagon Papers being published. I remember that well, being 23 at the time; 2. the article regarding some of the people involved in the storming and looting of the Capitol Building. A sad mess. Keep up the Good Work and Thanks to All of Your Staff!",
"I am almost 74 years old and this is a great Newspaper that my father, grandfather read everyday. this is a paper that separates news from opinion. I read 4 news papers every day including the WSJ, Washington Post and The Miami Herald. yes the Editorial pages are different but the news is the news.",
"Doesn't work well when your cell connection isnt great (like on the subway) which is typically when I read the news. Also I shouldn't see ads on something I'm paying for. unsubscribed, uninstalled",
"Earlier (2019, 2020) versions froze and crashed constantly. Happy to say that the problem has been fixed and reading the paper is a dream, almost as good as a delivered copy.",
NYTimes adds a broader and more in depth perspective that I don't always find in the Seattle papers...it is a joy to access the East coast view which is more global than the west. Thanks!,
For past 3 days the NYTimes android app will not open. Uninstalled and reinstalled without improvement. Powered off phone and restarted without improvement. Sent messages. Very frustrating .,
The best source of thoughtful critically important information today.,
Tapping push notifications doesn't take you to the right article. Frequently can't even find the article that I was notified about. Otherwise I think the app is nice.,
"For such a wealthy organization,with so many resources,I thought the software would be less demanding of my time and attention. I just want to read the damn articles. I am so tired of having to login and jump through hoops. It's uninstalled and I'm not paying any more damn money.",
"CANCEL WITH YOUR BANK (PAYPAL) ITS QUICKER. Really love the journalism. Unfortunately when you press cancel, you have to then chat to a chat bot. But you can't type. And UK phone number doesn't exist. This is a fraudulent way to achieve recurring revenue. In PayPal you can remove PayPal as the approved method for NYT transaction to bypass this fraudulent process by nyt. I was cancelling to take a break from digital media. Might have resubscribed in future, but never will after above experience",
"I'm very happy to have this app, but the fact that you cannot shut off notifications is a major flaw. When I uninstall and delete this app, it will be precisely because you cannot shut off the notifications. It's really not acceptable this way.",
"The content of the articles is great. However the app itself is not. My biggest complaint is that it even with video autoplay turned off, it still autoplays video ads, even when on data.",
"I loved reading the post. All the news I needed in one spot. I was on a 7day trial, wish I could afford to continue with the Post. Unfortunately I can't afford to pay a monthly charge for the paper.. If you can afford to pay a monthly fee, this would be hour best choice in my opinion. I am going to miss the Post.",
"A long read, but worth it. Knowing about her parents, their lives, struggles, and triumphs gives a good look into who our new Vice President is. Their meeting in the 60's appears providential and history making in a multitude of ways. Great article!",
"Have been getting notifications lately that, whrn i click them, open totally unrelated articles. For example, I just clicked on a notification about 'China's slowing economy' only to open an ariticle about 'Toni Morrison, Nobel-winning author'. This is quite bothersome.",
"This article does not highlight that the fitting and sale of digital processing hearing aids ( just as with the fitting and sale of single vision lenses and frames) is a lucrative business when compared to other service provided by otolaryngologists / audiologists ( optometrists/ ophthalmologists) for the amount of effort and office space required. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but plays into motivations of all parties involved when it comes to legislation and the effects on livelihoods.",
A must have app that I use on a daily basis. It's easy to use and feature-rich.,
For some reason the app has removed the vertical scroll bar from the display of articles being read making it impossible to determine just how long the article is. I've never seen anything like that before and I vehemently disagree with whoever made the decision to do it.,
"Great app. Much improved. Used to crash frequently, but has been fixed. Slow to load because of the large graphic content.",
"I'm having.problems loading.articles, they often dont load or load only partial content. Noticed since mid-March, possibly incompatible with Samsung updates on my Note 9 phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still having problems",
"This current version has text in odd combinations - white, light or dark grey and black text, in Singapore daylight hours. I'm not sure if this is a general app issue or a miss-syncing with SGP hours. Nonetheless, it's not conductive for reading. NYT contents still great, trying to read is not. Please fix or advice.",
"Always asks for version upgradation, dozens of time installed the app, and later forcefully uninstalled as there happens to be no updates available. Taken the subscription, and not able to read the news, waste of time and money.",
I'm having problems in that it opens other settings during the app I'm using and opens other apps as well. This needs to be addressed. I've sent an indepth email to your website. Thank you.,
It is the best source of international news as it always has been. I enjoy the opinion pieces. They are usually well thought out analyses of what is happening or what trends they are seeing. Most of all I see this newspaper as a real newspaper. They report things that they see or hear and you can make your own judgment of the facts.,
Non-stop fossil fuel ads. Seems like the Times runs PR for the carbon majors.,
increasing fees....anyone know how to unsubscribe or do a lower subscription?,
NYT has been the best source of information I can find on the internet for the last 3 years that I have subscribed. I get annoyed that the notifications I receive will not led to pages and that I cannot easily search for articles in the app.,
"The app is constantly updating/refreshing. This ruins my scrolling, causing me to wait for the front page to refresh & sending me back to the top of the page. At this point I'm doing most of my reading on the mobile site.",
"Also experiencing the same issue as the commenter below me. When I click on a news story or the morning newsletter notification, there is a 50% chance the actual story will appear instead of a random old story. And my newsletter is also defaulting to bringing me to an old December 3rd story. Get it together, NYT!",
"Fraudulent billing practices! I have an NYT Games subscription that I'm trying to cancel. The website says it's paid via Google Subscriptions but my PayPal acct is being charged and Google has no record of it. All in all, this is an $8/month reminder of why I now read WaPo.",
"Signing up for the nyt with Google subscriptions was a mistake. You can't access the nyt anywhere other than this terrible app, your subscription will not link to your nyt account ever.",
"If you pay for a subscription here, it's not a real subscription, it's only good for the android app- you can't access the new york times in a web browser or from a computer.",
"Uninstalled! Already paying monthly subscription. Have been giving NYT money for months. However, App lets me sign in but still asks me to pay. This issue should be resolved promptly.",
"Cannot log in using Google account. Acts like it's logging in, then immediately fails and asks to log in again. So much for the NYTimes deal Google had going.",
"The standards have gone down. I used to subscribe to it but now it's just hypocritical propaganda from the far-left. And I'm not even American. I ran away from an authoritarian regime when I was young, and I'm seeing that level of propaganda from NYT.",
"Love reading the New York Times digitally!! I get to read some of the best writers from all over the world, have a plethora of up to date information, and other articles that interest me about life, food, etc. - plus! Information that's relevant to my area. What isn't there to love about that?",
Navigation is horrendously counter intuitive.,
"This app can be pretty useless, you'll get a notification but it just tells you it can't find the article and to use the search function. If you come across an NYT link and try to open it, it will do thw same.",
"It's okay. It often gives notifications but when I click on the notification it usually doesn't open the article, which is really annoying.",
"To be able to save articles for later is a good thing. But it would be much better if the app could also remember where I interrupted my reading, a bookmark of sorts...",
"App keep asking me to upgrade. Has happened twice. i have uninstalled and reinstalled to the latest 9 dec 2019 version, it ran. now it shows again that this version 8.3.0/50022 has expired. Does being in a different timezone (GMT +7) gets my app expired quicker when the app update isnt even available yet.",
"No sharing options. Videos play in a tiny box and reload if the phone's orientation is changed. News notifications are nice, but wish it was a better app.",
Make it difficult to cancel. Cancel in the link takes you to a page with an American Number then another link to a list of countries. Which is not formatted to Mobile so you can't read the number that are you are calling like it's 1990. Oh and the office hours from midday.,
"Widgets seem to have disappeared from my phone and I cannot add them back. Were they removed? Welp after further reading I see thus far, for some inexplicable reason they deliberately removed widgets. Widgets were my sole reason for using the app but now I can get rid of this app and access my paid subscription through the browser and block the obnoxious ads. Seriously considering the Guardian.",
Journalism written with integrity.,
"I'm a paid subscriber, who only purchased a subscription because of the widget. However, the widget was apparently removed. I have rated the app as one star because of that, and will most likely unsubscribe. The app without the widget is all but useless to me.",
Third rate app. Search doesn't work. Chat client doesn't work properly. In chat mode the keypad disappears. Impossible to cancel subscription from phone.,
When clicking notifications I am rarely taken to the story I am being alerted about. Rather I am directed to the home screen of the app. Also the search function has been removed so I can't even find the story I was alerted about....,
Too many distracting Advertisements; more than using any browser. I paid monthly subscription to focus in reading. No way to remove ads. Do not waste your time and money. Go free on chrome without disgusting ads.,
"Quality material, excellent writing, correct journalism. My children (ages 10, 12 and 15) and I share stories - they benefit substantially by thinking more about the stories and current events; we all have better engaging discussions with one another.",
"Subscriptions to investigative journalism have always been a critical part of being an informed, thoughtful individual. In the age of Facebook & Google taking over advertising (revenues) upon which journalism was funded, subscriptions are far more crucial today, and a way of maintaining a piece of personal independence. Especially when read outside of FB's & G's surveillance mechanisms.",
"There was a dialog modal showing up on screen to update the app. There is no way to close it. And when I come to play store, I see only uninstall and open options. So I chose to uninstall. Bye bye",
Rapidly kills my battery. I've blocked this app from running in the background and it still will use 40% of my battery in the background. Considering ending my subscription to the paper due to how much this app impacts my overall battery life even when not in use.,
Cancelling a subscription is like going through hell seven times over. The amount of time I've lost on them (and still not got my subscription cancelled) is probably worth more than what I have paid for access.,
"I use this app every day. I have 2 wishes to make it better. Put a search magnifier somewhere handy, like on the sections page. The second is to enable a night mode. Other papers I read have it.",
"New app has a clunkier UI. Can't swipe across different sections anymore. The share button shares the wrong article if you've opened an article from the ""more stories"" at the bottom of another article.",
"Good resource. needs to work out bugs in moving from other platform links to re organize you are a NYT subscriber. too often, I am told I need to subscribe and then have to go to the NYT app to find the article.",
"Surprisingly terrible app for a great news organization. No dark mode, and barley any options for accessibility. I downloaded it, used for about 5 min, and will now immediately delete. If you want a good news app go with Washington Post. NYT- Your app is hot garbage and you need to fix it.",
"this app is incredibly slow on both my IOS and Android devices, are not the most current models. You should have sympathy on those those devices are one or two years old. On my Android device I can't comment on articles. But I will continue to read the Newspaper of Record.",
"Love the times, but the app itself is a bit glitchy sometimes. Never really bad enough to prevent me reading an article or watching/listening to files though.",
"Awesomely thorough coverage, dogged, groundbreaking investigations. A must- have for those who care about facts, staying informed, and the vital role of a free press in preserving democracy. An all-digital subscription is just $10 a month. Well worth it!",
"Worked fine for about eight months. Now it doesn't. Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling, still won't work. Very frustrating. It's a couple of months later and this seems to be a recurring issue.",
"I get pop-up notifications about stories so when I see something I want to read, I click on it. More often than not, this takes me to the home page not the story. This is frustrating and I'm waiting for the fix",
"This app is terrible. This is exactly why people don't subscribe to newspaper companies. Performance is inconsistent at best, no option on links people send to open in app, and littered with more ads than content. Go learn something from WaPo.",
"I downloaded program, installed it, but when I opened it on my phone, I keep getting the error message that my device is offline. What is wrong when your app can't tell when my device which just downloaded and installed your app, refuses to recognize the fact that it is indeed online.",
The news is great but the games are no longer playable. If this were a traditional keyboard and not a touchscreen I would say there was a sticky key somewhere.,
"Real News Here ! , I Trust The New York Times , For Bein Trustworthy Real News",
"What happened to all my saved for later? Why can't I see anything that I've saved for later on either my phone app or my tablet app? I can see it on the desktop, but that isn't very helpful. Also I can no longer save in either the phone or tablet, so anything that I think I've saved since September 29 is just gone...",
"Disappointing, not as good as the WaPo app and should be better. Frequently hangs on startup when trying to load Top Stories. Please fix as I would prefer using an app to viewing content in Chrome.",
Checking and comparing info from one great news information outlet to another. As well as enjoying other aspects of WHT the New York Times is known for. Literary ratings to technology going on now. Great recipes and articles for your health. Even in print the NYT has always been number one for me.,
"Please fix the bug which takes me back to the top page each time I return from reading an article. I lose my place in the scroll, and it's very frustrating.",
"annoying autoplay videos, cannot stop them even in settings. NYT no longer updating with news. App keeps old stories as top news for days. when I set the app to never play videos, I mean ALL VIDEOS.",
"Primordial. I cannot scroll with up/down arrows on my laptop keyboard. There are vast, empty spaces, no photos, and the print is miniscule.",
"I find so many very interesting articles each day. I do wish there where more condensed sections, because the detailed information is good, but takes a lot of time to read such lenghtly stories. But watch out for free trials rhat expire. They will grab your money anyway they can. They know all the tricks. Cancel a week ahead of time ane stop them at the money source, if you don't want to continue the on-line news with them. Tell your bank or credit company not to pay them past the end date.",
"Lately, I've been unable to read articles, as they do not fully load. This is quite frustrating. It seems ridiculous to weekly (at least) uninstall and reinstall this app. Please fix this!",
"Always direct without exaggeration. Polite, evento the worst.",
"Least functional app on my phone. Rarely displays more than one article without completely failing. More errors and ""app has stopped working"" messages per day than every other app on my phone has per year.",
"Its worth it to subscribe, unfortunatly, if youre poor like me & cant afford it in liu of a days meal, it just gets incredibly frustrating to see a bunch of stuff you might be interested in but cant read. But its well-worth paying for the subscription if you can & supporting independant journalism.",
"Excellent, timely articles and Wordle.",
wonderful news source. the app is easy to navigate. daily emails that contain a snapshot of the headlines are a great way to keep informed.,
Video could use picture-in-picture. Otherwise great reporting though sometimes has an establishment bias. The app is well designed and thought out.,
"I like the Times, until today. The mini puzzle WAS free. Now, NT WON'T let me play unless I subscribe! Black mail!! I'm a Vietnam Veteran living on SSI and my small military pension and I wish you had an affordable rate for me for a full subscription! If I can't play this puzzle, I might as well delete this APP; as it was once a free feature and what I looked forward to each day! THANK YOU to NT for reeming me too...If you are a retired Veteran DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! SHAME ON NT!!",
"The app frequently fails to load articles. need to close out app and restart to get then to load again. App does not automatically update content when opened. need to manually pull to refresh. More recently it has started to use way more mobile data than ever. In the course of reading 5-10 articles, the app used up 0.4 GB of data. I can now only use the app when on wifi, which had made me use other sources for news when I am out of the house.",
The last update ruined the app. It freezes and articles don't load. The keyboard for the mini crossword is cut off. It's pretty much unusable.,
"Science can't explain or directly observe conscious experience which is a combination of love and understanding. This experience is associated with brains, but is a separate reality not subject to decomposition such as a brain undergoes at death. It can't decompose! It's our everyday conceptions. Nothing material could exist unless it could first be conceived! All sacred religions focus on this reality of the Human Spirit. Find the ones that accept others as true & agree with science.",
very well done app. not flooded with advertisementdespite there are some. easy to adjust the font size. tricky to find older articles again to reread.,
"The app lags on opening from notifications, which is fairly egregious, I click on the banner to read the article, yet I more often than not have to manually refresh the app to see it.",
"I like the short snippets, well crafted with links should I want to dig deeper. The articles are well balanced (as far as I can tell), and I always feel well informed.",
"Notifications do not take you to the article. I click on a pop up notification, I expect to be taken to that headline, it does not. Today it took me to the ""Today's News"" Wich didn't have that headline if I scrolled down.",
The ultimate in 'click bait'. The notifications say one headline but if you click on it you get a totally different unrelated story. Mostly useless.,
"The news is great, but the loss of the option to have dark mode is really a big negative for me. It makes me often use other news apps in the evening.",
"Frankly the best newspaper app I've used. Well worth the sub. Only thing it is missing is colour options, ie a sepia colouring and a dark mode. Also the font they use is just beautiful 😍",
"I am a long time subscriber and have waited for a very long time for this app to get it right. For the kind of dough that the New York times makes, being a premier paper and having oodles of subscribers, you would think that they could spend some cash and make this app work right.",
"NYT is home to outstanding journalism, but the mobile app has critical issues. Frequent freezes, heavy network and power consumption, and unresponsivness. This latest update needs immediate attention.",
Incredible research and writing. Almost every day I learn something new and critical. The fact that I can trust NYT's vigorous journalistic standards is invaluable in this age of misinformation.,
I've always wanted to be able to read the New York Times since young being many teachers spoke highly about it. this digital platform is unbelievable it gives you access to the entire history of article at they disposal.,
reads more like a spy thrower science fiction epic. diligent reporting in the fascinating story. love the times for reporting these kinds of stories and count on them to do what other publications can't seem to do or want to do.,
"1)Type in password(to change obscene amount of notifications) 2)Says ""incorrect"" 3)I reset password 4)Type in ""incorrect"" password 5)Says ""you cannot use the same one x2"" 6)Inquire through ""chat"" (which I'm aware is a bot) 7)Chat asks for email/password 8)Uses every available option on my phone to respond, alas' NO KEYBOARD?!?! *Journalism/Reporting 10/10 *App for biggest name in written journalism :1/10 Garbage *Also note all the other users with identical issues",
The app works fine. Better than other news apps. The paper itself interests me in topics I otherwise wouldn't have considered. No need for me personally to comment on its' news and editorials. Read and judge for yourself.,
"Simple solution- turn notifications off! What you are experiencing is a Pavlovian response. You have now become a slave to the Google empire. Combined with notifications from other apps, you are working for them now.",
"This app is very much so adequate for getting the accuracy news too the people all over. Not just New York. New york time is dependable, and have been around longer than most. That means alot to us viewers.",
The app is really well made! I would really like a feature which allows me to return to right where I stopped reading an article. Also a text to speech feature would be amazing too!,
"While the articles are very mobile friendly, the games glitch. The mini crossword won't show the full keyboard anymore, only the top two lines.",
They've added dark mode...but no option to disable it. I've never seen another app make this mistake. I like to have my phone in dark mode but my news in light mode. Apparently this never occurred to the product/dev teams at NYT.,
"What aggreivates me is that this very expensive subscription, they still have ads all over the place. We pay you so much money- either make it free or nix the ads. $200 a year! You have to be better than that.",
still the best source of news!,
"Overall an OK app. There is an issue where if you click on a push notification, the article gets a dark gray background with black text.",
"Notification banners bring me to the main menu instead of the article. It's really annoying to dig through, and I can't find a search function.",
I always enjoy the extensive coverage of global News the New York times provides,
"Seems to be incompatible with my note 9 post Android Pi update. Articles load to black screens, images fail to load, text and icons disappear. Please fix. It worked fine pre update",
I believe the NYT is the very best place to go to be informed of news. I own a digital subscription I will never let go of and it's podcasts are superb.,
"As always, the NY Times columnists are thoughtful and provocative.",
"Obviously great content and a compelling price. App won't let you save or send wirecutter articles, recipes aren't fully available, and response to questions on app are painfully slow.",
Crossword portion has become very buggy. Only half the keyboard shows up. It is impossible to complete the puzzle now 👎. News is comprehensive,
Make it more lightweight. Annoying ads are there. Huge battery consumption is happening. Please fix. UI should be more responsive. Feed isn't updating well with time.,
"All the news that's for to print, gold standard",
"App doesn't refresh and keeps saying device is offline when, in fact, it is online. I'd like some feedback as I am paying a subscription. So being dead silent to all the people having the same issue is simply not acceptable.",
very important the piece regarding Pope Francis. I am a devout follower.,
"Very frustrating. Paid subscription, and after recent update get only ""opinion"", ""most popular"", and ads. Lots of ads. Top stories tantalizingly flash on screen and then disappear.",
"these days, the app stops and says, my app is an old version and download the latest. and it doesn't allow to upload. I have to uninstall and then reinstall it. Only to suffer the same problem after 4-5 days",
Subscription done via Google PlayStore did not reflect in the app or website. Neither Google nor NY Times is able to trace the payment. Google persistently asks to contact NyTimes and NyTimes says they can't find payment and that I should pay again. Frustrated by the experience and not by the loss of $5.5.,
the constant refreshing to check for new content takes you out of the article youre reading and jumps you back to the home page. you literally cant get through a full article without jumping out of it.,
I like it quite a bit. One big problem: it has stopped recognizing my subscription. I was not due to renew until August. It tells me I have no subscription. I've had a subscription since 2017!,
Works great and supports dark mode.,
"This is what happens when the right wing AND the left wing despise the political center. We are so fractured politically that the ultra conservatives, a distinct minority, have managed to take advantage of the hatred and have employed (literally in the instances of Thomas and Alito) the Supreme Court to impose their theocratic beliefs on the rest of us.",
"News is excellent. Alerts don't always link to the article they are about, though, which is confusing and frustrating.",
"Stopped working on my android tablet, maybe since last update. Says there is no internet connection, but every other app works. Tried un installing, rebooting, etc. Always same no internet message.",
"Professional editorial screening and filtering, informative, intelligent, factual, truthful, respectful, shining guiiding light tower in period of dark history of our times where people with no respect and total lack of human decency are in position of power to make it seem alright to continue as such.. But it's not alright! From a New Yorker, Lower East Side",
Journalism worth paying for.,
NYT is continuing to do an excellent job despite economic and political pressures.,
Great app. Love that some articles have been designed with special animations that really elevate the tone of the story. Do wish that there was a dark mode though.,
App has gotten buggy to the point that notifications don't take you to the story and often times stories don't load. Maybe developers should focus less on advertising to us and more on providing a workable app.,
"Very terrible app. I just downloaded not too long, and I am definitely deleting it. I don't advice anyone to download this horrible app. If they are not going to get a solution for all the complains, they should get this trash off goggle play store! Scam zone. Dont even try to subscribe!!",
Notifications never open the story. It always opens the main page. Sometimes notifications show different/duplicate story when expanded. Very annoying quirks.,
"Content is good and the app is relatively easy to navigate. However, the reason a star is missing, is because of no dark mode. How is there a reading app with no dark mode? I'll tack that star back on once this feature is added. Otherwise, I'm loving the app.",
"This app should be better. It frequently gives me news alert notifications, but when I click them, the app opens and says that the article could not be loaded. That's not much use.",
Your app is NOT STABLE. You open an article and you have 30 seconds to read it before it crashes and takes you back to home. Can't read like this.,
pictures do not load in the app on Chromebook. have to use browser to see photos. reported the issue several times and no progress in close to a year.,
Very frustrated by videos that play with audio. Would much prefer 'classic' newspaper - one where i dont have to frantically search for pause or mute.,
"Very frustrating. Pop-up ads, blank screens. Tonight I can read comments, but not the articles. Pretty much had it.",
I have only recently gotten into timepieces and the insane amount of internet real estate devoted to watches is ridiculous. This article was quite informative. I guess I have to actually get a watch now.,
"The main problems with this app, and I am a Times subscriber, are 1) The main page doesn't get updated quickly with the latest news, although the NYT web site is. 2) They post new stories in Facebook but lately the app won't open them.",
"Updated app is pretty good, much more reliable than before. I'm eagerly awaiting the return of dark mode. Notifications are timely and well targeted.",
Installed and unistalled app and reinstalled App . It keeps showing it is offline but all the other apps working fine. This was after a system update. Customer service not helpful.,
"Consistently does not open articles that come up in the alerts. Just opens something random, if it doesn't crash while spamming me with 70 articles in my notifications.",
"The main course of my news diet. I love the easy navigation of this app, the ability to share and save articles, and also search for articles.",
Love the app. Cancelled because my local library pays for a subscription for all it's members. Customer service person sounded annoyed and negative. Bad day? Hates her job? I don't know. She sucked to talk to. *Edit. Got it again. I love it. My favorite news.,
"Regularly loads random articles when opening a notification. Constantly shows me as logged out, and support is no help. Update: These broken notifications ruin the entire app. Wish I could give negative stars. How do you mess up notifications so badly?",
"NYT investigative reporting and journalism, especially during the pandemic, has been nothing short of spectacular. it has provided vital and practical information not only on public health during the pandemic, but also for this year's elections. It is a staple for democracy, especially in a time when that democracy is under direct threat, and from within its own borders.",
"Months and months of frustration. Issues with scrolling. Especially annoying being bounced completely off the app, often several times a day. Months and months, still no better🤬",
"The app is great. The reporters are generally great. The editors often stumble by trying to add ""balanced"" editorials that are disasters or by covering Trump's every fart as if it's rule of law. Still the greatest news organization in the world.",
"Can you fix the notification settings? I'm on android 8.0.0 with an lgg7 and even though I have the in app settings to silent and vibrate off, I still get pings when I get breaking news. I just want it to show up in my notification bar without sound.please fix",
"App runs well, journalism is a little left leaning, I would have preferred a more neutral source, but overall good experience. If you like the reporting already the app runs great",
"Every couple of days this app forgets I have access to the crossword, or the notifications they put on my phone, or articles on my computer. I am sick and tired of fighting with an app that I paid for to get the content that I paid for. I will not be resubscribing.",
No dark mode. Sluggish UI/UX. Alerts take you to live briefing which must be closed twice. Can't swipe between sections or articles. The Wash Post app is much better.,
"Content is good, performance isn't. Constantly freezes or refreshes & sends me back to the main page in the middle of reading an article.",
"(1) this app always nagging you to sign up & subscribe (2) but they won't make it easy for you to delete account or unsubscribe (3) it has thought provoking article though, very well written (4) but it doesn't have an option for low resolution images thus my data went drained (*) verdict: uninstall for good",
"If I tap on any of my push notifications about certain articles, it just opens up the main page of the app instead of opening that article. Really annoying.",
Used to be good. Recently when I tap to open a notification it just takes me to my home page and it's up to me to go searching for the article! Just fix your notification issue and this will be a 5 star app!,
Why did they change a great app? Loved this app until they recently changed the interface doubling the amount of work it takes top move around and read articles. Interface took 10 steps backward. Why? Why? Why?,
"I love the New York times. the diversity of subjects are amazing. I only wish that I could afford a subscription. being in my 70s and living on social security impossible. the times gives me 10 articles a month for free, these I cherish.",
"Works as expected, sometimes slow to load.",
Dark mode no longer working. Just dark beyond readable now. So much for my go to as my son falls asleep. Now it's bright white or read elsewhere. Tried to post screenshot but not an option. Come though with that dark functionality as the light in this dark time. Damn nyt. Get up,
"Chronological order as an option is still not available Can't swipe between popular topics, only between articles. This used to be a feature until the last year or so.",
"I have asked for and had approved a refund from Google Play for the NYT app. I had paid for an intro subscription this morning but the app never recognized the sub, and kept showing intro sub notices - the same with the NYT website. After a review here and complaints to the NYT, which had no info on my having subscribed, I asked for the refund. I went to the NYT website, paid for a subscription directly to the NYT, and uninstalled the app. Incidentally, I prefer the website to the app.",
"I have a free subscription through my company. However I cannot access my subscription from my phone for reasons unclear. It's I credibly frustrating and ridiculous. I have an account, it's paid for, now let me read your articles!!",
"I tried the app twice & it's was awful. These pop-ups are ANNOYING. If they can't recognize I have said ""no"" more than dozens of times in just the last week, why would I use the app? NYTs, make it stop.",
"I like the content but you are forced to pay a monthly subscription with the app. You can access the website for free. Plus, there are so many news sources that do not require a monthly subscription. This is bad form by NYT.",
I have been reading the New York Times for over fifty years. The New York Times has never disappointed! The finest newspaper in the world! Articles on the Arts and Arts Community are unparalleled Science features are always a fascinating pleasure The world is a better place thanks to the N.Y.T.,
"I downloaded this mainly because I see a lot of NYT articles on Facebook that I want to access. The app, however, won't let me access links from Facebook at all, just gives me a blank page. Honestly was better off without, hoping this gets fixed.",
For months now I've been unable to open links from the notifications. That's critical functionality for be. This app is useless without that.,
This is fantastic finding and will help in designing metallic glass application in critical areas taking the advancement of material science further. Thank you NYT for publishing such informative and educative articles. I haven't come across news papers publishing articles of such scientific importance.,
"I depend on the NY Times to provide accurate, fact based articles about some of the most important stories of our times. It's not surprising that ""Trumpophiles"" have their hair on fire as the spotlight of truth, common sense, reason and logic shines down upon them. GO Nwe York Times!!!",
"Far too many adverts, even for paid subscriber",
"When I was younger I thought so highly of the NY TIMES, always bought the weekend. Thought they were straight shooters with everything and I liked that as I dont consider myself Republican or Democrat, I just want the news how it is. I dont know if I was just young and naive or if the NY TIMES changed over the past decade. But they are very BIASED. Far leaning left news outlet and its so sad they are going this way. Are there any bias news outlets anymore? NY TIMES surely isn't it.",
Night mode is broken. The letters are very faint. Note says rotating the phone will fix it but the app doesn't rotate at all. Expected much better from NYT.,
"The personalized section of the app is SO bad. I get shown the same things over and over again, and there doesn't seem to be any ""learning"" about what interests the reader",
Can't read articles by clicking on the notification. Then can't read articles by clicking on them in the app. A complete failure of a news app. What a joke.,
Application needs advanced search options whenlooking for an article. Also search terms found in article should be highlighted. Finally articles themselves should be searchable for any term. Discounted subscription for new subscribers makes this app well worth the money.,
"And yet again, they change anything in the app that has to do with the mini-crossword, and they break the mini-crossword. GBoard on Pixel 4XL only showing the top two rows of letters. AGAIN.",
"Why would you remove the widget? Gets a 1 because the app is constantly trying to inform me of news I could care less about even when turning notifications off, the widget allowed me to at a glance see if any of the stories were interesting without the need for notifications every 10 mins",
"After hours of subscribing to the NYTime, I still cannot read the full stories. I reached out for help online, but responce was beyond slow, nonexistent. I also subscibed to the Washington Post, which was extremely easy and immediate. So, I am unsubcribeing NYTime app.",
"When someone dies, always go to New York Times obituaries first.",
I have found the NY Times to be diligent in research and outstanding in reporting news especially during Covid. I often compare reports with other reputable news both print and electronic and rely on the NYTimes for accuracy. The Daily Covid newsletter has literally been a lifesaver. NY Times is a Pulitzer Prize winning journal because of its integrity and excellence.,
Search option is absolutely terrible when looking for specific articles but the rest is rad. Kudos on all the things you've done to ensnare younger readers.,
"The app is unstable. The cinematic features, lead to lag and are simply not worth it. It's better to use the browser version.",
"I love this app. However, with the most recent update, I'm now seeing a popup message ""your device is offline. Ladt updated: oct. 24"" and none of the articles are up to date",
"Hopefully you don't try to cancel your subscription on the app! I have been trying for a few weeks to do just that and it does not work at all. Feels like a scam, because if I can't cancel this, they keep getting my money. Really not enjoying this.",
Google play subscriptions are broken in this app and support is unable to help. Eventually had to pay for another subscription because both Google and NYT support insists the other has the problem. (It's definitely the app that's broken),
"I assumed paying for a subscription would eliminate the ads, but the first article I read had 8 ads, all either animated or video. To cancel you have to call or chat online.",
The latest version of the app removed the headline widget for android. This was one of the best features and one that separated the NY times from other news apps.,
Gives you lots of status notifications but choosing them only takes you to the generic times homepage via the app. It's a good app if you know what you're looking for. Not that great for breaking news.,
Last update completely broke all games. Scrolling just forces the game to refresh and kicks you out to the game selection screen. Tried it on 3 Android devices including a tablet and got the same problem.,
"App keeps stopping before it even opens. { Up to date Pixel 6) Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to no avail. I have a paid account, and can't even use it. Pls fix.",
"Good news app, with some bugs. For some reasons most pictures in articles dont load for me, which is very annoying. All other pictures work fine.",
"Excellent, well written information.",
"Duplicate breaking news notifications are annoying. Glaring white background is fine during the day, but impossible at night. Give us a NIGHT MODE!",
"Kind of annoying actually. Articles won't load and then I'm told my device is offline, which it is not. I have full bars or I'm connected to wifi. What's the point in paying for a subscription if all I can do is read the headlines?",
"Unfortunately, the app is very inconvenient. It has so many bugs while going from page to another and it crashes. Please fix this.",
"The NY Times is a place I can go to get ALL the news - good and bad! And, you can trust what you read to be well-researched, well-written and fully investigated. Thank you for being there to get us all through the madness that has defined this crazy year!",
DO NOT PURCHASE A digital SUB VIA THIS APP. THEY HAVE NEVER given me an account number so I can't cancel. They do not recognize my email. AND YET I pay Each month Countless chats and emails have not resolved the issues. DO NOT TRUST THEIR SYSTEMS. I am serious about this.,
"I personally enjoy the articles from the NY Times more than any other Times that I read (Chicago and Japan). This newspaper seems to be for the world, not just for New York. Thanks for sharing.",
"The redesign with the tabs is better and the notifications not opening up articles issue seems to be fixed. A great turnaround - I hope similar improvements come to the Crosswords app. Saw you're hiring an iOS dev for Crosswords, but it's the Android version that's lagging. Be nice for Android to have a decent app too, we don't pay less....",
"Like the content, but app crashes all the time. Also, I hate that it scrolls up to the top when I return to the home screen.",
"For an app that requires a subscription, it is inescusable how badly designed and how poorly functional the NY Times app is. If they don't improve their app, I am going to cancel my subscription to the NY Times.",
"No dark mode. Instant one star. Everything else I use has dark mode, there is no excuse for this app to have this eye-searing trash in 2022. Cancelled my recurring subscription to the Times until they fix it.",
"I can't love the NYT app enough! It's fast and after a number of months with daily (throughout the day) usage, I haven't encountered any bugs.",
"beautiful for reading. needs in app feedback section, text size options do not work in some articles or sections of the app, recently viewed does not sync across devices",
the app was working great for a while but now I only get a bunch of news messages once a week instead of when they are released. can't find a setting to adjust that.,
"Crashes while loading ads App is nicely designed, but constantly crashes while loading the *many* ads. 3/11/19 - articles load, if i can complete reading them before ad loading triggers a crash, I am lucky.",
"I laughed all the way through ""Down the Rabbit Hole.""",
"An app that is as equally bad as its reporting. Don't waste your time. You're better off reading the label on the back of the shampoo bottle in your shower. Oh, and at least the shampoo bottle doesn't crash every 5 seconds.",
"Cannot access the articles All I get on screen is a message ""You have reached your 5 article limit."" I have contacted customer service and they say they are working on the problem. This is incompetence. We need a class action lawsuit vs the NYT.",
"This last upgrade takes forever to download the full text of the articles. If it continues, I'll have to subscribe to a competitor. What's with this NYT? Have you upgraded your membership in the data theft industry?",
"Too expensive. I know they post some great articles and, I finally decided to get subscribed ,but 8$/month for subscription??!! That is way too much. Some streaming services offer cheaper service than this.",
The Journalism is great and very well done. The App is clunky and antiquated to navigate. You should really do better New York Times.,
a voice reader option would be nice,
Times are you kidding me? The best journalists in the world are giving you stories and risking their lives. It's far more objective than some other newspapers I've read. Not everything is political to get perspective no matter what your opinion is.,
I rely on the detailed reporting and unwind with the arts and culture coverage. The crosswords and games are excellent. Highly recommend!,
Having trouble reading the stories. The page wouldn't scroll up after entering into the story (on Android). Very frustrating.,
For an app that constantly bugs you to subscribe. It's a bit strange that when you actually try to do so it can't connect to the Google play store....,
"The push notifications show me an article I want to read, when I click on it, it takes me to all the articles and I cannot find the one I wanted to read initially. Pls fix",
"I subscribed through the app without signing in. When I tried to connect my account it is not allowing me to do so. Through app sent request for help. Nothing so far except an automated email. Regards, Jeyaraman LS",
App feeds content you cannot access with subscription (wirecutter and food)... Deceptive and cannot be stopped. Hard to detect while reading available content. Tech support ignores. Needs to be flagged as nag-ware and advertising. Suggest against downloading or subscribing,
"There are so many news sources available, I almost never found the need for a paid subscription. Then you have to cancel by phone or chat, which is deliberately slow. I got Francisco, who delayed and delayed. It took approximately 14 minutes on chat just to say ""Thanks, but no thanks!""",
Notification settings are a joke. Stories about how someone feels is not Breaking News.,
NEEDS DARK MODE!!! I get it. Newspapers were always black text but reading a newspaper versus a backlit screens is really uncomfortable without dark mode.,
"Clicking on a notification almost never opens the relevant article. Also, searching for the article never works because the blurb doesn't match the article title.",
The loss of sliding section tabs at the top of the page is horrible. Bring back the old functionality. It was far superior.,
The best newspaper in the country at your fingertips.,
I have the NY Times app and it really keeps me informed. The news is so provocative and I learn about today's trials as well as historical events and factual information. I am proud that they do such an amazing job for the citizens!,
New York Times you have suffered the worst in the newspaper business losses and you have come out on top. Thank you for the hard work and investigative reporting that you have always done so well. Great App Too! bob brown Melbourne florida,
provides in depth information that I trust. I am grateful that I have access to such a valuable resource.,
"Great app, minus the forced refreshes making me lose my spot when I go back to the main page. Ad loading makes the page jump suddenly as well. Annoying.",
"The app was great until the update a couple days ago. Now it is very slow and barely functions! If you have not already upgraded, don't do it! I wish they'd worked out the bugs before releasing it...",
Buyer beware - it's unbelievably difficult to cancel subscriptions!!! It takes no less than 40 minutes minimum to cancel a subscription through NYT - save yourself the trouble!,
Always interesting.most are items that are more than what I expected.I wanted to share with some friends but didn't know how to use it or if it would be permitted. I know several who would have loved the DavidBowie item & costumes.I 'll encourage them to download themselves.,
"Bad update. Got rid of night mode. Return to the top after article is annoying. And broke the crossword, can't see the whole keyboard.",
"They make you chat or call them to cancel. Takes forever to do so also. I wrote this entire review while chat was ""pulling up my account"" after I was already logged in. Too pushy on cancellation. Just make it a button to cancel and I would join and leave as needed but since this is the process for leaving I definitely won't be.",
Excellent source of daily news.,
informative. wonderful cooking section.,
Scroll on this app is very sensitive where almost every vertical swipe opens an article. This doesn't happen for other apps on my phone.,
This update is much appreciated. I use this app to help me be informed. It's extremely important to support print journalism. Responsible press is one leg of the chair that supports democracy. Local newspapers are also critical to an informed electorate.,
Junk. Won't update with new content. Freezes up. Very poor showing. No clear determination to repair. Yes. I'm a subscriber.,
It never directly connects me with the NYT or an article. I always have to login after numerous NYT requests to upgrade or accept some bothersome proposal. I'm ending the NYT subscription after this month.,
No dark mode. Some good stories. Some fake news. A mix of both. Mostly establishment voices. Thanks for the service,
"scummy subscription stop policy, was just reminded about how Gross NYT is in requiring paying customers to call a service number to cancel payments. so gross, i will never fall for that again. so dishonest and disrespectful of ppl that actually paid you.",
"Apr 2023:Seems more functional. 2022: For neatly two years, the app will not allow comment posting from my Samsung Android device. It is not an account problem, because I have no problem posting via Windows Firefox on same device. Washington Post, L.A. Times, never a single problem! NYT? Incompetent programmers? Who knows...",
"Almost daily it tells me ""your device is offline."" My device is online for everything else. Tech support has said at least a dozen times ""reinstall."" It never helps.",
"Buggy app. The 'For You' section rarely updates, and my Wordle stats and streak got lost because of a bug they admitted to. Unsubbed and app deleted.",
"Words no longer appear, only pics and ads, not even headlines. I subscribed to the app, worked great until 3 weeks ago. Canceling subs soon",
App says my device is offline and doesn't show the news.,
"I am a subscriber for more than a year. News reporting is probably the best in the world. The experience however is not good. App is filled with bugs and customer support doesn't really care. I hope they see all the comments here and improve their services, because it's a shame.",
"Great app and amazing content as always. I have to deduct 1 star for the lack of night mode. My eyes hurt, it's so glaring white!! Please have pity on your devoted readers and offer a dark mode. Happy readers, happy newspaper, yes?",
"""BREAKING NEWS"" has become meaningless. If NYT is sending out a push notification about a story, you really don't need to say breaking news... especially when it's the third notification about the same basic story.",
"The coverage is bad, and you should feel bad. Right-wing bias aside, whenever I get a notification, I always have to ""retry"" after tapping it.",
Clean interface but riddled with problems. Notifications dont take you to the article and insane data usage. 2gb of background data use in 24 hours! Uninstalled.,
"Can not Uninstal as pre-installed software on my device. This is bloat ware and malware because it cannot be shut down on your device by any means and it dues suck up on performance. Content is only accessible by pay wall. I didn't pay for this, didn't want it but am stuck with it. I am sure my device will function better once I figure out how to uninstall this peice of malware bloat ware 😠",
"Reviewing app functionality alone, & content opinions excluded from this review. The app works very well for me and is good at curating targeted content and for making available things I search for. Stable with few crashes on my OnePlus 8 Pro.",
All the news that fit to read.,
Detailed and well researched,
"This app was always crashy. An uninstall/reinstall might help, I thought. The app does look completely different now, but also crashes 3 times as often. Can I give it zero stars?",
Article links from FB to app does not always work on my Andriod phone. Both FB and NY TIMES apps have been recently updated. Often ended up a blank screen.,
"I see that my complaint about losing the top scrolling menu is common. So, I am not crazy. Multiple un-installs and re-installs still has not brought back my formerly functional NYTimes app. Disappointed. Did Russia bring your app down?",
I value the APP and it used to be excellent. During the last week it is has become terribly unstable to the point that it is unusable. Galaxy Note10+ on Android 11.,
"I read The Morning every day as part of my essential catching up on events, reading and listening to multiple U.S. and foreign news outlets. The Times always delivers thoughtful national and international reporting. And NYT Cooking has become a favorite, too.",
"It's a great news app! Articles load extremely quickly, even when the connection isn't great (on the subway). It's well designed and easy to use",
The Home Page takes forever to load. All other sections load quickly. It is very frustrating and pushes me toward the browser version over the app.,
"Tapping notifications opens different stories than what the notification is for. Rendering updates through notifications pointless. Premium cost, expect app perfection.",
"Good app overall. I would upgrade my rating if you incorporate a ""night mode"" in the app. It does take a toll on your eyes and overall health when you are blazed by a bright screen at night.",
"For Android OS, this app needs an overhaul. Content on the front page jumps continuously, pointlessly rearranging itself every half second or so. Absurd.",
Can the app stop trying to update the page every time I click back once finished with an article? It is so annoying-I don't need the page updated every two minutes.,
it's by and large great but sometimes it pokes unnecessarily in sovereign matters of other countries. Giving opinions without deep and thorough research and understanding the ethos of the people and historical facts can sometimes be misleading. However the articles cover a wide range of issues.,
"Great source of reliable up to date news. Highly reccomend ""The Daily"" podcast for an informative and captivating start to your day. Student rate subscription is worth every penny, and the money goes to support the best of the best of investigative journalism. Only drawback is its US-focus which means some articles are not as relavant for Canadian audiences.",
"The journalism is excellent, but the app still freezes and restarts several times weekly, and apparently randomly. Galaxy S21 Ultra with all updates.",
"Hard to unsubscribe. I get too many ads. When scrolling, ads load late and breaks scrolling. I paid... Surely we can remove the ads? App is also glitchy and I can't configure it enough.",
"This was my go-to app for news, then they decided to remove the widget, and also the ability to log in? I presume only the latter was unintentional, but both make as much sense.",
"Crashes and locks up on Android, 3 or more times before last article. Ads are too numerous and too large. Poor user interface for a great paper.",
Great journalists. Great newspaper.,
"I've subscribed for years then Ive had time to look at recurring billing and found my cost jumped from 8.00 to 15.00 plus precious taxes so 16.00 I'm not sure why but I do what I did CANCELLED. I did the same for the Washington Post. Similar action. I appreciate that people write , research,great reporting but during a pandemic. Costs are tight.😷",
Couldn't even open the app for the past one week. Kept telling me the app has expired and asked me to update the app (which I did). Still doesn't work. No email reply from Nyt's android team.,
"Although the NYT Android app works as a worthy ""Latest News"" substitute (albeit not quite the same) of the website, one cannot say the same about the website's ""Today's Front Page"" screens, which are still not part of the Android. I'll revise my stars upward if they change this situation.",
"I am really impressed by the amplitude and richness of the articles published, no matter what the subject may be. My decision to sign up for full content has proved to be one of the wisest taken in a long while.",
"Recent update renders crosswords unusable-- cannot see bottom row of keyboard on phone and tablet. Sorry for the low rating--was fine until update, but HELP!!!! Please fix asap!!",
"Disappointed with the way this version seems to share to Facebook - no thumbnail/lede, just ""nyti.mes"". Now I have to revisit the articles in my browser in order to share correctly.",
"Most of the app works great. The search engine could be a little better. But the comments are limited to only commenting to others. The ""pen"" button to comment on the article directly doesn't work on Android, Samsung.",
"About as honest as it gets anymore. Some opinion articles have a spin factor, but the news reporting can be tracked on other sources for veracity. So far, I have not come across anything patently false that is not corrected.",
Broad range of information. Thought provoking aetfcf AZ[,
"I'm rating the app, solely losing stars due to the annoying Lucy-pulls-the-football notifications. ""Thought that enticing notification was going to take you to an interesting story? Ha! The joke's on you. We like messing with our customers."" This has been going on for over a year; it's been six months since I complained (they're aware of the problem). While the rest of the web can support permanent links, you can't have yours last a day or two? Puts me that much closer to cancelling.",
Do not buy the subscription via Google play store. It will not work on the app or the NYT website. Forums are full of people that paid and can only access the content via Google Newsstand. NYT replies work generic emails saying it's not their fault.,
App performance has really improved in the last few months. Things are loading and it's working as expected. Now I can enjoy the NYTimes without cursing my phone.,
I get notification on my phone with a little blurb about an article. If I find that I might be interested in the article I tap it. Now the app opens. Does it take me to the article that I tapped. No it takes me to a page which has multiple articles on it. Now I have to scroll and search for the article I was interested in. This makes the notifications useless and the app is useless. I will be uninstalling and cancelling my subscription.,
"This offers me no benefit over the website. The only difference I've noticed is that I can't block the 5+ ads littered throughout each article. If I'm a subscriber, I shouldn't be seeing ads in the first place.",
Decision makers and other people of influence read the NYimes in the US and abroad. Although I'm just a little guy I like to read what these heavies read just to keep an eye on what's coming down the pike. I've been reading the Times for more than sixty years.,
"Generally like the content, however the ads have started auto playing with sound even when the settings are set to no auto play. So had to uninstall.",
"This is the worst app I have. Doesn't work on my phone, constantly has to be updated, just quits, won't update etc. I might add I never have issues with the Post. And I cant see other reviews. Gee I wonder why.",
This app used gigabytes of mobile data even though I only read a few articles and didn't watch any videos. I've updated the settings on my phone to block certain apps from using mobile data but I also uninstalled this app just to be sure.,
Freezes every few seconds and crashes outright at least a couple of times a month. Easier to read in the Chrome browser.,
"Still no fix for the bugs in the mini crossword. Advice from NYT was to subscribe to the web app or subscribe to the crossword app, even tho I already subscribe to the full service. No thanks.",
"Everytime I try and click on a link from chrome, and open it in the app, it cannot locate the article, and shuts down, don't recommend downloading.",
"Very comprehensive, like the Times. Articles I thought had saved seem to have disappeared. I have trouble using the search function ( often trying to find my disappeared ""saved"" articles).",
"The layout and design of the app evokes a newspaper but it's app. It's perfectly programmed, I haven't come across one bug since using it.",
"App can be buggy at times, went to cancel service after 6 months and they make u go through a chat which took close to 25 minutes, not really acceptable. I've gotten auto insurance quicker than this.",
"App is fine, but clearly lagging behind other major newspapers' apps. The lack of a dark mode is particularly disappointing. WSJ and WaPo figured it out; why hasn't NYT?",
Crossword not working again. Extremely lousy customer service with a very fragile product doesn't bode well. Once again the mini cw isn't working. Same problem as before -- inability to access full keyboard. The idea of paying for this is laughable . . .,
"What have you done with my dark mode? The beta version that was in experiments for many years was never great, but it worked. Now even that has been taken away! Please restore this critical functionality ASAP.",
"Serious deteriorating. Multiple video ads for the same product in one story. More annoying, they autopsy without any way to.turn them off. No ""Todays Paper"" section. Not refreshed very often during the day. The WSJ is seriously kicking their butt.",
"Full of terrible hit pieces on presidential and congressional candidates, disengenuous op-eds, and justifications for foreign wars with no factual basis - just proves you can't trust any US mainstream media. Fox News may be worse, but I'm finding a more reliable news source.",
This is version 6.20.6 Updated 10/19/18. Works well on both my older Galaxy Tab S2 and newer Note 9. I got a good monthly rate. I'm very happy with the service. I just wish the news wasn't so bad these days.,
"Love the Times, hate the app. Version 7.2.0 is unusable. Artcles fail to load, text disappears, lockups, random crashes. Please fix this!",
What is up with you guys? I'm in the first month of a twelve month subscription and I can't load a second article without continually reopenning the app. Some articles don't even scroll to the end but cut off three quarters in. Please fix this thing.,
"Reporting unbiased, fact-checked news is crucial to any civilization. The NYT does it well. Thank you. The Times is a daily go-to. Together with the AP, The Guardian & the WaPo, and possibly Bloomberg, the NYT is one of the rare US institutions we actually do right!",
Half the time the app doesn't load the stories I want to read. My internet is not the issue bc I've tested that. Due to frustrations there are days in a row I don't get to take advantage of my paid subscription.,
The NY Times is an awesome app to use. My only complaint would be the lack of an audio option to listen to articles. This is something that is present at a number of other papers.,
"Content is best in the world, but the app drains battery in the background. Didn't use it once one day, but it consumed 21% of the battery and ran for 21 minutes. Now I'm trying to restrict it to prevent this.",
"The app is convenient and user-friendly (getting alerts of breaking news is particularly useful), but I fear it is best used as a way of gauging what the majority of people THINK the news is.",
In the continuous death cycle and consolidation of media companies the New York Times has been a beacon the hill for overseas Americans like myself with an excellent digital edition which is a daily 2 hour stop with well balanced national and some great in depth international articles. Great Op Ed pieces and writers like Nicholas Kristof who writes with compassion and from the heart. An article on the transformative evolution of this great newspaper is in order !,
"My go to for updates and insights into the important political and cultural questions challenging our world. I appreciate the long form articles, focused research and timely updates. Kudos to the NYT team for their commitment to real journalism.",
Great! I must subscribe!,
"The high journalistic standard of the NYT is evident on reading, especially their election coverage. Editorials are broadly known to lean liberal but they do include a variety of voices. Sadly, Food and extra Crosswords cost extra.",
Incredible that NYT continues to raise prices and yet clearly doesn't spend a penny on engineers. An app that refuses to sign me in without redirecting me to my mobile browser... True quality software. And a surefire way to get me to cancel my subscription.,
So should journalism be in modern times,
I have a basic subscription access under my dad's subscription plan. I'm not able to access more than 3 stories a week. Customer service sent me a new link for my basic access and it hasn't changed anything.,
"There is something about this paper. I've had hard copies delivered to my home, but I find the digital version much better for my needs. Thanks, NYT I have been a fan since I moved to NY in 89', and found most of my job opportunities in the employment section of your paper. Keep up the good work. Sorry I grew up reading the Los Angeles Times.",
News articles are unreadable. The app cannot stay in one place and will wildly scroll in any direction. Tried on two android phones.,
"Using this app to follow news as it happens is nearly impossible, there's no ability to sort articles chronologicaly.",
"Always up to date, almost always accurate, and vigorous reporting is what I love about the NYT. The App is continuously improving (which I like) now if we can get editor's on board to stop pandering to every tweet AND BE MORE CRITICAL AND ACCURATE WITH HEADLINES YOU CHOOSE (THIS I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH). 45's impulsivity hasn't been news for well over a year (or 2) Move on. The NYT has the power to control the news cycle, its time you reclaim that responsibility for the sake of our freedoms.",
I wish someone would respond to me. I have 2 current subscriptions to the NY Times and cancelled another because all of them still won't give me consistent (if any) connection. Unless they fix this I will not renew.,
App is buggy and a battery hog on its best day. On its worst it will just crash over and over again. Ads everywhere despite having a subscription. The news is good but the app and ads are hot garbage.,
"ADS! It makes me want to cancel my subscription. E: Cancelled my subscription. The app is barely usable. Too many ads, laggy, uses too many resources and makes my phone overheat. Maybe when they fix it I'll resubscribe.",
I used to love this app but I'm now uninstalling. Notifications to read an article I already read every 5 mins for almost an entire day. Reported the problem and didn't get emailed back. Don't install!,
"Moved away from the inexpensive print newspaper area, across country, so I'm happy to have the online version. Does summaries of stories, which you can click for more in-depth. Timely news & reporting",
great article. insightful. informative. NYT is worth it.,
"The last update broke the links from the headline to the stories, the headline just flashes but the content won't open. I'm a logged in subscriber using a Pixel 3.",
Great summary on the issue of ground water depletion,
Can't access my subscription,
"A very informative exchange... ""spot on""!",
Advertisements in app even for paid subscribers. Oh and nice touch with the bugged out menus to access subscription management. Had to log in twice and then choose to chat or call to cancel. Lol. Support your mission but not your business practices. Unsubscribed and not returning.,
"Nit had a chance to use it yet, and you are asking me to rate it.",
Best journalism available. Real professionals work here.,
Every adult American should read this sobering article. We have poisoned the system by choice on the altar of the profit motive.,
"Awful reliability - it crashes constantly and is a gross dis-service to the work of the high quality reporters whose work it should be bringing, seamlessly, to all readers. I cannot comment on re-loading problems as I have not stayed on-line long enough to encounter such problems",
Real journalism is vital. Get this app and subscribe.,
"Article push notifications don't lead to the articles. They always result in the error message ""This article failed to load due to an error. Please try again."" Pretty useless.",
Killing subscribers with the a la carte options.,
"Keeps needing me to log back in. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixes the problem, but annoying bug.",
They need to rename this app The Wordle Game,
Good content but massive pester power to pay. Not enough unbiased content to pay. Removing it to save space as can get free news elsewhere.,
"Great news content. App generally works well, except push notifications often don't link to the article after a day or two.",
bigger is NOT better in light of emerging threats',
I really enjoyed this recent class of election discussions?,
"Substantive, reliable journalism.",
Always on leading news.,
very interesting! could have far reaching ramifications.,
"What do I think? How many people know about this monument? What's more, how many know of Crazy Horse and the Lakota people?",
I mostly read at night but can't read this app because there is no dark mode and it is **BRIGHT AF** (would be thrilled to hear how if in wrong on that). Because of this I barely use it and probably won't continue my subscription for long.,
Makes a good argument for international cooperation.,
Great except for the Opinion pieces,
Great morning routine (for older men),
Paints a very believable picture,
It's the best paper in the country.,
Very bias and expensive papper,
NY Times is the best.,
A wonderful story of a father and a daughter's love and acceptance.,
Unsaved resaves instantly,
The best newspaper!!,
An Indian who wants the world to acknowledge the scientific history & knowledge of Indians.,
Best news in the business.,
app is great!,
always 5 star articles,
"Five stars for content, one star for the app itself. This week of all weeks it continually crashes when trying to open it. Please fix ASAP!!!!",
The app turn to beta version which requires me to update the new version of the app. When you follow the instructions it always take you back to the popup message to download the new version. Confusing!,
"Articles never seem to finish loading, causing the screen to bounce around the page. Makes it incredibly difficult to read",
Nature always finds a way...,
"App displays ads to paying members. Also spams you with notifications, seems like everything is breaking news. Why not have better controls for notifications. This stuff isn't rocket surgery.",
Annoying that story notifications don't take you to the actual story in the app when clicked. Difficult to tune which notifications are received.,
"The NYT is ridiculously biased, but the app works great and the stories are still top notch, if you can learn to see through the bias.",
"Horrible app, good journalist content. It doesn't let you cancel subscription easily. The chat bot doesn't work for my Android, the human Service app never gets connected and you'll have to call to cancel.",
"Love the newspaper, like the app, hate the ads. I am paying a weekly subscription, yet you are shoving ads for luxury watches and perfumes in my face all the time. Very uncool.",
"Although I like many of the features of the app, it's a major power hog, causing my phone to warm up and drain the battery while simply reading news.",
"Before subscribing you need to know that there seems to be no way to cancel ever. You're trapped. Other reviews that said they canceled cuz of some perceived political bias are lying to you. If those people were actual subscribers they'd still, have it.. You will never get out of this even when they triple the price in ya without warning. Don't do it unless you are ready for a lifelong commitment. Its easier to get out of marriage.",
"Unlike any other app I use, the paid version (a.k.a. NYT subscription) still comes with ads. They suck up data, slow article loading, and make scrolling jumpy.",
"App has been broken for awhile now. Articles don't load or text color is messed up. I'm not quite sure what the problem is but they need to fix their app, especially since I am paying for the content.",
"Notifications don't mean anything. I get article notifications on my phone. When I click on them, it dosen't take me to the article but rather to the main page of the app, and then I have to search for it. What's the point??",
Can't use it without tones of pop out everytime you try to open an article for subscriptions and payments. Most annoying application.,
"Well, there is not much to complain about when using this app. It's pretty solid, has never crashed in the last year, and easy on the eyes. And it does exactly what it is supposed to do: work without problems. There is some room for improvement so far as the notifications are concerned. Worth paying for! A user from Calcutta, India.",
I am not a BETA member anymore but somehow the beta version gets installed. I joined BETA but then I was frustrated as every time I opened the application the old build expired and I had to install the new one again and again. Now again I can see the BETA version and I cant install the normal one.,
I've been unable to set a different sound notification for this app from what my phone's default notification sound is for months now. Is anybody working on this?!,
"Constant crashing. Refuses to refresh. It used to work fine, but a month ago it started having issues.",
"I believe in news papers. Your reading is very personal and allows your quite mind to decide what you believe. I get tried of shouting and repetitive voices on tv and radio. Print with individual voices, I let their tell stories. Thank you.",
"Outstanding news content, but app is increasingly clunky, slow to load, and frustrating. Gets worse and worse. Very disappointing in the overall app use",
One of the recent updates has caused constant issues with the notifications: they typically do not align with articles and they often roll in all at once.,
"Terrible customer service. Quality of writing and editing is at an all-time low. Plus, they raised my monthly payment by 375% without notice. Been on hold for over half an hour, waiting to cancel my subscription.",
This app drains battery life super quick which is unfortunate because you have to take the time to read the articles. I uninstalled the app but continue to follow the NYT elsewhere.,
"While the Times are my preferred source of news, the app is practically unusable. The app crashes within a couple minutes almost every time I open it",
Superb and informative.,
Horrible support Been using for years. Mostly works well. All of a sudden app is eating up mobile data. Support ignores requests for assistance. If there is no resolution soon I will be forced to cancel,
app is currently broken. just hangs on a black screen when I try to open. have reinstalled to no avail. it used to work great before most recent update. writing from galaxy s20 fe.,
"I have been using the NYT app for 4+ years and I would normally rate 5 stars. However a recent update (~Jan 2021) removed the DARK MODE feature, and if brought back I would happily change my rating to 5 stars again.",
"Drains battery Does not maintain location between usages No dark mode Poor UI design Hard to find articles because of crappy search Sooo many ads (see battery usage above) And I'm a paid subscriber. Ugh this is a ""Failing NYT"" app.",
I am a paid subscriber and the app is buggy at best. Doesn't open a story with the loading banner looping infinitely. Have to manually kill the app and then launch again.,
"This app is fine when it works, but it keeps crashing on some days. I have to use a Chrome search on those days to access NYT news.",
"A terrible app. Article often fail to load, the length of articles is kept a secret, and saved articles randomly disappear from the saved articles tab. Is there a reason NY Times' Android app is CONSIDERABLY worse than its Apple app??",
very convenient and easy app but after download the new version of this app in couple of days the popups are shows that version is expired..and there is not put any solution to get latest version,
Unable to read articles in Dark/Night mode. The print is gray against black background. Contrast is atrocious. Needs a fix.,
"It's not connected to Facebook or any social media i.e. it doesn't allow me to read more than 3 articles per month on fb, not realizing I have subscription. And this app does not have a search button so I can search the title I saw on fb",
"The pictures are hard to see. I can't enlarge them, but the writing and reporting are as good as ever! First time I've used the app, so I've got to wait before I can assess the app fairly.",
"Subscription starts out as Free, then goes to $2 a month, now goes to $8 a month. Cannot find link to cancel. Can no longer afford it. Hard times!",
Putting ads at the very top of the feed is like using the front page of the print paper for advertisements. It's a slap in the face for your paid subscribers. If this continues I will cancel my subscription. (I am a fan of the content though.),
"Some of the best journalism in the US, but their international coverage can be improved, specifically around content and context.",
l love the honesty of the news and variety of US and World news. There are always interesting informative articles about additional topics from art to poison ivy!! I am a huge NYT cooking fan as well as a fan the crossword puzzles.,
"Please roll back to the latest release before March 12, 2019. This release contains breaking changes that prevent articles from loading! I want a refund for this month's subscription (and every month until this app gets fixed)! Pixel phone user.",
"almost everything is as it should be. two suggestions: 1) bring search button to the main page 2) make the categories such as Books, or World movable so we can access them with more ease.",
"Good, however sometimes 'forgets' my subscription details. Articles I started reading in print often appear a day or two later - reallt inconvenient, especially when commuting.",
"The Grey Lady remains a bulwark against specious claims of anti-science, anti-fact, propaganda that reverberate within the echo chamber of algorithm selected opinion newsstuff. While publicly traded, the NYT presents well cited, superbly written, and thorough investigative journalism for discerning readers to decide for themselves. While not the Loudest Voice in the Room, its adaptation to digital expedites carefully curated news as the North Star and Paper of Record. Journalism par excellence",
This app is not accessibility friendly. It does not work well with Androids built-in accessibility functions especially the text-to-speach reader.,
"Mostly love NYT, though I did downgrade my subscription a couple years ago after some egregiously Rethug-friendly reporting, when it was clearly a weirdly-buased piece NKT based on facts, after 40+ years where Rethugs are known liars, cheaters, traitors, and hypocrites. The app is good, but I cannot enlarge any pages or anything as I read. Very frustrating. Please make this possible, NYT.",
Best current writing and seems very informative. Some of us may get more stuff by reading in a good app like this one. Thanks to many different things that have led up to this tech work there may be a way.,
"Very pathetic experience. No notifications on time, comes multiple at a time. And while reading, popup asking login into account often interrupts my smooth reading.",
"Crashes and burns constantly - can't read any stories with our paid subscription. Stories take a long time to load if ever, then the whole app dies.",
"Recent versions constantly reload (in midst of reading articles, sometimes as often at once a minute) and suck up Gigs of Data. At this rate the NYT should be paying me!",
Shouldn't have to view ads if I am praying. Will be considering canceling.,
"Good overall but the poor night mode is a killer. Why use the app? I'd rather sync the site and use Simplified View. Get with the times, NYT...night mode is everything.",
"i want to get Breaking News alerts, but I'm turning them off because it keeps using my general notification/text messaging sound even though I changed the sound within the app settings to something quieter that wouldn't wake me.",
I love reading the Times for the political articles and information of al kinds. The Times magazine has thought provoking articles on climate change and other topics. The ads are few and easily bypassed.,
"I expected top notch journalism, which the NYT delivers on, but I have been (3 months now) pleasantly surprised by the cool, interactive digital content available on the app!",
"I really like the journalism, but the app EATS battery. Today I read it for 9 minutes and somehow it burned thru 8% of my phone's battery. The developers need to look into this stat.",
"I love the paper and the app works well. Except notifications don't open the article they refer to. I hope they fix this soon! If they do, this is a five-star review.",
"Simple and effective, plus the immersive articles are really nice. Dev team seems active as well and any bugs are dealt with in a timely manner.",
"Overall, I love the app and it's very user friendly. If we're paying for the digital version, why do ads still come up ? seems unfair . Other request is to include a dark theme",
"App design, fluidity and stability is excellent on my S20. The journalism is great, and the articles thoroughly researched. Well worth the subscription",
"I click on an article and when it opens the article, the background is dark with white writing. The writing is so pale one can hardly read it.",
"First rate journalism. Great writing and investigatory work, but also often consider very interesting angles to look at different stories. Great international coverage.",
"No reporting is perfect these days but the NYT and a few others, have earned our trust with fair and balanced reporting, thorough investigative reporting while our government, corporations and special interest groups insist on skewing, spinning and pervertion of facts for selfish gain. You don't have to agree, in fact, you're urged to question everything but the truth is undeniable.",
Ruined the battery life on my phone. Only sending push notifications throughout the day and I had never opened the app even once today and it had taken out 31 percent withing 3 hours. That 3 hours also was filled with YouTube which only took 16 percent. Horrible,
"The app is flawless. Except for the AR/VR module, where opening few articles in AR is crashing the app. But no other app out there delivers news in an innovative way like this. Love it!!",
App on android currently does not corretly open any links to NYT articles. It simply opens up the app's homepage and I then have to search for the article I previously clicked on.,
"As usual, the mobile app isn't as flexible as the mobile site-- I can't resize text on the fly or zoom images. Comment links open the app but not the comment. I am uninstalling and good riddance.",
"What good is the app? Not much. Get a notification about a story, tap it, and go to some random story I don't want to read about. Seriously, what is the point of pushing a notification if it doesn't take you to the story?",
I signed up for a promotion of the NY Times. I was tired of the evening news. I am loving the Times. I can customize push notifications and swipe to see articles I am interested in on the daily thread.,
"I keep getting changed $4 each month even though I have NO subscription to NYT. I have changed credit card numbers and they still charge. I call NYTs and they agree, I have no subscription so who is getting the $4 each month? My credit card is investigating fraud.",
An outstanding app. Easy to use and quick to update. I've been using it for three years so far and have no complaints. The same quality as that simbolized by NYT.,
Latest updates made the app virtually unusable. Crashes are common. This is a frequent occurrence with this app. I'm done. Canceling the subscription.,
"Works pretty great. Love the personal feed section. A dark mode would be very appreciated, though, since I usually like reading my news late at night.",
"Unfortunately besides charging the reader money, nytimes think it is appropriate their articles with so many ads, that you can't swipe a single time without seeing one.",
my app keeps switching to the beta version which made me unable to use the app. havere downloaded many times but the problems keep occuring. someone please help!,
App feels janky overall. Feed is jerky and jumps around a lot as ads load. Can't play video in landscape mode so they end up being tiny. Even paid users have to watch video ads before videos,
So happy to finally get the subscription to NYT. It's great to have reliable news available on my device for a reasonable monthly price. Thanks to all the journalists for their hard work and dedication to bring us the important news stories from around the world.,
Having lots of bugs lately. Pixel 2 android 9. Articles fail to load cause of error. Homescreen often completely blank or app crashes.,
"Love NYT articles, but the app frequently does not recognize my subscription when viewing articles from Pixel news feed and blocks articles. I think I have subscribed twice now and it still happens.",
"News is great, but taking away Night Mode was a terrible decision. May have to change subscription service to another newspaper because it's nearly unreadable.",
"Notifications are weird. I get some headlines pushed but if I open the app, a flood of notifications pop up that weren't pushed out.",
"This is an excellent app. It is easy to find articles of interest and to save them for later access. I ended up subscribing as I was so interested in the articles, most of which are very well written.",
"Sluggish, and otherwise frustratingly unpredictable. As much as I love the NYT, this is the worst news app on my phone. Has made me reconsider renewing my subscription. Why must it be so?!",
"Love the NYT. The app is terrible. I want to be able to search for an article I saw somewhere. I want dark mode. I want the link on the website that says ""read in app"" to actually take me to the app, not the play store.",
Great customizable notifications and bookmarking. I didn't get enough use out of this app because they removed offline functionality - that's killer for competitive extemperaneous speaking.,
"I hate that when i get a notification for a specific article and tap it, it never takes me to that article. Just the default feed. I then have to hunt for it. May as well just use Google News.",
it has started crashing and just cannot open it. I have tried reinstalling it but in vain. Although it was working fine before for more than a year or so.,
Great news service. Absolutely the golf standard of journalism. But the subscription is a bit high. Wish NYT would come up with a cheaper option.,
"I subscribed, but it's still asking me to do so. Was advised by NY Times customer service that they were having issues connecting to Google Accounts, but the issue still isn't resolved.",
"Critical flaw in app is that when clicking on news alerts, it opens app to an unrelated article. Then you have to search for story. Inexcusable Android support. It was already obvious NYT didn't care about Android users when it failed to launch NYT Cooking App outside of Apple store.",
"the May 18 update introduced a bug my Motorola G Power phone and to my Samsung tablet. The mini-crossword puzzle layout does not fit the screen of either the phone or the tablet. The keyboard is clipped and runs off the page on the phone, and on the tablet the puzzle is useless without the keyboard",
"App seems to be broken. Any attempt at opening an article leads me to a blank screen that simply shows me the ""loading"" circle until I give up.",
I paid for a digital subscription. And now the app doesn't work. Shows update required message although downloaded several times. I need a fix ASAP!,
I've been a faithful reader of the NYT over 30 years. I much prefer the digital version. This app certainly meets my requirements.,
One of the most solid and trustworthy news sources out there. Good details and sources. I don't know why Americans get their news from bloggers and talking heads when there are still actual news agencies.,
"Really miss the Times widget. Perfectly sized, good photos. Doesn't make much sense that they would ditch it.",
App often crashes and needs to be re-started. I'm using a Samsung Tablet (S2). Looks like it has to do with graphics being displayed.,
Great article covering important history both of the past and in the making. Shows the personal sacrifice and ambiguity a lot of people in Taiwan are having to navigate.,
"Finally, it's refreshing correctly again, but now night/dark mode is gone! REALLY need that back again - is it really that hard to implement? I pay for my subscription, and among SO MANY others would like to have dark mode back.",
"The most up-to-date , highly relevant and informational, comprehensively detailed ,fair and unbiased news reporting,story write ups or articles in sub-magazine sections of the NYTimes written wonderfully in a manner has made a subscriber like me so much used to reading it .Over the time,NY Times has become my most favourite News Source & Family Magazine .",
"The New York times was really good, but it wasn't very organized. YOu couldn't search on the home page either. But the articles were super!",
"Hangs and crashes all the time. Sporadically reloads the page by itself. Strolling stops sometimes. Great content, but bad user experience.",
"I'm a paid subscriber and like supporting real investigative journalism... But being force fed advertising annoys me. Animated ads, video ads, geez!!! Also, this app consumes seriously excessive battery - what is it doing? Seems very suspect. Poor user experience.",
"Usually an excellent newspaper, but also capable of being less than objective when reality pops the bubble of a phantasy of the Editorial Board. Except for that, this newspaper is usually reliable.",
Having to reinstall this APP after every read of an article is fundamentally an extremely poor feature. Please hire some credible coders that have basic expertise. This flaw has been showing up for too long.,
"App shuts down and will not update, fix it b4 I cancel. It has been over a month. I have dumped the app and reloaded multiple times. I'm not getting my money's worth of use. No use, at all.",
"Great reporting. great photos, great opinion. Even when they make mistakes, they're not afraid to admit them and fix them. America needs The Times.",
The best newspaper in the United States.,
Notifications work terribly. Almost never open up the same story in app. Search function in app doesn't find recent and relevant stories.,
Irritating user experience. I'm also getting system notifications that the app is draining my battery when the app isn't even open in background. F that. Uninstalling; I'll just view content on my laptop.,
Since the recent update I can't play the mini crossword on my phone. The keyboard only shows two rows of letters. I will give the app 5 stars when this is fixed!,
"it's a great source for news, usually providing a lot of context. they let you customize some notifications so you get need of interest to you.",
"Nothing works. Background update is garbage, app doesnt download for offline viewing -- ever. They even removed dark mode. Complete garbage.",
Buggy. Crashes often. Despite having a subscription they load ads into the content. There crashes seem related to ads that get stuck loading.,
"Crashes way too often, long loading times for articles seem to be normal. Using a 5+ year old tablet should be possible.",
"Absolutely hate being lulled in by app notifications only to be told that I'm ""offline."" Since I have to use a browser to read anything, I'll just skip the infuriating spin in the barrel on the way to the news. Deleting.",
The app keeps telling me I'm offline when I'm not (all other apps are connecting to the internet normally). This is an intermittent issue and it needs to fixed!,
I've read (and relied on) the Times almost every day since the 1950s except for 2 years in the Peace Corps when all I could get was the News of the Week in Review which they sent us. It's a major asset.,
Was  not able to access the subscription after purchase. Neither Google Playstore or NYT were any help in solving this. The playstore denied my refund. I recommend going straight to NYT and not use this subscription offering from Google.,
"The news are pretty good as expected from NYT but, about the app... I would like the dark mode to be optimized and the ""Todays Paper"" developed in smartphones!",
It keeps on losing my subscription information and asks me to subscribe again and again. Far from seamless experience. Very frustrating.,
"So many bugs and usability issues. NYT has uniformly terrible technology to begin with, but their Android apps are much worse than the iPhone equivalents.",
"App constantly crashes. The elimination of night mode has made this app even less useful. At some point, the app undermines the content.",
"NYT content is generally excellent and worth the subscription, but bright, obnoxious animated and video ads interrupt an otherwise well designed reading experience in this app.",
"It's the comments that I read the most. Great newspaper, tops. Many useful sections. Have been reading it for years before they started charging, don't remember how long ago that was.",
"The app works just ok and it's not available offline. What really bothers me, however, is that I'm paying to have access to the content and still get lots of ads everywhere.",
"Another update, another issue. Fixed keyboard problem, but now I am back to not being able to open puzzles in landscape mode. Extremely frustrated with this app!",
"App keeps on crashing, I'm a paid subscriber but App crashes evertime I try to login with my Facebook credentials. Please correct this. Maybe this issue, with the App, is its compatibility with Android Pie OS",
"I find current information in many fields at the New York Times and love the digital edition. I want more than politics and I get it here; Technology, Lifestyle, Food, and Humanities. great book reviews.",
"The ability to open in Google Chrome browser to read instead of going back to app. Dark mode, ability to turn off, it glitches.",
Its good as a news app and the 360 videos are a good addition but nyt has so much more to offer. App content categories needs to be broader than just news articles - am going back to flipboard & trendeer apps am afraid,
The latest version is constantly trying to refresh content so you cant easily switch articles. Ads have become more invasive and annoying.,
The app has so many bugs. Articles aren't shown. No scroll bar. Notifications aren't displayed correctly.,
Half the articles I click on just don't load. I get a spinner. Using a Galaxy 10 with wifi. I've never had this issue with The Washington Post or other new apps. Disappointed.,
"Easy to read, but search could be better and there is no option to search text within articles. Some news content leans into opinion.",
I have trusted the New York Times since I was old enough to read. I appreciate the presentation of facts on important issues. The layout of the app is easy to navigate.,
"Chock-full of informative, dependable facts for people on both sides of the aisle. Of course, reading The Times also was part of my conversion from Republican to Democrat, so maybe that means something useful to you.",
"News app part is good, but the spelling bee interface is the buggiest thing in existence. So many bugs it's sometimes unplayable.",
It crashes multiple times when reading an article. Ads crash the app... Existing seems to crash the app. Please get your engineers to fix this.,
"Overly woke and blinded by a strict narrative. Sadly, it is no longer the paper of record. After many years of enjoying this publication/app... it's time to uninstall.",
It used to be a great app but now every time I return from reading a story it takes me back to the top of the home page instead of back to where I was on the page. Very frustrating and makes me reconsider my subscription.,
"Great news source - clunky app. When you get a notification and click on it, instead of going to the story, it goes to the top of the home page.",
"1) When a lead shows up on my phone screen, that is the story I expect to see when I tap the link. 2) I really get tired of repeatedly signing in on my phone.",
"Useless piece of junk. Forced to download & employ, not intuitive, not user-friendly, wish the Times would either allow reading or not, & lose this useless piece of junk.",
"Constantly up to date on info. you can't get from standard news media, factual analysis and presentation.",
Strong reporting from quality journalists and excellent articles. I don't always agree with what I read or certain angles and slants yet the NYT subscription is one I am enjoying.,
Every time they update the app they screw up the resolution for the crossword such that the keyboard is half off the screen. I'm sure it will be fixed in another couple weeks bit this is about the fifth time. Why do I keep paying for this?,
The site keeps crashing.I sometimes have to reload an article 3 times during a 15 minute period. I hope they fix it soon. Android user.,
Good content and easy to use. still some work in progress around the dark mode for special coverages.,
"Bugs. I see other people having issues and my most recent one was that it wouldn't update. Like, days and days later. I finally had to delete it.",
"The app is well designed 👌, and the articles are obviously pretty good seeing as how the nytimes is such a successful paper. It's the news app I use most frequently.",
Great experience and great news. I would add the option to read offline. Have had a hard time trying to read in the subway.,
"It's an OK app. The ""save for later"" feature won't let me unsave when I am finished with the article. It's very annoying.",
Drains battery! Articles are fine but the app drained the battery of my Samsung phone. Had to uninstall it. Oddly enough it seems to work fine on my Ipad mini.,
"great when it works. pixel xl, articles don't load and app freezes a few times a day. This is for the paid version of the app.",
"not as progressive leaning as your magat friends think but a decent app, easy to navigate, save stuff, and quality content if you go find it.",
I really enjoy receiving the notifications with the latest news. The games are also good if you want to take a break. I would prefer if they would show more international news in the main page.,
Brilliant app. It would be great if you could introduce one more feature for Android phone users: To be able to select and rearrange the Customized Sections and More Sections in the Menu much like way one can do on Apple phones.,
"The makers of this app can't even manage text inputs on Android properly, so beware of endless repeats when you input letters, in Spelling Bee for example.",
Truky awful experience. Almost more ads than text. And animated ads to boot. Even if you have a subscription.,
"I've paid for a subscription off and on as I could afford (live on a fixed income via disability) as I believe in supporting our newspapers as much as possible, even if that means digitally. The reporting released today led me to resubscribe simply to show my support of a job well done.",
"Always a source of intelligent, thoughtful journalism that respects and engages the reader while covering a myriad of subjects. And when they make a mistake, they actually admit it. How refreshing...",
"It is a good app, which I use on a daily basis. However, every time it gets an update, it crashes, so I need to uninstall and install it again. That is frustrating.",
Would like the ability to see the notification bar when reading an article. Just want to see the time when I'm reading through a lengthy article.,
"Bug in notifications: when there are multiple notifications, sometimes when expanding one to read it, the description text is from a different story.",
"After a while, the app stops displaying articles in a timely fashion. App has to be restarted to fix extremely sluggish behaviour.",
"NYT is, in my opinion, the best newspaper in this country. Their news is fact checked with followups, mind intriguing games and various crosswords.",
"Half the time article never opens, or wrong one. Also very slow. I was hoping some of this would be fixed!",
My experience: Very difficult to post a criticism and emails sent are rarely if ever answered. The snobbery is off the charts.,
"The app is making an awful screeching/white noise sound every few minutes today. I think its connected to an ad, but its made the app unusable today.",
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! couldn't unsubscribe unless I gave them a call. Chat wasn't working. There was no email. They said ""you can cancel anytime""... well I couldn't cancel at all! I can't believe the HIGH level of UNPROFESSIONAL behaviour from their staff! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!",
No point in having this app. It doesn't update more than every day or two. Nobody needs yesterday's news. Developer seems oblivious to similar complaints. Too bad. I like the NY Times but this is ridiculous.,
"I spend $5 a month for the app to consistently give me an error message when I try to read, plus I often use the cooking section but I have to use my browser because its not on the app. Please fix this o dont want to unsubscribe but its becoming not worth the problems",
"The app itself is fine when I'm using it, but even if I disabled background updates it was using 25%(!!!) of my total battery usage and melting my phone. Uninstalled until I hear that this is fixed...",
"After a recent update, the app loads very slow. The articles used to load instantly. Now it could take up to a minute to load",
Animated ads every few paragraphs guarantees the eye can never focus on the text more than a short while. Hope you don't like reading!,
"I look forward to the weekly quiz but rarely do well. the questions are pertinent to the past week. it tells me that even though I watch the news, im not really paying attention to it. I prefer facts to opinions.",
There doesn't seem to be any way to unsubscribe. I'm being billed monthly but told I don't have a subscription. Either let me read the articles or stop billing me. And add an unsubscribe button or link. This is ridiculous!,
"Freezes and often won't refresh, incorrectly saying device is offline when all other apps can connect. Really frustrated.",
"Poorly written app, causes unnecessarily high CPU usage and battery drain. Please get your devs to do a better job. As of Jan. 2021, ""night mode"" has been removed. Navigation within the app is also cumbersome, please get a UI/UX designer.",
"App puts notifications of stories in my Android notification list, but when you click on the headline, that story doesn't come up in the app.",
"the app keeps reloading, making it difficult to read. I keep staring at white spaces for a considerable amount of time. Irritating.",
"Very disappointing app. Many pages don`t load, others crash. Performance has gotten worse in recent weeks. Please fix this.",
Really good some times scrolling through the App or the articles is annoying because an ad will load that will bump you up or down the page making you lose your spot but other wise it's great,
Gives good info if subscription. Glitched until update where scrolling stopped after opening page completely. Status bar headlines are worth having if interested in big topic news.,
"The only downside to this app is that I am asked to subscribe to either the print &/or digital edition several times a day. I am considering uninstalling this app, but will wait & see...",
"Now I'm constantly getting messages that this app is draining my battery. When I close all apps, NYT does not close. One Plus 6.",
"I use an academic pass to access the Times, but neither the app nor the mobile site recognizes it. I'll be logged in to my account, and the pass will be active, but I'll still hit the paywall, the effect being I can only use my pass on a computer",
The best media outlet; let us not mince words when acknowledging the NYT as the best possible source of information. Its journalistic rigor is a beacon at a time when nothing is more significant than the current influx of conspiracy theory peddled by shady individuals and media groups.,
"have enjoyed up to date, well reported & balanced news on a variety of topics of interest. Some bias at time, but usually limited to opinion pieces. I trust these articles enough to share with friends & colleagues on social media to explain COVID, politics& other complex issues.",
"This is a rating for the app, not the NYT. The app constantly hangs and/or crashes, rendering it useless.",
"This app won't let me read certain news unless I sign up. So basically if you don't let them fill your mail with junk, it won't work.",
"Broken experience since recent update. Notifications don't open app to the story, app is cumbersome trying to find story related to the notification.",
THE NYT is doing it right. Digital subscription plus focused news letters (notifications) get you to your interests in a flash. Well written and investigated.,
I love my NYT! I have it open several times a day to read the new articles that have come out during the day or to read the updates on the ones I know will be or have been updated. Not sure what I'd do without it.,
"Please add a native Android share button. If I'm paying a subscription I should be able to share to any app I want, not just those that NYT likes (or more likely who paid them for the priveledge).",
"Being from across the pond it has been lovely to see, experience and get to know more of how our American pals are more directly :) (P.s. Don't miss checking out their cooking section/newsletter too!)",
"It's 2020, and NYT still doesn't offer voice-reading of the articles. The Globe and Mail and Bloomberg have wonderful features for readers to listen.",
Even if I only have a few minutes opening the ap helps me stay informed. If I have more time I can scroll endlessly in the different sections. All the articles are impeccably researched and written. A must have for any informed person!,
Navigation could see a little improvement. Needs to do a better job of allowing me to view news by sections. Maybe add a search function while you're at it,
"This app has as yet to have fresh, warm chocolate chip cookies delivered to me from whatever source. Until then it only gets 4 stars reflecting its dependable delivery of NY Times articles.",
"Cancelled the NYT. Not sure what has happened to the agency but when you have journalists who conspire with corrupt leaders of the government about when to release a story and what to report, it's clear it is not the reliable news source it once was.",
Since the latest update the mini and regular crossword won't load properly. Can't get the full keyboard to load so can't play.,
"Well-designed app. Easy navigation. $4 every 4 weeks for digital access (a one-year, one-time deal; goes up after the year)",
We need a dark mode here!! Also a little disappointed to see ads throughout the app since you have to pay to access the content to begin with.,
"To the author: It seems you are eligible for citizenship, which would entitle you to vote. If so, why have you not applied? Your suggestion is not constructive to bringing our country together. it would deepen the divide and increase the partisanship. Citizenship requires a commitment and loyalty to our Constitution and our country. I question the concept of dual citizenship, and allowing those citizens to vote. Where is their loyalty? Are they voting to benefit this country or the other?",
New version crashes constantly. I'm unable to read a full article without multiple crashes. Please bring back old version.,
"So I downloaded the app from the app Store. When using it said outdated - get latest. The get latest link took me back to the same version I've downloaded. Click open on it and I'm back to the same outdated app message. Repeat infinity times. And I just bought this, should I cancel you guys??",
"News, music, art, all very well done and credible. the app makes it that much easier to engage.",
The app works great once your settings are correct. I like having access to the entire paper on my phone.,
"Every day since December 2nd, when I click on the This Morning Daily Briefing push notification, I am shown the Daily Briefing from December 2nd. It's not a big deal but it is quite annoying.",
"it's good compared to its competitors, although the dark theme is still in beta and needs more work and it'd be good to have more audio stories in there too",
"I have other Media to read, the NYT is hard to use and unattractive to me, I only use it to repost on Twitter or FB. It would be cheaper for Students and Seniors to have a read charge instead of a monthly subscription fee. Where's my Sunday paper?",
"My favorite, most complete, most reliable, most fascinating news source! I gain useful knowledge & perspectives every day about our nation & our complex world, too.",
It is much better to subscribe directly through New York Times. The google play offers limited content whereas the direct subscription will enable the subscriber to read more content on their phone and on their computer.,
Do not download this app. This app doesn't allow you to read their news articles unless you subscribe. Just go to Google and search for NYtimes news and you'll see all their articles for free and you won't be hassled. The NY Times should remove this app from the app store because they clearly do not want people to read their articles using this app.,
"Costumer service is very bad. They charged me even when I told them to unsubscribe the free trial and they won't respond later. Do not take the free subscription ever, it is a trap.",
it's worth every penny. The amount of content is astounding and scrolling on your mobile phone is easy and delightful.,
I am not a great reader with respect to volume of material. I really count on good quality of the content that I do read. this makes the New York Times my go to.,
Recent updates have made the app practically unusable. It constantly crashes or refreshes to the homepage while reading an article.,
It doesn't open. Once it opens it says download new update and it leads me back to play where I already have the update. And this is a continuous process.,
"It never updates and can't cancel. I only gave it 1 star to get into this page to dis the app and look for cancel function. Ripoff, and I grnerally agree with NYT editorial policy. The app sucks.",
"Slow, often doesn't load stories at all. Phone is noticably slower when running the app . Will revise this score once fixed .",
"Every time I click on a notification, it takes me to the front page, not the story in the notification. The story in the notification is often nowhere to be found.",
The updated version is crashing constantly. Please abandon the upapp immediately and return to the previous version which worked perfectly.,
"About this app says: ""• Read our Spanish-language coverage with NYT en Español."" But the option doesn't exist. A real disappointment cause I've really enjoyed reading NYT en Español. Am considering unsubscribing.",
"I live in Los Angeles and have seen the steady degradation of a once great Los Angeles Times. On Mondays I now call it the Los Angeles Pamphlet. I have come to recognize the importance of the always reliable New York Times. Reading it every day gives me the assurance that I have access to the Truth, usually. Thank you.",
I paid for subscription and the app tells me to update it even though its the latest version in the playstore. Why does the app stop working when I can't update it. Not the first time it happened!,
"Rating 1/5. Not because of the app per se, but because NYT started auto-logging out any site users on mobile. Then they started pushing ads for the app to stay signed in. As a paying NYT member, I don't appreciate such an aggressive dark pattern.",
"great app layout, love the weekly Quiz on Fridays (especially when I score 10 out of 11, still waiting to get 11 out of 11), great writing, etc.",
"Not the easiest to use. It continues to ask me to sign it. Doesn't recognize my account. But sort of works, sometimes. Perhaps the CCP is at work trying to SILENCE the NYT.",
"This is easily the best news app. I live in Australia, so just wish our national news outlets produced something even close to the quality of the NY Times app.",
"Very clunky app. Clicking a headline on the main page often takes you to an awful live feed layout. Also, no dark mode.",
"It keeps closing the app and never opening again so I have to download it over and over, I do pay the digital subscription and enjoy columns and news very much but it keeps worrying me",
"This app is buggy, especially on Android phones. The app won't load readers' comments. The Times is aware of the problem, but I haven't seen any evidence that they're working on a fix.",
"Quality journalism and articles. Now in dark mode so you can read easier the intriguing and in-depth reporting. Be informed, be enlighten by all fact based journalism. News before its news thanks to the dedicated hard hitting reporting.",
"Great article with strong points I can use talking with my friends averse to ""social programs"" as infrastructure. Passionate yet avoids the syrupy agruements that turn people off. Our values are most evident in how we treat the vulnerable and marginalized among us. Love this!!",
The app dosen't have a way to unsubscribe. They need a call. They convinced PayPal to close my PayPal account because I tried to unsubscribe by not paying them. NY Times is a liberal account of current events.I unsubscribed because it was too partisan.,
Deep links via push notifications are still not working. They do not link to the specific article and push to the home page.,
"Aside from The wonderful news coverage, the app works incredibly smoothly and any issues are fixed promptly as they arise.",
Paid subscription did not include access to all NYT features. Unable to cancel via Google Play store. No one to contact for refund. NO RESPONSE TO SEVERAL REQUESTS.,
"in today's world of fake news, it's reassuring to know that some media giants such as the New York Times, are still taking journalism seriously (for the most part) and try to focus on the stories that actually matter to their readers.",
"I haven't been able to access my saved article, nor find any email for customer care for people who can't call the US local number like me...Even the web version doesn't let me log in.... The last update needs some bug fix....soon!",
"Beware google deals if you've already been a subscriber, you might end up asking for a refund like I did. (I did end up getting my refund within a few hours.) What's a few bucks for this level of journalism anyways? Back to the old plan.",
Anytime I click on a story from my notifications it takes me to the general page and I can't find the article... one of the most unhelpful mechanics I've seen on the app,
"Since the last month or so, it started displaying ads that automatically play sound or music. This is totally unacceptable!",
good coverage of national and world news. interesting in depth articles and opinions (on all sides). older articles hang on a bit long.,
"Notifications. News alerts, clicking on the notification fails to take me to the story, it just opens the app home page stories.",
Very frustrating. It's good this app updates the news frequently but often you can't get through even one paragraph before it reloads again.,
"Not usable at night, they dropped night theme/mode months ago with no plan or timetable to return. Can you say ""loss of functionality""? I would have given 4-5 stars otherwise. The Wall Street Journal can do this np, why can't these guys??",
I recently subscribed back to NYT and the app is much worse than it used to be. The current 3 tab menu is super hard to navigate through,
"My main source for news and features. Excellent user interface, great content and the daily crossword.",
"Good interface, but external links and notifications often don't open properly in the app, so has to be restarted.",
"Night mode is gone. Cannot abide all that light pinging my retina. The world is going dark mode. Why is NYT holding out? I'll be back when dark mode returns. Please, please restore dark mode. Why are you holding out?",
Always deep and interesting analysis. Their approach to non-subscriptors made the Washington Post (that does not allow to go past an article's title) irrelevant.,
Frequently fails to load articles. I much prefer accessing the NY Times via the internet browser. This app needs a lot of work!,
"Absolutely extraordinary! Careful forensic journalism here lays out not just the events at the Capitol, but a systematic account of the key instigators and the incompetence (and worse) of the various police forces.",
"Content is great, but canceling a subscription requires calling customer service or chatting with them online. Not having a ""cancel subscription"" button in your account section is obnoxious.",
Battery vampire! I want the NYTimes news but this app drains the Galaxy 10 battery from constant usage. Constantly warned to turn the app off but that kills the Notifications. Can't this use of battery be fixed?,
"It looks fine in the experience, but the notifications almost never open the correct article when I click them.",
"This is beautifully written, lyrically poetic. The accompnying images are powerful and haunting. And its final impact is strangely hopeful.",
Excellent app. Excellent news source. Crossword puzzles. Too bad it requires upgraded membership to play more games.,
"Thought I would give it a chance, but totally left biased very skewed articles. A lot of opinion, very little unbiased news. If you want a cheerleader for the left, this is your app. If you are middle-of-the-road in your views, as I am, look elsewhere.",
"Very well written and great photographs, but even more awesome is how this inside-out thinking of WiFi-by-bus pulled these kids and their families out of isolation and back on track to a more future-proof life. Kudos also to this Jackson school district superintendent! -Rick Setzpfand from the Netherlands",
I'd give this app a better rating if they just brought back dark mode! Why remove it? Even if it's being rebuilt just leave the old version in place temporarily? Anyways hopefully it comes back sooner rather than later,
"The most beautiful interface of all news apps, very up to date authoritative. Only fault is that it is not entirely free.",
"NY times tries to have good journalism, but they are also too sensationalist. Stick more to quality over quantity.",
"The NYT has long been my favorite print news source. Thorough, thoughtful, self-aware, evolving, the pulse of the nation. Thanks for keeping me in the know. Also, thanks for the NYT Cooking app - worth every penny.",
This killed a version of the app that was working on the device; not familiar with android so will have a hard time rolling back.,
"Notwithstanding being a subscriber I uninstalled NYTimes App because of inability to directly reference, share or comment on individual news stories & threads inside the App using a date, topic, web address or link. Useful only for breaking news and reading the stories.",
Its nice to have easy access to slanderous and biased journalism at your fingertips. A more serious approach vs. The Enquirer that entices you to want to flip a coin as to whether the material is factual or not.,
Really cool graphics and illustrations integrated in the app! Gives a different perspective than a still photo!,
"Video's won't show up or play, screen stays black and doesn't show anything, no audio either. I already cleared cache and logged in again but it doesn't work.",
One of the best sources of news on one of the best news apps. Very happy customer. (One suggestion for the NYT app developers: add an easily accessible search bar for NYT stories.),
"i dont have the app because the reviews are terrible. i love the NYT but all the reviews have kept me from even trying the app myself. until they fix the app I'll stick to the daily paper and other mobile outlets. NYT, please fix the app so you can take my monies",
Excellent worldwide news and well structured app. Works well on all my devices. I recommend the app and the subscription to NYT news 👍,
Following links to articles or even from my notification bar leads me to blank pages on the app. It is pretty frustrating.,
App keeps blocking me and asking me to subscribe even though I already have. Also asking me to login even though I already have. So frustrating and annoying. App sucks. I've removed the app and reading NYT via internet browser like it 2010.,
"Makes me sign in way too often. I have a paid subscription and I expect to be able to read the articles, but too often, it asks me to type in my password. Guys, I don't remember all my passwords and when I'm out and about, I don't have access to my password list. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to pay for this.",
"Paid for All Access subscription within Google play account - unlimited digital access, plus access to the NYT Games, NYT Cooking, and one bonus digital subscription for a year. But NYT, NYT Games, NYT Cooking apps say I am not a subscriber!",
This does not update its articles very often and it sends notifications but when you click them it doesn't always go to the story described.,
"A real issue/topic Newspaper that operates as Tabloid Publication with most of it's articles. Most posted writings are opinionated. Device Notifications and Article titles are the best in the click bait industry, extremely misleading. Not a recommended source of un-bias National or Local informative news.",
Dies every few days and I have to reinstall. I have cleared the cache and done a force stop. Nothing helps. Love the times. Hate the app.,
"Recent performance deteriorated, seems to be since last update. Headline links do not show content 50% of the time. Had been a long time satisfied subscriber otherwise.",
Writing is nuanced and more complete. Articles leave me with a sense of knowing a subject from different perspectives and with sources that are credible and hard sought.,
"This app is horrible. It won't let me read more than a handful of articles a month even though I have a subscription. I've tried logging in multiple times and it says I'm logged in, but still won't let me access articles.",
NY TIMES is a great source of information. While it is not perfect it is a solid source of well researched information. My only disappointment is that it costs more than a retiree on a limited budget can afford.,
"Horrible app, I am a paid subscriber for many years, but boots me to the paywall to subscribe. And, will not let me access anything on the NYT homepage or articles. They eliminated the app for the Kindle Fire, so bought an android tablet, but this app is worthless. How is the NYT going to stay in business without having apps for the most popular devices? Stupid",
The NYTimes is great!! The app is not so great on my Chromebook. It doesn't return to home after an article yet,
"I tried the free Times subscription. Very clear, no distractions like other news articles. Trustworthy NYTimes. Awesome!!",
"Even with the majority of news publications not to be trusted any longer, I still find value in the majority of NY Times articles. Most can be fact checked and are accurate.",
"for the past 3 days I haven't been able to read this site. keeps saying Expired, download latest version. very frustrating.",
"This version is full of bugs. Games section: mini crossword: bottom half of the keyboard missing, Vertex: kicks me out when zooming in.",
"The ads are a constant obstacle to reading. Without an ability to opt-out of ads, subscribers pay for the free version of Hulu or YouTube.",
Has become an ad ridden experience for paying subscribers. The content is great but I'd like an ad free offering and no dark pattern subscription practices.,
It quickly drains battery. The high battery consumption rate can immediately convert my phone to a pocket hand warmer. Need a huge improvement!,
"I like the app and the newspaper. the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is when I go back from reading an article, the app brings me back to the top and I have to scroll down again.",
"I used to love reading NY Times, but it's just not what it used to be. For a company whose name includes 'New York', it has a serious lack of New York related news. Also, I'm not a big fan of having to call to unsubscribe, when I didn't have to call to subscribe.",
"This app has become more trouble than it is worth. Too hard to navigate. Eats up my battery. Articles seem to appear, then disappear. Sad.",
"High quality content, but not great for searches and pressing on notifications doesn't always lead you to the teased content.",
"I love getting the NYTimes every day on my phone. it has become my go-to source for news, and their investigative pieces are exceptional.",
Up to date news. Would prefer a better interactive menu to select the news I prefer. I like the crossword puzzles. Still exploring.,
"!!!!NEEDS A DARK MODE!!!! I also read the WSJ, and they have a full dark theme/ night mode, making reading much more pleasant on the eyes. Outside of that the daily content & reporting the NYT puts out is terrific.",
"I think you guys got a bug going. When logging in using a google account, then logging out and trying to log in with another google account doesn't work since the app just logs you in with the first google account you fed it which is awful if you logged in using the wrong account.",
"Notifications don't link to the referenced article but to the main page, and then you can't find the referenced article. This has been going on for a while along time.",
Please add an option for a one time prepaid subscription for people who don't want to use credit cards. Let me purchase six months or a year of news access straight up by paying a lump amount.,
"What is wrong with your app?? I installed and reinstalled, and it kept changing into beta version which CANNOT BE OPENED! Pls fix your problems before making it available for users to download!",
"Downloaded specifically for Dark Mode, which used to be in experimental features. No longer exists. Will be reading on web browser with dark mode instead.",
You pay for the service and they serve you tons of ads. It is completely unnecessary too because I get no ads on the website. It's a shame they don't want it to be easy to read the news that you pay for.,
"one of the worlds best papers. my favorite columnist are Maggie Haberman and Thomas Friedman NYT leans a bit left at times, but I counter balance that by reading the also excellent WSJ too. WSJ leans right, especially on its editorial pages.",
Consistently crashes when I try to open certain articles--usually ones with more complicated graphics.,
"A lousy app was just made dramatically worse. it is now an app for 6 year olds designed by Smurfs. It is clunky, impossible to customize and completely riddled with ads (from bizarre places: I am not joining a synagogue that runs internet ads)",
I would have given it 5 Stars before. The new updates have made it incredibly difficult and frustrating to keep logged in even though I have an account which is more than 10 years old.,
"One of America's best newspapers. Their research and investigation are what impress me the most. A great job with the digital edition, I read many stories on my phone and PC.",
"Mostly good app, in terms of news etc. However latest update has stopped the crosswords and other puzzles working properly. Please remedy.",
Great app but way too many ads for paying subscribers and lack of dark mode makes it all but impossible to read at night. Ridiculous in 2022 this still doesn't have a dark mode.,
"the app is unworthy of the Times. it tells me I don't have an internet connection, but will open the minicrossword. back to the Washington Post. Their site works fine.",
"My favorite daily source of information. It's well organized, thorough, thought provoking and reasonably balanced.",
"Among other things, you are unable to exit an ad and go back to listing with all of the articles. Have to close the app to close the ad. Browser 4 lyfe",
"I would love it if I could avoid notices about sports. I don't subscribe to sports notifications, and I'm not sure why they would be considered ""breaking news"" or ""top stories""",
totally busted with Chrome OS 93.0.4577.xxx The page just jumps aroud and you end up with 4 copies of the top ad covering most of the stories. was fine until a recent update,
"App works great! It also gives a good number of push notifications, not so many that I feel overwhelmed every time I check my phone. Definitely worth a download.",
"Old app said I had to update, after doing so it stopped working, saying I had no internet, which is not true. Loved reading NYT now what!? Updated they sure did fix it, fabulous!!!",
"You guys suck. Your ideals are twisted and pathetic, so far away from what a paper was actually used for. Not your crappy opinions, just the facts. I realize this takes more effort than just writing what you want, but you are closer to an Enquirer style paper than a reliable source of current information.",
Craps out all the time. It's slow. Updates constantly. Ads seem more important than news content.,
"News isn't fake, though there are many fake news organizations. I appreciate the NYT for providing a reliable source of information that does its best to represent views fairly.",
"Great newspaper. One of the things I love about the paper is the writing, there is so little GOOD writing anymore. I'm always impressed when their prose feels more like poetry",
"Everytime i open the app, it says app has expired, install new version. After fresh install works for some time again same problem crops up. Now i am sick of it.",
"Really glitchy. Pages don't always fully load, and there isn't a clear way to do a keyword search.",
"It's 2022 and there's no dark mode. There's no reason (other than ads, despite already paying for the subscription) that I should be stuck blasting light just to read.",
App is pretty great. only issue is the notifications don't always send you to the correct story.,
After the latest update the app keeps crashing!! So disappointed. I love the NYT and hope they fix this buggy app soon!!,
"Android - Pixel 2, doesn't load articles. Quality control, anyone? Can they please just hire new programmers? I want NYTimes to succeed, but clearly their current Android developers are not cut out for this type of thing.",
"You need a subscription in addition to the app, but subscriptions are reasonably priced. Still a great newspaper and, unless you're a diehard Fox ""News"" fan, you'll probably find the NYT relatively unbiased in their reporting.",
"When I tap an alert, it brings me to the app but gets stuck on the previous article. Doesn't bring me to the article I was interested in. Longstanding problem.",
I created an account with the email and password and then I try to go tell it what I'm interested in and keeps putting me in a loop to create an account and login and it never lets me pick anything as my interest. Right now I have the free account for one week And I will not pay because this does not work!,
"I subscribe to ny times games but even when I'm logged in, it doesn't recognize me. Also, after reading 3 articles. It asks me to subscribe. I go to settings and sure enough, there's my name...I'm logged in. What's the point?",
"Downloaded three times, alwayscto be told it "" willbe instalked soon."" Is that a joke. Not showing 8n downpoads or on app list. I will seriously beyond pique if Im hacked for this fruitless experience. I am a brand new NYT subscriber, to boot. ZERO STARS.",
Would have rated four stars before but with the most recent update a lot of things got worse. The departure of dark mode means I essentially don't use the app anymore. Please bring it back!,
Was good until this week. Now visual scroll articles are failing and my device care has to force close the app because it's overheating my phone when not even in use.,
"I have subscribed through the app. My subscription is registered on Google play, I log in with that account and I still can't read any articles. I just keep getting the pay prompt",
Amazing!! This is the first news app that hasnt crashed my phone. Very reliable and helpful!! The best one so far.,
App has issues with search within. It keeps bugging out everytime I search and want to reopen an article I've read.,
The app is clunky. You can't swipe to the next story. You have to go back. Then the page reloads. It's frustrating.,
"Lovely piece. I grew up in Maine but have lived in Canada most of my life. You got all the Maines along route 1...the other Maines, in the lakes and mountains and the remote peninsulas and islands now awaits you. It's big and complex and wonderfully excentric. And there are no box stores or cell reception in those places either. Happily.",
"All I want to do is read an article about the Tonys, first they wanted me to download the app then to creat an about to read in browser I downloaded the app and now they want me to pay!! I ended up not reading the article and deleting the app and canceling my account",
"3 years in, don't know what you changed but I'm out. See yea neva, it's been real. Lost my widget. Lost article access. And now I just can't log back in. Probly better off with a book anyway.",
What in the world happened to the app's dark mode? My eyes bleed out now everytime I try to read in the dark at night :'( such a great feature that was suddenly removed for no good reason!,
"Not Fox, not CNN. Not WAPO, or NPR. _Trustworthy_ Clearly differentiates between opinion and news (facts). Called up to cancel my subscription after my ""special offer"" expired, they extended it. Will continue forever at this price.",
"None of the sections will load, just top news, on my s9 plus. Update: this was fixed. Now, the app freezes when I try to scroll",
"My father was a NYT reader, and so am I. It is one of my trusted news sources. The app is good, but I am unable to post comments to articles. The best I can do is reply to another's post, which is not the same.",
"The ""For You"" section is completely broken and lately basic scrolling has gotten worse in any story with a graphic element or a big enough ad. We're paying for our subscriptions and this is barely readable ok a phone right now",
The application is good and has a great UI. The quality of NY Times journalism is excellent. Must have app.,
App stopped functioning. Getting blank page and message that device is offline but it isn't. All other apps functioning properly.,
"Good app and good content. On my Android tablet, ads cover the article text. One example is the Good Thins ad.",
Constantly unable to open articles. Tried restarting. So buggy. And I am a paid subscriber. Frustrating.,
I get daily emails and read stories. Navigational tools and clues hard to locate. Cannot find podcasts.,
Simply stopped working 2 weeks ago!!!! Customer service said they are working on it!!! Nothing has changed though and I am paying for my subscription!!! Very BAD!!!,
"UI bad. Extremely easy to accidentally click ads, notification blips often dont lead you to the right article.",
Crashes constantly and notifications don't lead to actual content. You can do much better!,
Removing dark mode so that you can release a new version later is absurd. The latest update now makes the app scroll all the way to the top of the news feed for some reason.,
"I use this app because we have digital subscription, but it stops and crashes constantly. Extremely annoying.",
"Freezes and locks frequently, making it impossible to scroll down and finish reading a story. Cannot read the stories I've paid for.",
Every time I try to get accurate information from this credible site someone is remote accessing your concept of your information and changing to their own opinion and I can't get a true story out of an actual article which sucks because I love the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both of which I subscribed to and have all the sudden loss my subscriptions and now I see are highlighted images of what they want to save like the fact that they and Korean are stealing Google play gift card,
"Am very pleased w/the NY Times app. Is on both my iPhone & tablet. Thx to great $1 per week subscription, have unlimited access to NY Times articles excluding food section unfortunately. Still *Recommend*.",
"Always on point, always delivering a necessary perspective in a polarized country. Always following the most important stories from around the world. Always keeping me informed.",
Consistently freezes up on my Samsung Tab running 7.1.1 Touch and scroll goes dead. Frustratingly useless as is. Uninstalling.,
The articles on the Times are more detailed and informative than any other publication I've subscribed to. The app is a great way to get that information in close to real time. Highly recommended.,
The best news paper in the world. I love the fact that New York Times makes an effort to provide good journalism at an an affordable price for all. Everywhere! Thank you!,
"Educational and informative, I am thankful for the information this company provides. Unfortunately I am compromised (32 months) and cannot access all that the New York Times offers. It is NOT their fault.",
I've enjoyed listening the the daily podcast since it was released. I prefer I good mix of political/social and more global news and I think the daily does a pretty good job at this.,
No support and terrible communication between Google and NYTimes. They could not even locate my account and I never received access to the content. They took my money and provided nothing in return.,
#NAME?,
a strength of the online NYT is the ability to find old stories on a given topic and the extensive online graphics and videos. it's a richer reading experience.,
This app has gotten worse and worse over the years. From notifications that fail to open their corresponding articles to lack of ability to swipe left and right to move from section to section this app keeps falling behind WSJ and WaPo apps for usability/functionality,
"I love the New York Times, but this app needs a dark mode option for reading at night. Hence the low rating. Once it has dark mode, I'll upgrade to 5 stars.",
"a bit long winded. But, really worth the read for its revelation of artist spirit and motivation. And, some interesting action from copyright and intellectual property rights. I'll pass on the book though.",
"Needs a feature to personalise the news categories I'm interested in, something like a ""My News"" page where I don't have to select from the myriad of topics daily. If this is already available, please let me know!",
A helpful informative visual explanation. Cool to follow and see the process of air circulation on a plane. Article is good for considering risk of traveling.,
"My app simply does not work. It had worked for several years, but for months now...it will not open. I have installed and uninstalled...to no avail.",
"This newspaper is total fraud.First it shows that you can have the subscription with only 15Rs/week & then it does not allows you to make payment by your debit card.I literally tried 4 debit card but could not make the payment, then one of their plan showed 170Rs/month (after discount on 690 Rs) after after payment 690 Rs were deducted.I tried to contact their customer care but they were not helpful at all but misguiding me.This issue made me realise that not all prominent things are trustworthy",
Great news Garbage App. The search function is near useless- often will not return a word for word search of the title of an article.,
"Falsely declares my device is offline, won't update content. Worthless for a news app to not show current news and only show DNS errors.",
"I love this but and thepuzzles are amazing! However for some reason it wont accept my CC to subscribe but still the NYT is where i get my news fix everyday, very awesome app, hopefully the devs see this and reach out so i can subscribe",
"I've been a NYT on line subscriber for two decades but this app is unusuable, never recognizes my log in data, tells me my device ""is offline,"" offers no help to access my account.",
Just installed to give a negetive review for interfering with India internal matters. We going to start trend of biased false writing by you if you did that again. Would drop the ratings to 3. Huge population have it's own advantages. We choose this government with highest mandate and we love them.,
Intrusive ads constantly crash the app. Very frustrating. Will see how long i stick around as a customer,
If I have a paid subscription I should not be subject to ads that autoplay with sound. I uninstalled the ap and am considering cancelling my digital subscription because y'all are greedy and those ads are agressive. Shame on you.,
"Took away night mode via update promising it's return. Why don't you just leave it until the replacement is ready? Also, I hate how they display ads despite paying them a hefty subscription fee.",
"Why does this app CONTINUALLY tell me I am not connected to the internet??? I AM connected to the internet! This happened out of the blue. Uninstalled then reinstalled, no change. FIX IT!",
"This is a web browser with ads, don't bother (I'm a subscriber). You can do better than this piece of garbage, New York Times.",
"Excellent contents but very frequent malfunction in new app version, making impossible to access some articles. search engine to be improved",
Only one side of a story. Doesn't print news- but opinion. I want all sides of a current event to make up my own mind. The NYT's is like the pied piper. Leading us down their path. Help us to think- !!!!,
"I love the different sections, the depth of the coverage, and the overall quality of the content.Great app.",
"My most trusted news source for over 20 years. Even with a left-leaning bias they remain the most reliable newspaper, even for a conservative such as myself.",
"NYT isn't perfect (just look at some of the absolute ridiculous hit job reporters they employ, Jennifer Medina's horrendous article regarding Cenk Ugyur comes to mind) but overall it provides a solid foundation for reading the news and I do actually enjoy quite a few of the writers and journalists.",
Overall good but the latest update causes the app the return to the top of the page after reading an article which requires scrolling back down through everything to find your place which is frustrating,
"Decent app. Good pricing. But a very biased and US centric world view. Nevertheless, few media org have the breadth of coverage.",
"I have been trying to buy a subscription. While it mentions discounted rate, when I click on the payment link, no discount is offered. Stuck.",
It's an excellent newspaper but it's embarrassing how many ads are on an app I pay a lot of money monthly for. What a disaster.,
"App removed the widget feature while increasing ""breaking news"" notifications tenfold. Not everything has to be breaking news, you know.",
Used to work on Android tablet then started crashing constantly. So I uninstalled the app and now it downloads from the Playstore but refuses to install!,
"Great app, well designed. I do have trouble with the mini crossword however bc the last row of the keyboard is cutoff",
Recent updates to the UI have caused me to be very annoyed. Like why hide comments in a menu? Why change it from sections you can browse at the top. Why change it to be less intuitive? Stupid.,
"keeps freezing and shutting down. never used to do this previously, but it is now a constant problem. often app is unusable",
"Constantly does not recognize my subscription. I re-signed up twice -- same problem. I tried to support you, NYT, but...",
Great app. Pages and articles load faster now that I upgraded from Samsung S7 to Samsung S21 5G Ultra. I like that I can save articles and share. I love the separate NYTimes Cooking app too.,
Wonderful to read from the breaking news to the cooking to the spectacular obits. To the Year in Review. To the photography. And more.,
Notifications only link to the correct article about 25-50 percent of the time. makes it very frustrating to find an article I actually want to read. Please fix this,
"I preferred the older version of the opening page, I felt like it highlighted more articles. but it's still fine.",
"Great app, great journalism. I cannot recommend this app or the NYT highly enough. It's a pleasure to use, enjoyable to read, and the journalism is thorough and intelligent.",
The app is as awesome as the paper itself! lol I've never had a single problem with the app. It's always worked flawlessly!!,
"Had a class in high school in the late 60's on how to fold the NYT while reading. Need I say more. On Sunday, my father would go out early in the morning and buy The Sunday Times which included the magazine as well and The Daily News (New Yorker here). All four of us would spend the day after church reading the newspapers together.",
"The paper of record, all the news that's fit to print, the newspaper that always meant NEWSPAPER after the Herald-Tribune and the other New York Papers suddenly disappeared into the Daily News and other tabloids, especially if you were growing up in New York State during the 1950s and 60s, AND if your mother would not be without the Sunday Times Magazine Section in which, before Will Shortz was even wearing them, the Sunday Crossword Puzzle was her weekly challenge AND justification of brains!",
NYT makes it overly difficult to cancel subscription by requiring a phone call. Secondly they absolutely hate on Bernie Sanders up until the moment he drops out then praises him to no end. I would avoid this garbage news outlet.,
"Disappointed that so many journalism sites are so biased. I cancelled my NYT subscription after trying it out, you can't read a single article that doesn't take digs at Republicans/conservatives. They're clearly biased to the left & I don't want to read partisan publications. I want truthful, unbiased reporting with just the facts & leave out the biased opinions. NYT is NOT capable of that, terrible journalism, another MSM spewing division & hate towards the right. MSM needs to do better. 👎🏻",
Ask me to login. I put in email address which I set up my account but it doesn't proceed to let me put my password in. Looks like I will be canceling my subscription. Why does this have to be difficult?,
App has become much more stable but the revised ux is a downgrade from preveous design. The new ux adds multiple steps to browsing by sections.,
"App updates constantly, every time you return from an article. You cannot scroll from one story to the next. You must go back to previous page first.",
Excellent reporting on the whirlwind of tragedies hitting some of the most vulnerable in our country. I hope all who read this article and are able to help participate in lifting up those in need.,
"The app is good, but I wish it had a dark mode option for more comfortable and power efficient reading.",
"cannot start my day without it. most accurate up to date news, great articles, professional reporting, impeccable journalism, and damn delicious food section. worth every cent.",
"Jerks when scrolling because the bottom bar keeps popping up, and also has no dark mode still. Edit: app is SO much better after recent update. couldn't be happier 😁",
NYT is my go-to right after email every morning (which includes subscribed email updates from NYT). More than worth the few pennies for a digital subscription!,
"Deleted the app, even though we have to login with our subscription, the app only gives access to a handful of articles. I'm going back to accessing my subscription through the Chrome browser.",
"Sketchy if best. When you click links, you received errors all the time. They need to improve the app or I'm unsubscribing.",
"great daily format of the worlds news stories, or a Sunday morning spent reading about culture,book reviews and events near and far. I was slow to internet version but am hooked after a week.",
"Reliable, well- researched and concise news. Really helpful, gives quick important news updates! Must try.",
"Broken app, works just well enough that the times can have a nagging pop-up on every story urging you to use it. Making your customers hate you is not a good business plan.",
I love the news subscription I pay for. I get updates in my inbox and the app is easy to use. Do wish I could get access to more stuff for the price.,
The NYTimes was a very good news app. The stories were interesting and informative. It was worth the subscription.,
Interface used to be smooth and fast. Everytime I exit an article now the entire page has to reload.,
The biggest issue I have with this app is that when I click on a notification I'm not taken to the story I was notified about. What's the point of doing notifications then?,
"Still needs a dedicated section link for The Wirecutter! Otherwise love the app, the journalists and all they offer. Thanks very much.",
"""Regardless of all the finger pointing concerning Media Bias, I have found the NY TIMES to be one of the few that seems to be more interested in sharing an objective and unbiased presentation from reliable sources and professional journalists.""",
"NYT has some good articles, but it censors all the negative news about the Israli occupation of Palestine, and many articles shown by the app or search are just teases – they show a few sentences and then state ""Subscribe to continue reading"". About 3 to 5 notifications interrupt me every day on the phone about articles of old/repetative news or of no interest.",
"App doesn't work. Try to log in and the page reloads on my S10+. NYT, I'd happily pay a few dollars for a subscription but your app is worth nothing.",
"I love that NYT does a great job in reporting the facts, news and updates. They also make public corrections when an error occurs. Good journalism with ethics!",
"Great app. I was hesitant to subscribe, but they do journalism so well in the mobile format. Good job, NYT.",
"It's very pretty, but every time I try to open an article that it sends as a pop up notification, I get an error message",
Too many ads and the repeat rate is very high. I did not pay for repeated ads showing disturbing pictures of starving children. l am going back to Washington post for my news.,
"They'll take your credit card and start charging it every month. You want them to stop, well that's your problem. Want to ""unsubscribe"" good luck getting that done, they'll be ""to busy"" to unsubscribe you.",
"while i love the NYT site, very good, i prefer accessing the site in a browser, i find the layout is better in the browser than on the app.",
Awful experience when trying to cancel my paid subscription. They make it practically impossible to do so and continue to take my money. Would not recommend,
"NY Times is one of the best news sites available. In depth and comprehensive coverage and, in my opinion, fairly unbiased politically.",
"great way to stay up to date. Unfortunately, the top stories hasn't been loading correctly on my pixel 3 XL since the new update...",
"I miss the newspaper. Endless scrolling is a fad, and it's irritating that NYT cannot seem to make the app read more like a newspaper.",
"After subscribing I thought I would be able to read articles....nope, I am still blocked from seeing articles and being asked to subscribe to see articles. This is a huge problem.",
"Love the app. I was previously able to view it in dark mode. Currently, that's not an option. Hopefully, the developers will rectify the issue.",
"It let me join and enter preferences but then it won't let me read anything unless I get a subscription. That is okay, I understand, but I uninstalled it. Misleading.",
Love it all! Wanted a subscription for years. Smartest money I spend in a month. Keep doing what you do. You really are the link that is keeping America's democracy alive. Thank you,
"After paying for one additional year of subscription via Google, I was locked out of the paid area. Back and forth with nyt customer service was useless. Despicable service. $25 thrown to trash.",
good source of news. truustworthy journalism. only gripe is app sometimes makes it difficult to find the story I want.,
"I was ready to assign an earlier article by Moss to my students on Monday. Now I can back it up with this essay about his new book-- perfect timing, NY TIMES! Thank you!!",
"jittery. And the various parts don't talk to each other. like, in the settings menu there are several sections and they all prompt me to sign in again",
"This is a remarkable conclusion from a well designed study: clean up a vacant lot and the impact is felt in many ways. Clean up and green up that lot, and the effect is stronger. What a wonderful return on a small investment.",
Canceling my subscription next month if they don't fix the video ads. Why would I pay to have my experience disturbed by 3 AUTO PLAYING VIDEOS ADS per article? This tells me they don't appreciate their readers.,
"The latest version is horrible. Can't swipe, clunky, slow, and stories sometimes don't load",
"The content is great, as always, but the new app style feok the most recent update makes the app a pain in the ass to read. I hate it now.",
Have to uninstall the app everyday then reinstall it to get the website to properly open. Have called NYTIMES about this problem. Very nice folk but they have not been able to fix it. IT IS A REAL PAIN,
Why all the ads?? It seems that if you pay to subscribe the ads should go away! They are very distracting. Is there a way to stop seeing them every paragraph or two?,
Year-long subscriber but the app has gotten worse over the years. If you're having trouble support will also simply tell you they've forwarded your problem and that's that. Probably cancelling my subscription.,
"My go to source for everything news, culture, opinion pieces etc. Navigation is quite easy as well.",
the New York Times is one of the best information Bargains on the network. I used to walk 2 miles and pay twice as much to get a copy. some things get better,
Allows you to sign up for a free account but you can never read any stories. Constant wall of sign up for a pay version. Why are you offering a free account if you aren't allowing people to view articles?,
Since I became a new yorker'er 9 yrs ago I've been a Times subscriber. I love that I can customize my digital subscriptions from which notifications I receive and when to my interests showing up on my For You main page.,
"This app keeps failing and shutting down on my Samsung tablet. I love the reading options when it works, but it isn't working!!!",
"The app often won't download an article, instead giving me an empty page or just staying on the home page. Today, I realised it was taking close to 900 MB of space; so it's getting removed.",
"Since the most recent update, the keyboard for the Mini crossword is half hidden on Android. Impossible to play.",
"It's okay, but I need dark mode and when I click on an alert, I expect the alert news article to pop up in the app..which is doesn't.",
Used to love it. Latest update is terrible. App freezes and type on the initial screen is hard to read. Hope they fix it.,
I have my news and so many wonderful stories about culture and art each day. I feel smarter on all fronts because of my NYT subscription. Having all of this delivered so easily is a real gift.,
So buggy! Articles don't open about a third of the time. Linking into the app from a notification opens the app with some conttast issues.,
I've loved reading the New York Times for approximately 25 years though I never lived in or near NY. The International news and editorials are so beyond any other .,
I prefer unbiased news and NY Times is a key source that never wavers. I do ignore the opinion part that sometimes seems a bit off.,
"Five Star. Enjoy the headlines that stream to my inbox allowing me to stay current and dive deeper with just a click of the headline. Clear, concise, transparent, well organized writing.",
"Excellent app, very high-quality news, perfect for keeping up to date with what's going on in the US, very reasonable subscription price",
It crashes at least once day. And about once a week it stops giving me access and acts as if i don't have an account. I'm really disappointed.,
"User interface is a bit Clunky/Confusing/Cluttered. These 3 C's make one.. Contemplate, Consider and Choose.. Google News App =Better all around.",
"Love the ""Everything you need to know this morning"" compilation. And appreciate being able to keep up with the news with push notification headlines. Thanks NYT!",
What happened to the search function in the New York Times app? No ability to search within the app hobbles it. I may as well find articles in a browser. But if I have to do that why do I need the app?,
Having to deal with oversized ads that autoplay is ridiculous! We are paying customers! I understand some ads but these video ads are obnoxious and annoying!,
"I enjoy the news stories I read, they are informative, and easy to understand. I like I can share the stories in this paper with young to old. Keep up the good work.",
"App still doesn't work at all on my Oneplus 6. This is the primary way I access my subscription. Updates should mean improvements, not rendering the app unusable. Please fix it.",
"Still waiting for them to implement dark mode, a feature that they intentionally removed in early 2021. Seriously, how long does it take to implement dark mode again?",
"I don't see the point and who are geniuses who created this app that's more limited than mobile site, eg in terms of links for specific sections/subsections. Uninstall and just use browser.",
Uninstalled the app because it slows down the phone. It doesn't work the way a normal app does - not loading up quickly.,
"Big fan of the journalism and approach. The NY Times is the best newspaper on the planet. However, quitting your subscription is tedious.",
The sop shows the the version of the app had expired. Play Store shows that the app is already in the latest version. Don't know what to do,
Notifications are broken. When you click on a notification it goes to the wrong story.,
Has incredibly buggy notification system that has been buggy for years. Don't know how one of the most massive news organizations can't get their app working,
"Since the Jan. 20 update, this app no longer opens on the Samsung Tab A tablet. We have 2 Tab A's and both are experiencing this issue.",
"I'm paying customer using a OnePlus 5T, and the Top Stories section does not load from time to time. I've to kill the app and launch it again to see the Top Stories section. Please rectify this issue.",
"I generally like the app, but it's very unstable. It frequently crashes after a minute or two of use.",
"Used to be reasonably good; now dreadful. Articles don't load at all, or load partially. Uninstalling and reinstalling made no difference. Why am I paying a monthly subscription when the app doesn't let me read the material?",
im paying for this app and frequently experience issues where complete articles are not visible. whats the point in paying for this if i cant read the content? been a times reader for years..at a point where i may cancel and go elsewhere,
"Absolutely incredible digital coverage, visuals, and abundant content across all of my interests.",
App is really sluggish slow. It doesn't seem network related. After a few weeks it is just annoying,
"Please remove that pop-up that appears every time I read an article on my mobile browser that says ""the mobile app is better."" Dark patterns suck. Let me read the way I prefer without annoyance.",
"As an international subscriber, too many American news and too little international news. So different before subscribing. Very hard to unsubscribe, they put you through multiple agents which dont respon at all. Finally give up and blocked my card instead.",
"Really bad app. Freezes all the time. C'mon, Times. You're one of the top 5 papers on earth and you can't make a good app? #verysad Now down to one star. Just awful. Canceling my subscription",
"Be warned. To cancel a subscription is difficult. After two years, I had to cancel. NY Times makes it difficult to cancel a subscription.",
Great app. Easy to navigate. 4 stars. Wish there was a dark mode and a place to bookmark/organize articles.,
It gets stuck. Will not open articles (paid subscription) consistently. I had to just use the regular chrome browser on my Android.,
The app let's you use it free for a few days and then blocks all articles unless you subscribe and take membership on a monthly/yearly basis. Disappointing.,
"I'm a subscriber but as of a week or so ago, it's not showing up in the app. Works in the browser. Same issue as reported by others. Please fix!",
"This is really good app, butt I'm going to uninstall it, because it's no longer free. I have to subscribe and pay 4.99€ per month for using it, but I'm on contrary on paying apps.",
My favourite news app. Excellent content and reasonably good to navigate. Quick loading times as well.,
What was the point of telling it all my likes and dislikes with innumerable categories if the for you page is just health and wellness articles? Its a very limited app you can't even browse all the articles anywhere.,
The app is great but NO DARK MODE! How anyone with such a budget can make an app and exclude a night time reading feature is beyond me.,
"Thank you, New York Times, for continuing to be a reliable, ethical news source during these trying times. Despite the unfair attacks on the media, you continue to shine and stand firm. I appreciate your team's dedication to journalistic excellence. I am a fan. May God bless and protect you all.",
"Latest update fixed the problem below, thanks-- Nothing happens when I click on story links so I can't read anything on this app except headlines",
FT is way superior! Using NY for a day with subscription. Already annoyed by all the in-app ads. Is it really necessary to trash all the fine articles with that much advertisement ?,
"Love this app! Gets the news to me in the way I love best about the NYT - without apology or hysteria. App is fast, and I have not experienced any glitches.",
I want to support the high quality journalism NYT does but cannot condone this practice of forcing advertising on users. Thankfully the Washington Post app subscription does not have ads with its subscription.,
Reliable news on a reliable app! Plain and simple. It's an affordable subscription for the news as well.,
"I have wrote multiple mails regarding the issue of not loading the app as well as website. I am facing this issue from last couple of weeks . Kindly look into the issue ""developers"".",
Not an international standard to have with. Back to back two fake news in a month. App design and hovering also to be changed.,
This is a top notch newspaper that appears to be non bias. The photographs displayed in the articled are always amazing.,
"great app, easy to navigate. I use it every day to access the quality reporting you expect from the NY Times",
Do not opt for subscription. It is a scam. They will not let you to cancel the subscription and will keep on deducting money. Their agents will not be available when you chose to cancel the subscription.,
"Always an interesting variety of articles. My go to resource for news, articles of interest, recipes, etc",
"Great news media app, standard-setting journalism. One of the best mobile apps to stay updated about news and views while reading content that can change your worldview. 👍👍",
"The mini crossword does not appear properly on screen. One cannot see all the letters, ""keyboard.""",
This app is useless for me. I have a subscription. Bought a new tablet. This app only lets me open a new account. It will not provide a way for me to open my old account on my new tablet. Don't waste your time.,
Mediocre writing and biased reporting. The search function isn't good and there's not enough filtering for types of articles.,
"repeatedly, our choice for easy delicious bread. even when it doesn't come out beautifully, it is so flavorful.",
Some bugs in the crossword since the new version yesterday. The keyboard no longer fits on the screen.,
l really appreciate the excellent reporting from the Times. I know I can always rely on the facts I read. Cheers to the dedicated reporters at the Times!!,
It's supposed to be a newspaper. Instead it's an opinion paper. There's hardly an article that doesn't blast Trump or the republicans. I want to just read the news. I'm sick of them pushing their agenda of making sure Trump doesn't get reelected in EVERY article they write. It's not a newspaper. It's politics siding with the left.,
Good overall except for the buggy save function on some articles. Sometimes the just don't save even after I get the save confirmation.,
Real harassment. After downĺoading app went for purchase of annual subscription as per offer of Rs 600 by NYT for basic access. Play store deducted Rs 6000 in stead of Rs 600 from my bank account. Chatted with NYT their records show payment of offer amount. Play store refuses to cancel the order or refund the amount. Really obnoxious behaviour.,
America's newspaper. By far the best journalism in my opinion. Wouldn't live without it. Much of its investigative reporting is top-notch and wouldn't be reported except for the New York Times!,
The app will not recognize my all-access subscription that I purchased through Google Play. My Google account is linked but I am still denied access to portions of the app.,
"The subscription utility isn't fixed. The slam offer made doesn't reflect on the invoice! Also, the dark mode has suddenly vanished!",
"I used to love reading the NY Times in this app, but now the articles don't open. So incredibly irritating. I'll be canceling my subscription.",
"Admittedly a (slightly) left-leaning news source, but the app is easy to use and navigate. Kudos to your dev teams!",
"I Iove the NY Times, but their app is, as others have pointed out, pretty buggy on Android right now. There are a host of issues detailed in other comments and all of them are spot in.",
"May be the worst app I have used in recent days. Every other day, it will complain ""Expired version"" and after that u can't download. Only solution is to re-install the app.",
"So disappointed The New York Times has become The New York Trash... The spin and liberal slant is so obvious, there is very little I can trust in this newspaper and I'm an independent... The gold standard of news once put out by the New York Times is now lower than dirt to me... We are in the middle of a pandemic and all they care about is pandering strictly to the left and the Hate Trump agenda... It's really very sad... What happened to unbiased news?",
"Since the update on 2/23/21, the keyboard for the mobile Crossword is partially blocked by a 'subscribe' banner. I do subscribe, and would love to be able to solve the crosswords.",
Horrible app. Incredibly biased and far left. News is often incorrect and has to be revised after the fact. DO NOT RECOMMEND!,
"What a beautiful, practical and long overdue vision of creating people-centric streets in New York. Kudos to the thoughtful planning and wonderful illustrations contained in this article.",
"slick, multimedia app. Not just a scanned newspaper. And obviously the NYT has excellent content.",
I love NYT but the app should allow me to select which account I want to use instead of assuming the default - my subscription is on a different account and I see no way to link the app to my subscription so back to the web for me...,
"Looks professional. I am pleasantly surprised. As for the quality of journalism, the articles are informative and quite balanced.",
I am a native New Yorker and loveThe Times and their in-depth reporting. I also love the daily crossword and weekly news quiz. Thanks for the opportunity to make these comments. Harriet King,
Bad app but excellent news. Swiping and navigating poor. Font sizes either too big or small depending on the header.,
I love the news from the Times because it seems like it isn't slanted one way or the other. I like the impartial approach. And there are really fun games on Fridays. :),
"I really like the app and the content but since downloading it, my battery life has significantly decreased. I have to uninstall.",
"I only downloaded it to stop the pop-ups on the main site. No luck. Every article I click on every day, do you want the app? No I do not stop asking.",
The New York Times is great. But after installing this app it is difficult to view NY Times stories on my browser or save them as pdfs.,
"I was really hoping that a news app made by the most popular newspaper in the U.S would less clunky, but frankly this is the worst news app I've ever tried to use. Do better, NYT.",
"Just updated to Dec 2 2019 update because older version was not updating stories. Latest release will not load at all! White screen only! Log shows the app crashed on my Note 8. Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled - all OK now.",
"Have to log in every time for it to recognize my subscription. Annoying at best, illogical for a piece of software that is subscription based.",
"titles often missing, text inexplicably light grey at times, links to app from notifications fails 90% of the time.",
"It's always worth to know what is happening and where, and to read true and unopinionated information, which news should be. I minored in Journalism in university.",
"Bite-sized news in a format I control. It's been a good way to stay informed about the issues that matter to me, without the endless litany of doom-and-gloom stories that TV news offers.",
"Good writing, wide coverage of news and other topics, no major complaints. Links were broken, now fixed. Notifications were broken, now fixed (13-Jan-2020)",
The app does what one would expect. To get five stars its recommendations for articles to read needs to be better. About half the time I find articles I care about via Google News.,
One of the worst subscription models I've seen. You have to call and talk to someone to cancel. They place you on hold and expect you to wait an unreasonable period of time. It's easier to get out of a gym membership.,
"This is a lot of information for up to date news all on the Google Play Store, may have a few ads as well ,but the news is more up than most of the news was up dated.very good way to keep informed . YOU WOULD LIKE IT A LOT,it is so much better than the rest of your family to be here and how much you can get to know what you are doing with your life.",
"I love this newspaper, but I wish it would allow account holders to share a limited number of articles. It would be a good marketing tool for increasing subscribers. Give them a taste, and many would subscribe😊",
"App itself works fine, but the lengths you have to go to in order to cancel the subscription are a joke! Would not recommend as a result",
Tapping on a news story in the notification tray doesn't open the story. It only opens the app.,
"I am a subscriber, but currently having to uninstall and reinstall on my Androud whenever I want updated news. NYT is aware there's this problem for some users, but no fix yet.",
"This app has a puny 2.5""-wide text strip, replacing the preiously available full-screen desktop view of the NYT that featured content titles by section in a sidebar and presented each article on a wide frame.",
"This is guys are real cheaters. If you want to cancel your subscription you need too call an US number or foreign number. There is a chat option but never someone available. You cant remove your card and so baiscally they lock you in. Really guys, what is this??? i bought a subscription of a paper i didnt join NKVD....i want to cancel with a click, bloody rip off.... worst digital purchade in my life, i will never click on anything from them again and tell all my friends and family to stay away",
"Simply the best. I love the Washington Post, being from the area, but the journalism is impeccable in both. NYT is a leader!",
"This app crashes a lot. I don't have this problem with the Washington Post, Guardian or any other newspaper apps. I'm considering canceling my subscription.",
"I have also worked in Afghanistan as a journalist and trainer of journalists, many of my students are still in Afghanistan including some who most recently worked for some of the organizations in this article. I think it's too soon to pat ourselves on the backs for those we've gotten out. too many are still there.",
The section menu is not working correctly. Some sections (Technology) do not show names. Some sections (Science) do not show content. Pls fix this. I am a subscriber.,
Best most complete and thorough newspaper in the world. Open and transparent discussion on tough topics. Prompt update of breaking news around the world. Reader and subscriber since 7th grade.,
"Great news, but the app appears broken and won't recognize my login. It tells me I've just signed in and need to register on the same screen.",
Due to android malfunction I had to uninstall & reinstall the app and my subscription was lost. Major issue if a different payment method used. Bombarded with warnings of cancellation and major time consumption trying to rectify....accounts not user friendly. Cancelling and moving on 😣😣😣,
"I'm so happy that I finally decided to subscribe, the 10 free articles per month wasn't enough and these days it's very difficult to find such good journalism elsewhere.",
This used to work well but within the last few weeks the app freezes up and restarts itself after reading 2 - 3 articles.,
"I have been subscribed for some time now, allthough it will not show me the articles because it says I need to subscribe. I can only access through a browser.",
Love all the info I can read very diverse media and of course the crossword easy app to use graphics are good overall I am very satisfied with my purchase,
"app doesn't work on android, and it took me 30 minutes to cancel my subscription. quite disappointing that they put so much hurdles to prevent you from cancelling your subscription.",
"Since most recent update, the crossword only shows half the keyboard, making it impossible to fill in.",
"Just rating the app, not content. On Android one this NYT app does not work anymore. Just freezes a start up",
"I love the depth of coverage on news issues, the recipes, the games, the art and literary reviews. Everything",
The notifications have nothing to do with the news in the app. Just turn them off. Otherwise you can't get better news. It's just the app that sucks.,
How can there even be 114% of Americans with there own podcast? The accuracy and unbiased facts of news are very important to me. You lost me with the 4th article I read.,
The morning updates are concise and extremely helpful. The articles are informative and engaging.,
"Objective, well rounded, backed by facts, wide coverage across the entire spectrum of life, cultures, science, technology, politics ... . Get it if you can.",
"It should be mentioned that the process of unsubscribing nytimes has been designed to be outrageously hard. Very scummy, you should really think twice before you subscribe.",
"If you love to learn something new every time you read, this is the news source for you. Definitely not failing my need to learn about history, culture, cooking, business...on and on.",
I paid for an annual digital subscription and still get advertisements in the app. Seriously? Is this how the NYT app and digital subscription are supposed to work?,
Great unbiased journalism. It is what is missing in many other publications. The best thing you could do is grab yourself a subscription.,
NYT tech support confirmed to me this morning that that they intentionally removed the widgets as part of the latest update. Baffling. Guess I'm switching to Washington Post app 🤷,
"Puzzles still glitchy after Android update. While I can now access the bottom 2 rows of the keyboard, Vertex is virtually unusable.",
Used to be fast but getting slower. Freezes frequently to load advertisements and Covid related statistics.,
Browser has a better experience. There is a constant banner in the app. Very annoying,
"Very frustrating, the app keeps stopping and I cannot access the content, despite having a subscription.",
Nice and clean but clicking alerts doesn't always take you to the story and sharing content is too limited.,
Will never order from Google Play again. I ordered NY Times and cannot unsubscribe. I am cutting back on everything since I am semi retired. But cannot find unsubscribe anywhere!!! I like NY Times but not this app😠,
"The app is about as good as the newspaper itself. Need i say more? A completely biased app full of ""FAKE NEWS"" trying to claim they're a regular, non-biased, news organization. Stop lying to the public.",
"App used to be great but is now super slow, doesnt scroll correctly, and kills my battery. This is a news app, not a game - completely inexcusable!!",
"Beautiful, inspirational, and aspirational. Very thorough reporting. More interesting stories would be nice! Please see my Twitter account for some ideas, recommendations, or suggestions: @maryellenwayne1",
"Worth a read. Covers 2 points very well. 1) What Republicans need to do for the future of their party and our democracy. 2) How to stimulate our economy AND jump start saving the climate. And YES, both can be done. And YES, now is the time...",
"mostly good app, but notifications are useless. the headline in the notification IS NOT where the notification leads.😿👎",
So much work has been done this year to improve the app. Works great. I love it. Minus 1 star for all the apps I still have to avoid even with a paid subscription.,
"NYTIMES LISTEN TO US. We cannot stand seeing that link to USE APP 5 times a day. Subscribers, they do not care about this inconvenience. I called them. Any ideas.",
Terrible news app. You can only read 10 articles before it makes you pay. There are better and free news apps on the play store. Don't waste your time with this one,
"Terrible app, news is filled with ads, it deliberately stops scrolling to keep the ad on the screen longer, unacceptable, uninstalled.",
"Subscribed to all access, not getting all access. Keeps wanting to charge for NYT cooking app separately. Can't log in on ios. My online account doesn't show the payment that Google play took",
"Crashes constantly, I can't even read the news in the morning. Also impossible to find the NYC covid map.",
It is very informative and interesting. The fonts of the app is unique as well as the articles presented.,
Terrible. Needs dark mode and better integration with Google play. Subscription doesn't even show active.,
Went from five to three. Multiple repeat notifications that don't link to the article I selected. Breaking news alerts no longer appear,
This app is the worst. Pages don't load all the way and the comments section won't load at all. It seems to work fine on my iPad but Android version is terrible.,
"this app is not updating the latest news or articles I have to uninstall and reinstall three times a day to stay current. As a subscriber at considerable cost, this is maddening. Please address",
"NYT are FRAUDSTERS. They are charging me fees every month and i am unable open the app. It says ""please download latest update"" but it doesn't downloads latest update. FRAUDSTERS HINDUPHOBES.",
"I rate a newspaper for the quality of the public service it offers, not for the games. So it's excellent, period. Keep going this way.",
"Great paper, but horrible app. Needs to be scrapped and rebuilt. The obnoxious adds foisted upon subscribers clog the app and crash the pages. I suggest you ask Bezos if he'll let you dupe the WaPo app!",
Great sories of all kinds. Good games and recipes too. The Times newspaper app is handy and easy to use.,
The articles keep randomly refreshing and auto scrolls to the top. Really annoying while reading.,
"While I'm scrolling it's pretending I've clicked on ads. I understand they make money if I do, but they will lose money if they keep it this trigger happy. Really frustrating.",
"No longer works on Samsung tablet. Guess I'll have to cancel subscription. UPDATE: Jan 31 - Hey, it works again. Yeah!",
missing some key features. you can't swipe left/right to go to the next section or even search articles in this app.,
"The app works well and the NYT content is timely, relevant and trusted. Highly recommended, if ""you can handle the truth"".",
All new sources need to be checked for accuracy. I feel confident reading the New York Times. You just have to separate facts from opinion the best you can and I really do this.,
"Writers are biased and try to confuse the readers when they disagree with something, witholding very important data and pointing out irrelivent data to sew confusions. They are fake news and shouldnt be allowed on google play. They also take permissions to all your data to collect and sell, DO NOT INSTALL",
"I rarely come out here to write reviews, but getting night mode was a thing to celebrate. Bravo NYTimes, it was quite the time!",
Good app all around. I only wish dark-mode would work for all articles. Sometimes I'll have to read on the mobile version to force dark mode.,
"ALWAYS stellar covearage no matter the topic: detailed, informative, challenging, thought-provoking, well sourced, often inspiring, but never boring.",
Not particularly happy. Content not great for international users and can't unsubscribe without phoning a constantly busy toll number. Shame on you nyt.,
Great app and reliable news! The app often has very cool visualizations on some of the stories. Well done.,
Too many ads for subscribers. And large distracting ads at that. Just use a browser with an ad blocker. Skip the app.,
"The ""monster""might just be the best word to call this turbine, I would want plenty of environmental studies and designations of shipping lanes. A large tanker took out the bridge in Tampa Bay years ago. It would be like TWO dinosaurs getting into a rumble, and both would probably lose.",
A phenomenal news source and a great app to access that writing. Digitally optimized content is a pleasure to read.,
I really hate the fact that you removed the ability to swipe through each page of each section like an ebook. Please bring back the swipe feature.,
Notifications don't always direct to the headlines listed within article. Very frustrating.,
Reasonably good interface; primary issue is that the notifications often don't target the right stories if the app is already open,
Subscription doesn't remove ads. You need to call in to cancel subscription 😕 But at least they provide local numbers in some countries.,
I just spent money on the subscription and it doesn't work. I called New York times and they gave me a number for the Google app support which doesn't work. What a waste of money.,
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the this article in the times. Nice descriptions of different music and math.,
It say free access to all the articles but shows me subscribtion menu on trying to open the article. Same article is fully available on their website without any restrictions.,
"Please beware. NYT subscription engages in predatory behavior. Once you sign up you cannot delete your payment info, and it is almost impossible to delete you account.",
Excellent app. Award-winning journalism and breaking news coverage that are so good without the noise.,
"Wish the Plague on this unremovable app, that came pre installed with my Samsung. Useless malware app asking my money and preventing me from installing apps i actually want to install... Dont put up with unremovable bloatware.. 1 star them all",
"This app isn't letting me read the article I want without subscribing. There is no point in installing this app. Also, I can't search for an article.",
"Most biased articles against India. uninstalled the app after their job postings for India. NYT hardly understands India, is a club of fools who think they can stop India from rising. News is freely available everywhere. Why subscribe to a media which hates India?",
I wish the Today tab houses more sections than it currently does. I easily run out of articles to read in the Today tab and the For You section is full of irrelevant fluff. I'd prefer for other prominent sections like World to be in the tab menu or to be within the Today page.,
The New York Times has ceased to be a legit source of news. It is now a festering sore on the back of true journalism and more of a political tool than a newspaper. Avoid.,
Forces you to make a phone call to cancel your subscription. Should be against the law to allow sign ups on the app but force a phone call for cancelation. Shame on you NYT!,
I love the content but the navigation design choices are strange and sometimes frustrating.,
It still shows me ads even after subscription and there's no “rotate screen” option. There is NO print edition available. I've unsubscribed.,
Latest version of the app has removed text size options and font size has reset/default to a small font. Bring back this option please!,
Too many glitches. Stories repeatedly fail to load on both wifi and mobile. I won't pay for an app that doesn't do what it's supposed to do.,
"The app experience is quite amazing. Reading made interactive, hope other news publisher bring data, tech and news together in this way",
"I loved this app, but The Times announced in autumn 2019 that they were discontinuing it. They're sending is to the web browser instead. 🙁",
"Top quality journalism. Even though it's usually classed as a Conservative paper, it remains balanced in its reporting.",
"This app sucks. It says to download the latest version, but when I click on the download, again it will show up to download the new version. Please fix it",
"I love this newspaper, despite its flaws. All journalism enterprises make errors but the NYT still has among the highest standards for writing and investigations.",
The app is fine...the content is tired and frequently stale. I am not here for opinion pieces I am here for news. Updated news more than once a day.,
"I found the constant barage of my phone pinging from this app annoying. Like most people, I want to get the news on my terms, not the other way around",
"After about a 4 year absence, dark mode has returned! And with that I'm back, thank you for not clubbing my eyeballs. BUT did you have to remove text resizing to do it?",
The app is good but the search is terrible. Often results in searching for articles on Google to find what I'm looking for.,
"as much as I love this app, as a paying customer it is extremely infuriating that the website constantly prompts me to open articles in the app. to reiterate, I am a paying customer. should I not be able to view NYT articles however I like?",
Cancel New York Times subscription. Going to have to cancel my credit card. Not happy there is no way to cancel this subscription that has doubled to 18.,
Bring back dark mode! Every other app has this option. It's easier on the eyes. I don't get why the latest update removed this feature,
So much better than the usual sensationalist online news outlets. I'd forgotten what it was like to read real news coverage - so nice to be back,
"ads intrusive, especially ones with moving content. comments section on individual articles often hangs. why bother. use privacy browser instead.",
Paid over $200 via Google Play and can't access. NYT has no record of account (over an hour on the phone w/customer service); Google refuses refund. BUYER BEWARE.,
i like the broad spectrum of topics addressed in the nyt. nyt has a neutral view but sometimes it seems to lean towards the right a bit.,
Keeps asking to subscribe. I have a subscription and am already logged in. Edit. Downgraded to one star since it still does this a year later. Fix your app NYT.,
Love the N.Y. TIMES. APP is reliable. Never any problems and the customers may cancel a subscription at any time.,
NO SPOILERS! the app really needs a way to disable sports score spoilers. otherwise you have to disable all notifications which I wouldn't normally do.,
"Antiquated with limited features. While a great news organisation, they really don't give enough resources to make their app good.",
"No one in the chain, from writer to editors at the New York Times, knew the definition of ""iniquity,"" and that what they should have said was ""inequities."" Get your act(s) together.",
"The dark mode was just removed because it's being ""reworked"". Very weird - why don't you keep the old one until the new version is done?",
The button to leave a comment on an article does not work on either of my Android devices. Frustrating that they can't make something as simple as that work.,
"All I want in life is to get on the metro in the morning, where there is no 4g, and have my news waiting for me already downloaded. Why can you do this NYT? Settings suggest this should work. Easy 5 once that's in.",
"OK. But does not allow to see all the sections, even as a subscriber. Including Today' paper. Not very well thought out. 😕",
A Times reporter had to leave the paper because he used the N word when asking a question about someone else's use of the word. An article by a conservative Times columnist questioning the move was not published. An editor had to leave because he published an opinion by a US senator that some staff and readers didn't like.,
Excellent reporting especially their investigative reporting. First with a lot of breaking news so the New York Times is worth your time.,
"Very nice. I wish there was less, rather than more: more curated, summarized info for the time starved. But very nice source of info!",
Far more complete than any other news article I have seen. most illuminating to see it may have years or decades of protection.,
"As a 5 time Hawaii Ironman Triathlon finisher, I find this very very interesting, and comforting. The author is an ultramarathoner, so he's got credentials to say what he has said.",
[p.s. the free days are browser only not for ap????] ...mods to address. if anyone has offline reading now DO NOT UPDATE! anonymous etc. use of feature will be lost. if this notice is too late try finding article in Washington Post! most stories get syndicated and many apps offer offline reading. Use browser lol!??,
"Amazing app, trusted journalism, appropriate amount of notifications, all of which are worth reading (unlike some other news apps) What else do you expect from the NYT?",
Updating my review: Night Mode is back for Android! And it works great. Please do not take it away EVER AGAIN. Thank you thank you thank you!,
Relevant reporting for a wild world. More important than ever to have solid journalism for information and as a check on our government and industries.,
"I love this news at my fingertips everyday!! Keeps me up to date and gives me all kinds of user friendly tools like recipes, links, etc. Thanks NYT!!",
I dont get any recent articles that are being sent to my phone...when i click on the notice it tells me the article has failed to load!!!!,
"Dark Mode nyt available for S21 fe. Don't know why, Don't really understand why. Also app alerts do not navigate to the actual news item it alerted about.",
"Used to be a good rating. Now they're just tailoring the news for me instead of giving me all of it. Highly suggest just staying with the Web Browser version, as app is just a coercive way to make an echo chamber for a singular user.",
"One of the last great news outlets in America. You may like or agree with the truth but that's what you are getting from NY times, deal with it.",
"The app can't be opened, I have uninstalled and installed it again and again and keeps failing. It closes just as I click it to open. What can I do????",
This is a brilliant piece of writing. I am from England and the same age as the 7up participants so I have some understanding of the time(s) and places the writer describes. A humane vision of Apted. Superb journalism.,
it keeps telling me i am using an old version every two days. and there's no update option in google play so i have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it literally every other day,
"Sometimes they have relevant news. Mostly biased nonsense. I keep it around, because it would be foolish not to know what bs people are being fed by the media. But not one story Is written without thick layers of bias and irrelevant opinions. Take this media with a grain of salt and you can find useful news. One star because your opinion is not wanted, give me the news and nothing more.",
No dark mode is a deal breaker for me since I like to read in bed before I doze off. So many other news apps have implemented it already.,
"The Times works nicely in Chrome but is somewhat confusing as an app. It is missing current market information. Also, how many apps do I need?",
What is up with all these ads on a paid subscription? I don't pay to have ads shoved in my face every paragraph scroll. Fix this or I will cancel my subscription.,
There should be ways to follow favorite journalist in the app to not miss their reports as well as dark mode immediately. More reports need to have audio version as well.,
Edit. Dropped from 2 to 1 star. Pathetic coding. Hire a 15yo to revamp this pathetic excuse for an app. Less than a week on and I'll be canceling my paid subscription. Don't waste your time. Plenty of better & free ways to get around their paywall.,
"If you value America's free press, subscribe to the NYT. It's the gold standard for accurate news and investigative reporting; a genuine national treasure.",
"Android app bug - scroll bar is the same color as the white background so while reading an article, I'm unable to tell how far along I am (and also how long the article is)",
"This took me about 10 seconds to kick to the curb. You can't enlarge photos or text. More ads? IDK, I couldn't wait to dump this junk.",
Stinks. Does not allow reader to enlarge print. Stories have worse and more confusing layout.,
"When will developers add something like Reuters ""The Wire"", showing headlines only, so one can quickly see the stories that interests them without scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.",
"Excellent, balanced news coverage and great features. Sorry but I can't afford it... Too expensive",
Constant birage of subscribe offers on the free app. Cannot get the good recipes unless you subscribe. Dont bother with this app unless you want to subscribe.,
"i appreciate the depth and detail of the NYT reporters. While certainly liberal, the paper brings knowlege and understanding of the issues we face.",
I wish all you guys who run the newspapers would give us a break let us subscribe to all the papers at once!! you can't subscribe to everything and nickel and dime us no one can subscribe to New York times LA times Washington Post when you only maybe look at it five times a month give us some balk rates will you!,
"I don't want 3rd party running in the background. Starts automatically .hard to defeat. I want the news,but I don't want the bastards running my phone.",
Have been trying to stop subscription for a year and every month they continue to charge me and the price is INCREASING for soemthing I don't even want. >=/,
The specialist reporting is second to none. I love that you can expect a high level investigation from these authors. The crossword and Spelling Bee are awesome. Thank you.,
"Says my device is offline even though i am connected to Wi-Fi. COVID and ""FOR YOU"" pages load but the front page and all news will not.",
"I love this newspaper. It's one of the best researched, with well written, easily understandable articles and opinion pieces. It's definitely one of my best investments.",
Crashes more than the elderly into a farmers market. Complete garbage. You are better off using a browser and going to their mobile website. Zero stars if I could.,
NYT covers it all. my first choice (and WAPO) for breaking news. their readers' comments are the most intelligent of any site I've encountered.,
PITA. I subscribed but it kept kicking me out when I wanted to read an article from Facebook. I will be requesting my money back and cancelling my subscription.,
"As an International subscriber finds NYTimes one of the better in the World of ""Peni-mation"". Archives from 19th & 20th Century is, an experience worth living. 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠💖 for the archives",
Beware. You cannot cancel without speaking to one of their representatives. The app is also riddled with ads and the articles are average.,
"The New York Times app is fantastic and of course, the journalism is world class. Highly recommend purchasing the very affordable subscription.",
"Can no longer link to articles om my tablet.. NYT said to update to 9.1.1, but I don't see it in the google store. App works fine on my phone.",
"This is a subscription based app, and they can't manage to stop trying to sell other content as another sub. Pretty ridicky",
"I feel like you can trust the NYTimes to give you non biased, informative and up to to date news about what's going on in the world.",
"it starts my day... from relevant news to thought provoking (and not always liberal) opinions, to challenging games. can't live without it.",
just realized that I can access all sections of the paper by swiping right... this is fantastic! I love this app!!!🙂,
The quality of journalism is degenerating. Tried to unsubscribe and the process is excessive. Unsubscribing shouldn't be an act of Congress and shows poor integrity on the part of NYT. Would not recommend.,
"Thank you for the fine, trustable reporting.",
Real reporting means answering all of the unanswered critical questions you still have after being constantly showered by miriads of tidbit-news. Truly worth your reading pleasure. Thank you NYTimes!,
"A powerful phone (OnePlus 6T) overheats on running this app!!! While the content is par excellence, this piece of software needs to be revamped.",
"I used to love this app, but recently it started scrolling to the top every time you return from an article. Please make that stop!",
fantastic newspaper with the best news in the world but even after paying a lot of money for subscription that are certain formats you cannot access you have to be have Superior Stature to get to those formats Like e-paper,
I love reading the articles and supporting independent journalism. I wish subscribers could get NYT Cooking at a discount though as that one is a pricey add on.,
"Still no dark mode. Please get with the times and address this, I can not have a bright white screen much of the time.",
Got it as part of my husband's subscription but it would never let me open any article in spite of 3 attempts by him and 1 by them. Guess it's time to cancel,
Why isn't there a search function (for a string within an article)? The app needs to be at least as good as reading in a web browser if I'm going to use it,
NYT does a great job covering the topics and issues of the day that I am interested in. a lot of other media outlets usually report on a NYT story so why not get the story/news directly from the source.,
"It's a decent app, but I can get dark mode in my browser. App used to have dark mode, and when it comes back I'll up it to 5 stars.",
"App doesn't connect my NYT subscription, so always asking for login. Try to login (i.e. NYT Cooking) and it won't let me past the ""Subscribe Now"" page.",
It would be good if dark mode could be enabled in the Android app. Much too bright at night!,
Articles that help me sleep better. a MUST for me!!!,
"Works fine, but 2 big issues: 1) no night/ dark mode 2) search bar needs an upgrade, i struggle to find articles unlessbi know the full name",
"The app is really convenient! There is really so much to do, read , learn. You feel better and do better with the pages of the times. Thank you!",
Can install. I push the install button but nothing happens. I just paid for a subscription and cant use the app. I can download any other app just fine.,
This isn't an app... It can only be opened by opening chrome and searching nyt. It's very strange.,
"Provides in-depth reports on news about top stories, both in the headlines as well as lesser-known topics. Love it as a top news source 24/7.",
"I support journalists, and subscribe to the New York Times from abroad. Thanks for all you do, and the user friendly app.",
"It wont let me sign in with my google paid account on the app, only via the browser. When i click the Google sign in while in the app I get a 403 error: dissallowed useragent. ""Google can't sign you in safely within this app"".",
App works fine. Content however is not news. NY Times is a part of the leftist ministry is propaganda. Completely biased. The Epoch times presents unbiased news. Use them.,
A great app which is a joy to use. If give it 5 stars but night mode has been gone for years and I miss it!,
"Every other major news app (CNN, BBC, FOX, etc) provides content for free. Period. I value good journalism and believe in living wages, however forcing readers to pay flies in the face of a free press and democracy itself. How elitist of you NYT, to only allow access to information for those who can afford to pay.",
Swiping pictures is too sensitive on my Nexus. Reading articles when offline would be great (check the Guardian app). Why there are ad's even though I have a subscription?,
"NYT site sells for $52 instead of $99, and it can be cancelled anytime. Also NYT site app works on Windows and Android, not just Android as this app is crippled to just Android.",
Great content but the amount of ads is overwhelming. The ads are still served even for paid subscribers. Worse reading experience comparing to read directly on the mobile website.,
"In addition to beautifully written, reliable new reporting, it also contains Travel, Arts, Cooking, amd other content. Well worth the cost.",
"Upgrading tablets but when I log into new tablets saved articles is empty. On website, phone, and old tablet it all shows my saved articles. Why don't they show on new tablet nytimes app?",
I paid for the subscription. Why am I still seeing ads? What more do you want from me?? I can't even read an article without 3-4 sponsored ads. This is absurd.,
"The app is almost unusable. Articles will not load, occasionally restarting the app will work but not always. Given how expensive access this app is this is unacceptable.",
"Annoying. Really, really irritating. Reading reviews here clued me into using a browser instead of this horrible cludge. Sorry NYT, your app is a fail.",
I love the Times. Where is the widget now? This was an important part of the user experience for me.... much like the equivalent news widgets for BBC. Please bring that back.,
"Why on earth would anybody pay to read news, while they are available online for free? I like NYTimes and the app is good but I cant pay to read news. There are millions of free alternatives out there for instant news.",
This article nailed a very difficult subject. The amount of research should be commended.,
Mini crossword puzzle does not show the bottom row of keys on the keyboard in this update. Can I revert back to the last release?,
The best way to stay in touch with what is of importance to me. From Politics to food to foreign affairs. I appreciate the investigative journalism most of all.,
This is the only trusted news source out there these days. You get to set up interests that are tailord to yourself and view what you really want.,
Simple app that works great for all news related content. Push notifications are very helpful to stay informed.,
"When I try to open articles they don't open, so I can only read headlines. Not sure why this is. I'm on a Galaxy 10e",
"Night Mode no longer works on the top of the ""Today"" tab and ""2020"" election story sections. This breaks accessibility and people with vision impairments can't read the content.",
Battery Draining. The last few days app has been killing my battery. Draining 23% of my battery in the last 6 hours on my Galaxy S10+. Looked at a story 6 hours ago and it's been hogging my battery and making my phone hot. Uninstalled,
"Great source for current news, in depth articles, culture, cooking and community. I must have it every day!",
"Ms. Dowd always tells it as it is. She has the courage to stand up to the big libs, who have a lot of power behind them, but she doesn't back down She pokes fun while always telling the truth... She is a rare commodity in this day and age",
"no one puts correspondents in the places the Times does. If you care about news that's outside of the United States, it's NYT",
Good balance of information.,
"I used to love this app. I rated it 5 stars. Now that I am able to afford the subscription, I got the app back on my Android 5.1.1 and the app will not load even though it's supposed to and I have great internet. What happened NYT?",
Top Stories is still broken. What gives?? I've updated the app three times now and Top Stories still will not load any article I tap.,
"It is a great app and importantly with terrific content. I ❤️👏 as I am informed, entertained, and sometimes profoundly moved by its stories",
"Used this app for years on Android with no problem. Now articles don't load, ads have weird flashing effect.",
"This piece explains so much about the disturbing trends in our culture. Clearly written, concise, helpful!",
"Hangs, often slow, changing orientation of device causes app to hang. Overall a poor implementation",
I enjoy what I believe to be great and factual journalism. If a mistake happens they are accountable and make the proper changes.,
"Wouldn't load the page ""Coronavirus in the US, Latest Map and Case Count"" but they fixed that. Loads everything faster now, good going, people!",
The app worked well for a while and constantly crashes now. I can no longer open it.,
App crashes all the time on Android. Sometimes fails to refresh news feed and I can only see days-old articles,
"The app is incredibly clean, easy to use, and offers not too many adds when using the free version.",
"they cover more detailed news, relevant news, and I feel that I learn at least one thing new in each article I read.",
It keep crashing while I am reading the news. Please fix it as I am a regular reader and a subscriber.,
Doesn't overload you with push notifications and gives you high-quality news from every facet of life.,
"Sharing options are totally inadequate. High quality, reliable reader app otherwise.",
"Most recent update is very unstable. It crashes constantly. I love the NYT, butvthis version is awful.",
One of the best sources for an enhanced experience of journalism par excellence. A must have app for your smart phone,
"Works well for me. Smooth usage, classy design, and in my opinion the best newspaper of them all.",
"Love the Times, this Android app sucks. Have to uninstall and reinstall it at least once a week to get it to load articles.",
An absurdly difficult to use update for me.. an app that worked. Makes it difficult to read the nyt. May drop my subscription.,
Still no return of the widget. Reading the NY Times much less often than before.,
It's really frustrating to tap a notification about an article and get something different.,
Fix the puzzles! They do not load completely - I can't see the last row of the keyboard. 😥,
"Search is hidden and when you find it, it can't successfully search NYT's own websites urls. Lame sauce, GUI is designed by toddlers.",
"After you get the app, they regularly give you update notifications about news events, but when you click on them, you're informed that you have to pay for a subscription.",
"The articles in the this newspaper is extremely informative and l love the variety of topics and subjects that are covered, especially in this time of Covid19 pandemic.",
The app works recreates most of the website features but no longer includes a way to share stories. Save yourself some space and use your browser,
Limited functions and constant crashes. Proliferation of ads popping in article scrolling makes reading enjoyment impossible.,
One of the few news sources that I trust. Always an interesting range of topics of topics and the writers are world class.,
"Extremely buggy since the last update, links from outside the app just freeze and refuse to load.",
"Great article, but why can't I search for articles, maybe even paste a URL into the site to jump to an article. Just wondering.",
The Times is the most important newspaper in the world. You know their app is good. Sometimes they have strange political views.,
"NYT is the benchmark in news reporting and features. Also, this is proof what well funded, strong, independent media company can achieve!!",
"Can you please make a Dark Theme for the app? I love reading all the news and stories, but the eye strain, especially at night is unbearable",
I purchased a games subscription but the app still prompts me to subscribe whenever I try to do a crossword. Have tried restarting to no avail.,
love the breaking news and human interest stories.,
"if the change describing this article is real, it's a good sign of Hope",
"I read NYtimes every single day. it has become an overdose for me.... However, I do think they have to open up to more news around the world...",
Timely updates on matters that matter. I have had no issues with the app and it has alerted me on important news as they happen.,
Paying for a subscription I can't access through app. Won't update with current articles. And articles that are available won't load.,
"I'm a subscriber but the latest update keeps nagging me to subscribe, and throwing up paywalls in front of articles. I pay for this service. I expect better from the NYTimes",
"App is decent but desperately needs dark mode. The journalism is garbage, devoid of ethics or standards that journalists used to hold as sacred. I hear they're going to be deposed soon... uh-oh.",
The mini crossword is still not working after emailing me to say they were issuing a fix. I really enjoyed that couple of minutes every day! Cmon!!,
I love my Morning Briefing and alerts. The Times app keeps me informed about the news that matters from a reliable source.,
"I believe that we must pay $$$ something for printed news. As a modern citizen, it's a necessity. As a civilization, the printed record is what defines it.",
"Still like the app, but there no longer seems to be a headlines widget. That is very disappointing.",
I like how the Times doesn't let people comment on every article 😂 It's a lot less blood pressure raising to not have to read what everyone else thinks about the article you just read.,
"Always trying to sell you a subscription. Really a rip off. Or, give you a part of an article and then want you to pay.",
Absolutely impossible to cancel subscription. I've tried several different ways yet they still take money from my Paypal account.,
Breaking News: I read pretty fast. Your app does not need to refresh EVERY SINGLE TIME I finish an article.,
"App is regularly freezing, and in need of closing. It's been going on for weeks now. FIX THIS ALREADY.",
"Please update the Android app. Even while signed in, the app constantly asks me to subscribe and will not allow me to view any stories.",
"Misleading pseudo journalism, people usually think fake news is something new, but the times have been making fake news for decades, for a simple test check out how many times they have had to retract or correct their fake news about Israel but the times' pseudo journos know no shame and they just won't stop, the times is a cheap rag.",
More coverage of this backlash is necessary.,
"Too many notifications for ""breaking news"" that aren't really that important. I'd rather use Twitter to find breaking news",
"Super user-unfriendly app to use, especially the for you section, I deselected sports as my interested topic but still gives me tons of irrelevant sports, namely baseball news",
"As I am referring to many sources of news, I find that this application doesn't portray the real facts of the news. A lot of incorrect or bias facts have been used to deceive readers. And they want to charge readers for that? What a joke!",
"Horrible experience, i cannot believe that NYTimes develoeri can't provide dark mode in this app!!! Unacceptable!!!",
I just don't understand why I am still paying for such a terrible service. The articles don't show up in the front page of the app. Terrible. It looks like they don't develop the app anymore.,
"Kudos to the NYT for continuing to enhance their storytelling through amazing UX. Clean app, thoughtful content and a leader in keeping journalism alive.",
I installed it. When I try to open it a message keeps popping up that ur device is offline. So i can't use it,
"NYT is frequently an eye-opener for me...It shows me how rich CEOs are acting callous and rewarding themselves with bigger paychecks, even as their companies foundered and lost most of their capital in 2020...It is a great newspaper and helps you understand how the rich have reconstructed the world to suit their purposes... But it always contains plenty of other hard-core factually correct, interesting stories as well...",
Very nice articles as we all know. However the integration of the app with fb and other sources is not ideal.,
When is the Times going to add text-to-speech to their app and web site. It's so great to be able to listen to WaPo stories.,
"Gimme night mode, what the hell... Dedicated reader but I miss it lots, I have no idea why you'd just take away the feature before updating it",
"Anybody can say anything on the Internet, unless they work for the New York Times. Incredibly rigorous research and if they do make a mistake, they simply say so and apologize, including for racist coverage during much of their 169-year-old history.",
"Latest update seems to have made going back to the home page shoot back to the top of the page, rather than the link to the article you've been reading...",
"Great article on an important subject. The Up series is probably the most profound, moving project on film.",
a good and fair analysis of the current and popular push in culture,
"NYT not having dark mode, only a very bright white mode, makes this app hard to use in many situations.",
"Great news app, the thing is that for me as an Egyptian it lacks enough news about middle east, however it keeps me updated about what happens in America! Wish it has a dedicated section for middle east as in BBC",
The BEST newspaper in the world The New York Times currently offers subscriptions for the incredible amount of £2 per month this app is very user friendly and allows access to the GREATEST newspaper in the world great foreign coverage domestic coverage great opinion pieces.,
Comments on articles were displayed (mostly) when the app was initially installed. They are no longer displayed.,
News Every Minute The NYT mobile app keeps me informed of all the news I need to know as my day progresses. I check in throughout the day for the latest updates. I feel secure with this news app.,
"Broken after most recent update Articles will not load, front page will not reload. Cleared all data, etc. Stock Android 10 with no ad blocking",
Good app. On quibble: there's no direct way to get back to the NYTimes home page.,
excellent article about a real problem/ threat to our Democracy,
I would rate it a five if tapping on article notifications actually brought you to the article you tapped on instead of just opening the app.,
"Terrible app. Continuously reports I""m not connected toi the internet, won't refresh. I'm always connected.",
"With 7/29 update, can't see or use the entire keyboard on crosswords. Not good.",
Simply amazing app and amazing journalism!!! I love it and thank the journalist at the New York Times for their great work!!!,
Content is top rate. But the app is horrible. It crashes constantly. And why are there so many ads for subscribers?,
pretty good app n some articles by NY Times are really good. app can be buggy and have problems loading articles at times,
"great paper, good reporting, and they publicly state their mistakes (a breath of fresh air). The app works well especially with alerts",
"Great news and good design, but regularly hangs and prompts crash reports. Pixel 1.",
Love the app! Please add the ability to sort sections or at least mark your 10 favorite (as was available in old editions of app),
Nice. I have WSJ also. Good to have both subscriptions tons to read and sometimes more diverse/depth of coverage at NYT.,
"Its great app, and time saver as well.undoutedly we can read newspaper anytime anywhere without delay thanks organizer.",
"Very buggy app on my Samsung Tab A tablet, Problem seems related to ads. Makes screen flash and then crash.",
This app has started playing video ads with sound without permission or warning. Completely unacceptable. Cancelling subscription.,
"Since update unable to see the news, app keeps going to the Opinions page. Easier to read the news from the website than the app.",
Frequently goes into infinite loading loop. Requires restart of Samsung note 10. Developer non-responsive.,
No dark mode. Even Kindle keys you swap white and black to make it easier to read.,
"NYT Times ap works! I like the features,especially the headlines that turn grey after reading.",
"Ditching app, too glitchtly. Plenty of other better working news apps. Plus app won't update to when a subscription is purchased.",
Several features like the ability to share an article are missing. Will change rating if it's fixed.,
I've always found the NYtimes to be balanced and informative. Journalism at its best.,
The performance of this app is miserable. It's much faster just to pull up the times in my browser.,
"Very uptodate , beautiful coverage of the latest news and very interesting articles. In one word: excellent.",
"It's fine, but the beta ""night mode"" does almost nothing. Dark mode sorely neeed. I use a browser instead, so I can force the site to dark mode.",
"My most used app. Even before the recent covid19 pandemic I have loved using this app. Not glitchy, great stories, and a wide variety of stories. Thank you New York Times for a great news app!",
Great news source. A bit spammy with push notifications. I have it set to only show breaking and I get 3 or 4 per day.,
"Save feature doesn't work. I can mark an article as saved, but there's no menu for retrieving it. Moto X4/android",
"I can stay informed for a minimal charge. Our daily rag is just that, so the Times gives me the current national and international news I want.",
Bad app. Doesn't change. Cancelling my subscription after 7 years. Faults on me for foolishly thinking they would improve the app.,
"Not only the NYT, but the NYT in a very readable format. Drop a few Ameros on the crossword package, too.",
The content is good but there is an issue with the app where it is not connecting to the internet. All other apps work fine.,
"Stop insisting that I install your app whenever I read articles in Chrome. Not everything needs to be an app. Unfortunately, no way to complain aside from posting a bad review.",
"The ""history"" of masks wearing, for public health purposes, is especially timely. One more gift from past crises that we can acknowledge and laud.",
"Good up, but even as a paid subscriber they show ads left and right. I'm uninstalling and will use the web page with an ad blocker.",
"On a note 9, I can no longer open any live updates articles in the app. Fix! Thank you.",
"Ads, ads, ads! Every 1:00!!! Can't minimize to listen to while working. But you probably don't want to know about it.",
"A good article about a very important but often overlooked set of needs in every couple, that can lead to loneliness and resentment if not addressed.",
Responsible journalism - albeit a tad liberal.,
Trash app. Tried to open 5 different articles. Everytime I was brought to the same artictle which wasn't one of the five.,
"For the love of gawd, if you send me an email with a news flash, LINK TO THAT STORY & STOP MAKING ME SCROLL FOR MILES LOOKING FOR ARTICLES, some of which I NEVER find! Stop wasting my time!",
Great content. Although most of its politics content is leftist focussed. Would be better to get the other side.,
This article is informative and sharing it opens a conversation on this topic.,
"Very inspiring. This message acrosses Generations. it reminds us to continue to dream, live your the dream, and rejuvenate our dream. Wonderful! ❤🖤💚🎶🌼🌞",
"Some of the most non-objective based news. Maybe 1/100 articles contained actual information. This is where you go to have your feelings catered to, which do not matter when it comes to news.",
Its good but i just find i get the same articles everyday and not sure how to change it. You also cant ctrl-f for words in a long article,
I'm from Argentina and I want to improve my english language. Not only the app is awesome but also the newspaper!,
Too many in-app ads even after paying to subscribe :( I'm going to stick with a web browser with ad blockers as a paid subscriber of the NY Times,
"Terrible UI. Takes minutes to load content. App now says my phone is offline, can't load content. Gonna go read the Post now.",
"Reliable reporting as you'll get these days. TOTALLY wrong intelligence in some recent medical reporting shows lack of knowledge and sources, however. That is misinformation unintentionally. That devalues anything the NYT publishes on COVID-19 that isn't data-driven.",
"Please stop with the constant pushing of live articles. I appreciate when the ideas and topics are fleshed out. I will go to Twitter for 24/7, one sentence updates.",
It's the NY times seriously you want me to rate a paper I had been reading for well over 25 years... Best damn source of news.,
"For whatever reason, the last 2 months i haven't been able to install the Android widget. Very annoyed!",
nice selection of California books.,
Top coverage with balanced analysis. At par with what one would expect from a tier one news organization.,
Excellent description of current pandemic mood of many. Glad to have a name for it. Advice is helpful as well.,
"I've long respected the Gray Lady, however not always agreed. I find that receiving the Sunday paper in hand, and having online access during the week, is perfect. Please note, written by a resident of Vancouver Canada.",
"How do you not have a landscape mode for video? That's ridiculous is this day and age. Throw my subscription dollars at adding the function, please.",
"One of the few reputable English language news sources left. Excellent news coverage, huge amount of material on culture, travel etc",
"provides objective facts, science, statistics. advanced reading level. writes at a subjective angle.",
"In my travels of the southwest, I questioned the accepted idea of the Mongolian migration. why only from the north? Living conditions were accommodating in the southern America's. Proof is difficult to find due to climatic challenges (humidity, loamy spongy soil) but not impossible",
I enjoy this newspaper although I don't agree with it all the time. I sometimes think there is bias even though the articles are well written.,
"i love and rely on the ""failed New York Times""!!! (😉☺) Thank you for all the work you do and for your service to our country as our Fourth Estate!",
love the journalism. I live in the UK and prefer New York Times coverage of local events over the coverage of the UK major newspapers.,
Many times I tap a notification and it takes me to the story I read previously and I have to hunt down the article I want. Fix this,
Great! (just plain Great!),
"Since last update the spelling bee game is broken, it keeps repeating a letter, have to close the app, but after restart same thing will happen",
"Great writing. Some noticable ""bias"" in the Trump-era but mostly a bias towards facts, rational thinking, and confronting the rearing head of nationalism in the world. Trying to do better with their market clout to correct their past mistakes.",
"No GooglePlay option for Times audio, for real? For Christ's sake it's 2023 what major company puts out Apple only options three days?",
Great articles. Good design. Subscribe to the Breaking News newsletter if you haven't!,
"A fascinating article that covers the gamit of urban, engineering and economic history but clearly centered on climate change. Worth the read.",
"if one wants in-depth, succinct, constructive reporting, read the New York Times. It couldn't be simpler",
needed. appreciate the reporting!,
"As a Canadian I enjoy the on line NYTimes immensely. The articles are alway informative, well researched and the writing of high quality.",
"Great writing great articles if you like to read, stay up on current events, sports, politics This is were you need to be...Cheers",
I sit in amazement that as a society we still have the access and right to a free press. Thank you New York Times....may we never take you for granted.,
Sometimes its political leanings affect its reporting (as happens with all publications) but overall the NYT is one of the very best newspapers in the world.,
The app won't let me comment on anything. I hit the pen icon and a window pops open and immediately closes.,
i have read everything news wòrthy for a long time in my reading chairs. The New York Times news is always a quality experience to read.,
Subscribed this morning and was half logged in. Not able to share as described in the offer. Tried cancelling and things went south from there.,
"price special, updates of shots, world info, statistics, human interest good, on whom died of covid-19, (that was nice) ,need more republican info, since this basically a democratic newspaper.",
"It works, but badly needs the night mode back. Unfortunately, it was removed many versions ago.",
Stories no longer load from the app. 9/6(19 update hasn't fixed the problem. This app is terrible as is the customer support.,
Long-Time Subscriber to the NY Times. Tons of interesting stories from various places and societies around the world. FACTS ABOUND.,
Paid App Only. That is if one cates to continue reading any single Article. once they grab hold of your email they hound you daily to establish a paid subscription.,
Please do something about the issues with loading articles - I can barely use it as is. Have reverted to using the website.,
"Decent stories occasionally but very biased and wants your money right away, almost and it Intrudes your email and solicits. I removed the app.",
No search option or way to get back to what you were listening to. Very cumbersome to navigate!,
Zero problems with the app over months-however the dark mode has gone unusable to use as of late. For some reason the text is borderline unreadable when I use dark mode va light mode...any way to submit proof/some kind of bug report?,
awesome news paper I love it thanks new York times,
"App is fast and responsive for reading, however I just recently lost widget support on my tablet.",
Great source of breaking news and editorials. Very readable fonts and font sizes. Appealing!,
"Excellent, quick access to the NEW YORK TIMES",
"App will not display stories once selected, only a perpetually spinning circle. Expect a lot more from a paid app.",
Does a good job sending notifications and not opening any of the actual articles when you tap on them.,
"Good News. Well, ""the news"" is often bad news, but the journalism is good journalism.",
I enjoy reading the Times. although I live on the West Coast I find their news stories relevant and timely.,
"Really good app but there are a lot of notifications, most ""breaking news"". It's a little much",
"Best daily on the planet. Always was, always will be. NYC '65",
most important commentary I have read in a long time,
"News is good. However, it constantly crashes. Three times today in less than an hour",
great source of news,
"I also came to the United States from a communist county, in my case from Poland in 1982. And I see the developments in America exactly as Ms. Park. Except that in many instances it is worse than it was in Poland in 1970's and 80's. There you often had to say things but you knew that they were false, here many believe it, completely brainwashed. Just like it was in the early days of communism; many like zombies trust they're building a new paradise, others too scared to protest.",
"Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan are crying in their graves for America and Democracy. So sad. And frightening. With thanks to the writer for this cogent appeal and public service.",
I have just spent 45 minutes trying to cancel the New York Times and I still can't do it! It's reprehensible to trap subscribers into paying for something that they don't want.,
The user experience is mediocre at best. Each update over the last few years has made it harder to use and more annoying.,
"Unstable, freezes contently. Poorly built app. Save your time and just visit the web site, this app sucks.",
"NYT the window to the world....the one news paper I trust! deep analysis, excellent coverage, enjoy the stories- simply the best 👌",
I need an easier way to access Saved for Later articles. Home screen widget shortcuts for categories would be great.,
"love it! easy to read and navigate mobile format, and I love having the news literally in the palm of my hand.",
Very difficult to move the content that slides horizontally. Apt to dismiss the app instead.,
"The new version of the app is painfully slow. I am giving it one more week, then deleting it if it doesn't improve. Will read via the website.",
"This story is very poignant. It definitely highlights what small businesspeople are going through. I have much sympathy for Henry; this story has made me wish I could patronize his store because I like wearing the clothes his store has to offer, but, alas, I live on the other side of the country. It was very well-written in that it opened up Henry's life to us and how he is surviving during these times.",
It is absolute heaven to subscribe to intelligent and responsible reporting AND to get a physical newspaper delivered! I can enjoy the Sunday paper in bed again!,
"A really good publication that covers local, national, and international news in depth. I look forward to getting my paper every day.",
constant problems with not being able to open stories. just uninstalled to reinstall. see if that helps,
"Too many ads clutter the articles, same ones over & over again. Deleted the app today; instead will read NYT on AdBlocker.",
"For top-notch journalism, news, opinion articles etc., subscribe to New York Times. You will be glad you did.",
Why no search feature? If I don't click directly on an article notification I have no hope of finding it through the app.,
Spamming people from their different NY times accounts. Deducting subscription and not answering mail when doing so. BEWARE!! NY people please unsubscribe me or else I will have to block my card because of you,
"Great journalism with a world scope.Authoritative and can be relied on as good source of information- reservoir of knowledge that will continue to inspire and, satisfy the conservative and intellectuals curiosity.",
"Great overall app, but please have the Saved For Later articles easier to access. Like on the front page.",
Quality journalism. Fluid app with nice customization. Big missing feature though is dark mode.,
"We are what we eat. Our bodies are a composite of many things-diet, exercise, outlook on life, etc. Live strong and practice wellness.",
The best newspaper in the world has the best app! Thanks NYT for bringing world class journalism at affordable rates for your international readers. The app is smooth and is seamless to operate and read.,
It keeps asking me to update to the latest version (though I have installed the latest one) and stops me from reading articles.,
"Disappointed that the widget for this app has disappeared since the app updated. However, like the dark mode in the app.",
though conservative leaning they stick to their tradition of FACTS first! Get yourself a Digital Subscription or if your more adventurous the paper subscription.,
I am a psychologist and have treated ma many grieving patients. This article adeptly described some of the factors that affect how we grieve.,
"What can I say? The New York Times continues to set the standard for fair, factual reporting. I subscribed at the start of the pandemic, and I continue to rely on NYT daily.",
"I get that most reporters are biased. It's just awful when an entire news outlet is skewed to one side. If they would just hire some centrist/right reporters to balance the leftist viewpoints, I would considering subscribing again.",
I love the puzzle making word from 7letters. I appreciate the hard work of the New York Times best gift 🎁 and the greatest Bible study article watctower. JW. ORG your awesome,
I love the New York Times but I simply cannot keep up with articles emailed to me. I wish there was a way to get just the political news and editorials.,
App won't load content. Says I am offline when I am connected to the internet and all other apps load correctly.,
"Be careful. Very hard to unsubscribe. Took me an hour and forty five minutes to have my subscription canceled. The agent thanked me for my ""unloyalty."" WOW.",
The best article I have seen on this topic of the sedition of power which advocates for long term systemic change. the Republicans who supported Trump before this episode are equally if not more culpable and the democrats for letting this go on for so long post election. shame on all of them for squandering tax payer dollars.,
"Crashing for A WEEK. Have loaded, deleted and loaded again 3 times this past week. Very irritating to say the least.",
"Has too many articles that never load, extremely buggy. Obviously not in any big rush to fixing the app cancelled my subscription.",
It was a good app. But for the past few days I am unable to open the articles from the main feed page. Kindly look into it.,
Paid for two different subscriptions could never get the app to recognize either of them. Emails to support were ignored. 50$ wasted,
"Inappropriate ads from NYT. My young boy was devastated by the graphic violence. Not appropriate for 14 or younger. Not focused on News. It's focused on being this half thought-out moral censorship platform. It tries to craft and form what is bad, wrong, immoral, or dumb. Hides behind opinion pieces. Like there is a difference between an article or opinion. Always the first to call for deplatforming or censoring opposition.",
"i like the layout of the app, the articles and original reasearch they conduct is amazing, but the paywalls are disgusting, you cant use it for free",
"Regardless of what you've heard this is not a ""liberal rag"" Quality Journalism",
Love NYT. The Daily podcast with Michael Barbaro is my favorite source of news. Would really like to have more live videos.,
"Good app, would love there to be a dark/night mode though. Really rough on the eyes at night with the bright white.",
Even before dark mode was taken away (it's supposedly coming back at some point) this has just been very underwhelming.,
"Pretty solid for the $1/ month deal, no ads and NYT is kinda less bias (doesn't mean it wasn't). Pretty aight, cool journalism",
Dark mode support needed. It's too harsh on the eyes at night with the bright white background.,
"Only app where I pay for a subscription and still see ads. Not small ads - big, full screen video ads.",
opening this app to top stories never loads until you go back and forth a few times. for an app that I pay for should work a little faster,
"Love having access to the paper whenever I want, as many articles as I want, for $4 a month is fantastic!",
I love the depth of the writing and reporting. The information presented goes far beyond the surface details.,
"The app works well, but does not allow for comments - either to read them or make them - you have get the whole paper for that",
"This app will send me push notifications at 1am, wow, ""1am"" almost looks like ""I am""! Which is funny because I AM F***ING sick of these notifications",
"Has been crash city for literally for years for me. No fixes yet, just uninstall/reinstall constantly.",
"In an era of ""choose the news that agrees with what I feel"" the Times still keeps giving us honest, well researched news.",
"Generally been very happy with the app, but the latest update removed ""night mode"" (dark background) which is unfortunate.",
"Lately this app has been struggling. Articles take forever to load. I love the Times, please fix this.",
"despite dsily entering my subscription detsils in the web verson, it makes me use the app now",
Randomly fires off a ton of outdated notifications. I just cleared about ten notifications from up to five days ago.,
The app is very fictional and always being improved. Now it's even better that the Dark Mode issues have been fixed!,
"It's about time someone wrote about this. This administration's pandemic response communications have been strikingly better, but still are not nearly good enough. It's been frustrating.",
"In a day when television news is defined by the opinions the news stations want to project, New York Times is my preferred choice for getting verified, factual news.",
"news!! interesting, imformatice and now at your fingertips. it's an app, and it works, and tmyou get the news!",
This app is practically unusable on my Galaxy phone. It would be fascinating to hear the story behind the incompetence.,
Very clean interface. High quality journalism. I use it every day to get information I need.,
Great content but the App is a bit laggy after returning to main site after reading an article. That's my only complaint.,
"Apparently I cannot use the app as it is out of date. According to the play store, the app IS up to date.",
This pretty gutsy and cool!,
"I enjoy reading the NYT. It's informative, balanced & sometimes fun to read. I especially love the Friday recipe segment",
"Gives a drop down for an article, when I click on it just goes to the main page of the app rather than the article.",
"Not really any different from the mobile site, but with more annoying notifications to turn off.",
"Perhaps the best newspaper app. A bit of a memory hog and sometimes finicky, though.",
"I've subscribed for about a year. Turns out the news is real, and it feels good to support real journalism.",
"Excellent, timely reporting. A must read daily for every American to know exactly what's going on in our country. Democracy doesn't exist without these great journalists.",
This op-ed on false patriotism is as reasonable as it is a courageous challenge to renew our commitment to our founding principles.,
"Too messy. I signed up for NYT, but still haven't gotten easy access. I detest apps and passwords.",
"The news of the world presented by the thoughtful, scrupulous, and supremely capable journalists of the New York Times.",
I no longer can get the nyt on my phone. Can't refresh at all. It won't recognize my subscription!!,
Couldn't see articles posted on public platforms without them asking me to subscribe. I'll subscribe if I want to see things the Times isn't posting publicly. I just got tired of trying.,
"Read it everyday, super app. It does have some issues updating with weaker connections.",
"Shows Ads to paid subscribers. I counted 16 ads on a single page, and I am a paid subscriber. What a bad experience",
Love the coverage and the app. Dislike the lack of a cancel button for the subscription!!!!,
"Best newspaper of our tme (and probably others). App is awesome, too. A pleasure to read whether on-the-go or chillin'",
Subscribed in play store and the app doesn't recognize it so I hit the reading limit. tried logging out and back in and no dice.,
The games are solid. The obsessions of the writers and editors over the past few years have diminished the quality of this publication.,
"I really enjoy the way stories are classified into subfolders, placing associated pieces with one another.",
"The NYT is one of the greatest newspapers, in terms of its journalistic content, but its app has become a headache.",
Easy to use app that allows me to readily consume NYT news and articles. Please being back dark mode.,
App no longer Auto rotates and half of the links to articles from main page don't load... NYT Staff: Please fix these annoying issues,
What I really liked about the app was the headline widget. It's very unfortunate that it is gone now. I hope it will come back in an update soon.,
"I subscribed to NYT so I could read NYT articles on Google News. Yet, it doesnt recognize my subscription on Google News. :(",
"either doesn't load articles or loads them in a dark theme with dark grey text, have to click through tabs multiple times to make it load the articles with a white background and black text",
one of the top newspapers in the country!!,
Most people are unaware or have a misconception about how the failed War on Drugs is causing Chronic pain patients to suffer. Most of us are able to live fairly normal lives with the help of opioids. This dramatically changes overnight when pain relief is denied and more are suddenly finding themselves in this predicament. The number is growing as the safe supply of prescription opioids is dwindling rapidly because the manufacturers are being forced to cut production by the government.,
"Just what you need. honest, truthful news. The world would be a better place if everyone read and flowered the NYT.",
it's my daily read.,
"Nyt is not a credible mainstream elite media. After the 2016 presidential election, I gave nyt xero news reading attention. Why? Fake News. Thats why I stopped buying all their ads and subscriptions. Until all fake news stopped, there is no going back to nyt for me. Sad, since 1960, I was a blind reader. Not knowing the difference btn real news and fake news. But been naive is no excuse. When you engage in reporting, seek the truth before you make national headlines. My hat to DJT, THANKS.",
First and last app I'll ever have and need for news. I appreciate this app entirely. Def a subscriber for life. Keep up the wonderful work!!!,
Having to call a number to cancel is enough reason for me to cancel. It's a repulsive tactic in this day and age.,
"A bit long winded for my like, but quite informative. It Openened my eyes to a different world, literaly speaking.. Yours sincerely, Brian Wood.",
Best newspaper I have read.,
love receiving news updates from nyt,
NYT provides informative and useful information about current events. I find it to be straightforward and honest.,
"Award-winning journalism on an app that never errors out, even with video live play. I love this app!",
"Jittery scrolling on Galaxy S21 ultra. When I scroll articles, the performance is not as good as I see it on WSJ or other news apps.",
Excellent article articulating the cognitive dissonance caregivers feel way too frequently today. Financial benefit mucks up healthcare decision making without a doubt.,
I love this app. I can read the news better at intectual level than other junk papers and articles in news.,
Notifications don't link to the article that they advertise. It's very frustrating,
I like the app and the service it provides but my phone is always complaining that it uses too much background power.,
"Very buggy, blank pages for most articles I wanted to read. This alone is a deal breaker.",
Absolutely fantastic.  Quick updates immediately sent to phone for important news.  Excellent journalism.,
"What happened to the widget? I liked this app just fine, but a recent update took away the news widget. Phooey! 2 stars!",
"NYTimes is more than just reputable and verifiably true, their standard of writing proves to be the best across all media.",
Love the Times. The app is easy to use on my phone and tablet. I read at least some articles every day.,
"What happened to the widget? I want the widget back, as do quite a few others who have posted about this recent change.",
"The New York Times appears to be fact oriented, which is what I expect from from a news source, for it to be credible.",
"Quality of articles is generally good. Wish the full subscription rate was more competitive, however.",
"It was good but now it's not letting me read articles unless I pay with a subscription, which is disappointing. I should not have to pay just to read and learn new things.",
Have to sign in every time i read an article. Otherwise have to agree to lengthy list of uses of my data.,
9.27 unusable due to scrolling issue. How did this pass QC? Update: issue was quickly addressed and resolved.,
I've been reading the Times for a while now and I love it! Great journalism and a great app! A+,
The cancellation policy requires talking to a human who takes you through a lengthy conversation trying to get you to stay. It's 2019 and that is just unacceptable.,
Impossible. Cannot cancel subscription after rate went from $4.99 to $16.99 I don't read it enough to spend that much!,
Largely unreadable. I only read the sports section. the rest is too one sided and often not accurate.,
They acknowledge but can't fix a bug that fails to open the correct news article if you click on the notification produced by this app for that news item .,
"I love the NYT, but the app is a little clunky and it's difficult to search for articles, IMO.",
"Everything you are looking for, headlines, health, arts, puzzles and cooking, on an intuitive app.",
like the introduction style. appear to turnout useful for potential new investors. Does look like a useful IDEA!,
Very Liberal. Shouldnt New be Impartial? News used to be Driven by the TRUTH and NOT OPINIONS or ONE SIDED VIEWS . Also ✓BEWARE when Signing up for a TRIAL! Your ONLY 2 Options are either they require you to ✓ SEND an Email or ✓CALL to CANCEL your SUBSCRIPTION! Instead there should be a ✓ IN-APP CANCEL BUTTON or a ONE CLICK CANCEL LINK to Steam-Line the TRIAL CANCELD. Also the 2 Business Day WAIT before Responding to my Email asking if I really wanted to CANCEL and Charged Me for 1 more Month,
Unfortunately it's useless on my phone. It stopped loading stories. The daily podcast never loaded either.,
The notification tabs NEVER line up with the correct article when you select them! It's infuriating.,
This app keeps going back to its older version. What's the problem? Then i have to re install everytime.,
"The WP and WSJ have superior apps. They have a today's paper section, that makes reading the paper much more enjoyable.",
"full of bugs, ads hesitate for minutes and articles load halfway and then blank till the end. annoying, annoying, annoying",
The app resets constantly. Uses too much memory and slows my tablet to a crawl.,
"by far favorite app on my phone. love the quizzes, breaking news notifications, & customizable feeds. stay in the know ya'll",
"Hello Luv New York Times however this app constantly request pay if you wish to read thish ect ect.. I would however I'm not making an income. I totally understand you have to pay yr employees! In my Humble opinion New York Times Is Worth the $ I'm unable to. Thank You New York Times for All of yr Dedication to the Facts of News, Not the Gossip of News! Sincerely TamarazArtz",
Impossible to unsubscribe. Had to get a block on my credit card. And never did get all the access I wanted.,
"The NYTimes not only truthful, it's the most thorough coverage of all the News. Highly recommend.",
It contains AD for paid users. You can not pay to remove ADs. This app is encouraging and forcing you to install an AD-block extension!,
No way to search for articles. What is a news site for if you cannot search for the items you want? Knocked off 2 stars just for that alone.,
"Ads sprinkled throughout a story or not, this is still one of the best newspaper apps out there.",
the times is one of the best news feeder there is. I enjoy reading now it's your turn to read! excellent,
"Why does the book section still show Lincoln in the Bardo as number one in hard cover fiction? If the list is no longer active, take down the banner ad.",
The app is good but white theme consumes phone battery and causes eye strain. Oled black theme should be an option for readers...,
"They've removed night mode as an option. Love the content, but I won't use an app without dark mode.",
"Great paper, good, reliable app, go to place for news and long format journalism.",
"Enjoyable and thorough, but intentional or not, there is a bias to one spectrum of the political landscape, however much they try to maintain neutrality.",
The Audm feature has never worked on my Galaxy Note20 Ultra. Crashes app. Audm plays perfectly in other apps such as The Atlantic.,
Why is this app no longer supported on the Amazon Fire? We are very frustrated and considering canceling our subscription.,
Notifications do not work. They don't open the actual link to the notification.,
"Facts. Real facts. They don't throw around the ""we did the reaserch,"" like some news organizations whose sole intent is to manipulate, they actually do the research and provide the facts. Love the live updates streams.",
"No dark mode/theme. Navigation seem basic or none existent. For now I wod prefer continuing on Firefox Beta Browser, Android...",
I absolutely love the app personally.It is easy to use and understand.I wish the N.Y. Times however covered more of the news going on in the scientifical world.,
"The android version constantly requires me to subscribe, despite my being logged in. Every 5 articles, it tells me I've exceeded the 5 free articles per month.",
"All access subscriber here. So far, the experience has been great although I have one suggestion: Introduction of dark mode in a future update would be of great benefit",
"Excellent coverage, and an impartial & informative approach to news displayed in an easy, interesting App. Thank you! Highly recommended...",
"The app has been unusable for the past three days. Every time I open a news article, I can't scroll down.",
I love the times. Have been a reader for many decades. Always leaders in information.,
Crosswords don't work anymore. My keyboard bottom row is no longer visible on my tablet screen. This sucks!,
Great institution that has helped guide me through these troubled times. Very cheap subscription offer which couldn't be resisted.,
"Has recently gotten very slow and buggy, not loading any headlines until I force close. Happening on my essential phone and my wife's LG G5.",
"I love the NYT. They're staffed with smart, intelligent, investigative writers that we can count on for current events in all news categories.",
Paying subscribers should not be seeing ads in the app,
I can't wait to share this with a Barbie-loving 66 year old and a 7 year old.,
I appreciate the comprehensive coverage and information. The maps are especially important.,
"NYT is the fastest, most accurate and reliable news source. If your time is important, go straight to the NYT.",
Notification alerts do not open the actual article that was notified. Everything else is good with the app,
This publication has sold the US to China... Can't see it doing the same to India... P.S.: You can keep my balance subscription as tip,
It didn't load... It was there in my phone for more than 3 days but i couldn't open it not even for once and not even after reinstalltion.,
App just started returning to the top of the home page whenever you return to it after reading an article. What a pain!,
"I cannot play the games in spite of having paid the subscription on March 12th, and have called seven times for technical support.",
Can not get enough of the REAL NEWS! Thank you NYT for all you do to shine light into the darkess of places!,
The articles are well written informative and keep you up-to-date with the news. There's a lot to keep you busy in an issue.,
NYT is the best source for news. I trust their reporting and the writers. Couldn't do without the NYT.,
"Removed dark mode, and notifications only take you to the correct story half of the time.",
Exceptional news reporting with in-depth articles and opinions. Fact checking; Covid tracking down to the county level with ability to set tracking to personal areas of interest.,
"Worst experience, app is asking to update everytime I open it. It keeps on going back to older version.",
News with objective intelligent facts and insight like no other news source can provide. Thank you NYT for what you do everyday!,
recent subscriber and appreciate the news alerts and diverse categories. wish didn't have to sign in on each device to access...,
Love puzzles every day,
Essential source of information,
The NYT is still the premier source of news in America.,
PLEASE continue this investigative reporting. All of the victims need it desperately,
Interactive | Engaging | Educational,
The go to on most any subject,
interesting and helpful,
Important information that is ready to share.,
There's always something interesting ...,
Wait. What? You're not reading the Times every day?,
a thoughtful push back on a GOP paradigm ... public safety requires police brutality.,
Be nice if it would stop signing me out.,
Why must I CONTINUALLY log in ????,
Articles freeze or don't load. Comments on article don't load. Article vibrates. Have reinstalled app many times.,
Still the best source....,
One of the best and we'll executed...,
A very useful app.,
The NY Times is racist with all of their attacks on Clarence Thomas. Bunch of racist left wingers. I say this as a paid subscriber!,
Russian ignorance only speeds up our destruction.,
It keeps forgetting my log in.,
A great American newspaper,
"Absolutley a pleasure to read. Take this magnificently written and produced article, Dissecting Elon Musk’s Tweets: Memes, Rants, Private Parts and an Echo Chamber By Sheera Frenkel, Martín González Gómez and Ella KoezeJan. 31, 2023",
I am already a member access was denied,
"What a rare gift to find Rabbi Wolper's article offering us his wisdom, encouragement, and nourishment for life - right here in the NYT. Deepest gratitude to him, and to you.",
"beautiful story about the last of ""boys of Brooklyn """,
It never actually displays the articles. Useless. Will be canceling subscription. A waste of my money.,
the mobile app is limiting,
I use this app EVERY DAY. LOVE.,
where else can you learn everything,
honest open journalism,
uplifting story and arresting photos,
Your dedicated coverage for the emergent events in Hawai'i is greatly appreciated.,
great news source,
best news app,
"it's the NYT, for ducks sake.",
News and entertainment in the palm of my hand. I really enjoy having so much easily accessible information instantly.,
wildfire smoke forecast VERY helpful.,
Poor would not download to tablet,
That was riveting. Thanks.,
Love this paper.,
utterly appalling; concrete that H. Sapiens is the most dangerous creature walking in earth. Prima facie.,
covers stories untold elsewhere,
Love my daily updates.,
great reporting by NYT on this,
Mostly fake news,
no spin zone !!!,
Important and informative,
"The app itself works fine. I use to enjoy the cartoons. I just got tired of seeing so much disrespect and mocking of our president, so I Uninstalled.",
"It's basically a chrome-based app. Where is my ""reading list""? I save an article and I can't find it anymore",
Information I can trust in a world of increasing misinformation. Variety and interesting articles.,
Ridiculous that you should have to pay for more than a few articles a month. I uninstalled it as soon as I saw the free content limit.,
"Right after saying the app seems to be improving, I can't open any articles. Love the reporting, hate this app.",
"Excellent reporting. Getting better with recognition that ""both sides"" isn't a nod to the truth regarding editorial decisions.",
"I have a subscription, but the app keeps prompting me to subscribe and won't let me read some content.",
"exceptional in an era of hanging on. Thank you for continuing to print ""...all the news..."" STAY FIT, FOR AUS",
I hope this app will become free without having to have subscriptions ofr having to pay for it that would make this app better for people who don't want to pay for it,
"Enjoy the news, but so many problems trying to play the crossword when all the letters aren't available to use! Can you fix this, soon?",
Still no night mode. Why take away a feature that is also something core Android supports? And not even acknowledge it...,
"Installed this to see what it is like. After browsing about half a dozen articles I am greeted by a notice that says I have reached my MONTHLY quota, and I need to pay. CAPITALISM AT ITS BEST. HAIL AMERICA THE GREAT COUNTRY !!!",
"I couldn't subscribe for it, after frequent attempts. NYT worthy of reading, but need to solve the subscription facilities.",
Taping on the news notification does not open the correct news headline in the app. Please fix this.,
"Great read informative, entertaining and challenging. But billing and admin problematic still double billing for my subscription",
Since a T Mobile upgrade app does not show full keyboard in mini crossword & popup maps in articles glitchy please fix.,
Would be much better if there weren't the need to go to a browser for the replica of today's paper. The Washington Post app doesn't do that.,
"The very best news source in America. Always honest, admits mistakes if they make them. A National treasure.",
The NYT has been the best news source I could wish for during a time of so much miss-info. the app is wonderful I love this app,
"no dark mode support is shameful with wpost and others having it Edit: 1 year after my review, dark mode arrives, thanks for saving my eyes!",
I'd give it 5 for functionality. Works fine. But I'd like to see a dark mode like on other reading apps.,
"I want to give it five starts but the dark mode just dissapeared off the app, other than the harsh white background I enjoy the app and the news it delivers",
"Repeatedly asks me to log in, then saysiam logged in, thens asks me to log in again. Cannot access articles even though i have paid.",
So infuriating that you have to open the app to get breaking news. Learn from Washington post App which whenever there's breaking news it immediately pushes it via a notification,
"It's the times, no bias just news. Best in my opinion bar none. Facts and reported accurately and timely",
"Freezes, crashes and uses a ton of battery. My phone gets extremely warm using this app.",
Very bad. Login problems. Download issues. Articles hard to navigate. Developer should emulate Washington Post app.,
Great app for news but please give us the option for dark mode and prevent the app from turning screen off every few sec. Thanks,
NEEDS DARK MODE! Phones these days are so bright which is great outside on a sunny day but not when reading the news in bed. Dark Mode please!,
"Since later 2019, it is slow to the point of never loading. It is totally useless app.",
Great app. It would be great if they could make the dark mode a little more easily accessible. <3,
"The odor of rotting apples is still curling my nostrils. I cancelled my Sunday print edition I was so disgusted. How do you justify asking a paying subscriber to pay nearly twice the $ to access the word games and brain puzzles which iPhone owners get free? I promptly deleted this power hungry app, cancelled my 6 month digital subscription (keep the money I don't care) and stopped my Sunday paper delivery after 22 YEARS A LOYAL CUSTOMER!!",
Crashes a LOT while reading articles. Burned through 250GB of cellular data reading the news for 10 minutes. Garbage.,
Very dissatisfied. NYtimes wouldn't recognize the subscription I bought through Google and Google won't refund the payment.,
Huge step backwards in functionality and usability now that NYT has removed the desktop widget. Bring the widget back!,
"Too many politically biased articles, at times simply untrue. Journalism should stand by the truth.",
"'Today' section doesn't load properly on Android. No response from support after four weeks of pointing this out, multiple times.",
Frustrating. Tells me that my device is offline when it is not. Doesn't update when I open it.,
This app does not update!! I remove and reinstall to get latest edition. Very annoying.,
"Allow users to easily cancel subscriptions please, don't force them to call, then hold, transfer, and listen to aggressive upselling sales tactics....",
"The app just hangs, with a blank screen. Something won't load or won't open. Tried 3 times",
Recent update removed COVID map and a ton of bugs like opening a blank page when I just try to open any news .,
Great app to get your latest breaking news. Fun app with cool games to enhance your mind. Well formatted and organized! :),
"Its notifications are disfunctional in that they don't open the relevant article, but just the front page.",
wow. It's terrific to hear the opinions of other police from other countries. It's also interesting and terrifying to see the training of 🇺🇸 police.,
Cannot open stories posted to social media that aren't part of the most read articles. Very annoying.,
"Best newspaper ever - indepth news coverage, human interest stories, arts & culture. It has something for everybody!",
The times has a great desktop site for todays paper. It would be great if it was an app too.,
"Pay to subscribe only to have giant video ads eat up cell data and battery power and take over bluetooth audio. Good reporting, bad app, questionable business decision.",
The journalism is wonderful. The app is mediocre. It also needs a widget.,
Really enjoy waking up to the Times. Updated throughout the day. Always informed about topics of the day.,
Pathetic news. Too much fake content and unreal articles. you need to capture more real news and publish the truth. Worst news application ever seen.,
"Charged for a service, and still unable to access the web browser or App. Please refund my money. All around negative experience with this company.",
"Very thoughtful and insightful analysis. Must read for anybody interested in the well-being of ""American experiment"".",
App gets wonky and won't open during periods of high traffic (?) such as right after election and following insurrection riot.,
I love the New York times but I think $15 a month for an online subscription is a little steep and I'm probably going to end up dropping it.,
"Multiple crossword glitches, still not fixed. Very frustrating, such an expensive app!",
"the Feb 27 update seems to have my android 9 acting all wonky. ads flicker, scrolling freezes, it made my subscription worthless",
"breaking news keeps me current, opinion columns expose me to more viewpoints, arts section and book reviews help me become more knowledgable.",
"One of only two comprehensive, trustworthy, journalist-researched news organizations left in the United States. NYT along with the Washington Post have been my trusted news sources for decades.",
My email offered me this app in relation to my new monthly online subscription to NYT. ..then it asks me to set up an account and says there will be a monthly charge??? I'm already paying. Why doesn't NYT just send me an online version in my email as my other two papers do?,
Journalism is vital to freedom!,
all the news that's fit to print!,
"Intentionally hateful, tbh. Always the depressing stuff and nothing else",
super functional app with deep content,
"In journalism, quality matters regardless of whether you agree or not with the facts presented. This applies to past, present, and future issues that affect your life. I hope The New York Times will always sustain this approach.",
"Fast, without any negative impact!",
Excellent - what a newspaper should be,
"Excellent, incisive reporting.",
Only read the headline. This evening's news.,
Loved the movie and the article!,
"NYT app - Horrible UX. Dysfunctional mess. Overridden with ads. Design/dev team should find new line of work. Privacy issues. The app is DATA MINING, TRACKING, SPYWARE. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD. ... Then to add insult to injury, even paid subscribers are inundated with massive ads embedded in the middle of the articles. NYT hypocrisy - after reporting on the evils of forced arbitration, NYT new TOS now FORCES it's subscribers into arbitration. ... NYT EvilCorp.",
Excellent discussion of our broken health care system.,
"I think we're going to see a grand realignment, partially based on the points raised in this essay. I have no problem defending liberalism, but I find the bourgeois pettiness and intolerance and mainly, unwillingness to engage, to be a flaw that is already proving fatal. Just in terms of demographics and who may represent them, I think. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris combined, or Donald Trump on the other side, each of these sides, represent far fewer people than, say, Robert Kennedy Jr.",
"Great article, as I am from Slovenia.",
Interesting and timely look into concerns over how hospice orgs are growing in this country.,
A great way to spend long lazy mornings with my refreshments,
Very useful and entertaining,
The app says i am reading in private mode and i cannot view a full article! I am using the app and not a browser!,
You remove the auto zoom feature which I find highly discourteous. Zooming text is convenient so why remove it.,
Please fix the crossword on Android. I only see the top 2 rows of letters. This is the second update that broke this.,
"Besides having the most up to date, real-time news the interface is better than all other newspaper apps I subscribe to",
I downloaded the app because I have a subscription. Imagine my surprise when I was billed 8 dollars for having the app even though I already have a subscription for that I was also billed for. Basically I was double billed for having the app.,
"I'd rather use my public library online NYTimes account than this slow-to-load articles, content-edited app. Uninstalling.",
"Love the New York Times, and while this app isn't quite the same as reading the print newspaper, it's pretty good.",
"Very good interview with one of the greatest documentary filmmakers. ""we are living in a time of three viruses.... Covid, racism, and lies/misinformation"".",
Does not display replies to user comments. They're there in the browser version. They're just not displayed in the app.,
Had to remove the app because it would not stop playing audio that I hadn't started and did not want.,
"love this app, I got my news quickly and effectively. easy to navigate and to personalize.",
"The New York Times has mastered the app concept, matching its mastery in presenting news and information that counts.",
I wish there was a way to edit and rearrange sections locations. Like I want my saved articles to be on top,
"Useless, a waste of my mobile data (and that's saying something seeing as I've got an unlimited data package)",
"Great newspaper! I quit my job, left my wife & kids (& pets) so that I could find the time to read the NYT cover-to-cover everyday. Now I'm lonely... but much smarter!",
"I like using the NY Times app widget to quickly see main headlines for the day, I am very sad it disappeared.",
it seems this app really isn't free. you have reached your last free story isn't free. just a way to sell something more for the times . i am thinking of dropping this app.,
The front page stories do not load. Have to hunt for them on inside pages. This is on Android Asus Zen Pad,
"love it. so worth what I paid for the yearly subscription. no tv personalities, just the news.",
"Easy-to use, but uneven from desktop version. Especially when it comes to commenting.",
"I count on the NYTs to bring honest, well researched and written news and editorials. It remains a bastion of integrity.",
This version broke Spelling Bee: no longer shows yesterday's finds and broke the back arrow. Unforgivable!,
"Tired of disguised food subscription marketing. Of course, canceling is hard, like it's a 2 bit paper rag.",
Garbage app. I pay for a subscription and still have ads? Kinda defeats the purpose of a subscription.,
"Following latest update, NYT app keeps crashing and I am unable to use it on my Android (Samsung Galaxy S20+) phone.",
The app is deep linking to articles and you can't get a share button or URL to share a story --- just stupid stupid stupid -- uninstalled!,
i would give this app 5 stars if only it had a DARK MODE feature!!! sometimes my eyes cant stand the white backgrounds.,
Articles often fail to load in the latest version. I get stuck in the loading screen.,
"Content is great, app is so buggy. It's so bad it somehow manages to bug out my app switcher on the Pixel 3.",
"Annoyingly the app will often auto-reload while I am reading, leading me to lose my spot. It's infuriating.",
"accessing the NY Times is one of the few things that has made 2020 bearable, somewhat understandable.",
very important news.,
Thoughtful and provoking insights provided. Reporting news is good. Providing fodder to incite is not The Time's approach.,
"When sending push notification on an android device it won't take you to the article, just the default homepage.",
Great app. I love reading these articles straight from my smartphone. Keep up the good journalism 👏,
the best newspaper 👍,
"THE best reporting available and the extras (puzzles, recipes, human interest) cannot be beat!",
"As usual, any article by Ms. Tufecki is a must read but this one even more so. A very valuable public service.",
"Intersting news but biased by authors as usual, I wish they,ALL publishers, would clarify facts from.opinion.. and who's opinions o we know what angle they have.It's hard to sort out BS, propaganda from real news.",
"NYT was required reading in HS. That was 30 years ago. I never stopped reading the NYT. Today, my children and I read the NYT together. Thank you for being a part of our lives.",
Great app but the widgets have been broken for years. Never worked on my android phones.,
"A simple, well-designed news app. If you like the NY Times, this is essential.",
Over the past year there have been numerous attempts to capture the duress and emotional toll on nurses caring for pandemic patients. This video is the best.,
After update the web links are still broken and the app says it can't connect to internet. What did this update fux?,
The best news app. Expert coverage and absolutely mind blowing depth to any story around the world.,
No search option... This needs to be done. People want to search for stories and topics they're interested in reading about.,
NYT has become just another US media. Never expected it would join the rest of the US media and feed the readers such biased stuff.,
"No scrolling bar, no dark mode, unable to track progress on the article.",
Accurately reports the News in America & Worldwide. Great Investigational work w\Breaking News being a Priority. Very Good indeed.,
"Rating will go up a Star when constant inexplicable crashing is addressed, otherwise I'll have to delete it. :(",
"This new design is great, much more better then before. I just would like to see more interactive reportages",
"You constantly have to tap ""read more"" button. Every Single Article. Annoying.",
Better than most news out there in terms if coverage and variety. App works well.,
"amazing news, articles and op eds. Their morning briefing are the perfect was to start the day",
The app is a great way to get content from the NYTimed. If you love the content you'll love the app.,
Mediocre at best. I would prefer actual news and not an agenda pushed. We need news without a spin.,
"App works as you'd expect, but the five stars is due to the support team that replies quickly when you give feedback!",
"while not perfect, the NYTimes is a very good source of news and reports about culture.",
"Informative and educational,objective and relevant information,reliable",
"Excellent news source, app easy to use, and site very easy to navigate.",
"Whenever I click on a notification, it doesn't send me to the article it references, very infuriating",
worth every penny,
The games are very glitchy. Very annoying especially if you pay extra for crosswords.,
Paid the annual subscription fee (the money has been debited) but it's still asking for a subscription fee.,
"Canceled subscription, app icon no where found on phone, have to access through play store to enter app. Getting worse.",
Recently saw the ads the New York Times have been running on Hulu. What a load of over sensationalized BS.,
"I love NYT. It is real journalism, and this app makes it available anywhere anytime.",
It shows my device is not connected with internet and I unable to see/read contents although I'm connected with internet.😑,
"I trust the NYT for well researched coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their fantastic investigative journalism.",
"Despite paying a subscription, this app is selling user data to more marketting companies than any other app I have installed. Can you not have a paid app without ads and that does not give away marketting data?",
Cant even follow the election or the pandemic with out them stopping you and asking you to subscribe. Wish my browser could remove all their articles from my searches.,
No stars given if you can not develop a stable application and then charge for the unpleasant experience. Learn to code.,
"I love the objective reporting/reporters of MSNBC. IT is my favorite news outlet, and the on-air talents are great!",
Uncluttered news app. Content what you'd expect from the best US daily and Sunday newspaper.,
Great investigative journalism... and frightening that this is even possible in a country that has been a paradigm of the power democracy for the world.,
Almost all lefty stuff mixed with mindless stuff and only occasional useful non-political matters. Sometimes very well written.,
"Garbage. App is okay, however very inconsistent reporting, obvious bias, and some fake news as well.",
so much stuff !!!,
Really wish there was a dark mode. I read at night and the white back ground hurts my eyes.,
"It's a great source of daily news, but sometimes the notifications glitch.",
"NYTimes puts a lot of work into their phone app, and it shows.",
"Paywalls, after a couple articles. More about ""show me the money"" than distributing needed information. My opinion only.",
I believe The New York Times truly cares about accurately and responsibly reporting the news. Thank you.,
The update is so buggy! Articles stop scrolling midway. Articles don't load when they should. Sheesh! Get it right.,
Great app! NYT has great reporting and stories. I'm so grateful to have it so easily accessible.,
this phone app is well written and allows you to view the interactive functions of the articles.,
There are advertisements in an app I am paying for. There is no way to add sections to the home bar. There is no way to leave comments on articles.,
"Clean App.. NYT: Foes of Faux. Best Practices in Real Journalism on All Watches. ACES of MY InBox, which includes Reuters, DMR, MSNBC, WP, LAT, The Australian, Pravda and Voce do Brazilia.",
I was told to download NYTimes in this.app. So I could.download ringtones but I am just going in circles. Miss read again!!!Wh??,
$4.20 ( Cdn ) a month for a years NY Times is a great deal. Unsubscribe any time is a great option. If you don't like it after the first month all you spent was the cost of a Starbucks coffee.,
"constant reloads/ updates, spiffy features that seldom work flawlessly. I ask myself, why don't I just use a browser instead?",
"Fake news, posted news without proper fact checks. Practice good journalism. Don't practice paid journalism.",
Lengthy but very well written article that gives an orderly perspective on our present state of demographics and healthcare for our human species.,
I read some of the more recent negative reviews. They don't reasonably match my experience. I think NYT is being targeted. Looking at this even more its suspicious that the complaints all at once are an extreme OVER AMPLIFICATION of a minor issue of dark mode. Seems suspicious. Just saying.,
Live in London. Read The (British) Times. Important to get a different and well-written perspective.,
"Look, good journalism isn't dead! And some of the writers are half decent too. 😊",
wont allow update. uninstall and reinstall does not work. open keeps bringing back same update version message.,
Absolutely in love with the app and the content. User interface is top notch.,
if it wasn't for the blatant pro azeri and pro Turkish bias the NY Times has I would have given them 5 stars. app is great.,
The app is broken. Images do not load properly while browsing through an article.,
The NY Times is my go-to for honesty and integrity as well as fine writing and interesting features.,
"A sad, but necessary timeout to better understand the need for personal, situational awareness concernig the emerging, multi-facited, world disaster associated with global warming. Well done, & thank you NYT!",
Lacks dark mode even though tons of readers want to check the news in the early morning or evenings.,
Just needs some widgets for this app,
The story line on all of the three sections were the same; however these are trying times..,
"my fear is that those people will come to texas, or Idaho and find 'new' employment elsewhere. where is a national register to identify their habits. they need more than a nudge to a different field of work. maybe they need to be outstanding, in their field. no, seriously, they need to be outstanding, in their field.",
After the update I'm not getting any breaking news notifications like I was yesterday.,
For a news outlet I want an app thay updates more often than 9 or 20 hours. Do enjoy the less time sensitive articles.,
The app is poorly designed. It spews forth audio content unsolicited with no interaction with app.,
You cant even do a text search in an article. Just use the mobile browser version. 🙄,
"Won't recognize my subscription - nytimes says contact Google, Google says contact NYtimes and the whole time they are just stealing my money.",
Deleting the app over the ridiulous JK Rowling ad campaign. I will not entertain cosuming news from a media platform that supports cancel culture. I am never likely to re-install the NYT app and will make sure NYT content does not show on my Google news feed.,
Great on my phone. Main news quick to read. Lots of interesting articles as a bonus.,
Loading loading loading... Half of my app time spent on staring loading spinner. Really not acceptable especially I am paying for my subscription.,
Superb. I love the interactive puzzles- especially the NYT Spelling Bee. Can be glitchy on iPad.,
Great app to stay informed with current events. However problematic with Android 10.,
"As a paying subscriber, I am bombarded by too much adv. I would be happy to pay 3x to see less adv, but no such option.",
"l love the Times, but I love the daily and I can't figure out how to access it on here; soooooooo I just use iHeartRadio for the podcast",
App does not work. Cannot see most of the fonts and cannot login with my account.,
"Great reporting and articles. App is good, intuitive, and reliable.",
The New York Times is simply the greatest news and entertainment reporting source in the world.,
"All the news thst's fit to print: Complete, accurate, fair, and intelligent reporting.",
I love the NYT app but it doesnt load articles properly anymore. That's a big problem!,
"The New York Times app works well, but mostly it's the content of NyT that I enjoy most.",
I love the NYT and their app is as refined as their writing. easy to navegate and save my favorite articles.,
"Reliable, well written, intelligent news and analysis. The perfect antidote to a post-truth culture",
"I like the app, but I'm really surprised there is no widget? I need a visual reminder that I have articles saved to read lol.",
"This is the best news app for international updates, containing lots of editorial and opinions. Thank The NYT.",
this is a wonderful piece about families and what shapes us. and a beautiful piece of music composed by the author. I loved every minute of this story. thank-you,
"Worst app my tablet, crashes almost every time I use it, unusable this morning, crashes with every use.",
"Please issue a response to the many people (including myself) who are having trouble loading articles. Let us know if you are, indeed, trying to solve the problem.",
They have made it extremely hard for a person to unsubscribe. You have to either call them or chat with a rep or write to them. Disappointed as Hell! I want my digital subscription cancelled RIGHT AWAY!! Goddamn swindlers!,
"Clean & easy to use, but boy I would really use it a lot more if it supported dark mode.",
"This app is pure garbage. Just had to reenter my password five times, trying to read one article. Uninstalling now",
great news source. editorials are left leaning but news ranks right in the middle of the mediawise rankings.,
"The ""share"" Action of every notification shares the article from the most recently received notification instead of the specific notification",
Games (crossword) portion is missing last row of keyboard. Makes a bit tough to finish a puzzle 🤨,
It keeps scrolling back to the top of the page every time you click through to read an article and return to the page.,
Exceptional. Really captured what so many of the faithful missed this past year and what matters in welcoming them back.,
great reporters. great reporting. super articles od special interest or in- depth examination. special thanks.,
UNBELIEVABLY slow. And when I open the app it invariably shows me the news from 3 days back.,
I just started - too soon to make a review of the App just yet. But I love the NYT & I have for a long time!,
It's the only one worth reading! I have done so since 1969 after returning from 2y 8 mos in Viet Nam,
I can't go a day without reading the NYTimes. It makes me feel like I'm really reading the truth. I just want the truth about what's really happening in these crazy times.,
Mediocre The design could have been better. Each time I go back it takes me to the very beginning and not where I left,
"As the NYTs argues, truth matters. Do read to support good journalism and Do demand good journalism from the NYTs to make sure they fulfill their stated mission.",
"great content, better search feature and easier to toggle notification settings would be the only improvements",
decent app. headline notifications when selected from drop down don't bring you to article. Samsung Note9,
It often took so long to update it was no longer news but history! And so is my app!,
Reliable news source.,
Cancellation process is an obstacle course meant to wear you out trying to make cancelling more hassle than paying your monthly fee. Shame on NYT you're ruining the spirit and reputation of great journalism.,
"Easy to navigate, thorough, well written articles on a range of topics.",
Excellent examples as to what and why what one should do for health reasons.,
Stability is terrible. Frequently quits an article while reading and you lose your place.,
it's great getting timely news on my phone every morning from the NY Times! like reading the Paper!,
"Great news source. It has some left leaning bias, but good on the whole.",
Android app keeps changing to a version with no flexibility and no ability to change settings,
Only tried for one article. Deleted because I found I couldn't zoom in to make font larger.,
Has too many technical problems. And despite being a paid up member has too many Ads.,
"A extremely informative, and most timely summary of the research thrusts and key players.",
"I like the app just fine, but I'm not okay with data sharing (e.g. location) with 3rd parties. App deleted.",
Great newspaper with varied topics. I especially like the book reviews and puzzles.,
Unlike the browsers I use this app will not auto rotate which for me is a problem that's why I will be uninstalling it.,
"Very in-depth reporting supported with facts especially on issues that affect the nation and the world. On the domestic front, there is a need for NYT to print more positive stories highlighting multiculturalism, and address the critical issues affecting the ethnic neighborhoods in American cities particularly New York City.",
"Please, for the sake of my eyes, bring back dark mode. I don't really understand why anyone would remove this feature in 2021...",
okay now l going to tack care this inssue should be downloaded in a second this not good tacke it this long . but . as you see l been a round from this started year l wast involved for a lot reason and for fresh my maind.. and not lose my marbles,
This is a international app. peoples from every country reads this app. But this app doesn't have the dark mode. So I think this is the worst App I have ever used,
"Less user-friendly than Guardian but gives the best access to excellent writing, investigation and commentary,",
"Please bring back the ""now"" feature!! Otherwise, best news app and paper.",
States it is offline and my tablet is not. Have deleted and reinstalled. Happened with the last update,
"The app is bugged. Stuck on an eternal loop of ""fetching newest stories."" Cannot use it.",
Can't get to articles straight from notification bar. there's ads even though i have a subscription.,
Ysed to work great. Since the last update it hangs all the time loading articles.,
How do I cancel my subscription?,
THE go-to place for reliable in-depth news. Well worth the subscription fee for full access.,
Where did dark mode go?! Totally unprofessional to just delete an important feature without options to allow it.,
"Always great, as usual. I am really happy to have subscribed to such high quality news!",
Excellent source for so many things! Interests and Opinions from all corners! Definitely a National Asset!,
The application in its own right works great. I haven't experience any glitches.,
"Can't download articles, too much photo detail slowing speed. Do you have an app with only headlines?",
"thorough, factual reporting..thank you!",
A long history of disciplined honest reporting has become all the more important in stressed challenging times.,
"Most difficult news ap to use. Slow, continualy knocks you off the article you are reading",
A fantastic source of news and opinion. Easily the best newspaper app I've seen.,
not good. every 4th or 5th day the app freezes and asks to 'download latest'. Frustrating.,
What a great article. I really enjoy learning behind the tools we use to understand and model the world around us.,
A great source of unbiased information with high quality journalism. I am very happy to pay for this service. The NYTimes is pillar of our global democracy.,
"Buggy. Used to be great, gone downhill recently. Removed swipe to change sections?? Ugh.",
Why is there no way to access saved articles without leaving the mobile application and logging into the web version?,
The recent update is messing with the dark mode in the app. Please fix it and i will rate 5 stars.,
"Excellent user interface, and of course, excellent journalism.",
The variety and quality of NYT articles has made this past year not only bearable but enlightening.,
After the last update the app doesn't refresh. It hangs until you force it to close. Please fix asap,
Important part of a complete start to my day!,
"One of my favorite newspapers. Highly recommend to anyone looking for balanced, objective reporting.",
Too many times asked for pw and told I do not have access. Can't seem to be able to cancel either.,
I might just cancel my subscription over those pop-up full-screen ads. Quit. It.,
Don't waste your time installing it I thought it would be a waste of time but I figured I'd check it out Used to be a good paper Newspapers are supposed to report the news not write the news,
"Great paper, but half the time the push notifications I get don't go to the related article.",
Android app has become very buggy requiring many restarts to read the days news. This needs some urgent work,
The UI is okay but it always gets into a messed up state where it tells me I've been offline for days,
Most of the articles on app are not free..you need a paid subscription to get access.. especially opinion page.,
For some reason I can no longer share or save Stories. As a paid subscriber this is unacceptable. No response from tech support,
"Bought a subscription and none of the articles are available, it asks me for another subscription. You can't even get THAT working?",
"Great article that shares a personal experience of how this fundamentalist philosophy has infected many Christian churches. The article details the psychological impetus for seeking beliefs espoused by fundamentalist Christians and WHY they would be attracted to philosophies that are antithetical to central teachings of love, grace, and mercy of the New Testement. I really appreciated how the author's personal candor mixed with a thoughtful overview of the key elements of fundamentalism.",
"Thoughtful, informative articles that include both sides of an opinion. Covers a wide variety of topics.",
"good work out over breakfast to get the brain going and on my birthday today I scored 2 (the bot was 5), I know I'll crash and burn tomorrow but I'll bask in today's glory 😎",
The only daily paper needed as a your GPS to news.It is objective and details all perspective prisms from all sides and lets you decide.,
"the only thing wrong with this app: it's a pain to find your saved articles. it's there, but it should be more prominent.",
I frequently have to uninstall and then reinstall the app because stories either load incompletely or not at all.,
Most Biased news agency in the world. Without knowing ground reality just publish news passed by some biased so called reporter.,
"Tired of the 'ten per month"" rule so just deleted. Online ads pay for all the other sites, why are you different? Laters....",
"Good app and newspaper, Shame that you have to pay to read some articles, Otherwise would have got five stars.",
ny times was known for its investigative article's but I've come to learn that they are politically biased and do not report the truth even when everyone knew articles written were biased. if your not reporting the truth you're part of the problem.,
Always insightful yet measured in reporting news worldwide. I never tire of reading the Times.,
Absolutely can't live with the Nytimes! Relevance in Journalism in every Genre. Thank you!,
Articles won't open on Samsung tablet. Clicking on headline link shows white screen briefly then returns to headline homepage,
"If you love pop ups ads on top of scrolling ones and having your data about what articles you read sold, this is the app for you!",
"Excellent scope and writing. Also, sadly, increasingly ideologically affected.",
When it's working it's great but it has periodic problems which prevent proper usage way too often.,
Upgrade won't install on ASUS android tablet. Worked fine for two years prior to this issue.,
"I have always liked the Times for having article's that have personal heart interest, and perhaps, a shared political rest.",
"Nice, clean design. Good for reading. Navigation is good, but could be better.",
I love having a New York Times on my phone,
"The fact that it fails recognize that one has other NYT apps (e.g., cooking, crossword, etc) is tedious at best",
Night mode is back! The app has been getting better over time which is great.,
"because of making account for this stupid application, lots of spam from Aol. com is sent to me! so many spam?!!! the app isn't worth it at all",
I rely on the New York Times to provide a factual and intelligent rendering of the daily news.,
"I do have dark mode now, finally, but ads are not, making them even more intrusive.",
"Great content, but I cancelled subscription because this app lacks the read aloud feature of the Washington Post and Guardian apps.",
"Great journalism, but Please make the app have dark mode. I can't read it at night",
"Countless bugs, and after the latest update at least half of all articles I click on never load.",
The widget was what made this app attractive... without it I will not be renewing my digital subscription.,
"Most of the current Affairs is missing..sports covers mostly basketball, world affairs missing not a good option for global news",
"They removed their widget after an update. I never leave reviews but because I pay for this service, I am highly disappointed !",
I love the New York Times. They are the first to release most information and being very accurate.,
"I admire the integrity of NYTIMES and wish rest of world can learn ethics from this admirable newspaper and the brave heros( journalists) who bring facts from multi- faceted sides and present the informed case to us. I have shared several articles with friends and family in other countries. Puzzles are irritating, frustrating, I want to pull my teeth till solved then sense of satisfaction is highly therapeutic. Thank you for being my trusted companion NYTIMES!!!",
devours 2 and 3 percent of battery a minute which makes it impossible to even use unless I'm tethered to a charger.,
"As a former homeless person who has now found a secure home in a great town, this speaks volumes to those marginalized by society, poverty, inadequate housing, outside work like UPS. Now that global warming is added, I see the wealth disparity rearing it's myopic blindness to to our underprivilaged brethren.",
Michael Barbaro is a wonderful interviewer. His voice soothes the most jagged story. The Daily podcast is on my list every M-F!,
"Good approaching great, but navigation and state handling need work to reach 5 stars.",
"Great information, but hard to navigate. The app supports dark mode.",
always have my daily dose of NYT,
Presentation seems good. It seems local coverage is being dominated over global news. An eye should be on global news.,
"Good, clarifying article helping me understand why trying to explain simple reality to right- leaners makes me want to tear my hair out.",
Can't log into my account. Subscription linked through my Google play account and it will not let me log in on new phone.,
"I would love it if there was a way to sort articles I've read like a favorites tab, etc.",
Same frustrations about notifications that others have noted. Hope they fix it soon.,
I can't stop smiling while reading this. I've listened to Weird Al since the Dr. Demento days. I finally attended a concert as a senior citizen with my adult son. This article is a wonderful tribute to an artist that's gives it all for his fans.,
"Once upon a time the NY Times was a respectable News Paper but NOW it is just a LEFTwing Socialist organization. All it publishes about Conservatives is Pure Negativity BUT if Any Communist says Anything it is ""published"" as if it were Gospel! DISGUSTING!",
"Over six decades reading very few information sources compare with breadth, depth and primary source material of NYTimes.",
The Widget is gone; no mention of it in the release notes. Not smart NYT developers!,
Most recent update: articles don't open at all. This app's quality is going backwards.,
Needs a dark mode. The white background app is too bright and not suitable for night time use,
NYT Subscription is easily the best purchase I've made in 2020 and this is a great app!,
"I just uninstalled it and went back to the web site. Why? No comments, no index, frequent and unnecessary notifications, etc.",
Crashes multiple times a day. Times tech staff has not gotten back to me yet.,

Solid journalism on which I rely,
Great news paper,
It keeps crashing. Had to reinstall almost daily for it to work.,
"Useful, began to change my fearful attitude right away. A refreshing shift of perspective.",
Biased one sided propaganda tool. Not Worth the time wasted opening the invasive app! Do Not Recommend.,
Like the news and generally the app. Getting Dark Mode like most other apps would rate higher.,
"Total garbage! Super glitchy, hearts navigate, and not worth the subscription.",
"Keeps asking me to subscribe, even though I am... can't read all the articles I'm wanting to read. Please fix!",
The mini crossword is unplayable because the bottom row of letters on the keyboard are hidden and inaccessible on my Pixel 4a,
Uses up to 2 GB data per month and user support is not able to explain why. Scary...,
Newsletters are wonderfully curated. Access to the entire publication with searchable content.,
No dark/night mode?!?!?! Horrible navigation! Awful app. NYT should be embarrassed of this. Fix it!,
Keep your journalistic integrity... don't bend to people... and app and website too need improvement now.,
I love my NY Times app which keeps me informed and brings lots of smiles on the Metropolitan Diary section.,
"easy to subscribe, but you HAVE TO CALL to do an online chat to cancel BUT no one is ever available.",
Terrible customer service. Obv great journalism but the app and customer service awful. Really hard to update your details,
"if the membership price wouldnt be that exaggerated.i could think about to subscribe.by the way if you could subscribe,do it.ny times is the best out here",
"I liked this app, but the latest update just killed the widget, which was one of its most useful features! Why is NYT deliberately making its app worse?",
Recently app continually tells me that it is offline when NYT server is up. Became useless.,
NYT online is a lifesaver. $17 each four weeks is the best money I ever spent. I couldn't live without it.,
love this app. Slightly disappointed that the puzzles are a separate subscription.,
The NYT is jealous of tiktok and seems to be trying to destroy it. I use this app to be accurate in my tiktok content...BUT not anymore ..screw you NYT,
i don't finish my morning routine until i have read parts of the Times. NYT is the site for real information.,
App used 400MB of background data until my carrier warned me of a data usage spike. Uninstalled immediately.,
"I love getting the latest headlines, but also be able to look at different sections that I like.",
"If you're looking for some good, reliable, in-depth, and well written news, then this is the app for you.",
It's great. But could do with an easy to find search function.,
News at the speed of life. Updates & opinion pieces timely and well written.,
App is mediocre. Feels like a web UI wrapper and often support for coping article urls is buried.,
"Notifications don't take you to the article, instead they take you to the front page.",
It is NYTimes. My go-to news outlet. App done well and straight to the content.,
I hate that I can no longer see the sections at the top of the app. I read fewer articles as a result.,
"great articles everyday, i always look forward to what's next, in depth, sensible, fact driven",
Timely vaccine information.,
"terrible, was working fine but now jumps from pager to page. Running app on Chromebook in tablet mode",
No search capability. Ugly interface. Infrequent updates.,
"Pathetic quality of journalism. No wonder even the remaining journalists are leaving. NYT, your strong ideological bias, particularly against India, has costed you your credibility. You are no more than a mere tabloid. Absolutely pathetic.",
Great knowing what I read goes thru vetting n validation process before published. World news at its best! Kudos nytimes!,
I love reading the NYT but this app is so buggy that I had to cancel my digital subscription.,
"It's 2021, and this app still lacks Dark Mode. Come on, already! The Washington Post app has Dark Mode, why not NYT?",
Having to wait for hours for a representative to cancel is an unacceptable process. Add an option to cancel within the app or online.,
"I feel like this is responsible journalism... feels confirmed, in depth and well researched ... and articulate. we share this country with people poisoned by Trumpist hatred of the truth. I feel as if the NY Times, along with other traditional and responsible siblings news outlets is our defense against that rot. thanks to all the hard working reporters, researchers, columnists and all the support staff that keeps them going.",
Best news app by far. The journalism is top notch and the application is world class.,
Most of the time when I open it there's an error loading and it force closes.,
Paid for all access and bonus. I do not have access to crossword and spelling bee; and no bonus.,
"Notifications now always open into an error, my device is never online anymore and won't update to more recently than one day",
The fact that I pay $15 a month to be a second class citizen to IOS (no dark mode on android) is digital apartied. I shouldn't be shocked NYT hates the poors.,
"An important article for our time: articulate, well researched and thoughtful.",
The content is great. App is terrible; it absolutely needs dark mode.,
"Great in-depth reporting, great writing and thanks for telling the truth! Turns out that's patriotism",
"Sometimes a little overwhelming, but a great, NOT FAKE, source of important news.",
NYT is my first stop every morning to find what is happening in the world.,
Very well written. Intelligent and highly literate reporting. I can highly recommend this newspaper.,
"Great app and great content. Worth every penny. Learn to pay for good content, people!",
I have not had any problems going into each days articles and reading what I wanna. I love the NYTimes!,
"So I pay for subscription but still get served ads, no thanks. Would be nice if this was disclosed at time of purchase.",
This app slowed my samsung s6 down to nearly a stop. I removed it and my phone became usable again.,
"One of the most respected news sources on the entire planet. I try to read a broad spectrum of news sources, including NYT, Reuters, Associated Press, Washington Post, and a few others.",
Great news and fascinating in-depth articles,
Pathetic and biased news.. It's all one sided news... never appreciate the good things... And shout out negative news with loudspeakers,
"Love the excellent, high quality writing along with great insight and thoroughly researched reporting!",
"Tried to sign in with my free account I made with this app on the New York Times website reading about the United States Democratic candidates and the Presidential election in 2020 - but after I created the account via the website, by signing into my Google Account, naturally it suggested I download the app - the Google Account login does not work at all - and keeps telling me I need a paid account - why do you have free accounts, direct me to the app, and tell me once I login I must now pay?",
"After just 10 minutes, I found multiple inconsistencies and errors. This is modern journalism? ??",
Why is the español option gone?? Terrible change of interface makes it harder navigate Older versions were better,
"I, absolutely adore The New York Times. It is an example of journalism at its' best!!!",
"There is nothing such as 100% objectivity, but to be payed to practice defamation and to spread false news is a the lowest level I have yet to see!",
"App constantly, irritatingly reloads the home page while you are trying to read articles.",
Doesn't work well on my Samsung Galaxy S9 plus. There's no updates unless I manually open the application,
The New York Times - the best newspaper in the world. I just wish they would have an easy way to adjust text size.,
I love this app but it uses most of my little monthly data. Will reinstall once I get more data.,
POS App failed same as you Help,
This app blocks you with a paywall even if you have a subscription. I have to read articles on web browser.,
Now I like New York Times even without the funniest because. I can continue reading write on gmail without going to website,
High quality journalism but subscription fee is high. Consider offering free articles to low income markets,
Usability of the app itself is poor and the most obvious flaws go unaddressed for literally years. Article scrolling is psychotically jumpy and closing the app for two minutes it opens up again at the top of the front page as if you're seeing the next day's morning paper for the first time despite the fact that nothing is different. Ads show for paid subscribers so you can be sold Gucci while you read about consumerism destroying the planet.,
With the latest update reader comments doesn't show. Fix this please. Otherwise it's a good app.,
"I like the content provided, but, like the Washington Post app, I wish it offered a dark mode.",
It's ok but I have more control and a better experience in browser.,
"Has lots of bugs, the news too is biased and propoganda",
The New York Times is an essential part of America. We need investigations that the government refuses to do. Thanks NYT!,
Superb reporting with a New York state of mind. Lacks only a good search tool.,
"great news service. American-centric of course, but a great source for news.",
Always blocks my article to get me to subscribe. I'm going to delete it if it happens again. To bad cause I like their articles.,
I love the NYT! The articles are very well written and so well researched. I learn something new everyday!,
News doesn't seem to update as quickly as alerts. Maybe update will fix this.,
The New York Times repeatately demonstrates why they are the leading info source for all things affecting we Americans.,
NYT - THE morning noon evening all-time treats. Reverance for its professional intuitive insightful coverage.,
Terrible app. Poorly designed with bad inaccurate information. Deceptive ads and marketing. Steer clear of thia app.,
"Hello, NYT give lot of information well on time. Some of the input available, not found else where. I like",
How do I turn OFF the push notifications in my status bar? There are ZERO settings options in this app. Rude...,
"Articles are thought-provoking, interesting, informative, well-written, and, straight to the point.",
"The story is interesting, the length is considerable and the topic is so damn timely!",
Best online news app I have used. Love the smooth integration of comments with the articles.,
"It's not so much the app, but the biased news content. Try Epoch Times for unbiased news.",
Paying subscriber. Great content but often loads stories slowly or fails to load them entirely.,
got tired of reading politically biased news in India and subscribed to the NYT.. so glad I did it. feel whole and human again.. 🙏,
The best newspaper in NYC for anyone interested in learning all sorts of things about people and the world.,
"App does not work. Fails to open. Says I have no wifi, but I do.",
I always gravitate to the New York Times for what I believe to be unbiased accurate information.,
Keep getting an error message. What's going on? It was working fine until a few days ago.,
Bug: App always scrolls back to the top of the main page after returning from an article/page.,
Great for mobile catch-up on what's happening. Seamless search and access!,
Always my go to site for accurate and timely news. Best source in the world.,
"There's always something for me, whether I'm doomscrolling or seeking distraction from news overload.",
Like the publication but the app is loaded with unwanted tracking ads that distract as you scroll the pages.,
NY TIMES is truthful - not fake news! All news needs to be truthful. Save the opinions to the opinion section.,
"Wish searching older articles was a easier/more robust, but overall happy with the app.",
"nyt, hi quality, diverse reporting padding our life with everything worth knowing about it. love it!",
Great newspaper which keeps me up to date on issues of the day. A daily ritual which I enjoy.,
It needs more news and technical support to serve in a better way. Pay attention towards it.,
Past couple of weeks crashing every few minutes. Interactive content not functional on Samsung Galaxy tab A,
I have been an avid New York Times reader for years I am super happy although this app is truly a disappointment,
"Love NYT, but the absence of a dark mode makes the app unusable in the evening.",
"nice layout and design, easy to maneuver while on the go.",
So many ads. I pay for a subscription. Stop showing me ads! Use Firefox and free instead,
"Very good, but phone app is limited and clunky compared to full online version.",
Journalism is supposed to report unbiased facts and news. NYT is unfortunately garbage just like most news sources these days. If you are wanting a real news source you won't find it here,
The newest article on the top news page is 17 hours old and articles won't load when I click on them.,
I absolutely love the New York Times! The articles are well written and the topics are plentiful.,
"After updating the app, app crashes at the start. Please fix.",
"Clean design, nothing gets in the way of the articles (no pop-ups, etc).",
I trust NYT . Great reporting. The best articles. Informative. Photographers do excellent work. Many positives with NYT.,
Great app! The unrivaled access to quality reporting is well worth an online subscription.,
Truly LOVING this!!!!@,
"One of the best articles I have ever read and one I will reference, and I hope many others will as well, for years to to come.",
App crashes every time I click on an article to open it. Please fix this,
"I like the this app because it has a world view good interpretation instead of just city state, unbiased that's what I like the best",
"App works flawlessly and NYT is one of the best sources for indepth, detailed coverage of events.",
"Just dropping my rating until dark mode is back, which I'm told (by NYT support) will happen eventually.",
Anyone with an Oppo phone will find the version of the NYT app in the Oppo store will overwrite the PlayStore version. The app will then keep saying it is an expired version. The Oppo version is an expired version 8.3.0 (marked beta with logo in green). Could NYT remove beta version from Oppo store please?,
Give us option for night or dark mode otherwise you could loose many users like me and my friends who read everydays The New York Times for many hours.,
"I paid the amount required to get all the news, but I don't recommend if the user does not have a good and stable connection!",
Articles dont load. Kind of the whole point of the app. Fix this NY Times!!!!,
It always ask for premium not useful please uninstall this app don't waste your precious internet for downloading such pop... Thanks,
Battery killer. You can actually watch the percentage drop by the minute.,
Don't much care for this I rarely get the review articles because they want you to subscribe to The New York Times and I can't afford to subscribe,
Pictures and movies are no longer available. This app is terrible after latest update,
"Excellent source, articles are compelling. There's something for everyone.",
Can't link the play store subscription to a NY Times account. Unable to use on other devices.,
"Great stories, high quality writing and reporting. Indispensable.",
"Installed app with great hope, read privacy policy which creeped me out in a fairly big way, uninstalled app. Can't support an organization that uses me against my will to make money when I would be paying them for a service.",
"Well written, the NYT has become a voice for the far left wing. This is not my father's NYT. I'm a moderate-liberal D, and the news and opinion sections have left me behind.",
"Cool UI, but very frustrating to accomplish simple tasks.",
"Why are there ads in this app? I paid for a subscription, I shouldn't be seeing ads.",
Very informative and interesting. I some times search for Psychic and parapsychology articles.,
"The July 29, 2020, update has rendered the crosswords -- both regular and mini -- unusable.",
"Latest update broke my app. I only see a blank white page, even after restarting my phone.",
I've read this paper for the last 30 years and have always found it's articles enlightening and entertaining.,
i've updated to the latest release and navigation keys still do not work which makes the app useless without a mouse,
What happened with the last update? I tap on a story listed under Top Stories and it won't open the story.,
Its not gud app. They don't know how to edit or present news. They also misleading the people. Most of the news are from sources which are not vedified they are fake news. Worst news channel.,
"Terrible app, broken integration with google pay, no dark mode, new pay wall step for every click and the list goes on",
The NYT is journalism genius. Great app. I enjoy reading the NYT and it is great to have real news at my fingertips.,
"Best in win place and show. And Wordle! Integrity in reporting the good the bad and yes,Politics.",
"Good content, but freezes all the time (so you need to close/restart it).",
Balanced coverage and bold journalism. It keeps the light of freedom alive.,
Best newspaper in the country.,
"up to date, immediate, accurate reporting from a stable of the world's best reporters. Come on, who does this better than the NYT?",
"Too bias. One artical read like a 12 year old wrote it, ignoring facts over personal bias of the topic. Not an accurate news source.",
"What if it wasn't only to spy, but to plant info. Perhaps a virus to act or open another system when signaled. replacing good or false compromising info ""proaganda?"" divde an conquer! even untrue or alternative facts seem to reek havoc on us lately.",
"The greatest source of information obtainable on Earth, moving closer every year to a real version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",
App UI is ugly but more importantly NYT lackluster journalism continues to get worse. Now their undying support for Zionist terrorists has pushed me permanently from this fake news publication.,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WIDGET? WHY'S IT REMOVED? I barely have time to read. Bought a subscription to help keep the good guys in business.,
Worth every penny and more. Support accurate honest journalism and amazing recipes.,
"This is the NYT, what's not to like? News, features, food and much more. and the puzzles.",
"Wonderful journalism. The whole platform is very resourceful, very broad.",
Love reading the Times! I really enjoy the mini-crossword and the Spelling Bee.,
"love this app, it's easy to navigate and the news articles cover all sides.",
"Grateful for a trusted news source and interesting articles, but lacking a dark mode for the app",
This is an expired version! Every time I finish dowloaded it and not more than 5 ms it says expired version. .,
"Once they learn to stop amplifying and repeating falsehoods spoken by people in power, they might become a home to real journalism.",
Why did they change the interface! Now it's harder to navigate to other sections,
Every single notification changes to a different article to see more details about it. Ruins the whole thing,
I love this app! NYT has great reporting and this A+ app has turned it in my main source of news.,
"Always a reliable, non partisan source for news. Depend upon it.",
Good information to understand that we'll need to ease back to normal not jump back.,
"one of my favorite apps out there. not just news but savvy, cool interactive content",
"World-class content, but links to articles in Chrome on Android no longer open.",
The widget for Android 9 suddenly disappeared - any info on why? I found it really useful.,
"excellent presentation, shows the divide, and the urgency to support the children impacted.",
Can't access nytimes with Samsung galaxy with latest version of app. Update 05/2020: bug is fixed,
"Love this app, but it has been crashing multiple times per day in the last few weeks.",
Its not FREE...!!! Who reads 4 articles in a month? You have only 4 articles to read and for the rest you have to pay. Thats not fair. It should have been written. Dont install!!!,
Get it together devs. This is worse than a webpage. Place keeping and dark mode would get to 4 starts.,
Great story about the behind the scene/after hour work that occurs in Washington. Together they were able to achieve more,
"Mostly speculations based on correlation, lack of investigative skills among their reporters (or their unwillingness to investigate), failing to provide proof of the actual causes of events. Many omissions when presenting the so called facts, as if done on purpose to consciously manipulate opinions. Some articles are interesting and informative. Watch out for partially presented facts as they skillfully distort the truth.",
"once the voice of America, a reflection of all that was great about our democracy, now reduced to a grocery line tell all with little regard for honesty, integrity or prudence. oh how the mighty have fallen.",
A lot of times articles never load and the top stories page constantly loads.,
I feel like I have access to one of the best U.S. news sources! I read news from it everyday and I trust the news from it.,
Crashes constantly and sometimes won't even load the home page.,
Recent update seems that I am navigating without waypoints. Please bring back the top tabs.,
"the app does not stay on the page, what is with latest news why can't I just have my on line subscription displayed as an app",
A very helpful app in keeping with the news of the world from every aspect.,
Best source of news! I am grateful for their work in opening our minds and wishing out understanding and perspective.,
Since I have no suspicion for this newspaper this app let me keep up with the News That's put on New York's time overall it's a good app,
My most reliable source of news and info in this world of increasingly unreliable sources.,
Fix your deeplinks already. I have yet to see a notification correctly link to an article.,
"The app is well developed, clean layout and a good source of news.",
"Good paper, but dwelled too much on Trump for too long. It became all Trump re op eds, which was unnecessary.",
"great features, well written articles, and an easy to use app.",
Content is good but updates are too infrequent; sometimes up to 17 hours! ;,
The app reminds you on your first visit how many times you will have free before subscribing.Press freedom is a must. But in your face reminding profit is a big deterrence for me to be a supporter.,
"New article nortifications do not load the article, they just dump me to the homepage of the app... :(",
Great app for news but I can't share the post when it's in my notifications at the top of my phone,
I love the app and the beta dark mode is the best. Definitely reduces eye strain,
"Easy to navigate. Really drains the battery, though.",
"I am not a fan of the new app. I used to use it multiple times a day, but this new format is terrible. I'm uninstalling it. What a shame.",
Good design and content. My only complaint is that the app can be a bit slow and buggy.,
They got rid of dark mode y'all. Every other major outlet has dark mode but not these dummies.,
"Extraordinary coverage of a subject that is seldom heard or written about. Revealing, sad and infuriating.",
"I get the news I want but even with paying the overpriced subscription, there are still ads..",
"Can't see articles. Can see table of contents and article comments, but apparently articles themselves are the lowest priority",
Really disappointed that NY Times removed the widget. Pls. bring it back.,
Best NYT reading experience on the phone. a couple app hiccups but hasn't crashed yet,
Does not work. Seemed to work a few days and now does not recognize the subscription.,
"Best reporting, interactive reports, and user friendly data representation for election info, COVID-19 info, and everything in between.",
"This thing locks up my tablet for varying amounts of time, turning it jnto a slab of plastic. NOT acceptable.",
"Unconscionably difficult to cancel. Will not ever subscribe again, despite liking their coverage.",
"No more night mode? After latest update, I get assaulted with bright white light coming from my phone. Bring back the night/dark mode!",
Am using dark mode on a Galaxy S9+ with Android Pie. NYTimes app does not play well with dark mode,
I liked this app but it uses too much space as my phone has only 16 GB and I am not able to expand this.,
The Times has great reporters and which makes for great reading! Facts!!!,
"I rate this app with a resounding ZERO, as it's missing a search feature which renders it USELESS!!!",
POS doesn't automatically update and I had to go through an excruciating chat with an awful support person to make it work again,
I just can't do it anymore. It's tragic to see what the Times has become. Unsubscribed and deleted.,
"The news there is in a excellent app, so easy to use and well laid out.",
Hard to search for stories. It needs a better search option.,
"Fantastic and extremely wide coverage of world events, likeable graphics and unbiased representing the diverse range of people",
"the app has some annoyances, but it's generally a good way to read the newspaper.",
I never receive the complete article sometimes I am just halfway through in the screen is blank and nothing else will load,

Haven't been able to open top stories for a while now. App has bug.,
"I enjoyed the perspective from a single person's point of view,a very thought provoking article. Looking forward to the book. Thank you.",
"New York or not, there's nothing like the Times.",
In the UK and can't do a paid subscription either through the web or the app. :(,
"My app stopped working. I LOVED reading the NYT, but I'm unable to usr it now.",
Often annoyingly jumps to the top headline as I'm scrolling down otherwise gives me the news.,
Excellent experience. Easy to navigate. No crashes,
Works okay. The for you section of my app is completely broken and doesn't work at all!,
"Ok app, great content, takes a lot of space and does not support memory card => uninstall.",
Too much marketing from Wirecutter and recipes when I am already paying for the NY Times.,
All the News that is Fit to Print in my world. I have read the NY Times since I was 16. I will die reading the Old Grey Lady.,
"Very nice app, easy-to-use, very stable. And a great news source!",
Constant crashing and freezing. Please fix for Samsung tablets.,
Love the Times! Well written articles that are current and comprehensive!,
Poorly optimised and slow. Comments beyond a certain count never seem to load.,
A paid subscription should not have more invasive ads than free newspapers. Period.,
"Why app is more limited than nytimes mobile website, what's the point then?! Eg. subsections, it doesn't exist in app (eg. World, then subsection specific region/continent...).",
"Unable to use my subscription, ads take over everything ! Disgusting and disgusted.",
excellent and independent media since I was 14 years old reading 📚 the Times.,
Brilliant analysis from Snyder. This is a must read article. We desperately need a return to truth in America if democracy is to survive. It is a challenge even greater and more important than the pandemic.,
"I liked this app until after 2 days, I get a pop up where I have to pay a monthly subscription to view the app",
"Easy to scroll through articles, nice to see how news is viewed from a US perspective rather than UK",
"It constantly glitches, will not open articles, and does not load ads well.",
It doesn't allowed me to open the even I allowed the app to access my email and FB account. Worst App!,
I believe in the New York Times and the Washington Post. They both are exemplary examples of good journalism and outstanding reporting.,
"Superb articles that are informative, insightful and thought provoking.",
My favorite app/paper (paper) has set the STANDARD in journalism for decades. Thank you.,

"Excellent reporting, great diversity. Damn paywall. But very good for free reports",
"I love the NYT! Accurate reporting, great graphics, recipes, arts, politics, Spanish section, world news. The best!",
"Maliciously smearing progressives for centuries. Great ""journalism"" you got there. No wonder people believe the fake news narrative with your level of bias.",
Let's me sign into my account but all pages are blank fix this and I'll give it a higher rating.,
"Continue to bounce out large white panel, storicannt be accessed cuts to blank screen or out of program at its will.",

"App is broken in a few places, the debates' live chat doesn't allow scrolling up.",
"Paid for a subscription, but it won't let me view or access articles and propmpting me to repay.",
Freezing regularly. No 'Nite Mode' that saves energy AND eyes.,
It's a greedy and cheap app which is going to say it isn't gonna show you any news unless you pay some big amount of money. I hate this app.,
"""Da Failing New York Times..."" - still beacon of truth despite what unhinged Chief Execs may imply...I support them because they've been more truthful than our government has been. Best source for news only matched by WaPo.",
This is an excellent overview of how to stay healthy for life. Read it over and allow yourself to conform for your own benefit.,

Crashes constantly on my Samsung tablet. After last update freezes on my phone.,
"Great news and reporting. Only recommendation is it could improve the ""For You"" section.",
"difficult to find older articles sometimes, if you lose your place, but otherwise good app",
"Reliable. Moderate use of hyperbole in stories. Well thought-out news pieces backed by fact ( and not that ""alternate fact"" malarkey, as President Biden likes to say.)",
"Agoraphobia is not an..""Oh well, She has this...but in some ways she's doing real good "" kind of thing...and I understand Sinead's life today IS a mixed bag. I had a little trouble with how the article wraps up in a kinda neat package...but all in all a fascinating piece.",
Articles won't load. You just get a spinning arrow. Version 7.2.0 is broken.,
"NY Times is a beacon, that needs to stay shining on us and keeps us well informed.",
"There's good reason why The Times is and long has been not merely ""a"" paper of record, but ""the"" paper of record.",
They make it a pain to cancel your subscription. They forwarded me to a sales group that didn't understand what no means.,
"Damn the facts! NYTimes can always be counted on to include a ""bothsiderism"" or ""whatabout"" to protect Republicans.",
Usually well thought out articles; sound foundation with collaborative facts and data.,
New York is the center of the formation of public opinion in this country.,
"My best companion to stay informed, in combination with the printed version.",
"Great app, love the content, works awesome on my pixel3a. Please give us night mode!",
I wish the app didn't refresh everytime I back out from an article to the home page.,
"I don't know why every time I deleted this app it's pop-up again, it's really frustrated.",

Subscribed and i cannot connect my account... Tapping on connect account does nothing! Please fix.,
This is one of the most challenging and thought provoking articles I have ever read on the limits of personal freedom. No pat answers here but I believe the author is pointing us in the right direction.,
The app doesn't work. I pay a subscription and I cannot open the app...,
The best thing about the pandemic is my digital subscription to the awesome New York Times,
"great way to read paper, but no recourse for duplicate digital subscriptions from nyt directly--be careful",
Doesn't work on android tablet. Login keeps getting stuck in a loop.,
"Subscribe and support journalism. You wont regret it. I'm so thankful for the well thought out, well written pieces that I receive straight to my tablet.",
the best reading ever. you can spend hours on end. incredibly informative.,
"""You have reached your free article limit for the month."" Thanks, uninstalled.",
I'm paying for access but the poorly designed app won't let me open it. Enough.,
Reliable news in an intuitive app. Worthy to support in these times!,
I need an account to see main headlines. Are ads no longer enough? Now you gotta collect my personal information? No thanks.,
"Very moving. When I read about the recent gift from Ireland to the Choctaw, I very nearly cried.",
Investigative journalism at its finest.,
"Keen, cool chat with two of the keenest, coolest actors we've got! A great reminder of how blessed we are to have them too!",
"Lately app sucks. As a subscriber I can hardly use it as it hangs up. FIX THIS, PLEASE!",
Interesting article on working inside Amazon's warehouse. Why everyone needs their stuff in one day is beyond me!,
"I am chatting with a chatbot trying to cancel my subscription for more than 20 mins now. I have lost all hope, and posting a review here. Hopefully this will get noticed. Why is unsubscribing so hard for you guys!?",
"Horrible, drains the battery, constantly intrusive though notifications stopped.",
The app sucks and the news company is even worse. Racist and spreads slander not news. They pretend to care about diversity equity and inclusion but only care about who will pay the most. True journalism does not exist at the NY Times. Shocked by some of your news articles,
most complete breakdown coverage of possible effective areas of the body for both adults and children..,
Every few months the app starts crashing. It must be reinstalled each time,
sometimes the notification link does not take you to article and that's quite frustrating,
THe NY Times is my favorite newspaper because of its in-depth reporting on both international and domestic issues.,
Great app. I subscribe to the New York times and pay for it and I should not get ads.,
Clicking on the alerts about breaking news doesn't take you to the corresponding article,
I delete because it is boring and needs improve entertaining personal news and attention i know the app developers can do better than that I want a media app i feel i am working with not grieving,
Says free but wants $$ via pop-ups every other click. Not worth the time or $.,
Thanks for the update the application,
"Please, please, please add a dark mode! I like the app but it's blinding for sensitive eyes!",
As of 7/30/20 when attempting to play mini crossword on my smartphone last two rows of keyboard hidden from view.,
they often sent notification IDs for articles and then delete the articles so that the notification leads to a broken link.,
Articles much slower to load in this new tabbed version. Over both WiFi and LTE,
"this app works with paid subscriptions, there are all the options I need to access everything I want at NYTIMES except crossword puzzles",
Easily understood. Comprehensive current and background information.,
"App does not open. Have reinstalled, turned tablet off/on just get a blank screen",
What a beautiful tribute to the human condition and hopefulness for this time of struggle.... thank you for this piece of light!!,
Generally good reliable news source but a couple of SMH headline and op-ed choices...like the app,
"Love that I can live in Florida & still read and appreciate the span of stories from "" The NY Times.""",
"Quality reporting, avoids trash, great mix hard news, science & quality of life issues like art, music, theater, and of course, food!",
Good app but huge data hog. My plan is By The Gig and this app takes almost a Gig a month despite limited use.,
Big problems with thr latest update. Articles not loading and sections not updating.,
Software bugs. Notifications are useless since they don't work,
I have enjoyed being a NY Times subscriber. Good & informative articles always.,
The app might not tell you this but actually all sections are opinion sections. If you like reading reiterated political talking points this app is for you.,
"awful. The app stops constantly, making it impossible to read the nyt.",
"Tops in reporting on many, varied subjects as well as current event news.",
I love this app. It works great for me. I get to keep up with The New York Times all the time. Easy to use it does what it needs to do for me. Thank you,
Recent updates messed up the mini puzzle. Bottom row of keyboard is cut off.,
You are the best designed news app in the world. Well done! and thank you for being a model.,
Slow to load on Silk browser (Amazon Fire). Tends to freeze and develop black spaces.,
"Recently started overheating and severely draining battery on S7, even after clearing data, reinstalling, etc. Back to using the web page.",
This ap sucks i Paid for a subscription on a different email account and I have no way to log in with that account easily,
"I, too, am annoyed that the app returns to the top upon exiting each article. What bonehead thought that was okay?",
Gotta agree with trump on this one. I subscribed THROUGH MY GMAIL ONLINE and it won't let me view articles through the app. 2022 and yall are effing up. Failing nytimes is right. Yall suck.,
"The neoliberal viewpoint, informative.",
Love this app. Well organized and smooth functioning. The way I start my day.,
great app and no adverts exorting me to upgrade to 'premium' and then most likely 'premium plus'...,
"clowns to the left of you 🤡, & clowns to the right of you 🤡",
Republicans want fascism in the U.S.,
Great journalism!!! Need the dark mode option ASAP!!! Otherwise 5 stars!!!,
Facts.....its necessary.,
"i enjoy reading The NY Times. Having lived in the ""Big Apple"" - i have fond memories of buying The Times at my local news stand which also sold hot bagles and warm salted soft pretzels. I survived the polio epidemic of the late 40's - 50's... All this and so much more i recall doing many moons ago, all on crutches & leg braces. Let Freedom Ring! Touche NY TIMES! Freedom of the press! Blessings. juan c. carballo-- facebook: Juan Carballo or Juan Carlos from sunny Miami Fl. Godspeed to everyone",
"Waste of time. You get 2 or 3 ""free"" rticles before they force you to buy their subscription. Deceitful, usurous, and misleading. Maybe the con artist moron has something!!",
"The gold standard for unbiased comprehensive news, opinions, articles, self improvement, and trends",
"After the upgrade the app opens to a blank page. Galaxy s8, android 9...",
It's not failing after all :),
I enjoy the many articles. NYT presents clear and insightful information.,
love this digital version!!! now I read the times & discard the rest cuz I'm not paying a dime.,
I never installed this app! What ever Google gives me to read okay! But I'm not paying subscription since I watch weekly on TNT and I can always see what Twitter has,
I uninstalled the app and use the web browser because the app was so horrible. Basically unusable on my LG V20 Android,
Very important and relevant news with less bias and better topics than most other news outlets.,
Excellent time to have a subscription. The COVID-19 coverage is the best.,
"It used to have a dark mode. Now, it doesn't have. Why? Is it possible to get it back? On the other hand, the content is the best.",
"Recent update shows me offline and won't connect, even if I'm getting aletts.",
Please make a dark mode for this app ...the only reason Im going to reading back in chrome is the dark mode...,
"Quite simply, the NY Times is the app I use the most, by far. I just love it. Thanks for the good work!",
"l am 7 months from the magic age of 80, and the writer of this article is spot on!! l only hope l can maintain my level of physical activity at least to age 90.",
The best journal in the world and It is also perfect to study english. What should I want better ?,
navigation through the app can definitely be more user friendly and more intuitive,
I haven't used it long enough to give input,
"Suddenly, my payment syatem that was working since 4 months has gone invalid. I cant read my articles now.",
Was logged into my account tried to renew and it tied to my Google account instead of my times account now they say I owe them twice.,
"not a follower of classic art painters, but this work is thoroughly beautiful!",
An excellent paper and a strong recommendation to consider subscribing to same. David from Australia,
The best news everyday.,
Always trusted NY Times for authenticity and a broad range of articles.,
This is one of the top news sources in the world. You'd think somebody could do some research into how to effectively design an app that works.,
The app is extremely buggy and it does not appear to be getting any better with updates.,
"I like factual news, but can do without being told how to live my life.",
World class reporting and an app that makes the news more accessible than ever.,
great interface. snappy way to read and share articles.,
"Great newspaper, excellent journalism, and a well-functioning app.",
Can't cast video to chromecast and the navigation is really poor.,

"No Sports scoreboard, stats, standings, etc. No daily crossword",

Most recent update is a disaster. App freezes constantly.,
The price is really decent and its easy to find articles.,
"Zero journalistic integrity nowadays. Not worth reading, listening to, or supporting.",
"Articles like this and the comments associated due us all a great benefit by looking at all sides of a story. Overall I think everyone agrees but does not fully understand or comprehend how education in America has changed. It would behove all to push forward a rational and comprehensive plan to change the uneven landscape of education in America. Education is the bedrock of success be it through a college, vo-tech, mentoring or other means. Education literally has taken a back seat to politics.",
"As a long time subscriber and early reader of the New York Times, the on-line edition is a welcome addition.",
Removed the news widget for no good reason. Please bring this feature back!,
"App is broken. I'm forced to unsubscribe, since I can't access any content I'm paying for.",
Indespensible news source. Like the mobile interface a great deal.,
App crashes several times a day. Very frustrating.,

can't live without,
"Even with the digital subscription, you still have annoying ads everywhere!",
Unable to download articles New York Times does not help unhelpful when you go online for help to correct problem,
Great app! Can be tailored to notify you about the stuff YOU want and need to know. I love it.,
No option to resume an article. Nyt can also include an I built dictionary like kindle.,
New layout is terrible. Far more difficult to navigate.,
"Great article of another Moms life w Covid. I'm Vaxxed, a Christian. conservative. I CHOSE tbe vaccine. I choose to mask up. this article shows whatever we can do to save 1 child from this or one more NURSE having to wrap a body.",
Still a learner is there help available?,

I enjoy the variety of news reporting and opinions in the Times.,
"Excellent, except minus two stars for the lack of dark mode.",
"need a way to cancel easily. enrolling is easy, cancelling should be as well",
Excellent. Unbiased and refreshing in a world of news with an agenda.,
I have sports notifications turned off but that didn't stop them from sending a bunch of world cup notifications 🙄,
This app absolutely needs a dark mode for reading. Please put this at the top of your release list!,
"Thought enjoy, haven't time to sit & read paper. Get small 10-15 lots of time in.",
Games section has disappeared. Also there is no search feature to find specific articles I want to read,
I know it's a serious newspaper but a little more colour wouldn't go amiss.,
Good app from a great news source. Unbiased voices with the facts.,
New version of the app constantly freezes and crashes mid-article,
My favorite Newspaper! Get it 7 days a week delivered and also sent electronically for one price.,
Pretty much impossible to unsubscribe. That should be just as easy as to subscribe. 😉,
What's to says some of humanrights still never realize the who the one give hands to help super already run with my news stand moreany times now running with the play store god blessed.,
My favorite subscription newspaper. Covers subjects extensively and for the most part objectively.,
Please bring back night mode. I've been sent back to mobile browsers to get this capability,
"Your information is only as good as the source. Do not be just a consumer of news. Have a dialogue. We have to pitch in, to keep the sources available. My opinion - an entity is defined by the principles that it lives by.",
Lowered my review. No dark mode and it keeps opening on the nytimes website. Super annoying,
"great app, but I which the search function was more prominent and not so hidden.",
Recently got rid of dark mode. It's been difficult to read in bed now.,
"Interesting, informative & a credible source of information. You should allow us to share an article with non-users, ones they read and they are able to appreciate the quality, like we do. You might be able to get more people to subscribe",
The app is easy to navigate and the paper is always a pleasure to read!,
"I like to read in bed in the morning and the fact that this app doesn't have ""dark"" mode is unacceptable.",
Keeps crashing. Makes for a very expensive subscription.,
Best news app with so much more. I couldn't do without my NYT every morning.,
"Be careful before subscribing! When you want to unsubscribe, they make it so difficult!",
Where is the audio app for Android?,
Always been a fan of The Old Gray Lady. Love the high end ads. Hope they can survive,
No way to remove ads even with a paid subscription and now night mode is gone.,
Great way to construct a personal dashboard to track the Delta variant where friends and family live.,
This article is on point re why we've not seen the full economic destruction we may expect given the COVID pandemic. It points out the effect of the stimulus checks without a specific exploration of the waste implicit in an under focused approach. I appreciate the use of hard data and avoidance of the easy tropes so common today.,
Good coverage without editorializing everything to death like everybody else in the news industry.,
"Fascinating article, well written, and very eye opening.",
detailed and best coverage of all aspects of all issues worldwide. no other alternative!,
It often asks upgrade to latest version but there wont be any latest version available.,
Brings my entire phone to an unusable slow crawl. Must be serving way too many requests.,
Dark mode is gone. Terrible move. Also going back beings you to the top of the page. Who approved these changes? April 1st is months away.,
Content does not change daily. The Magazine section seems to be eliminated.,
Night/dark mode is back. Much easier on my old eyes. Thanks!,
Elite level journalism that is VITAL in the age of disinformation. Also check out their top quality podcast: The Daily,
"Latest update removed the headlines widget, so not bothering with this app anymore.",
"Love the graphics, interactive reports, and photojournalism.",
Hate the constant refreshing. It shifts where I'm reading. Very annoying,
New York Times is my go to news paper. I really enjoy reading it with my wife over coffee!!,
THE American publication that covers all that's going on with smart and interesting contributors/journalists.,
Great news source but the app is buggy. Many times it just quits.,
"Dark mode is hopelessly broken. Thousands of other apps have figured it out, but how hasn't NYT?",
"Unreliable as a news source. Made up stories and opinions, yep.",
Clicking notification never takes you to the article that caused the notification.,
The app is great it has great articles to offer but unfortunately I don't have money to subscribe to use the app so I am unwillingly uninstalling the app but hope soon I will be using this app again.,
The New York Times remains the nation's standard in news coverage & journalism in general.,
I would never pay for content from nyt. I wish they would bankrupt so google stops pushing their articles in chrome.,
"Insightful, balanced, factual reporting supported by a really good app.",
Mini crossword has stopped working on an Android device......cannot access full keyboard,
"Great app, but the navigation and performance could both be improved",
"Love this article of hope, love and loss...We're all in this together and believe that there's always light at the end of the tunnel...",
This is an amazily-indepth news source. One of the best in the world.,
I pay for a subscription but have to pay extra if I want to view recipes.,
science based and also sensitive to those still needing to mask up outside in order to feel safe.,
One of the best newspapers. I like the app design also.,
Good app. A little buggy at times. Otherwise it would be a 5.,
"I have a subscription, but it won't let me read any articles, even though my account saiys I'm logged in.",
wont even display the whole article...just cuts articles off halfway through.,
This is a great example of how to succinctly present a complex issue and provide a considered opinion without political bias. Well done!,
"Informative, incisive and on the cutting edge of breaking news.",
Stopped working. I get a blank screen once in the app.,
"On bad-news days I skip to the puzzles. So, everyday.",
"Good reporting, terrible app. Seriously, hire a software team that can build an app capable of, at a minimum, displaying news stories. That seems like a reasonable expectation from paying customers no?",
excellent reporting. Top professionals. Don't always agree but thecdactsxare the facts as they say.,
"Everytime you open the application,you have to uninstall it and reinstall it .don't know why.Thank you",
The widget seems to have disappeared with the newest update. Any ideas?,
"5-10 adds in every article, even WITH a paid subscription. What a joke.",
Cant seem to load latest news and keep telling me my device is offline. Please fix it.,
I am finally deleting this app from my phone. If you don't want to spend money on news then don't download this app. Google news has the same stuff for FREE!!,
"Shockingly insular, no sections about neighbors Mexico or Canada. The World gets one heading and all other countries apart from US get lumped together, appalling!",
"I am having lots of login issues on my home computer. The account is through Google Play and is fine on my phone, but I cannot change my home computer to the login info that my phone uses. Any ideas out there? My home computer says my old account is disabled and says my free articles are used up for the month. What to do?",
"Great app, a fully fine tuned dark mode would be all its missing.",
It's great to be able to access this level of journalism outside of New York. The app is easy to use.,
Very thorough and informative! part of my daily news read.,

To difficult to figure out how to cancel subscription! Otherwise good app.,

I can no longer rotate my screen to landscape mode on either Android or Apple,
"After 8/23/19 update, widget for NYT has disappeared on my Note 9. Please fix!",
Constantly crashing on me in the middle of trying to read news articles,
It would be even better if it had a dark mode option. Even a night mode.,
Excellent news and information with informed opinions and a variety of viewpoints.,
"Heavily one sided politics, like extremist. Even, anchors making fun of people with american flags. Sorry man, I just wanted some news. That stuff was way out there.",
"It says this ""version has expired, please update"" but there is no update available.",
love the reporting. the articles are well written and tell a story.,
"Great journalism, buggy app, incompetent support. Update: still.",
Great app overall. Just wish it had swatch and dark mode.,
what the hell happen? I used to love my NYT app....in this past 2 weeks it started acting up. Please fix it ASAP . Thank you.,
xlnt news source ahead of the pack. Very reliable information except on Tesla.,
Tapping a notification does not bring you to the corresponding story in the app,
"This app is a data hog. Used 500 MB reading a few articles. (Do love the content though, this review is specifically about the app itself)",
"Nice clean interface, very little ads, but it needs a dark mode",
Doesn't always work! I pay $16.00 bucks a month for the app. It should work.,
I've found The NYT app to be very infromitive I look forward to following it on my cellphone daily.,
The Android app hangs and glitches out after I start reading an article since the last update,
"Does not work period.It appears the same idiot who wrote software for the 737 max is now hard at work on the nytimes app for android, God help us !",
Nice but locks you out after a while unless you pay. Going to stick with free news apps for now,
Articles are relevant and provide in depth thought has gone into their articles.,
"I honestly enjoy reading NYT because it isn't infotainment but actual news. Honestly to be a completely neutral news source you have to be somewhat incorrect, because the truth isn't neutral. I think NYT recognizes that and is willing to throw shade at actual problems and people rather than preserving the feelings of those who support said problems/people. There isn't any compromising of values here, only the genuine hunt for the truth in the wild maelstrom of falsehoods that is American media.",
"The app doesn't work well with android technology, otherwise it's a great app.",
Thank you NYT for keeping me updated on the Little things as well as the big ones.,
When I read an article from this app it always tells me to pay for a subscription and it is very annoying and plus I don't even want to pay for a subscription I have to find a way to make this app to stop asking for me to pay for a subscription.,
"NYT is my goto resource for relevant, timely and intelligent news and commentary.",
Providing depth in coverage that mainstreams models are completely content to be without!!!!,
This app very updateable & Truely news provide and Make amazing article to read and listen News and video other many more.,
"I can't see a search function easily. If there is one, it should be easier to find.",
Good app for the news. Better offline downloads is a must for subway commute.,
Good app except the recent update now pushes an old news notification once a day.,
Keeps saying it's offline. But all of my other apps can access the internet.,
Some features are still in let's say early access but it an overall good app,
This news agency doing biased reporting in South East Asia. Its better to uninstall this useless app!!,
Exceptional reporting. NYT does there homework & fact checks. Exc editors.,
Why is the story that i click on in my notifications literally never the story i'm actually brought to in the app??,
Reliable as to fairness and accuracy. Can't ask for more from a news source.,
"for the last 2 weeks, every story just goes blank halfway thru. Don't install!!!",
The app does not work on my Lenovo chromebook--the pages don't load properly.,
simple and easy to use. important news front and center.,

"When I click on.an alert, it doesn't open to the story the alert is about.",
"I get the essential news I need from the NY Times, with none of the blather!",
Good professional reporting. Mostly neutral bias. Fair and balanced.,
NYT provides timely news and generally balanced editorial comments. It also provides freedom of expression to its readers through the Opinion columns.,
Bad company idk about the app I don't wanna read their liberal propaganda but I know they are very left biased so if you like that it's probably a decent app,
Great app and has everything I need. My recommendation is to fix the glitches in other people's comments.,
It crashes so much that I can't finish reading any articles.,
Have to log in every time I go to Google News on my Android phone. This is not acceptable.,
The NY Times offers great daily reading if you like to stay informed.,
Pay for it! Totally worth it to support unbiased news.,
"Always top notch coverage of world news, and all news that matters.",
Terrible app compared to the mobile website. Just put the website in an app already!,
I can't sit at desktop and read anything anymore; this app is perfect on my phone.,
Clicking notifications doesn't bring you to the article from the notification.......,
"The New York Times has degraded to pure, openly, subjectively biased news to the facts of violating all ethics and standards of Journalistic integrity, but even purposefully distort facts and ignore major news. You're a disgrace and your fan base will soon be gone",
Have all of a sudden made it impossible to okay daily crossword without subscribing....very disappointing,
Great journalism which is needed during these crazy times of conspiracy theorists and disbelievers of reality. People have to push back against these attacks on reality and democracy.,
Slow and precise. Wishing for some positive content.,
The best source of news one can hope for. Please suuport and subscribe.,
"Powerful resource, although finding a piece can take a little effort",
"After installing the app, I found it impossible to use without going to the playstore to open the app.",
"what difference does it make. I just assume that everything I do on the Internet is being monitored by someone, the government, the Chinese government, or, after the last major hack, a huge group of hackers.",
"Articles not available despite receiving the payment, customer service brushes me off instead of resolving the problem",
Overall happy and would love to see dark mode for night time reading,
Not exactly like reading the paper bit same great reporting with less waste.,
"The party needs to return to its principles or be replaced. If it is replaced, we need high profile leaders including those who have experienced elective office and shown character in the midst of this crisis.",
I thought you were a cool and totally useful app until i realized you just want to monetize,
Lousy. Overcharged and did not receive the full access or free subscription I paid for.,
An amazing app that should be the model for all news agencies.,
Too many editorial and opinion articles. Too many ads.,
I wish it didn't cause problems on my android phone. Constantly disconecting.,
Application showing please update there no update at play store. Using on Android mobile.,
This app is 90% about only politics! Not a reflection of the great paper itself. Sad.,
love NYT for its range and objectivity in news coverage!👍 I trust NYT for even news on India.,
It would be better if they could add dark theme..other than that the apps pretty good,
"Love the NYT, but the app could use a little stability and polish",
One of the best reads available... historically and currently.,
"great newspaper, lousy app. you have to uninstall and then reinstall to get it to update",
"When a top story doesn't have a ""Share"" option, well that says all you need to know about the App.",
The BEST newspaper in the world! NYT continues to prove their importance as a leader in media year after year.,
Not news. Merely political dogma. Disappointing for an organization who once had some semblance of balance.,
straight forward legit news with easy minimal cost. Highly recommend.,
awesome news source. the app is just fantastic. read offline. love it.,
The app is solid. NYTIMES as the news medium is solid.,
Having problems logging in. After entering credentials always takes me to sign in page.,
"The venerable NYTimes is for me, the best researched news on the planet.",
I enjoyed the depth of reporting and coverage in the digital edition of The New York Times.,
Always say it is having a latest version and I need to redownload it in order to use it...,

Easy to navigate and works with minimal internet connection.,
"It is horrible, slow, cant connect to stories, etc.",
"Great content, but sometimes the app is slow and erratic on my Moto G Power phone.",
Latest update broke the app on Galaxy note. Won't open! Fix it!,
Doesnt stay signed in and doesnt provide notifications except when i open the app,
Why do I still see ads if I'm a digital subscriber? Isn't that the whole point of giving you money so I don't have to see ads.,
Articles don't load and the support staff doesn't seem interested in doing anything about it.,
Works well except for Night Mode (which appears to be known as a problem),
Generally excellent reporting. Gives ultra-conservatives preferential treatment.,
Very disappointing app. It will go 20+ hours without updates.,
Uninstalled because it keeps opening nytimes links and only showing a blank page.,
Well designed and personalizeable. Amazing news source.,
This application is user friendly and nice to navigate your favorite topics and more.,
i've always believed the chemo (I won't use the word therapy) was a problem created to solve another problem. Genetic therapy and immunotherapy will hopefully eliminate the scourge of chemo. This article supports that notion.,
"Looking forward to seeing all the news in America, would love to visit but can't afford it. This is the next best thing",
I would rather read in a format more similar to the actual newspaper.,
The app loads extremely slow and keeps throwing error you are offline,
"Ads, in the paid version. This should be posted, I regret paying.",
Great and easy way to stay abreast of braking news .,
Please fix the puzzles. They no longer work correctly on my phone. So sad.,
I start every day with the New York Times. The app is great. It works. Every day.,
"App runs slow, after this latest update I can't load comments anymore.",
"I'm a big fan of the New York Times, and the app works smoothly. It's well designed.",
Impeccable journalism. Simply the best news source available.,
rare to come across such fresh and fine analysis. a contribution on its own. thank you!,
It's the New York Times. The website is a bit easier to navigate than the application.,
"Slow, unresponsive. Frequent crashes.",
I still get ads when I have a paid subscription. Kind of bs.,
Left leaning but excellent reporting and just plain good writing.,
A good mix of news articles covering a variety of topics both domestically and globally .,
Many thanks for outlining these key points of history and specifying references so the uninformed can dig deeper.,
"so far, so good. still an elitist, racist publication but it's not the only place I get my news.",
It's all good but not providing same subscription rate as the website says.,

new feature request:. show only articles without a reference to Trump. i want a trump free experience,
"This new upgrade lost the dark mode white on black background, ideal for tab trading in bed in low light. Buggy install. Professional?",
The app works so well. It has blended seamlessly into rest of android.,
The photojournalist's beautiful images grabbed me first and drew me into a compelling story of discovery and increased awareness in his homeland of Sweden.,
Retracting my statement about icons disappearing. They only did that on a couple articles.,
"Smooth and clean, easy to find articles too!",
"Only read this news content if you the truth, outstanding reporting and facts to back up their reporting.",
Terrible. No longer works properly in Chrome OS.,
"This is not news, they interpret events through their lens and then hash up garbage!",

This app needs paid subscription. But the browser version is free.,
"Terrible biased covid reporting, pushing a narrow liberal agenda instead of good science.",
"I have been using it for a month, honestly im surprised why itz so low rated . This is really an ideal news app. I love it",
"Next to a news stand in NYC, this is the place to get it. Plus there's a search function.",
"The very definition of ""gold standard"" for rock solid news reporting.",
Fairly easy to use. Always good trustworthy content.,
"Helpful look at emerging science reinforcing need for air circulation, not air entrapment.",
No nighttime reading mode. Intense white is painful to read.,
Excellent presentation and organization of the myriad of information the NYT produces daily.,
"Worked well briefly, then updated and it's back to freezing constantly",
Such a poorly done app. It constantly refreshes and is just poorly made.,
Left wing news source that infamously promoted Fidel Castro's rise to power and hasn't endorsed a Republican for President since Dwight Eisenhower. I give the management some credit for trying to understand the conservative side and hiring soneone to help it do so. But unfortunately the left-wing mob culture of the staff made it impossible for this brave woman to remain with the organization and she quit.,
"there's been a nursing ""shortage"" for as long as I've been alive. a ridiculous article That's a total waste of time",
When I try log in the app sends back me to the homepage without possibility to access and use my subscription.,
The apps is just very poor. Taking forever to load. Disappointing,
"About half the time it does not work, pulls up blank screen",
You wasted so much f***ing time Just to cancel my subscription. Not like any other platforms.,
What's the point of having all of these headlines in my notifications if I can't actually read anything?,
"Absolutely worth a Times digital subscription, get your own!",
"I love the Times, but you really need to up your tech game.",
what has happened to this app? I am having a hard time accessing the articles and crossword puzzles.,
great article on experiencing travel sustainable with lots of resources to explore,
appreciate all the well written articles. smooth app. no complaints.,
NYT is not news. it's partly foreign propaganda pushed by China.,
No I do not want to provide you my email address to read free content that you are getting paid referrals for my purchases on.,
Surprisingly great; one of the few news publication apps better than their webpage,
The only news provider that I pay for. So you guys are doing a great job. Just please put in a dark theme. It's ridiculous that it's missing in this day and age.,
Easy to use and quality articles of course.,
"In depth, and well-researched articles across diverse topics! 👍",
I am changing my 5 star review to 1 star as the app is unusable for me without dark mode. I will wait 1 month before I cancel my subscription completely,
The news source I rely on most. Love reading it online!,
Thought the stories slanted. For exanple:Trump Weakens Major Conservation Law to Speed Construction Permits Could have been: Trump revises conservation law that stood in the way of speedy construction permits. See how the headline is less anti Trump. Most stories were slanted left.,
Concise yet in-depth reads...really enjoy their format w so many distractions on my plate.,
occasionally it crashes and need to be rebooted.,
A reliable source of relatively accurate journalism. In this day of right wing media falsehoods and conspiracy theories the NYT is one of my go to sources for truth and reality.,

App won't pick up links! Can't read linked articles.,
"These Weekender stories are a thoughtful break from the generally depressing ""regular"" news.",
still the single best news source in the world! The New York Times.,
Easy to access. Some of reading level may beyond some readers.,
Good app but every article should mention date and time published.,
"All the news that's fit to print. Exposes the lies, misinformation and deceit.",
Subscribed to NYT installed this app but cannot connect to my account.,

This is an extremely important piece of writing that everyone should read. Very insightful!,
"poor download and login issues Issues continue with abilitymto click through on articles after authorized login shows ""digital subscriner""",
Timely and generally accurate reporting complemented by well-argued opinions.,
Night mode gone with latest release. Blinding! Removing app.,
"Great portal to the digital content! Top notch journalists, reporting, quality of work, and integrity of purpose. (Pixel 4a 5G)",
The app itself is beautiful but the periodical itself has fallen mightily.,
Downloading this app was the worst decision I ever made it immediately gave my phone a virus and after that I could not even use the app due to corrupted software and tracking systems be warned I'm sure it's a Russian robot troll app trying to convince you to vote for trump and change your vote,
"i can count on thorough, factual information and news.",
Love the articles and crosswords. Spelling bee is awesome!,
Everything is behind a paywall. I can find same or better for free. No thanks!,
Excellent app. It is not affordable for many of us on fixed incomes.,
Slow or no link to articles from home page since last app update.,
the Android app has scrolling issues making it very annoying to use.,
The article was a little bit sad but also made me want to be braver and better.,
I consider the NYT a reliable source of news and it consistently introduces me to writers who challenge my thinking.,
Your new format is brilliant and after two decades I'm going to subscribe again.,
"A wonderful source of information in all areas finished with a crossword, tiles or suduko.",
I love this application. It keeps me well informed and I don't see fake news.,
"This app transfers knowledge, facts with great accuracy and objectivity.",
The broadest and most well researched journalism in the United States.,
Huge fan of the content but the load times in this app are infuriating.,
"Well-written & informative, keeps me up to date on ""reality"" outside my nest!",
"Keeps crashing, won't even start up on my Samsung tablet.",
App has gotten a lot slower over the years. Especially any topical section like COVID,
Newest update made dark mode disappear. Please bring it back. Thanks.,
"Not useful after exceeding ridiculously low ""free monthly articles limit"".",
wish it was easy to turn off email notifications and just get app notifications,
Where has the widget gone? I am using the app for android and woke up today and realised the widget had disappeared. Please bring it back!!!,
Article selection from top stories stopped working with this update on my android phone,
"excellent read, analogies and depth of information !!",
NYT is the best newspaper in the world! The app is awesome.,
"great publication, but the app is a bit glitchy at times.",
App change from a few months a ago is really bad. Ending my subscription.,
6/1 continually must uninstall and reinstall this app in order to get the latest update it is just really a nuisance,
The app crashes any time I use any interactive map or the the puzzles,
great to see especially for those who cannot afford to be physically present. WOW!!,
"Rarely any issues, all issues were quickly resolved by calling support.",
the app closes without warning or reason. I have a valid subscription--don't know why.,
"Fantastic newspaper, and the app is so convenient.",
App keeps reloading story I am trying to read. Latest version.,
Quality journalism and a great app to keep updated just intime...,
The few times I could read an article was ok. Not paying for more.,
"very good read...editorials, always good for discussion with others.",
"Article doesn't load, and then freezes halfway through..",
Factual information tastefully presented is what NY Times is!! Love reading them!,
Love the access to such a variety of stories & voices.,
"Despite having a paid subscription, there are still consumer advertisements.",
Daily read. One of the few news apps worth the subscription.,
"As an international reader, love it for the US news and specifically the OpEd selections.",
"Articles are good but comments do not load, also stutters when scrolling.",
"Why does the Android/Google version not have the ""play"" section like in the iPhone version. Also why does the NYT GAMES app for Android NOT have the ""Red letter"" game??",
Too many emails in a given day. I wish you could opt for a daily summary.,
Push notifications never take you to the article they mention.,
"An article that clearly and concisely defines a young ""wanna be"" demogogue.",
Great read always. Trustworthy news. Intelligent journalism. Please please get rid of that orange fool in your white house.,
"Thanks for ruining world cup games that I recorded with you ""breaking news"" notifications. Uninstalled and unsubscribed",
NY Times the premire source for news. Can't get along without it.,
Awaful app which show you half of the story. Don't trust this newpaper anymore. I have canceled my subscription,
Starts flashing black boxes and makes articles impossible to read after 5 mins,
Like water & air... An absolute necessity in today's troubled times.,
"Keeps freezing/crashing, also now returns to top of front page when you go back from an article",
"Poor. Cannot login using my tablet, just crashes. Why am I still a subscriber?",
Terrible...just get a spinning icon when I try to open an article,
"hate it. if I'm out of town and want to read the times, I don't want apps.",
This news site has put through so many blatantly biased stories that it's not even funny.,
I have been a subscriber for many years and now am locked out of the online edition...no help after I emailed and called..,
Making it artificially complicated to cancel a subscription is not 2020 and a complete no-go.,
"There is nothing bettet than great, accurate and insigjtful news.",
The paper of record now just runs copy marketing the state department and pentogon hawks worst ideas like they did in 2003 during the run up to the invasion of Iraq. You are less informed after reading news from the NYT.,
"Having lifted weights my whole life largely because it can be done alone I have suffered the usual BS about just being a dumb guy, articles such as this put lifting in context. Screw being a guy, this can be understood interestingly, as this article suggests.",
Passionate but balanced and thoughtful news coverage.,
Slower than ever. Has lost its clean feel. Too busy.,
Easy to share and nice big bold print easy to read.,
"Great information, well written and excellent clarity.",
Truly fantastic writing and reporting. App works great!,
love reading the articles and finding out is happening in the world from here.,
Breaking news are no longer breaking news. Breaking news for everything......,
Uses too much power. Have to reboot to clear it.,
Articles don't always scroll. Insane that a business this large has such a buggy app!,
Will not update any more than 97% and is also giving me Spanish. Some update. Nice glitch,
The app regularly opens the wrong article when trying to open updates.,
"Enjoy reading NY Times, it gives me the news with a little slant to the left.",
This app is very buggy and annoying. Content is great.,
"App not user friendly on Laptop No mention what to type in ""Meeting Information"" Also while installing asking for URL. No options given Must make it user friendly",
Wash Post provides better coverage. But I like having both.,
Love NY Times! It keeps me in the know about just about everything going on around the world.,
"Paid for, but able to access the dailey crossword puzzle without additional subscription",
Ads are too distracting to read articles. What did I pay for?,
Concise n accurate reporting. Love the content. Non partisan content.,
Does not update news frequently enough sometimes as long as 18 hrs between updates,
"Very informative and very indepth articles, I enjoy it a great deal",
Fails to show articles. Links from front page just refresh and go nowhere,
Horrible! I have a subscription and can't see any of the articles. Waste of money.,
Edit: I am clicking through from the mobile website to tell the NYT that I NEVER WANT TO READ IT IN THE APP.,
"Simply one of the two best daily newspapers in the world, period!",
The NYT has the indepth coverage that helps explain the world and keep me informed.,
August 27 update broke the app. Doesnt open news stories anymore.,
wonderful and well researched news. I hoghly recommend getting a subscription,
It closes itself whenever it wants. This is so frustrating.,
I want to see real news this app doesn't support blm and is full of racism. I would rate this a 0 but that isn't an option,
"Bad writing, bad opinion pieces, elitist trash. Save your money and use a free news app instead.",
The best damn news app from the best journalists in the world!,
Worst app and worst subscription fexibility. The website and app has too many bugs.,
Often doesn't launch properly. Blank screen.,
"How do I uninstall this app? I hit the uninstall button, but it did not uninstall and the uninstall button has been replaced with an update button.",
amazing journalism. week written opinion pieces. the app itself works as expected.,
Will the notifications *ever* redirect to the correct article? Been broken for at least a year.,
"very informative, easy to understand, friendly ui, it's great",
On reading the reviews it's very unfair to show any ads at all when public is paying monthly installments. Plus me I don't know about you's but Anything said by media has got to be a lie. I wouldn't pay 1 cent for a lifetime subscription and I think Donald Trump thinks the same.,
Usuallt does not run. Have complained no action. Going to stop subscription,
"The search button should be on every tab, not just the sections tab.",
"Informative and fair, not fake news. Requires a subscription",
It's really cool cause it have interesting articles and topics to read about,
Break news notifications should be breaking news. Not actors being involved in more drama,
"The app is ok, but the newspaper has become increasingly radicalized in a way that becomes completely toxic.",
"Good app, has everything you need in news and current events",
"Exceptional journalism, beautiful writing, and reasonable politics.",
The New York Times has the most amazing articles!,
Great journalism. I'm captivated by your articles.,
excellent at providing accurate news and easy to use,
All the fake news and propaganda you could ever want if the app would work right,
I wish other news sources could be as articulate and informative as NYT.,
"Very good app. But would like a ""front page"" feature.",
I am from india....and i find most of the stories published about india in this newspaper as fake and misleading....their repoteres seems to be biased against india....,
Superb analysis of Trump and the republican party. Essential reading for all interested in how history informs the present.,
"Used to rate it 5 stars, but they discontinued the headline widget.",
"Love this app, but recent update ruined the Vertex game. Can't scroll and it keeps kicking me out.",
I trust this source and appreciate the breaking news updates.,
Very biased network. Sickening. Would prefer a better balance people deserve to know. Disgraceful,
"Tech workers trying to unionize had their proposal shot down by NYT execs. NYT had to be forced by the courts to allow an election to go through. While articles are posted about wage stagnation, economic inequality, and the slide of the working class into the abyss, the executives readily fight against an improvement of the material conditions of the working class in their employ. Also, the inability to login through the app and using an email then email plus password login is irritating.",
It's Fantastic to read the NYTs and not even get out of bed.,
Need a dark mode on the app. Too much eyestrain at night.,
It shows expired version after download but no update displays in playstore.,
"Affordable, reliable good reads at all times.",
not worth installing. their reporting standard too weak compared to others. too much biasdness and distraction.,
Great writers and many perspectives to give the reader a 360 degree view.,
presents useful information about looking at inflation.,
"it's freeing, and elevating, to read the NYTimes.",
It us such a nice app. And NY times is like the best newspaper there is in this world,
Always a good source for quality journalism.,
"Topic is timely, objectively presented and covered thoroughly.",
"Basically just propaganda, I can't read their stuff without cringing all the time.",
"It has been so refreshing to read honest, intelligent, and responsible reporting. In this day and age of misinformation, the New York Times provides a place to be properly informed.",

Not real news. Alot of lies. Your better having no news then these lies. I would put a negative star if I could. NYT has been a dumpster of nonsense since atleast 2000s and regressive worse day after day.,
"I love the way NYT tell the stories, with a professional and detailed explanation",
"Giving a one star rating after getting fake news (data mislead) I analysed many times what's goes wrong with this news agency? please stop spreading fake news at international level because nowadays people are from the world ""especially from india"" are getting smarter to dectect how things goes with digital media.",
"Reading the Times is like eating an entire meal, includes appetizers and dessert.",
Quality comes at price. Subscribe to get unparallelled news content.,
No 5 stars until they bring night mode back to the app. WAPO has night mode...,
In depth reporting. Well reasoned presentation of relevant current news events.,
"NYT bullying subscription customers to install their app for their own interest, making it impossible to navigate in browser. Despicable behaviour. Shame on you.",

Doesn't recognize my subscription. Can't find it on my phone and can't open it from here.,

News doesn't update.. The Guardian is much better.,
"Love the Times. Also the app, it works like it's supposed to.",

How difficult is it to roll out a scroll bar? I am tired of not knowing how long an article is going to be.,

Rather nice app. Wish it had a dark mode like The Guardian though.,
I really like the Times. Articles are so interesting.,
Bring back the widget. Will not be renewing my subscription without it.,
Suspending my subscription in solidarity with the writers until there is a good contract.,
"Notifications just open the app, not the article",
All they post is sensational headlines to rile up Patriots. Problem is they are half truths and no one wants to pay them for opinions. We have our own opinions. We don't need yours.,
Biased opinionated news. Can never get the straight or honest story. I would give 0 Stars if it were possible.,
Keeps crashing and my requests for help are ignored.,
So easy to navigate & find the news I want.,

"This was a very insightful article. The research bears out the truth, America was established on racism and we are still reaping consequences because of it. However, I am happy to see the author point out that more and more people are multiracial and we need to get past our past. So, it is my hope that one day those that are racist will stop denying it, atone, repent; and, we can have truly one Nation under God, Indisvisble, with Liberty and Justice for ALL!",

exclusive informative articles needed more than ever.,
I have to look up a lot of the words they use and that helps me get smarter.,
"wish i could change plans within the app instead of calling, otherwise great app",
"Did you publish Bitcoin Hunter related any news.? I have seen they made a news this newspaper also published there news. I want to know, is it fake or not.??",

"Horrible app, huge bias and a lot of inaccurate / fake news",
"love getting highlights, with opinions to immideately dive deeper.",
Dr. Miller has brilliantly brought words to a mystery all of confront from time to time and some of us put our hands on every day. I have worked in palliative medicine for 25 + years and recognize the immense gift of being aware of the finiteness of this one life. Thank you for your beautiful exploration of dying and death.,
Far too many ads ruin the flow of stories.,

Time to bring back darkness mode. What excuse could there possibly have been for removing it? Let's go.,
All the required news stories with great content,
"Decent app, but dark mode seems to be gone again.",
A great tool to access the Times on Android.,
consistently genuine old school investigative journalism that I can count on...,
"This app doesn't suit international readers. Today section is crowded with US political news, atleast give an option to international readers to either remove ""Today"" section from app or just have an international edition for international readers, FT and Bloomberg have intl editions, Why not nytimes?",
The fake news organization to which all other fake news organizations are measured.,
My goto access to American politics and news. Thoughtful journalism and considered opinion pieces. What's not to like?,
support our free and independent press.,
The website keeps spamming me to install the app. I do not want the app so stop spamming me,
"I love this app, and the newspaper is fantastic.",
App keeps closing. Very frustrating.,
"Times change within 24 hour PERIOD! So finding a reliable sources that help us understand Life. Well that is what Life Time Of Events Of New York Timesheets Do Best. Thank you Sincerely , O",
"Irony, NYTimes stands for democracy and freedom of speech but won't let even subscribers comment on articles, exchange views from other parents especially when the articles are for/by companies to push their propaganda. Rarely even moderated comments are deleted immediately later. Sad, this is coming from NYTimes.",
Incredible app from one of the greatest newspapers in the world.,
always a reliable source for news. I love the NYT,
Excellent source of reliable information that I need!!!,
"I'm sorry, but I subscribe to the NY Times exclusively for the NYT Cooking app.",
"What a fantastic, tragic, engrossing article!",
Preferably to read in browser in my opinion on a PC or tablet.,
Truthful news is a relief; New York Times holds the Left and the Right accountable.,

going to use some of these ideas next time grandkids visit.,

"I like the Times. I pay for it. But while I don't think it's the Enemy of the People (far from it), I do believe it's made it its mission to be the Enemy of Trump, which carries its own issues. I wish the reporting would be more objective; it's hard to give credence to a source who never shows the president in a non-negative light. It's like, obviously F Trump, but don't tell me every story through only that perspective. The WaPo is better about this.",
it stopped working. on both my Samsung and on my iPad.,
This version broke the mini puzzle. The keyboard is half displayed.,
Now it doesn't even open news to read the headlines without payment wall.,
The notifications never go to right article.,
Most sophisticated and stable news app around!,
The Best. The one and only subscription (news) that I pay for.,
excellent content and easy to navigate,
Unbiased fact based news on an international scale.,
Articles will not open; clicking links only refreshes a page. Content ac cessibility has gone way down. Times editorial bent now seems more supportive of wrongdoers in government than of those who are imperiling their lives to reveal the corruption and criminality of the current administration.,
Can't find how to unsubscribe easily. Had to call. Caveat emptor.,
a great newspaper that I read daily for US news. an institution.,
Excellence is the word to mention the effort put in this newspaper,
Love supporting the NYT for their factual journalism and amazing reporting.,

I value the reliably balanced perspective from outside my own country.,

Pathetic. You guys are cheating customers. I paid the amount but still there's no subscription. Cheats,
Notifications change when you click the drop down,

"For the love of reading, dark mode please!",
It is not allowing me to purchase a subscription. Please resolve this issue at the earliest.,
Layout is nice. Enjoy news stories.,
"Surprisingly untruthful, malicious, smearing newslet - Just check their latest article regarding Jordan Peterson and their utter misrepresentation of him. Unfortunately for the NY Times, J. Peterson recorded and released the interview on his Youtube channel, thereby shedding light on the quagmire that is journalism nowadays. Deplorable. You may as well read a random gossip magazine.",
The editing is amazing. CAREFULL : It's addicting.,
"Not able to use the app, kept turned into beta version.",
Trusted news source. Easy to use app.,
"there are people with great, concrete ideas for the way out of the problems the pandemic has exposed.",
It limits me to the number of articles I can read. Certainly not worth the price.,

Very nice to have the NY Times especially the columnists,
"Even if you pay, there's still going to be ads on the homescreen",

Ads constantly cause the app to crash,
This review is about David Brooks' latest column about wisdom. It is his considered and informative views about what wisdom is and how receiving it has helped him better understand it. Really good stuff!,
"Recently, has to be reinstalled every day! What an embarassment!",
It was going very slow and always closed every time,
"I loved it but when I opened my Account, I can't get in again. How aggravating this is. But, even God can't arrange stupid minds when people control their minds because of greed.",
Continues to be the best daily newspaper in the US.,
I love 💘 reading this paper. its like a Pulitzer Prize winning rag!,
Excellent analysis and archives from the 1800s. Just wow!,
Good but awkward to read and needs dark mode!,
Super easy to navigate so much variety,
I pay for a full subscription and I can't access articles...,
What happened to dark mode? It's gone and this app is eye searing without it..,
"I came to know Coach Thompson from the North - New England, Providence, Rhode Island specifically. Coach Thompson was the center (literally) of adoration for fans of Providence College's basketball team, the Friars. This tribute from an admiring fan in Mississippi of Coach Thompson, who was touched and inspired from a young age as I was (I moved to DC in '72), bookends the love we African American had for Coach.",
"nice staff, good to great reads, a little left but o well",
"I find it highly unethical to have to pay to read important breaking news regarding the threat to democracy. Even when logging in to read a ""free article"" it still makes me pay! Like I said, this is highly unethical and hell should be raised for this.",
NY Times blocks me with a subscription offer even though I am already subscribed.,
Quick easily accessed news at your Fingertips!,
good use..thanks,
The coverage is exceptional and detailed with in depth analysis.,
"From burying and lying about the Hunter Biden laptop story as Russian disinformation, to unsubstantiated reports from the Ukraine war, to its historical refusing to cover the Holocaust, this news source is very well done, but unfortunately, Not to be trusted.",
greatest source of facts and fascinating news for 50 years of my life...,

"best source for information also intertainment,",
"Glitchy, and the crosswords don't open properly",
There is nothing like the times Very thrust worthy !!! Awesome,
The app would greatly benefit from more journalism and less simping for billionaires.,
Ending up uninstalling since links will not open from Facebook.,
Gracias a Dios por el New York Times!! Wonderful to have a news source we can trust even if not everyone agrees.....better to be well informed than to be in the dark about issues impacting our communities.,
Thank heavens there is a NY Times ! I would go completely mad without it !,
Great indepth articles. Really outstanding journalism,
Its a scam if you are trying to Downlod a video game. They told me I could downlod FORTNITE on android but no that's not true.,
well-written articles. my favorite news source!,
I was wondering what payment types the NY times accepts? I'm not sure if I have the right accounts,
"App written / dev by a child. Opens to inform me there is a new version, cripples itself, only to force land you on current version loop.",
Its soo teaching updating news n information. Loves it,
Ads slow down scrolling and make everything sluggish,
spelling bee does not check off many the works I have played that are on their list of acceptable words,
"The greatest news source there is, hands down.",
"The best, the authority on journalism.",
Even though I am paid through November this app is insisting that I should pay again. It will not give me an opportunity to prove by logging in.,
NYT is more iPhone friendly than it is to Android users.,
Comprehensive journalism. Great writers!,

You don't need to put cookies on my phone. Your Covid articles come with too many strings attached.,
"Exceptional reporting, well written articles.",
It gives you the news. Haven't seen any bugs as of yet,
Interesting informative articles about real world events. Definitely worth the time spent reading. Nicholas Kristof's expose on Pornhub has made an immediate difference in limiting the illegal content and forcing the issue of accountability for the owners of the site. None of this would have been possible without his article and it has changed society for the better.,
the best. all the news fit to print!,
A vast expense of information at your fingertips - all that's up to you is to CHOOSE... Two thumbs up,
decent journalism and user friendly app.,
A great paper with real journalists who work very hard to distill the actual truth.,
Betterment of Photos in a galleria would be justifying arrangement just it so happens downtown in MANHATTAN in CHELSEA Town where we was born and raised around there...🗽🚌 The life and timesheet of NEW YORK varies every hour on the hour around the clock in which case that is always ticking 🕗!! Thanks GOD😇 I will be Speaking in references of associations to (me-Girlfriend* PEARL RENEE SPRINGS/& (Boyfriend* KRILL.M.THORTON in respected currencies to the streets & infrastructures!way out there #$$@%,
They make it too difficult to cancel. You have to CALL!,
You pay $35 a month for a subscription and you're still subjected to ads.,
Giving an upgrade to latest version error inspite of having the latest version.,
Don't even try and cancel subscription. Poor customer service.,
No scroll bar and fullscreens articles for no reason,
"Can't log in on a Huawei P30 Pro, so my subscription has become useless....",
been reading since 1980s. wish I could get a paper version in my hands here in China.,
"I love how the app looks 🙃, def my news 🗞️ all day long .",

hard to navigate and find articles,
Just getting to know the NYT and enjoying every bit of read,
Great app. Everything worked just fine and I had no issues,
Always interesting and factual stories.,
It's one of the mosy biased and anti India news organization. i hope they mend their ways before its too late. 😡,
Excellent writing and and breadth of topics marred by bias.,
Well researched articles on multiple topics throughout the day.,
Impossible to delete this app from the Samsung note devices!!!!,
"What has happened to widget? It just vanished! Bring it back, please.",
The New York times shut my account down because i support Bernie Sanders and that im deplorable and asked me to support Elizabeth warren-- i can't do that so im un-installing APP,
"what great content, & visuals. thank you.",
App runs well and has easy interface,
chrome web app much better. droid app freezes on 10% of articles,
"Needs tabs, ways to open links without losing spots",
I wish there was a setting g so it looked like the actual newspaper. Is it there and I just don't see it?,
Way too buggy and unreliable.,
"Thank you, NYT, for reporting the news.",
"Brilliant, heart felt, articulate. inspiring.",
Good article. Means a lot of work. Which is why we're accepting applications now for the Indigenous Land Stewardship program at Native Education College in Vancouver @nec_vancouver.,
Nothing more than a marketing attempt to sell subscriptions to the Times.,
"very timely, before it's broadcast in the news in my area.",
The update broke it. Now it always says I'm offline. I'd give this zero if I could.,
It's not updated automatically. Every time I have to reinstall,
Spelling Bee is at the top of my to-do list every morning!,
like the human interest stories,
the best news source,
Great journalism but the app needs a dark mode,
part of my every-morning routine; almost better than coffee-- actually is better than some coffee,
"NYT is my first stop for movie reviews. James Maguire Deer Isle, ME",
great news paper.,
"My ""go to"" for news, business, finance, real estate,... you name it.",
Constantly refreshing and freezes several times a day,
Full of fake news and dribble. Came preloaded on my tablet. Worth what it cost - 0.,
I appreciative the unbiased reporting.,
Seems a good use of $$. The proof is in the pudding....,
I deeply love this app,
Amazing news source but app Doesn't have a dark mode.,
"Keeps reporting on capitol rioters like they aren't criminals. If someone is shot while committing a federal crime, they shouldn't try to give them sympathy points. Needs more diverse and compentent journalism.",
Every time I click on this stupid app it always asks me to sign in when I've already signed in. Freaking morons,
"App is very slow, harder to use than the website",
Dark mode please! It's 2022. Also listen to this article function would be great,
Good detailed articles but they lean left often.,
"Grew up with it, always dependable accurate reporting",
NYT is factually accurate and up to the minute.,
I love the range of articles. I always learn something new.,
Fairly moderate news. I appreciate the free crisis coverage.,
"When I tell you this is the worst customer service and dishonest company I have dealt with...not an exaggeration. They make you call to cancel and wait on hold for 50 min to tell you they canceled, don't believe them. They charged me for MONTHS after AND when I called for a refund they claimed my account was on hold and they would ""decide"" if I could get 4$ back. Other customers and I work too hard for our money. This is fraud and I will fight for the hundreds I was charged.",
Constantly spams phone with article headlines.,
"No dark mode in 2022 is befuddling, especially considering they used to have it. Downgrade.",
"Paywalled, useless app with biased, arrogant, and pseudo-intellectual articles.",
I am happy with my New York Times subscription it gives me a lot of good information,
Excellent reporting of both world and national news.,
Got a new phone. It doesn't recognize it. Can't read the articles.,
The New York Times is very Excellent App.,
Always surprising and very good journalism,
"6am Sunday I get the message that the app was updated 14 hours ago...NOT NOW...why is it ""selling"" old news?",
Makes reading the daily paper easy.,
technically and editorially unable to grow.,
"Not well done, prefer using browser",
Excellent source of news! Would give it 10 stars if I could.,
The app won't let me open any article to read and I am a subscriber!,
I really enjoy my daily updates from the New York Times.,
Articles are cut off after a few screenfuls.,
excellent functional app for a world class news source,
One the best News App interfaces I use.,
the greatest newspaper ever in print. all the news that's worth printing. AAA+++ 35 YEAR SUBSCRIBER,
Why would you remove dark mode without having a replacement ready? What a dumb decision.,
Can't open any articles with latest update,
No refund when trying to cancel immediately after sneaky price hike,
"it's obvious why I found you a vital source of info...painfully informed, but glad to have the truth.",
Outstanding excellence in journalism.,
Extremely informational and documents a wide range of ideals and thematics that build on the diversity of this world in a meticulous manner that increases awareness of detrimental issues.,

Too much bias. I downloaded AP news instead.,
Great articles! Thanks for keeping us informed!,
Outstanding graphics integration.,
The app seamlessly replaces it's newspaper equivalent.,
"The reporting shows the good, bad, and the ugly of the plight of ordinary people. we in America take for granted a free press.",
"I don't really think there's a whole lot of easy solutions to the problems created by Facebook and other social media. But first, we need to take away legal protection for Facebook. They must be legally accountable for lies and harm on their platform. For example, they should have to pay lifetime salaries for people who worked with Dominion voting systems, and now have lost their jobs. Next, let's make sure people control and own their personal data.",
hangs when scrolling. becoming unstable,
"I am paying the $4.00 per month for access, but I continue to have limited access.",
Bring back dark mode! My eyes are burning! NYT is great other than that.,
I can't write a review on the new york times how can you do it they are the best there's no one else. Excellent,
"up to date, unbiased and affordable",
I just think this is such a balanced and thoughtful take on what's happening. I'm insulted that it has been criticized. Keep it up. Real news. Real journalism. Real integrity. Real intellectual. Real accessibility. Love it.,

"GREAT APP! SO MUCH ""STUFF"" TO READ, VIEW, DISCOVER, ETC. 👍",
"Hard to find unbiased reporting with real facts, NY Times is one of those you can bank on.",
Every time they send an add about a paid account. Unistalling,
Keeps crashing. If I can get it to work I will review again.,
"Installed, chewed up a huge chunk of battery in half an hour, uninstalled",
Remains the undisputed source of in-depth journalism.,
New York times is the Best ever news along with cnn I think it's more details about what you should talk about,
ship. Left leaning rag. Journalism in this country doesn't exist anywhere. Way too political.,
Did you guys seriously delete night mode? We do not want to read off of blaring white screens all of the time.,
"So hard to just read, so many passwords so ma y logins",
Probably among the best newspapers. Has a bit liberal tilt,
Good reporting but very biased to the left.,

In-depth reporting and opinion.,
"Excelled coverage, great navigation... Complements daily paper",
"They make it unreasonably hard to unsubscribe, took almost half an hour.",
"Highly partison and bias based writing. Can't trust it as ""news"" since it's filled with obvious liberal commentary opinions.",
The Times has always been a first class news source.,
"app is great overall, but why no dark theme? my eyes are burning...",
"Great News, keeps me up to date on all the latest. Just the way I like it. Thank you.",
I have noticed most of their news articles are one sided and misleading full of cr#p.. they use their platform to spread hatred & false accusations against Pro-Palestine activists & whoever has different political views than The New York Times political views. This is why I give 1 star ratings because they post one sided misleading news articles in favours of their own political views,
Terrible app and even worse source of news. The national enquirer has more integrity than nyt nowadays.,
Can not work properly in my phone so I would really command to everyone use this fake app 😡😡😡😠😡,
"The app is ok, but there really needs to be a dark mode.",

It had excellent widgets that have been removed...bring them back,
Great news app with tailored push notifications,
"Good paper, excellent articles, vids & games too",
I don't have time to wait forever and a day for an article to load.,
The best newspaper in the US. It is that simple.,
Accurate information. Intuitive website.,
Very easy to use. Great content,
Well designed and navigatable.,
A great and essential paper.... Real Citizens have an ABSOLUTE responsibility to stay informed. And that means they have a responsibility to read the NYT.,
Crashes every minute or two with no apparent reason,

No gas or guns have been deployed, for the record.",
always shows an error making it unaccesible,
"Real news, well-researched and well-written.",
Up to date researched news. Love the Times!,
I love the NY TIMES except for your portraying certain topics such as gender spectrum ideology without any scientific evidence or even scrutiny as the truth leading to too much confirmation bias. Theres also a fair amount of lack of coverage of income inequality. But I can't stop being a subscriber because of your portrayals of mass shooting and violence and pornography as the root of the deepest evils of our time. I hope your journalists editors can find a way to influence lawmakers positively,

THE resource for current and historical need and information,
Have to uninstall/reinstall constantly just to get it to update.,
"Excellent article as a reminder of how we got to where we are today. The blueprint of civil rights strategy and tactics was created in 1948 at the Democratic convention, further detailed in 1965 and now being torn down by the Supreme Court. My Virginia is taking steps backwards so this book is a must read for teachers, church and community leaders who should lobby their elected officials about this hard fought history of social justice and appeal to them to uphold its benefits for citizens.",
A great New York story.,
The world's newspaper,
A superbly written account,
Mounting evidence of possible intelligence...,
actually a great app- not just great news source.,
Simon Romero is my favorite NYT journalist,
Misleading at best,
one of my favorite biographies,
I am tired of subscribing to services that can't let you share with a spouse unless you  give them your login info.  Wake up and come into today's tech world for goodness sake.,

Looks like a very useful article. I saved it for reference,
good app to keep abreast of latest and insightful news,
vehicle for unwanted disruptive ads and not for information- great shame,
Great on the breaking news. Love it!,
Often mere propaganda. High biased content.,
Great journalism that I wish I could afford.,
The NYT is journalism at its best.,
Such a sad story of a woman addicted to evil. It shows the Catholic Church's continuing hold on the minds of the people it enslaved.,

Most of the news needs payment to read.,
Amazing photography in a beautiful country. Swedes love nature.,

Consorting with the government To hide the truth. Who do you think you are? Will never believe anything you say or print ever again. New York scumpet.,
I love the Times!,
I will always keep The Times.,
Best paper in the world,
"Once five star, now four plus, trailing the insurgent and currently incomparable Washington Post, largely due to the failure of journalistic control and judgmental lapses.",

They are no longer a press company than a political party. Sad days. I miss them decades ago.,
Have made two or three attempts to unsubscribe. Impossible to unsubscribe.,
Very good effort in journalism.,

Needs a dark mode.. Hard to read with white background,
articles don't load 50% of the time,
Reliable news source to depend on!,
"Caroline Williams is indeed a poet, and her TIMES piece about being the child of rape/and of the southern culture that is with us still is tremendously powerful! I thank her for it; i thank the paper for publishing it and furthering the education of this middle-class jewish woman whose tribe has also tried to articulate a very different yet just as horrendous heritage. I would like to read more of her work and i congratulate the TIMES for including it. E.Roshevsky, New Hartford NY",
I give four star not a five Because so to much buffering while Studing the article Although my net contain 4G power!!!!,
"Phenomenal analysis by Tim Snyder. In the interests of his own self-aggrandizement, and taking advantage of weak points in our system never visible given an implicit respect for deep-rooted norms, Trump has opened up a very dark portal in American politics. If it is not closed, itcould take us down the road to fascism. Without bold action in the next couple of years, by way of civic education and structural reform, our democracy will truly be imperiled. Let's hope it's not already too late",
Well organized by the the best news stories.,
"This app don't check any fact about india. Totally fake app, master of propaganda",

I simply cannot continue to support a paper that show such bias as has been apparent in the Depp-Heard trial these past two months.,
The best! Simply the best source for news.,
I love the New York Times and are very inexpensive,
Reason it gets 1 star is you are limited to thr amount of articles you can read a day without paying for a subscription You have to be out of your mind in this day and age to ask people to pay for news when there are so many free sources of news around Will be uninstalling,
Biased paper always spreads half truth and creates confusions among readers,
Prefer reading news then listening to TV news,

"For $4/month, the digital NYT has exceeded my expectations. Suggested content based on my reading habits in the ""For You"" section is excellent. The multimedia articles - particularly the video examinations of the Jan. 6th insurrection and the live and summary coverage of Derek Chauvin's trial for the murder of George Floyd - were nothing short of excellent. If you'd told me I'd happily pay for the NYT before 2020, I'd have yelled ""FAKE NEWS!"" But here we are.",

Yes it was really help full data,
rock solid source of information. no drama.,
the app-not great. the news is though,
"As with many topics, creating some room for conversation.",
Rarely see News on TV I have not already seen on App.,
"The Times is a lonely, venerable survivor in our tattered, corrupted U.S. journalism ....",
Best Newspaper has also the best App!,
Thank you for this much needed review of where the truth about all this really is.,
Shows advertisements even though I am a subscriber. Sad.,
The only news that's fit to read!,
"Always informative, always enriching",
Automatically getting logged out of the app every day,
"love this app, so easy to navigate.",
The app is the best if you want to learn what is happening outside your country,
Times app is a pleasure to use. thanks,
"The bias is just too much. I understand you didn't like Trump, and for the most part neither did I. This unspoken new rule that we can't question or criticize anything that democratic leaders do because God Forbid it gives the Republicans the upper hands is destroying this country. We need the press to be tough and the New York Times is not that.",
Reading New York Times online is an excellent experience.,
"Fast connection, important news, entertainment",
Great app for getting your daily news!!,
Crashes frequently on my phone.,
BEWARE IF YOU PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION IN THE APP AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BOTH THE NYT AND GOOGLE DENIES ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU ARE LEFT WITH AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE ( LOSS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION). WILL THE NYT RESPOND TO THIS REVIEW? THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THE OTHER REVIEWS POSTED HERE WITH THE SAME ISSUE.,
App freezes and wont load articles,
NY Times is my favorite international news source.,
"Retired app, doesn't work any longer. Why still here???",
Excellence in journalism!,
"balanced, well informed, lucid",
Is there any way to get this app off my device? It is like having constant spam! HELP!,
Well written and exceptionally moving and as only a first hand account from one who served can be.,
No one who watches this could claim the riot was anything but an attempt to stop and reverse the election process .,
"This thoughtful piece reflects realities in every sector of the nation, not the South alone.",
Unable to select font size,
Prompt on breaking news update.,
The best all round news app.,
"This app is made to look good, not to work properly.",
"NYT had always been partial, biased, anti India.",
"These times demand the Times. So it leans left? Where else are you going to get your news - Fox? Even Fox News itself states that its commentary anchors are entertainment. Sydney Powell's LAWYERS stated that ""No reasonable person"" would have believed the lies Sydney Powell was pushing on Fox. So if you want actual news, albeit with a liberal interpretation, the Times is crucial, and utterly irreplaceable. Get the other side from the limited coverage in the WSJ if you must.",
Bring back the night mode. My eyes will thank you...,
I love the reality based journalism!,
All the news that's fit to read online.,
Simply the best in left of centre mass media.,
Always illuminating far-off corners of our culture of which I had no previous insight,
You can't search text on articles. Is this a paper version?,
this app is my go to for current events even though it's a corporate controlled news outlet.,
Not as accessible as Huffpost but informative.,
"The article conveys a good feel of the present community however misses the history of not only wind farms in Carbon County Wyoming, but the change there in politics. Years ago, Carbon County commisioners and the Carbon County Economic board there helped get the largest US wind farm, at the time, built. The largest threat to Wyoming continues to be the lack of industry diversity and the impact of partisan politics is now a compounding factor.",
Great source of info and analysis!,
It needs a night mode. Thanks.,
"can't uninstall. ""system app""",
Night mode gone! Terrible experience.,
very one sided reporting there is no objectivity anymore,

"Every facet of your cooking or entertaining by people who know what they're doing , so you look like you do. Incredible!",
"Great content, accurate reporting.",
"excellent app, and I read great articles",
This is a solid starting point for improving the guidelines of the presidency. I'd like to hear other thoughts on this subject.,
Too slow & not fast functioning,
"This app is good, but please add a dark mode like WaPo has.",
the best place to get all your news needs,
App fails often must uninstall reintall continually.,
The NYT is great journalism.,

I just went there on my own road trip I wish I had all of this information before,
Awful. Plagued with annoying ads. Avoid.,
"After years of being a loyal follower I stopped reading the New York Times as I felt that despite their tall claims of impartial, unbiased news, they are supportive of the Israeli apartheid regime downplaying the Palestinian suffering and subtly pushing the Israeli colonial narrative.",
I can't live without the New York times,
"Outstanding articles, great Journalism",
Confident that I can trust this app and the New York times. hi o hi,
"As they say, ""all the news that's fit to print.",
"Saw some bad reviews but tried it anyways. Really enjoying it, no problems yet",
Biased newspaper that favors Israel and their propaganda. Plus their app took forever to download and it glitches. Did I mention it's a Zionist run newspaper? Hahaha,
Bought a subscription to support the excellent investigative journalism.,

What's up with the repeated update after you go back to the main page of the paper?,
"As we exit 2020, this New York Times piece captures the memory of 2020 that is most seared into my being. When ppl #Rise as a nation against hate and take a stand against #SystemicRacism change is inevitable. The year #America got #Woke like never before.",

This application applying to resource titled organizations one of which I have been apart of for over 20 years is in violation of a mix up of agendas and a mix up of priorities. Help me if you want the love and praise and the gift of ability of doing what is right.

This App is misrepresented as being free...only free for one week.,

The app doesn't keep me logged in like it's supposed to.,
Does not update the news stories done the last update 2 days ago,
Notifications open wrong article,
I hope that the app can update the dark theme!!!,
user friendly platform,
Cannot continue reading news without making an account.,
Loading times became unbearable...,
"Pushes constantly to pay. I get it, but nope.",
Great way to get an alternative perspective on the world,
Can't log in to paid subscription.,
Unhelpful subscription processes. Will not subscribe by this process again.,
"Stop with the Olympic Spoiler push notifications, are you serious right now. Smh",
This app is terrible. Full stop. The NYT should be embarrassed.,
Very good application for news,
"I like the daily ""What You Need to Know"" notification.",
My favorite site and app. I use every day.,
"Scam paid app, news should be free or at very least cost.",
Great articles. Great information 👍,
A great source for news.,
"Fake journalism and fake stories. Blot on the name of journalism, showing skewed naaratives and planting paid stories!!",

They didn't accept my password. Then I fist get the otp Nonstarter,
My #1 source for Reliable Digital News on all my Devices...,
Thank God for The New York Times and the American free press in the age of Trumpism.,
Glad it is free & informative.,
"This well researched piece documents what I do not like about the communication around this virus, causing people who are looking for excuses not to wear a mask to find it in overly conservative communication from some health professionals and the CDC that really does not follow the science.",
looks delicious and very unique,
This is a completely biased pro Israel media. The way they portray Bella Hadid and Dua Lipa for supporting of Palestine is horrible. They should be ashamed of theirselves supporting the terrorism and forceful ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by the hands of Israel.,
Good reporting & several opinion columnists are fantastically spot on.,
Really good app both on the pc and iPhone,
"It's good but even the ""for you"" section shows irrelevant stuff",
Enjoyed every bits. Thanks!,
App consistently crashes,
The most biased news network .,

It would be five stars for me if only it had dark mode!,
"As a man, Hetero, Married and a father of 2 girls I applaud this woman for her willingness to call out mysogny in all its forms. Sometimes I hate men too.",
Be daring and read it to the very end.,
"I couldn't live without it. tHank you for all the facts, opinions, news, etc. you have brought me.",
What the heck happened to dark mode? It was there before now it's gone,
Terrible. NYT has been hijacked by Socialists. Nothing but lies. I uninstalled this app & now my phone needs a bath.,

This app is hacked by intruders from enmies of the USA and ot sjould not cost one dime too look at this news period,
"I've been reading Heather Cox Richardson for months and agree with most of the commentary on her best-of-breed daily summaries of the news, which I have come to read before similar attempts by the New York Times (David Leonhardt is my second read), Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, etc. Just for the record, I am one of her male followers, and am not within 20 years of the age cohort attributed to her.",
the best ever real journalism,
great. except there is no dark mode :(,
Great journalism matters!,
Well balanced reporting. Wonderful insight.,
It is okay but they want you to subscribe to them,
"News is sold out, orientalism at its peak..B grade news",
"It's a beautiful app, works well.",
"Good analysis, Mr. Douthat. By the way, a similarly detailed deep-dive into the evidence (circumstantial yet highly suggestive) in favour of the lab leak hypothesis was published in early 2021 on the University of Hamburg website by Prof. Roland Wiesendanger, who is not a virologist, but who knows how to assess a hypothesis. Wiesendanger came to the same view as Nicholas Wade (writing for Bulletin of the Atomic Sciences, interestingly, not for NYT) and Nicholson Baker writing for New York Mag.",
Excellent.... losses that matter and don't!,
Best daily newspaper in AMERICA. Bar none,

Extremely biased news.,
Really needs a dark mode,
Great article depth and writing,
great app. great content.,
I was impressed and I got the information I needed.,
Thanks for blocking text copy,
concentrates on must know issues instead of gossip columns.,
The journal of record for the United States. Every concerned citizen should have access to it.,
At this point. How is anyone charging for their paper with so much free news.,
Beautiful metaphorical symmetry!,
"Terrible publisher. Sold their soul for price of a big mac. These aren't journalists, they're conartists. Though artist would imply they're skilled, that might be generous. Truly a dying medium and rightly so.",
"If I pay, why do I need to see ads?",
Super interesting articles.,
It has stopped working,
Great article showing how a few greedy doctors put there wallets ahead of public health. Vaccines have saved countless millions of lives with only minimal risk,

One of the best papers anywhere!,
Top notch reporting. Top notch app,
need better interface,

"objectively, this article tells it like it is.",
"when the hell will you get this garbage app out of beta and make it work properly? I pay for a NYTIMES subscrption, please make it stop sucking",
great feel good story. we need more,
Can't open articles on my older tablet,
Flawed but still US paper of record as far as I'm concerned.,
Journalism at its best,
share on Twitter button doesn't work. how can I fix it?,
"If it weren't for some of the rather questionable ""opinions"" that have been printed in the op-ed section over the last 4 years, it would have been 5 stars.",
I like the app better than reading in browser.,

Only covered UK English wards thanks.,
I have always love the New York Times and The New Yorker all things New York,
One of the few newspapers with integrity left,
Get to the bottom of things and read the real news.,
"I read the articles maintaining, different attitudes. Have you read different views in oth&",
App needs to go away. NYT will continue .,
Great read Best Newspaper in the world,
So far this app seems to be what I am looking for but I will know better once I have used it more!,
This app is a ad disguised as news stories,
"My 'For You' section does not reflect my selected preferences, at all.",
the only newspaper I read and trust.,
"So much to read, so little time",
Excellent Paper. Investigative work is superior.,
"You have to call or chat with a representative to cancel your subscription? It's not 1990, how is this acceptable",
Very predatory with the subscription demands,
"Why don't they give the dummies to the RNC which seems to have a positive affinity for dummies, even to extent of regularly running them for gov't and filling out advisory panel. My, don;t that just trump all.",
Journalism at it's best,

"it's a working app, which says a lot",
Should be required reading in every classroom in the U.S.,
I am removing this app from my phone because it's not clear if the New York Times is a Murdoch-owned property. #BoycottNewsCorp,
One of the worst news apps.,
Lots of info. No problem navigating.,
Won't load articles,
An abundance of information. Something for everyone.,
"good app, works flawlessly",
annoying app can't remove it,
Needs a dark mode option.,
"I do not recall subscribing to this. Refund, please!",
my favorite news source. news you can trust,

Why ads even after I subscribed?,
needs a search function,
"Interesting how non-traditional historians are uncovering the repression of succesful African American (and other minority group) communities that has too often been missed, glossed over, or forcefully ignored. My middle & high school Amercan History classes never mentioned African Americans having the right to vote (NJ 1776) or building highly successful business communities (""Black Wall Street"", Tulsa OK) - nor how fearful/resentful white males stole or destroyed the same (NJ-1807, Tulsa 1921)",
Informative and rational coverage of National and World affairs.,
I love touching base everyday.,
Good source of current news.,
the most biased news times,
real news with no fluff. that's why I read the NYT.,
Incredibly Well Designed app. One of my favorite new sources,
"In-depth reporting, factual journalism.",
The gold standard of news apps,
"I have been reading NYT since Mrs. Sylvester, my 8th civics class teacher, c1968 provided our class w/ free subsxriptions to this amazing reaource...I love rhe New York Times!",
Not a good app. Better to use Al Jazeera.,
"Great insight into how children, teenagers and young adults be one radicalised. This story does not concern Caleb alone, it concerns all of us: parents, teachers, friends, neighbours... We should not have to be fighting for their souls every day of our lives. But we do. We need to.",
The Times is what we rely on for the truth so vigorous reporting and accuracy is paramount for both our society behaviors and our emotional wellbeing.,
I wouldn't know what to do without it! Amazing!,
"I ALREADY PAY FOR A GODDAMN SUBSCRIPTION, STOP PESTERING ME ABOUT YOUR APP THAT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER THAN THE WEBSITE AND WHERE YOU WILL CONTINUE BOMBARDING ME WITH INTERFACE RUINING ADS - STOP",

They spread lies and sensor truth.,
Great journalist and writers,
Nothing like the NYT to stay smartly informed.,

amazing storytelling from the best newsletter in the World,
Widgets have disappeared!!!,
"Covid-19 fear mongering is not cool. Using words like onslaught.. How is this helpful or what do you consider an onslaught? I question if this is even reporting, or straight up criminal fear mongering. Tallying numbers like a count down. Every morning is like wondering if you have been nuked rather then find out actual news. Tell what's being done, rather then what's not. Report as to how and why ventilators aren't in supply? Why is the Gov saying it's they're stock pile n not the US as a whole",
Fixing always seeing,
The ONLY real newspaper! Not a tabloid!,
"A superb source of information to balance our mental diet now fed from so many sources; The NYT makes one powerful through the vaccine of knowledge, providing strong immunity from the diseases of ignorance.",

One of the better news apps.,
great tech articles,
I adore wordle. Which is challenging,
Will stay at 1 star until the return of the widget. I should have read the reviews before updating.,
Very slow to update,
I would not recommend the NYT. They lie and hide stuff. Look at the Biden laptop.,
Unacceptable that it is so difficult to stop this subscription,
Too many notifications,
No landscape orientation,
"app is great, news is sad",
I feel so ignorant about how world history is vital to a civilized society. This article is so well written and illustrates the link we have in an international community,
Good topic's. Enjoy reading...mainly on my laptop.,
eye opener and enable to know what's going on in the world..relatively grounding but not the most settling. one must be honestly aware and count their own blessings,
1 star until there is a dark mode. Ridiculous.,
Very good app for news,
Insightful and too the point,
Great to read an article about an old friend! So many great writers who frequented NYU's Institute of African American Affairs and Africana Studies Program under Manthia Diawara.,
very decent app and content,
Dark mode is not working,
"It has its faults, some egregious (vide Iraq War, Donald Trump lies), but overall, the Grey Lady is (and should be) the ""paper of record"".",
No sentient inquisitor can ever cavil at the venerable Gray Lady. I won't try. Good on ya.,
"I started following Naomi early in the pandemic when she said ""The sport will be there for us."" She is a bright. thoughtful person who I hope will continue to be a generational voice.",
Completely broken app. Not sure why anyone would use this.,
Well written news. Very refreshing,
Whose bright idea was it to remove night mode?,
Best thought-out content out there.,
"If there is a search function, it is not obvious on my app.",
Excellent data source,
"Honest, truthful, unbiased reporting.",
very nice article & reporting,
Excellent. Makes me want to stay informed.,
The best. Nothing more to say.,
"Barely a step above clickbait garbage like Vox, HuffPo and Salon. Corporate media is dead.",

The best source for news in the world today.,
"like the reporting, but don't appreciate the op-ed anymore",
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. The NYT is the journalistic standard, in my opinion.",
Consistantly outstanding journalism,
App refuses to let me pay $30 a month. I did not feel these stories represent any truth. They are pushed as fact when they are only opinions.,
"Never read it online, but may like to.",
The clearest path to the truth!,
Can't scroll on Chromebook!,
This is fully Biased news at it's extreme. Fully funded by Democrats.,
Love the in depth analysis of major stories!!!,
"""Most of the news that's fit to print."" smh",
The best News coverage in the World!,
"A nuanced, exceedingly well-researched account of a painfully complex life, and of a messy and questionably-deserved death.",
Crashes too frequently,
"ln depth, tells the story behind the story",
Really good update on time,
For those who don't know this industry/company Writes hit pieces against former President Trump as often as possible. They spread disinformation and fake news. I HIGHLY advise you guys to do your research on how evil The New York Times is. They want to destroy Republicans but We are going to win In 2024! You get zero stars from me.,
"I'm a subscriber, but the app doesn't recognize that.",
"Still one of the best read around, even if you don't always agree.",
if u want to know what the reality is never read their news. the real meaning of sold out media,
support great journalism,
VIEWER BEWARE!!! You'd think there was a bunch of natzis running around in there the way they act... Mostly filled with Fake news and UnAmerican tendencies.... And the hatefullness toward the employees if you don't align with their ideologies oooooweeee! Doesn't sound like you'll get a balanced news diet does it?,
Absolutely fake media. Now they are after neutral institutions to destroy them. Shame on NYT,
NYT keeps me informed on topics that matter to me and keeping me engaged in the world!,
Nice app for good news.,
"Glitchy app , great news",
"This isn't a news app! Platform for propaganda! I guess they will next say ""Osama was not found in Pakistan"" Preposterous!",

Would better if there was a widget for this app.,
"Reverend Barber, who I've followed for sometime, speaks more truth than most politicians. He would be a wise counselor to any President wise enough to listen.",
the author dances with words making my own grief visual and therefore manageable. thank you,
Great article. Illuminated the paradox of systemic racism; how it co-exists with real generational betterment in the lives of some minorities,
Love the perspective of east coast nut do not think paying for news is good,
"This article reveals how the profit motive, which is the overriding interest of business corporations that have invested in hospitals, has been inflicting moral injury on doctors in America who embarked on their profession to heal the sick and save lives, not rake in profits for private equity.",
The NYTimes is what we think 🤔 they are.,
Yet Biden cannot call himself a Catholic and support abortion... It's not does he only support abortion but he is a fierce aggressive advocate for it. Cant have both ways,
Why review a compulsory app?,
The widget option is gone,
THIS APP IS SO IRRITATING. Give us a share feature ffs,
The New York Times has served the country by giving clear information about the pandemic and other matters. An informed American public makes informed decisions. Thank you to all the members of this group that participate in the American community.,
Best online subscription I have.,
You can't unsubscribe. They wont let you leave. They will make you sit on hold or wait in a chat room till you give up. DO NOT SUBSCRIBE.,
"Excellent Reporting. Actually, the Best.",

Nasty popup on the web version.,
The real news in real time!,
For the best information then we chose the best app to meet the best...,
App is good but there is no dark mode 🤔,
Can't look at anything with out subscription,
Waiting 1.5 hrs for installation of app isn't my kind of fun,
Unable to uninstall,
Not a independence media as they claim to be. Another democrats propaganda,
truth is hard to find in today's world. the nyt remains one of the few places I can put my trust,
Essential reading in the UK,
Is thebest app in news and articles,
"This company believes nothing should be free, even if they're getting ad revenue",
Need to register. Annoying,
"Keeping up with the News, believable!",
So hard to cancel any subscription,
Love it...easy to navigate,
"I want to link my subscription on the app, will not let me do it.",
Have read this paper for almost 40 years.,
The latest update has broken the app for me.,
Said read for free but immediately wants to charge,
serious. fact based. interesting. significant investigation. anti corruption. eyes opener.,
Limited number of articles unless you pay.,
What need I say. Great news and obits I trust.,
A great man in the music world.,

The New York times is part of an extremist cultural Marxist leftist terror cult. I consider them a terrorist organization and I am awaiting for America to regain Independence and this is definitely one of the terrorist organizations that will be facing consequences in the subsequent aftermath.

These people are guilty of treason against the United States of America.,

TALK ABOUT FAKE NEWS! THIS IS THE WORSE NEWS APP THERE IS!!!,
"Biased,spreads misinformation just because the rich guys buy them off easily",
Friedman has been correct on these matters so many times before. B from PA,
"I have already subscribed with NYT online, you have been withdrawing directly from bank account",
NYT has lost it's mind.... they hired fools.... who don't know the boundaries of any nation... such a drastic mistake with india's map...,
Intuitive analytics and first-rate user experience,
The New York Times is my favorite newspaper,
Not free. But good enough.,
Great stories & news,
great story about people who achieved their own place in the world,
"it's important to have a clear idea of the ongoing risks of Covid, even among vaccinated people.",
"poor. Multiple articles quote Pakistani and terrorist claims without proof, while ignoring indian ones. Clearly biased.",
"Thoughtfully written. I still don't understand those who, despite over seven million votes to the contrary, would believe this election was ""stolen"" in only the presidential race and not where the other side won. I fear for our country where the perpetrators of the big lie are also in positions of power. It seems Rule of Law, the basic concept of our Constitution, is not working and this frightens me. Where is justice and truth?",
Two stars until the widgets return. :),

The media company is doing free and fair journalism. It has been trying its best to cover up (hide) Israeli aggression against innocent Palestinians by not highlighting the fact that it is the Palestinians who are losing their lives not Israelis.,

The NYT had become a terrible hyper partisan company that publishes toxic opinions not news,
"The New York Times in all forms WILL NOT cover the mass murder that has been going on in China for decades which in fact dwarfs that of the holocaust. Imagine a news source ignoring tens of millions of people being murdered. Uninstall this app that is supportive of the Chinese Communist Party covering up their genocide.

Also, Trump is applauding Putin because it's been an expected move since the USSR broke down (Like, are you dumb? Or just behind?""), so stop acting like he's the enemy in all this. He is bashing Biden, because Biden is the idiot that beat him in the election. The man can't do sh**! It's the same as calling your article, ""Water is Water"".",

"NYT is the best thoughtful, deep-coverage, broad coverage news outlet I've ever known. Their respected position is earned through talented people holding themselves to the highest standards of journalism. A necessity in today's fragile democratic society",
This article is so right!! All countries should give any frozen Russian assets to Ukraine!,
"it's really impressive how much time the developers spend on iPad Apps, yet they completely neglect the Android Tablet market and Android Tablet Apps. NY times needs to put a lot more elbow grease into their Tablet Support both here and on the NYtimes Cooking app, Tablet support sucks. The review above was written in 2020, and as of 2022, nothing has changed. Still true in 2023. Recently whem reading articles on a Galaxy Z Fold 5, artiicles jump around when scrolling in an unreadable manner.",
"NYT has created one of the most flawless newspaper app. So easy and convenient to use, articles are in order and thankfully with less advertising which is actually an irritant and one leaves the app to read somewhere else. Keep it up.",
Great source of knowledge and reporting. I can read many news items from around the world. But app navigation could have been better. Search and sections are hidden away with no direct access from the home page.,
"Need I say anything except ""Thank You"" to the journalists and NYTIMES for their due diligence in getting the news out and keeping us informed. If you want to be informed, read the NYTIMES! Just do it!",

I updated the app and now it gives me an error. I guess that is progress? I also wish they'd fix their link with Facebook. Also, there's no persistent login between the two platforms. I have to click on the article and hit pay wall, then open the story in the system browser...for EVERY damn article I want to read! What a hassle.",

But to its credit, saved articles are saved online so you can read them from multiple devices and they survive a phone failure",
Can't choose what topics to get notified about do it's nothing but Mark Zuckerberg for a month then nothing but mass shootings for three next three weeks. Awful,
Sham access .,
"Quite simply, the best newspaper in this land or any land. On-line subscription really a bargain. As an old broadcaster, I turn to NYT 1st!",
"Another year goes by and the same issues remain. I am so tiredof fighting my way through the gimmicky interfaces in which they present many articles. Sideways scrolls that hide content, finicky vertical scrolling that jumps uncontrollably forward or back for no apparent reason. Arduous updatimg. They're so hard to maneuver through on my tablet. Plus the content has shifted to recipes, social stars, games, cutsey fashion, etc. and away from hard news. And yes, my tablet and app are both updated.",
"The new feature articles are completely unreadable in the Android app. The text jumps all over the place, it's very annoying.",
Reliable. Continuous improves have enhanced functionality.,

Still pretty bad. I mean it doesn't crash anymore but it still can't get it to download the whole paper when I have wifi and even with the stuff I have previously downloaded it still downloads a bunch more that it didn't before. Not too bad until your on the subway and can't read anything cause it's not downloading the actual articles just the ads.,

"I hope NYT software UI engineers read this. 1) I have a paid NYT subscription and yet the app still displays Ads at the bottom of the screen! This wastes display space that could be used for 2 lines of additional news text. 2) ""Search"" should be available on any opened news article, not just on the main page of each section. 3) App should support ""Copying"" text in displayed article to the clipboard via ""long-press"" on text.",

Terrible user experience. Clicking on a link on the front page now dumps you into a Facebook-style feed of stories. Once there they are constantly trying to distract you with other stories before you even get to the text of the story that you wanted to read. In other words they have become a ad-focused distraction engine just like Facebook. Sad. I uninstalled.,

Once an incredible app completely destroyed in all recent versions. New feature is continuous 6% cpu usage to turn your phone into a hand warmer and kill your battery. Edit: Almost 7 years later and I am embarrassed by the progression from worse to worse with each release. You'd think even dark mode could make a reappearance of basic functionality.,
Frustrating.,

"The app functions well and the formatting for small screen use is excellent. Various media seem to function well most of the time. My pet peeve that I don't like is when you open a picture you have to back out and close it by clicking an arrow in the upper left, which seems to be idiosyncratic to this app. Integration with their website for this subscription via GPlay is poor.",
"I use this app every day. I love the paper. I do not love the app. It is surprisingly hard to navigate in lots of small ways. For example, what principle is used to organize the order of sections? Either alphabetically or customizable would be great... ""For you"" section is pretty useless, and featured prominently. It takes like 20 clicks to get to the local covid data despite the fact that I identified my locality for that purpose. Or just feature nyc data ffs. Is or isn't this the NY paper?",

It would be most helpful to have a search function within the app, since Google NYT search results, even very timely links, frequently fail to open in the app.",
"Stories that I'm shown don't change very frequently. Frustrating their algorithm decides what stories I might want to read & only shows me those. ""For You"" section is worse. 80% of the articles are cooking articles. The NYT is right- I love cooking. But they require a separate subscription to their recipes and it angers me that almost all of the articles they are showing me are for recipes that I don't have access to see. Last, they send ""news alerts"" for non urgent articles I've already read.",

Please reserve these alerts for critical news updates. I've updated my settings to only receive breaking news updates and they are still too frequent. The same story cannot break multiple times. If I am interested, I will follow it after the first notification.",
"Update: Still no dark mode or night mode. It was fine. Then they eliminated night mode. They did this before and eventually brought it back...but why? If the ""new"" night mode isn't ready, then don't take away the old one. I don't ask for much...just quality journalism that I can read comfortably. A few days ago, I had that. Now I don't. Bring back white text on black background. I am honestly considering canceling my subscription over this because this has happened before.",

"Anytime you go back from a story you have to wait several seconds while most of the screen blanks out and flickers up and down a few times while it does a refresh. Very very annoying.

Look at Google News - smooth and solid. Please make this work properly and get rid of that awful auto refresh thing.",

"I wonder why the NYT took out the night time reading mode (which changed the contrast of the app. white background changed to black and black to white) with this unusable light tweak.. Are we going backwards now? (It was changed last year). Bah... 05/21 Again night mode/dark mode is out 🙄 I wonder why? WSJ and WP have it in their apps. The two stars are for NYT journalism, but their app needs to get a good programmer. This app has progressively become worst over the last 3 years. I'm out!",

Update. Most recent update has made last row of mini XWord unavailable. Does anyone test these updates? Worst app ever for a product that costs nearly $20/month.

"Love the NYTimes, but the mobile app won't let me ""recommend"" a comment or even like a comment. ALSO unlike NYT online version I can't open more than one tab with for each article I want to read. Sure, I can put it on the bookmark list, but that's about 10 per day. If I don't read it RIGHT THEN I have to look through all those bookmarks. Impossible to find. I like to pull up separate tab to easily read standing on line, etc. HUGE FLAW. So I read online usually. PLEASE FIX!",
"News & other content are great, BUT the app is still NOT USER-FRIENDLY. When I get the ""push"" messages and tap to see the highlighted item, I don't get directed to that article, but to something else. What Would help? (1) A ""search"" feature, to help the reader find what I'm looking for, and (2) a HELP/""support"" option. I can still use Google to search the article and allow me full access as a subscriber. Cumbersome process! I'm tempted to just drop my subscription and seek my bed elsewhere.",
"i can't figure out why they leave the dark mode in android app. i can't simply read anything, it's so boring and stressful. i work all day with screen, i loved so much it that i simply can't live with light mode. I'm really disappointed by the new scheme they provide because it's too simple, but i can accept as long as i can watch it in dark mode. Really what happens, it was a government issue that you couldn't leave it anymore?? Really, why?",

NO DARK MODE. Wasted $ subscribing to NY Times. Severe retina burn in low light darkened room.,
Been a digital subscriber for years but it keeps asking me for my subscriber information. Thought that bug was fixed. I will uninstall again and just read it on the web which remembers me or the Nook daily download. Software is junk. NYT should be embarassed by it and pull it.,
Disappointed to see ads as a paying member.,
I like the app. But where is the dark mode????,
Love it,

"I have lowered my rating from 5 to 4. Have subscribed to the digital app for 10+ years. Up till now perfectly happy. However it seems a recent update has caused it to be extremely frustrating to use. After clicking on an article and then returning to the home (headline) page, it reverts back to the top of that page instead of the last location. That requires the reader to have to keep scrolling down to where last viewed, each and every time an article is viewed. This needs to be fixed asap.",
"The recent changes in the app have not been good. I miss dark mode and I hate that every time I tap to go back out of an article, it automatically takes me to the very top of the home page so I have to scroll all the way back down again each time. Quality of the news and notifications are still great. It's just the UX that needs work.",
"Great news, terrible navigation. The ny times is one of the best news organizations in the world and their reporting is top notch. The app is generally good with one critical problem: after you read a story the only way to get to the next article is to go up which then scrolls to the top and reloads the whole page. It's a mess. In addition, this appears to have been designed primarily for iOS with some hacky adjustments for Android. Do better!",
"The Paper of Record. I try to consult it every day. Jan2021 update: Something changed. After I read a story, it goes back to the top of the original page. Frustrating. Later Jan2021: They fixed it. Back to 5 stars",
Enjoy politics,
"I've been using this app for a couple of years and it's gotten noticeably worse in the last four to five months. Most recently, the app loses your place when you go into an article, so when you go back to the main page it scrolls all the way to the top. More generally, scrolling has gotten really sticky. It used to be smooth on my Pixel 3, but now as I scroll through articles and headlines the scrolling sticks and I have to flick it again. The articles of course are still great.",
"UPDATE #2: They appear to have removed Dark Mode from the Experiment section of Settings, where it's been for...years. Grrr. UPDATE: NY Times made the unbelievable and entirely inexplicable decision to remove the Android widget in the new update. A MAJOR MISSTEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. TOTALLY STUNNED. I went ahead and installed the Washington Post app and subscribed there, as they still offer a nice, customizable news widget.",
The app always scrolls back to the top after every article and I have to scroll down each time.. gets very annoying,
The latest versions scrolls back to the top of the paper every time you read an article. It's awful.,
Bring back night mode. I don't want VR. I don't want more interactive bs. I just want to be able to not sear my eyeballs reading the paper.,
I came here to complain about Night mode disappearing and immediately found the release notes indicating it will reappear soon. Thanks John,
"What happened to night mode? How am I supposed to get my news fix at 3AM when I can't sleep? Disappointing! I guess its WAPO from now on. 11/2016 - The best way to read the only true, legitimate news source left in a world of posers and angry partisans.",
When I finish reading an article it sends me all the way back to the top. Totally maddening since a week or so ago. Fix it!,

"This app has become unusable. Hardly scrolls as you're reading, trying to freeze up, then just suddenly shuts down completely. Occasionally locks up completely, freezing everything until you force it to close. My phone even alerted me to put the app to sleep due to frequent crashes. Developers please fix!",
This app is incredibly slow and unresponsive. I can only assume that's because it's filled with spyware tracking software to monitor what advertising was seen and for how long. Avoid at all costs! Spyware spyware spyware,
"Reinstalled after deleting 7+ years ago. Hoping this version is better, but based on current reviews, I'm not expecting much.",

"Overall it's a great app. Could use a bit more customizablility, feed-wise, but that's a small gripe. The only real issue I've encountered is that night mode has stopped displaying correctly. I don't know if it's a new bug or if it's got something to do with how the live coverage sections are formatted, but the text in many articles is a darkish gray that blends in with the black background.",
"My last review of this app in June 2017 thanked NYT ""for bringing back Night Mode and dumping the awful Twilight Mode."" I gave it 5 stars then. But then Night Mode--which never got out of Beta testing--went buggy over the years. Now it's faded gray text over black, nearly impossible to read. So once again, I implore the Times to bring back a proper Night Mode, which is much easier on the eyes than black text on white background. Also plz re-enable Rotate to view landscape mode. Only 3 stars now.",

"Still (stated this back in 2018) far too many ads and unnecessarily intrusive ads for a paid subscriber. The app itself is good, but the spelling bee has an annoying habit of running amok (simulates a constant key press on a traditional keyboard). Solved by exiting and then pressing 'continue'. The problem is the number of times this must be done each day.",

"Their breaking-news alerts are extremely buggy. You tap on an alert to see what it is, and the alert literally turns into (i.e., gets re-written as) something you've read already. Sometimes you get 4 alerts at the same time, and this happens to each of them. This has been true for a while, but is downright apalling during this pandemic. Too bad this great newspaper has such an ameteurish app.",
"As a publication NYT is phenomenal, however the app lacks a ""dark mode"" and is teeming with trackers. According to my DuckDuck Go App Tracking Protection, this app made more 100 tracking attempts in less than 1 hours time. I expect tracking from ""free"" apps, but not from an app tied to a $15/mo service. I'll continue to read NYT content, but not through the app.",
"Recent update to the app layout is pathetic. Don't wanna go to Sections and see the whole screen occupied just by section names. Sections need to be on the top/top side on the front/main page of the app. Newer layout gives takes up the whole screen for just the 1 top news. That is crazy. I need to glance at miltiple headlines to quickly choose to read what I want and not have to scroll frantically. Please bring back the earlier layout. - Long time, loyal NYT reader.",

I hate the changes you've made to the app. Put the sections navigation on the top of the page and then restore the ability to go from one article to another by swiping left or right and not have to go back to the list of articles in the section. Until then my rating is going down to three. Five for content and one for the app divided by two.,
I love the content but adds continuously asking you to subscribing made me delete this apps. I m sad but i have no other options. Because of those subscribe demands i asked google not to show any news coming from NY Times. Because of your stupid SUBSCRIBE you make people run away from you.,
The app is now full of annoying graphics and advertisements. It eats through my battery in seconds. My phone turns into a hand warmer.,

USELESS APP FOR READING NYT!! This was a decent app until they updated it. It is now impossible to toggle back to your reading location in the list of articles. Each time you toggle back it is as if you opened the app for the first time. I wrote app feedback to the NYT expressing how disruptive this is to a reader. They acknowledged this is the intent of the new app update. Well...this app is no longer useful to me. Not even a little bit. Deleted!,

"Downloads paper once daily or top sections twice daily. Bafflingly, opening an article auto updates & cache flushes it BEFORE CONNECTION CHECK. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. you app switch/phone lock/etc.. Tried every setting combo/hack (disable data/airplane mode/etc..) w/ same result. Renders app useless in, let's say, the NYC(!) subway. Other news apps (ex: Washington Post) store a full daily paper & NYTimes used to successfully do this. Issue is a major hindrance & ~10yrs old completely unacceptable.",

The only downside is that the links in the news items and articles have never worked for me. Update: Reinstalled the app and the links now work. Now, I am reinstalling again because the articles- but not the comments, oddly- stopped loading a day or two ago. Hope this fixes the problem. Excellent newspaper, though, and this is the only way of getting it in NZ.",
"NYTimes support confirmed starting wirh the December 9th app update, 9.0.0, you can no longer reorder favorite sections. Now you need to hit the Sections icon at the bottom right of the app, and then scroll thru a list of *all* sections to find what you're interested in. I'd like to specify my favorite sections like before, and also be able to swipe right or left in a list of articles, or within an article, to switch among my favorite sections.",
Just lowered my rating in that it became much less useful once they eliminated the widget that allowed you to easily see stories. Washington Post has kept theirs and is now much more useful for constant updates. App does still allow for full review of all articles if you specify open app.,

I feel like I would like a section for most recent articles. That way it would eliminate the search through other sections when I have already read through everything current. That would be nice.,
Update: I'm so disappointed in the app. Whenever I click on an article on Facebook it doesn't load in the app! It has completely ruined my experience. Can't believe I can't enjoy something I pay for! Fix this. Great content. I wish it was cheaper for those who that don't live in NYC or US,
Uninstall and reinstall doesn't work. For the past week the app has been buggy and doesn't open stories from the Top Stories tab.,
Headlines only - story links load a blank screen. Too many ads. I have paid for access so I should not see advertising. Can't give them zero stars.,
I'm a paying subscriber and there are still way too many ads.,
"11/1/19: New similar issues with 8.7 and 8.6 on same phones. Reverted to 8.5 until a working version is available. Geez. (older post begins here:) I pay for my subscription. Latest versions 7.5 and 7.4 don't work properly on my fully up to date Pixel 2 XL. Found V7.3.1 online, seems OK so far, but of course there are probably old bugs. We'll see. Such a waste of time.",

The worst is that I have the setting for Autoplay Videos turned OFF yet advertising videos (and those relevant to articles) still load and play on their own, multiple iterations per article! This also happens when I am using cellular network data (which I pay for by the KB). C'mon NYT!!! Solution: sign in on your mobile browser. No ads.",

"Updated: Reporting is great...NYT is one of the best. But I do still have an ongoing issue: why don't notifications work correctly? I get one, and 75% of the time it leads to the wrong article, or pulls up the app without refreshing the content. Should be relatively simple to identify each article with a GUID, and on notification selection, if necessary refresh the content, then display the correct article. Fix this and get 5 stars.",
"I'm downgrading this app because it's become next to useless, due to all the bugs and the abysmal performance. Most notifications no longer navigate to the correct stories. Videos don't play, or stop frequently (none of my other apps have this problem). Some days, NOTHING loads-the app just spins forever. When articles DO load, I find reading them very rewarding.

WaPo has the same widget, and I used both on different pages of my home screen. I practically never opened the NYT app directly to browse stories. Will you be restoring this widget? My subscription may depend on it.",
Pairing all the news that's fit to print with an app that prints fitfully. Buggy app Now it tells me my device is offline and won't print (it's clearly not),
"This used to be a great app. Please hire someone to fix it. I'm a paying subscriber and the app barely works now. I can't get to any articles from the headlines anymore unless I use a browser. Also, what happened to the widget? Fix it. You are the New York Times for Christ's sake. Richard Ehrenberg",
"Who came up with the idea to remove swiping to switch between categories? It makes navigation much more cumbersome, especially on large screens. Additionally, article notifications are linked improperly - I tap on a link about Facebook and am brought to an article on Barr and Mueller. (Edit) So many updates...and nothing fixed!

I support The Times and value its mission, especially in today's climate, but this is garbage. NYT, you can do better than this.",
"If you want to unsubscribe, the NYT makes it difficult to do so.  You have to either call and talk to someone or waste time in an online chat.  The goal of this sleazy tactic is to try to persuade you to maintain your paid subscription.  This really leaves me with a bad feeling about the NYT.  How can you trust their content when they have such slime-ball business tactics?",
"Too many ads littering the articles, especially for a fairly expensive paid subscription. It also crashes a lot.",
When compared to the WSJ you realize why you have to subscribe. NYT is best in American journalism today and they consistently show that. This should be supported by everyone that is concerned with truth in journalism.,

Times readers know what they feel is ""fit to print""; being online gives the Times and its readers room for those interests.",

For the last month or so The Times app on my Galaxy S7 has been working very poorly. The app freezes up at times & frequently takes 30-40 seconds to load pages. It's very frustrating. I love The Times but may choose to read it in another format since the app is not working well. Hey NYT please fix the app!,
"UPDATED 3/14/19: If you're using an Android Galaxy S9, note that this app currently doesn't play well with the Night Mode setting - it'll cause weird issues with white-on-white and black-on-black text that will make the home screen and many articles largely unreadable. Outside of that, I'd prefer the app over the web version of the site, and like using the home screen widget for quick headline scrolling.",
"update: this has gone from bad to worse. i can't even open articles anymore. at least it used to just hang, crash and kill my battery. without question, the worst application I've ever seen. With most recent updates this is horrible. It uses a ton of battery, hangs for seconds at a time and will periodically start playing media at high volume. We will likely cancel our subscription if it doesn't get fixed fast as it's close to impossible to really read with this.",
"After the latest update, the Times completely freezes up 5 or 6 times a day. Plus, it is sucking up the battery power at a remarkable rate. Since I opened the app 30 minutes ago my battery has gone from 82% the 58%. I've never experienced anything like this before. Not good. And this is after reloading the app. Nothing has changed.",
I agree with Michael Arzt's March 12 review. I am experiencing the same problems he describes. I have kept checking the settings to see if there is something I unintentionally changed to result in the graying and black backgrounds.,
i am suddenly having problems with the app using large amounts of battery even though i normally check articles in the morning and download them to Pocket to read later. Not sure what's going on.,
"The widget is now 4×3 instead of 4×2 and, more importantly, does not update headlines consistently. From a chosen article on the widget the general page appears instead. That page has now a fixed tiny font size. Will the developers fix these problems? This issue was fixed and the app works wonderfully now. 5 stars!",
This app crashes every three minutes. It is infuriating. NYT seems to have increased the type and quantity of ads it's serving. I didn't think this app could get worse but I was wrong. 0 stars.,

Among other recurring flaws, the ""save for later"" feature, which is supposed to allow readers to tag articles for future reading, is completely unreliable. Tagged articles frequently fail to show up in the ""saved articles"" queue. Articles you've read and untagged will mysteriously re-appear weeks later. I love the NYT, but this app is too poorly designed to be useful.",

"While the quality of reporting the New York Times produces is decent, the paper leans to the Left. Consequently, the Grey Lady risks its reputation due to recent articles and undertakings (like the 1619 Project) that were blatantly politically motivated. I like the app's original format, but this present version patterned after its website is easy to get around. I only wish they had a section so someone can check on the stock market performance and fewer ads. Otherwise, you may not be disappointed with The New York Times.",
"I watch YouTube videos from the ""best of late night"" column. When I finish a video and return to the column, it for some reason reloads, and since l'm in subway, good chance the column won't load or will without videos. Why is it necessary to reload every few minutes just because I switched to YouTube and back? New annoying and time consuming bug, still one star.",
"Use it all the time. But, it keeps shutting down because according to the Play Store, page this app is not optimized for my device. So until that changes, I giving it a 3.",
Doesn't load top stories. All other sections load up fine.,

"Good source for US and international news. App is pretty good though some bits feel a bit rough around the edges (date of crossword shows September, and sometimes there are errors when launching from a notification), but all in all is a good app to get news from.",

"TOO MANY ADS!!! Too many distracting ads that make it hard to read the article. Usually each ad appears 3 or 4 times within the same article, so you can't get away from it. Since they started using video ads, the amount of data this app sucks up has quadrupled. UPDATE: Fed up with the ads, after seeing the same flashing ad for bras 100 times a day for the past week (I don't have breasts). I am uninstalling the app (and possibly cancelling my subscription) and will get my mobile news elsewhere.",
"The Times is a good paper. Too bad they can't design an app that lives up to the standards it maintains for its journalism. Am a paid subscriber. The app crashes frequently and unexpectedly, and they never seem to fix the bugs. Edit: app worse than ever. Does not refresh itself and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled EVERY SINGLE TIME in order to get updated news. Edit: They still haven't fixed the bug that prevents the app from refreshing itself, and I am still uninstalling/re-installing!",
good news,
establishment news,
sucked,
NYTimes,
"Would be 5 stars, but I have it set to update in the background a couple times a day and it doesn't. I have to actually open the app before it updates, and only then do I also get a push notification of my morning/evening digest of news. This is hugely inconvenient, as I usually open to read during my underground commute, where reception is spotty and therefore I can't get updated articles. This has been an issue for a while. Please fix this.",
"Excellent reporting but app is terrible. I've used the NY times app for about 3 years now, and while the reporting is top notch, the app has progressively gotten worse. Biggest complaint is advertisements (some with auto-play videos) that slow the app down incredibly and kill the experience - long loading times, choppy scrolling, and I'm running a brand new pixel 3. It's horrible that after subscribing we're still subjected to ads, and then these ads completely bog down the app. In the words of our dear leader, SAD!",
"Overall a great app, but I've recently been having an issue where I click on a notification for my daily briefing and get brought to a blank screen in the app. The news story never loads and I have to force close the app, re-open it, and navigate back to the daily briefing (which is often far down the page, couldn't this be surfaced to the top? or have it's own section?)  Also, as an NYC resident I'd love to be able to have the New York Today articles surfaced to me on a daily basis by the app as well instead of having to sign up for emails.",
Stopped using this completely because I cannot scroll through an article without seeing 10+ ads. Sad!,
Update 2: App is again a battery hog. Stick with the mobile site.,

"App works fine for me, despite all the complaints here. Still the best NY paper by far. However, let me down on Election night 2018, so I'm turning to TV. NYT has great journalists but still has to get it together on the technology side. You can't crash on election night and expect subscribers to stay devoted.",
"Ridiculously slow. Election night results either crashed the app or were not displayed properly. Use your browser. Also, pics don't load. Either way, NY Times its still the best paper out there.",
"Most recent update fixed some annoying bugs with the crossword and image loading. Thanks, devs!",
There's a really annoying glitch where the toolbar flickers when you scroll through an article,
Leftist garbage,
Heavily biased,
Well done,
Bad,
Loved it,
Great,
Thank you,
"App notification settings are useless, always uses same as system no matter what. Support no response on why pretend feature in app.",
Takes long time to start and reloads at random times. Switched to Google News app 👍,
"The Crossword and other puzzles, which I do every day, stopped loading completely after the last update. The negative change prompted me to drop my rating from 5 to 3 stars.",
"Commenting on the phone? Night mode? Search? INDISPENSABLE. ""Twilight mode""? Useless. I only use mobile site, for real functionality. I spend more money on NYT than any other digital product. How do you choose which reviews to reply to?",
No thanks,
👍,
"App has gone downhill in recent incarnations. The best thing about this app as a NYC resident is that offline content is frequently updated. Recently, however, more and more of what appears to be offline content lags or seems to require an internet connection. I'm still giving it four stars for content. Points off for ease of offline use declining.",
Good content. EATS BATTERY LIKE CRAZY. Do not recommend based on battery issue.,
Very good!,
Fine,
"The app suits me fine as far as good presentation, readability, the ability to configure what sections load on the home screen, etc. And to those who complain about paying for content...that content doesn't get produced for free you know... HOWEVER - the app often kills my battery. Whenever I see an abnormally fast drain on the battery it is NY Times app at the top of the list. So I have uninstalled it.",
"Although NYT Android app now has a setting to turn off autoplay of videos, this does NOT apply to video ads, nor to certain NYT videos that they apparently want to highlight. Seems dishonest to me. Will try using an adblocking mobile browser on the web site instead of this app.",
Very anoying,
Great app,
Stupid,
important,
Investigative,
Wow,
Ok,
good,
😀,
"A normally good app, recently it keeps crashing. Articles freeze up and then disappear. More and more ads seem to be trying to populate while scrolling, which may be part of the problem. Closing and reopening the app reestablishes the article, but then it will freeze up and crash again.",
"Very pleased that they added dark mode (it is currently in ""NYT experiments"" in settings), so now they have a 5* app as well as the usual 5* content.",
Crashes constantly.,
Commie pinkos.,
Deceitful,
Addictive,

Like it.,
Rag,
"Something has happened to this app over time. It used to be great but it's become very very unstable and flakey lately. It just keeps getting worse. I pay $15 a month and think I deserve a better product! I also subscribe to the Washington Post, L.A. Times and the Desert Sun. All less expensive and better apps.",
The homepage is failing to function.,
Works again. Good reporting.,
Amazing,
good,
"Great writing in a great format. Morning and evening briefings are often all I have time for, but despite marking to get notified about them, I haven't received notifications for over 6 months. And it's difficult to actually find the briefing. Should have it's own tab. I've written to NYTimes numerous times and they have provided no assistance. Links to more in-depth stories are easy and intuitive. Subscription is a little pricey IMO, but willing to pay for serious journalism.",
User interface is clean but my phone overheats when i use the app. I canceled my subscription because every time I open the app my phone turns into a hot potato in my hands. Users should also be aware that it's very difficult to unsubscribe from the nytimes. These underhanded tactics changed my attitude to the newspaper completely.,
"So many ads, and they reduce the performance of the app. I'm trying to read an article and it freezes and I cannot scroll because it's loading an ad. I pay hundreds of dollars a year and I still have to deal with these awful and ugly programmatic ads. Terrible app.",
Just started today. Haven't figured out how to change pages without editing and coming back into the app from the icon. Need to continue trying. The NYT articles are superb.,
First app I've ever reviewed because it's sooo bad. It crashes all the time.,
"Content is great. Stories load much faster than they do in web browser. But the app keeps annoyingly jumping out of the article I'm reading, back to a main page.",
"Great content but the app frequently crashes. All articles with parallax scrolling, such as the weekly quiz, are nearly impossible to read. Very buggy.",
App was once pretty good. More recent updates have made it barely functional on all but the most recent devices,
This is one of the worst news apps I've ever used.,
"Works fine, but uses an obscene amount of data. Seriously, it's an article, competing apps use a tiny fraction of the data.",
A truly Great Online Newspaper that freezes and crashes all the time. I have an Android Tablet and NYT tells me it may not be compatible with my device...why isn't it compatible with the most popular OS in use today?,
"Even for subscribers, articles full of intrusive ads :(",
I haven't been able to load comments from articles and they haven't been able to fix it.,
paid for subscription but still so many annoying advertisement.,
"Still call to unsubscribe in 2018, seriously? Good app and good articles but unsubscribe should not be so long and difficult",
Put the by-lines next to the headlines!,
I do not like paying for news coverage!!!,
"For good quality, unbiased journalism, look elsewhere..",
Crashes constantly,
Weak,
Great,
I like this,
Intentionally misinformative,
"App does not function properly. Active ads become so intrusive they 
actually make stories unreadable. The ads themselves are annoying enough, 
but they quickly cause the screen to blacken in part or in full. This 
happens 100% of the time!!!",
I'm a paid subscriber and still have to deal with obnoxious autoplay ad videos eating my data and killing my other audio. The content is great but the ads ruin it.,
"You lost me when I saw download options for offline reading reading didn't include ""on demand"". I'll go to the website and download what, when, and where I want.",
"Unfortunately this failed attempt at a news publication supports proud 
racists. I wouldn't imagine their brand of ""news"" is any more reliable than 
the opinions of their antiquated, racist staff.",
Never remembers where I am in an article and will scroll to random positions or the top when I lock or rotate my screen. Also ads constantly register as tapped when I'm scrolling through the article.,
"Laggy app and have found it so far impossible to cancel my subscription. 
Trying to cancel just gets a Merry go round redirect with no customer care 
available and when the chat is available it's back on a Merry go round.",
Narrow minded writers and one sided stories. Does not present all the facts.,
Freezes a lot. End up readi ng from the browser instead of the app.,
not able to read full articles on pixel. app is buggy.,
News articles usually don't load at first try. Everything else is great.,

Perfectly usable substitute for the web page on the go. Reliable and simple to use.,
I am impressed with NYT articles and coverage and ethics,
"The New York times sucks its run by libraTURDS,",
Habers gonna habe! 😍,
Huh,
"News content is great, but the app doesn't seem great to me. It doesn't 
show front page stories rather ""top"" stories that refresh. But for example 
it's 6:15 am and I only have two new stories when I know that the paper 
version is already out with a front page of new headlines. It makes the 
digital version seem slower than the conventional press, which is crazy. 
Plus, slow to load and pictures rarely load.",
"I support the NYT (I have a digital subscription) , especially in these times of insular views and beliefs. But, the NYT app is less than stellar. It crashes. A lot. I will be reading an article in the morning, then go back to the NYT app home page and leave for work. When I get home I press the home button to wake the tablet, and the NYT app will crash. Just because I woke the tablet. I also see frequent articles failed to load messages, or the message on the app home page about failing to load content. Don't try to lame my internet connection - it's perfectly fine. . NYT needs to get better app writers.",
"The NYT android app is close to unusable due to massive intrusion of ads 
that slow down and even crash the app. I do not understand how a paper with 
this much good content has a horrible app and a horrible user experience. I 
have a fast and new android phone. But the NYT app simply stinks.",
"Love the content, but app malfunctions often on my Motorola z2 play. When 
scrolling through an article the text will disappear. It will only show 
large blocks of black and white. App restart is needed to fix. I do have a 
paid subscription.",
"I haven't installed this but it kerps appearing, I've tried to unintstall 
and force stop etc but it just keeps coming back. I cannot change 
preferences or settings as I will only get access if I sign up.",
"The stories had Racist undertones and they felt like they were pushing an 
agenda instead if reporting the news.",
"Speaking to the app quality alone. On Samsung devices the app is unusable. 
It has trouble scrolling down as it can't seem to deal with its neverending 
ads. The app is a massive energy sink.",
"App is totally useless.. at least the real thing can be used to wrap a 
fish, or line a bird cage. NYT doesn't champion the first amendment. They 
hate America, and real Americans hate them back.",
"I'm deleting this. No one should be promoting racism and alt left 
propaganda. This news paper has been exposed on multiple occasions and I am 
pro America.",
"I didn't like the format on my tablet, too jerky. Then I discovered the 
Today's Paper app which operates through Chrome and other browsers. Much 
smoother and easier to follow. Wish it came in an icon identified app.",
"The New York Times is the epitome of journalism here in America, and the 
app shows that not only in the quality of news, editorials, and other 
categories (albeit categories I don't read), but also in the ease of use 
and display. The only app and newspaper I think competes is the Washington 
Post. Highly recommended, although I do think 6 dollars a month is a bit 
high, especially for a college student such as myself, but that's the price 
you pay for good journalism.",
"I pay money for this app and still get too many ads. It is constantly 
stalling out. We need the Times to keep watch on our politicians. Just wish 
this app worked better.",
Uninstalled since they support racism against white people.,
Omg!!! How dare you employ that racist lady and support her!,
Overall pretty good but crashes a fair bit .,

There's no UK England News. Why?,
Pathetic paid news at best,

"whenever I use the app it says the version is out of date and asks me to upgrade. when I do so, I find out that i already have the latest version. hope this is fixed asap.",
I have the latest version but the app pops up a message saying to download the latest version. I uninstalled and reinstalled from the app store and still getting the same message.,
Lovely!,

"I didn't originally go through my NYT app, but Google Feed so when I read 
the five free articles, I clicked on my app to finish my sixth article. 
Except then I went into a loop of logging in and still getting blocked 
because I needed to buy into their online sub. Okay, maybe it was a glitch 
so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, changed the password, and then 
logged in. To the same damn sub request block despite the fact right under 
it, it said I was logged in. Gah! I know I am current on my sub fees 
because PayPal sent me a notice, so what the hell? It's only $3.99 /mo but 
the 39 min I have wasted on this makes me want to stop paying and just stop 
reading NYT altogether. Washington Post has never given me this issue 
before.",
"It's a great app for reading NYTimes, but has a few drawbacks. You have to 
pay higher subscription fee to use on both phone and tablet. It's back to 
not working so well underground again, which is kind of ridiculous in NYC. 
It even reloads and loads stories slowly on weaker WiFi, which is annoying 
since it's probably just checking to refresh and ad server. Right now it 
won't even load half the articles on mobile or WiFi, seriously what's the 
problem? I pay a subscription for this premium poor service?!? NYT should 
be keeping up its game with steady improvements in format and digital 
content.",
"Love the news but my app is now randomly playing a Lowe's ad at high 
volume, even when my phone is asleep. Looked at permissions and there's 
nothing that indicates a way to ensure this app never takes over my 
speakers. Very embarrassing to be meeting with clients and hear an ad 
emanating from my phone...",
"Frustrating user experience. Can't queue articles for reading in a row or 
later. You can 'save' a story but where do the saved articles go?? Can't 
zoom in. Can't learn more about a topic by selecting and linking to a web 
search. Hides all of your notifications for some damn reason as if 
multitasking is a forbidden sin. Just read the Times on a web browser - 
it's a much better experience.",
"Frustrating. Clunky. Will reload itself in the middle of an article, 
returning to home screen, up to 3x a morning.",
"Ok to read articles. Crossword frequently freezes the app and forces an app 
closure.",
"I pay for the service. I have the All Digital Access subscription. Why am I 
still seeing 5+ ads in EVERY article? I want an answer, not an automated 
message of ""Ads help us"", but a real answer from a real person. EDIT: 
counted again today after seeing an absurd amount. 10+ ads. What is going 
on.",
"What happened to my great nyt app? Subway-useful no more as pages won't

offline even though the setting is selected.",
I love it!,
very bad,
"Latest update says it fixed bugs in the Saved For Later tab, but I can't 
view the articles I've saved.",
Too many Ads.,
Cannot uninstall,
"The New York Times is known to many as the best newspaper in the United 
States. I think the articles that are published in this newspaper are 
generally very good, but I believe that the New York Times is more of a 
""rich"" person's newspaper. I wish this newspaper would hire people to write 
for the newspaper who know poverty better. This newspaper doesn't give a 
very good poverty perspective.",
"All is well with the app, but why the hell do I get ads if I have 
subscribed and am paying for news!? ALSO after a month I tried to u 
subscribe because its not worth it, you pay to have news and you still see 
ads... Well good luck unsubscribing because there is no button to do it, 
they want you to call them, and for us who aren't in USA there is no other 
way ( maybe there is but there is no simple button like everywhere else!). 
Luckily I was paying over PayPal and went to their site and canceled 
payment there! Never paying or reading your s""*t again thank you very much!",
"The app is nearly unusable, with ads that frequently cause crashes in the middle of reading articles. Even when it works, the battery drain from the ads is very rapid. The only way I can use it is to go into airplane mode so that the ads can't load. And this is on a high-end Samsung tablet! If they're going to charge for a digital subscription, they should at least stick to reputable ad networks.",
"App crashes frequently, even after clearing cache. Crossword is 
particularly buggy. Too many ads, I'm constantly opening them accidentally, 
just trying to scroll.",
Recent glitch in ads during scrolling makes information unreadable,
"The best for thorough, thoughtful and fair reporting.",
I'm gonna try it just awhile,
Very easy to use and it is helpfull for learning,
App stops a lot,
Can't disable notifications,
Too many ads,
"Good app. Lately some bugs have been introduced (breaking notifications, images, login, etc.), but I get the impression that the developers are fixing these quickly, and I appreciate their responsiveness to feedback. I like the ability to save articles and sync across devices and platforms. Lots of quality journalism, including a new podcast section in the app.",
"Arrrgh, so frustrating! The amount of advertising is absolutely brutal, 
they're jamming them in between damn near every paragraph even for 
subscribers. Totally ruins the experience. At least with a browser you can 
use a decent adblocker plus Ghostery to keep them from tracking your every 
move.",
"I could never log in. It would say my account didnt exist yet i got emails from them and they still took my payment. It was a bummer, I really like the NY times. maybe in this case paper is better than an app.",
"In general, the app is quite good, but with the latest releases it uses up 
too many resources on my phone. Each time I start the app, the phone slows 
down and starts overheating. Force stopping the app is the only thing that 
helps in that case. No need for this app to use this many resources (CPU, 
memory).",
"It crashes often, sometimes while just reading an article. Updates to add 
cause display to move content, making it difficult to read.",
"The Android app functions well but is missing the Todays Paper section that 
is on the iOS app, so I tend to read the NYT on my old iPad instead of the 
tablet which I read the rest of my newspaper subcriptions on. It is a bit 
annoying having to switch between the two devices.",
"This used to be great. Latest version of the app blocks page loading and 
scrolling when it loses a connection, which makes it useless on the subway.",
"Great writing and honest, verified reporting. A pleasure to read to stay 
current on world events",
"Used to be a very good app. Then they added more and more ads. Now the ads 
occupy more space than the story text. Very bad, especially for an app 
which requires a subscription to use. Greed has taken precedence over 
content.",
Now crashes almost constantly. Frustrating for a paid app.,
"It's fine. Deducted one star because they used to give unlimited access to 
iPad users . I don't know if they still do, but it that's lame.",
"Need to see billing page, to check status of current subscription. No easy 
access.",
"Now that the ads have been removed for a paid subscriptions an excellent 
app.",
We know all countries information in my mind regular,
Crashes and hangs on its own ads.,

Rarely updates,
"The app itself works fine - but unsubscription is a NIGHTMARE. Was told ""1 
second"" wait time on their chat for half an hour before giving up and 
calling someone who, in broken English, told me the ""system is down"" and 
maybe tomorrow it will work. Just make an unsubscribe button like everyone 
else, for Christ's sake. It's 2018.",
"NYTimes App used to work on Android 4.1.2, Samsung S3. I subscribed and 
have loved the app, but it is no longer compatible and will not load 
anything (confirmed with NYT). Now if I still want articles loaded to read 
later off-line, I must cancel my NYT subscription and sign up for WashPost, 
which is still compatible.",
"I've had this app for a long time but recently they've started piling on ad 
after ad to the point where my screen is almost always half ad, half real 
news. As a paid subscriber, I expect at least three paragraphs of text 
before being served a full screen ad. Also, sometimes the ad is right 
between the news photo and the related text making it impossible to connect 
the two without scrolling back and forth. Very poor UI choices in favor of 
ad revenues.",
"Chronically freezes and stops on both of my tablets. Very irritating as I 
pay for this subscription. I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous 
times. Next uninstall will be final NYT.",
"Update 6/15/18:  With the upgrade, I cannot silence notifications unless I turn them off completely, which I have done.  I set it to silent/no vibrate, save the setting, but it still buzzes when breaking news.  I've gone to only getting notifications (silent) from WAPO.  Sorry NYT. Please fix!  Please, Please!  give us a way to turn off audible notifications.  I just want the notification (breaking news, etc) to show up as a notification w/out the sound.  This is a  no brainer!  As such, I am forced to disable notifications completely.",
"The app worked great until the 6/1/2018 update. It now crashes and restarts 
3-4 times in every article. It's just unusable now.",
"There is still a notification problem. I don't get any nytimes 
notifications, including the morning briefing until after I've opened the 
app for the day.",
"Great content and overall pretty good app, but it uses way too much data! 
I've limited to manually updating the content, but wish it had further data 
saving options.",
"Consistently unverified reporting- usually made up to fit a liberal agenda 
-heavily slanted to the Left. Always against the current Administration.",
"The app is wonderful, the articles are gold and it has been a constant 
companion in my life since 2014. However I use the app on my phone and 
tablet and since June 11th 2018 it has not loaded any new articles since, 
the tablet is a 10 inch samsung galaxy tablet with android 4.2.2 is it 
possible to get a running version for older devices please? I'm sure there 
are many of your users who enjoy the nytimes from older devices, can you 
guys do it? I much prefer reading on my tablet since the display is much 
larger and It's easier to maneuver than my phone, thank you very much.",
"Few requests: -Can we get a link to Smarter Living in the menu? -What 
happened to night mode viewing? Used to be on the mobile website, now also 
not on the app. Can you bring this back please? -Can you put the Save for 
Later at the top or on the main header, so it's quickly available? -Also I 
agree on the too many ads for paying subscribers. We do pay for your high 
quality journalism, so shouldn't we get no or less ads than the free users? 
Thanks",
I love the app. Great overall link to the world.,
"It's good app for me.Because, I am learning USA language from it.many many 
thanks nytimes family.......",
"Great app, awesome quality.",
Leftist propaganda,
"Both the app, and the content is five stars. If you don't live in New York 
a subscription is a little pricey and harder to justify, but if you want 
world class news and features, it's worth it. If you're not paying, you 
still get quite a few free articles (notification articles are always 
free.) I wasn't thrilled when I had to phone in to cancel a trial 
membership, but that's pretty minor.",
"Not so good now. Hangs up and must be closed. Very slow to open. Was really 
great but not now after I am guessing an update.",
"I was happy with it until a few days ago, when it started crashing both on 
my Samsung TabA and my Android phone. Very frustrating and about ready to 
give up on my subscription if I can only read NYTon my laptop.",
"Crashes often. Lately it is unusable. Am looking for a news source that can 
also deliver through technology.",
"Beautifully designed, unobtrusive ads, however extremely battery

Galaxy Tab S2) to seriously over heat while it quickly drains the battery. 
There's definitely an issue here that needs attention. I can't really use 
the app until it's fixed.",
"I love their journalism and that's why I have been their digital subscriber 
for the past six months. But despite paying monthly subscription fee, you 
will still see damn annoying advertisements... about four to five ads when 
you are scrolling and reading a single article... Why am I paying for it if 
I am still seeing all these ads.",
"Signing up for a free trial was supper easy online, but the only way to 
cancel it before it converted to a paid subscription was to call them. I 
had assumed having to haggle with sales folks over the phone wouldn't have 
been part of a digital subscription.",
"Switched from WaPo to NYT recently because I like the style of their 
reporting better and the app is also a bit more polished. Unfortunately I 
can't give it more than 3 stars for videos simply don't play. Now, I still 
stick with it because my main interest is reading the news but some videos 
seem interesting and not being able to watch them sucks. I read thru all 
the settings and didn't see anything related to this. Since all other 
videos in other apps run fine I must assume it's the app's fault.",
"I was never nuts about the news, but this app makes it interesting. 
Informative...it's nice to look at things from both sides of the fence. No 
problems with the app, no glitches...which is rare. I can't recall giving a 
5 star rating on anything in the Playstore, but I can do nothing less for 
the NY Times. Thanks guys.",
"It crashes at the end of almost every single article. I love reading the 
times, but do so on my phone, and am about to cancel my subscription. I 
have notified the times twice over the last month about this issue and they 
have not fixed it.",
"Newtime is a great place to visit and enjoy the summer Weather and the 
weather in your area and your home 🏡 are very important to the real 
time... And you can get a good time with nytimes company. 😀",
"I cannot use this app in this state. It is burning through data for no 
apparent reason.",
"Warning, even after paying for a subscription there are autoplay video ads 
with sound. I'll pay for decent journalism, but in return I expect the ads 
to be removed. I'd pay a few bucks extra a month to get rid of them.",
"The best journalism in the world. Great food section - love Melissa Clark 
and Sam Sifton - they have my cooking to a much higher and more interesting 
place. Thank-you.",
The 2nd most biased news in America. Behind only the LA times.,
"they are top grossing.. but that doesn't mean that they will suck us.. 
paying system is so poor.. Free visiting newspaper site would be better..",
It crashes every time I get to the end of an article,
"The ads are annoying, intrusive and ultimately worsen the reading 
experience. I'm a paid subscriber to a couple of other apps - if they get 
rid of their ads (e.g. The Guardian) if you're a paying customer, why can't 
NYT?",
"Too many headlines that presume what I ""Need to Know"". I'll pass on 
clickbait.",
"Damn, this is the best newspaper in the world.",
Bravi! Real news for hungry minds. .,
"I really like this app, it's very easy to use. <3",
"STOP SUPPORTING APARTHEID REGIME! FREE PALESTINE. I HATE YOUR BIASED FKCNG 
PROPAGANDA!!!!!!!!!",
vanguard of truth.,
Nc,
"I'm actually not commenting on the app, I'm commenting on Google: I 
purchased an annual subscription through Google Play, who sent info to 
NYTimes that I had purchased a 4 week cooking trial. It took 4 hours on the 
phone with Google to get them to give me a refund. Two of those hours I had 
a NYTimes customer service rep on the phone with me to keep Google from 
badgering me, keep Google from telling me to factory reset my phone, etc. 
NYTimes should stop selling subscriptions through Google Play. Finally 
Google sent my refund: now I can purchase my subscription from NYTimes and 
start reading articles!",
"UPDATE, May 2018. Still not fixed. Rotating the phone causes a complete 
page reload. Extremely annoying, especially when watching videos or special 
articles with videos, or nearing the end of a long text article. Please fix 
this!! - - - - It works well enough mostly, but has a VERY annoying quirk 
in that many things cause a page reload. It's nearly impossible to watch a 
video full screen, for instance, because if you rotate your device, the 
page reloads. You lose your place and the video just refuses to format 
properly. Also, if you're reading an article then switch to another app, it 
totally loses your place and you have to start over.",
"As of today: Auto plays audio and video advertisements as you scroll 
through things. Forget it.",
"Update 2: Wow updated to use notification channels! I'm impressed with the 
Android Team.👏👏👏 Update 1: Thank you for dimming the navigation and 
status bars as per below! —Hey guys please look at what Medium does when 
reading articles. They hide the status bar and dim the navigation bar to 
make it easier to read. Please do the same as this is a reading app. 
Thanks! Please support notification channels on Android Oreo.",
"Informative news, interesting articles, fun mini puzzles... this is my 
go-to every morning.",
Good,
"It's disappointing that you still can't make it auto update on a 
predetermined number of hours - not use opening the app when you have no 
connection, only to read two days old stories.",
Easy to get world news,
"I signed up after the new update forced me to. Once I did, it wouldn't even 
let me read an article since its telling me already read 10 articles this 
month which I haven't. Used to be a well performing app a year ago, I don't 
know what happened",
"Im so tired of your ""breaking news."" They are so not breaking news.",
Its called Fake News and The Failing NYT for a reason...,
"Best news agency. But please post world news more and more. An user from 
India.",
Great coverage.,
Enjoy the app.,
Why I do see ads when I m a subscriber?,
Nice app,
"Can't use the nytimes app unless I let them read my call log. For what 
reason, who knows? They didn't say. Probably because there's no reason for 
these people to go through my call logs..",
"The New York Times provides a rich, high-quality experience on its Android app, with amazing well-written and nuanced journalism. The app looks and feels refined and polished.",
"With latest update, stories won't load",
"I think it is weird that they are charging a ton of money to receive news that so many competing apps give for free. Their app is not even worth it. You cannot even set the notification sound when news comes in. I mean, if you're going to charge to use the app, the least they could do is make the app really configurable.",
"This app has functionality attached to long press of is application icon which means I can't drag it around on my home screen. I really want to put it on a different page on my home screen and I can't figure out how to do it. I'm so frustrated that I'm actually deleting the whole app, just so I can have control over where things show up on my home screen.",
"I'm supposed to have a free subscription through my University. It works online or if I open my mobile browser, but on the app it tells me I've reached my limit for articles. Really annoying, will give 5 stars if the issue is fixed.",
"Update : If you purchase a subscription, I recommend paying NYTimes directly. I tried to cancel, but I purchased my subscription through Google Play who refused to prorate a reimbursement. I want to support the NYTimes and subscribed last year. I just payed my subscription for the second year and suddenly I get blaring ads while I am reading. I don't know how to turn it off. You'd think that after talking my $100, they could give me a peaceful experience. I'm going to find a different news source and cancel my subscription. This is unacceptable.",
If you accidentally click on a video ad it takes over the whole screen and you can't back out of it or get back to the app after it plays. You have to kill the app and reopen. Terrible experience for the reader. Also creates antipathy toward advertiser.,
I was perfectly happy with the app until March 24. Now I am not being allowed to log in to the app from my phone. But I can log in from my desktop and my subscription has already been paid. I tried reaching out to NYT over email but zero response. Extremely poor service.,
"I wouldn't waste your time or money. They limit there news, and are 100% one sided it amazes me how far one company will go to push there opinions over the facts.",
Automatically plays ads with sound when you are scrolling through a story. Unforgivable breach of trust. They crossed a line and lost me as a subscriber.,
NY Times is one of four news apps that I use to form a complete picture of world politics. It is my favorite news app in the United States. Articles are well written and informative.,
"Well laid out, clean CLI, however very limited number of news available for free per month unless you are a NYT subscriber",
"When I tap a notification for an interesting story, the app opens to the main page and not the actual story. The frustration this causes is compounded by the lack of a search feature, because the notification is gone and there's no way to find the story in-app.",
"I've loved this app for a long time, but recently they started playing audio from ads while I am reading articles. This is totally unacceptable when I am reading in an area where noise is inappropriate.",
"Never considered writing a review until they released a new version with a ""scroll up"" feature when you tap a topic heading. Still one demerit for lack of a reliable dark theme, but the app is coming along.",
I would expect some decent from as a person who has paid for the NYT to have an ad free experience in the app. Evidently not.,
"It's a good app, but you have to scroll down to access some topics, like smart living, since does not exist a way to find this in categories",
"The app has started autoplaying audio, with no warning, when reading articles. Unacceptable.",
"I dont want it, but its bloatware on my device.",
I don't want this app but cannot delete it. I know I can hide it but that doesn't free up the space it uses.,
Breaking news alerts stopped working on Android 8.1 for the Pixel 2 XL,
"It's great, as far as it goes, but all the blogs are missing, the Watching blog and the Word play blog, in particular.",
The New York Times why you blocked me on Facebook,
Too many alerts when I've only enabled alerts for Breaking News,
Consistently logs me out. As in every time. I can't stay logged in.,
I am connected to internet yet it's showing m not. Does it work outside of USA?,
New York Times Magazine credibility is worth reading!!!,
Constantly crashing mid-article. Unusable.,
Ads play sounds while app is closed.,
It asks for money too much. That app is not standing for news. They standing for money.,
Too many ads.  Why am I getting ads when I'm a paid subscriber?  I'm about ready to cancel all subscriptions.,
Great app,
Not free.,
Thanks,
"NYT has excellent content, but the app is a buggy mess that won't let me access content to read it. I pay for your newspaper because I think it is my responsibility to support and consume good journalism- please fix your app so I can do that. Editing to one star because it's impossible to read the news half the time.",
"Comprehensive news coverage. Lots of topics. For people who don't pay for an electronic subscription, the NYT restricts the number of articles which are allowed to read. There is an working in the app. The last 2 months, as I scrolled the short intro to the many NYT articles, it suddenly pops up and says I have""read"" 6 articles. This month I had read 1 article when it popped up and said I had read 6. I appreciate the limit to 10 stories from this excellent newspaper, but the app is flawed. Please fix.",
"Constant notifications of random stories. That's okay I'll limit it to only breaking news. Still constant irrelevant stories popping up. Whatever I'll disable notifications all together. Few days pass by. New notification from NY Times. Huh? I thought I disabled that. Recording shows shooter in Miami? This looks intresting, decide to check it out. Your article access has expired. I have to pay to look at top stories? Deleted.",
"Dispite the great content, this is fatally flawed:  To cancel a subscription you have to navigate the fine print on several pages only to end up at a ""open chat or call us"" site to cancel. Then, despite being logged in, you have to enter your email address in the start-chat form. Then the representative first thing asks you for your email address to ""confirm identity""  That cheesy make-it-as-hard-as-possible-to-cancel policy is what I expect from a paper run by a Nigerian prince.",
"Increasingly bloated and slow, does not load photos past top of story, crashes after 15 or 20 minutes of use, only using the app because of the  white text on black background feature, web version better in every other way.",
"Do not buy this unless you love advertisements. I thought it was ridiculous that a paid app had so many ads, so I have rarely used it since I got a subscription. Luckily it was a complimentary 3 month subscription. I just looked at an article both online and in the app. The app had 15 ads and the web had 7. Seriously?",
It seems as if developers have not factored in smartphones that are more than a few years old. Crashes continually for no reason.,
Every thing I need to know on one great app. Thanks New York .,
Don't force me to make an account. Goodbye,
The new York time is the best news paper out there.,
Why are paid subscribers subjected to ads? This app should have a paid and Free version. The distracting ads make this app unusable.,
Crashes continually to the point of being almost unusable.,
Simple and clean interface with the best news.,
Why does this ap need to know what phone calls and numbers? I'm not upgrading.,
Great news from a reliable source.,
"I love NY times, it's free news app.",
"Timely news, so I like it.",
I want to delete this and cant please tell me how to get rid off it,
Why would I want this!? I live in the UK but can't delete off tablet,
I hate it,
Great reading,
Indispensable,
Great,
"I don't understand the people complaining about this app. Especially for the ads. Great journalism like this needs subscribers AND advertisers to do their valuable work. Its not some weather app nor some stupid game, these are journalists working one of the most important jobs in this country. People expecting the ads to disappear after paying 9.99/mo don't understand what a crisis old, irreplaceable media like NYT is facing. Keep up the good work.",
"Get off my tablet! This was installed on my tablet by force and I can't get it off as it's classified as a ""system app"". I don't care if Donald Trump just said something racist on twitter so stop trying to get me involved with worthless drama!!!",
Great articles like the layout of the app. Easy to find stuff has extra sections you don't find in print edition. Worth the subscription price.,
"I've disabled this app every couple of weeks  since I got this tablet.  I can't completely uninstall it, and it keeps reactivating notifications and reaccuring like a bad case of crabs.",
No longer allows you to login. Even though I'm a subscriber says I've reached article limit. Can login with browser but app rejects me. Time to cancel subscription.,
"The content is usually good. But don't get their subscription, they still serve ads all over and are harder to cancel than a gym membership. Awful...",
The update is draining my phone battery like crazy.,
Auto play video ads x(,
I have a subscription. I shouldn't have to see so many ads,
Solid good reporting without an agenda to make fake news.,
Expensive ! And not same pricing if I go thru kindle app. Strange! Why?,
Great app! Super recommend.,
Good !,
"Can't start the app. Says that it has expired. Tells me to update. Go to 
play store and it says I have latest version. Hilarious",
"After a recent update I'm having to reinstall the app after every session. 
It tells me you have an outdated version of the app but I've reinstalled 
daily for the last 7 days",
"When I try to open the app, it says I need to update it, leads me to Play 
Store page, where there is no update available. Pointless. Reading NYT in a 
browser is a lot more convenient.",
"Getting the error message 'This version of the application has expired. 
Please upgrade' even when I am using the latest version",
"The app is asking me to upgrade but I am not able to and I cannot use the 
app. I am stuck",
"Every day I have to uninstall and reinstall this app. Everyday I get the 
information ""This version (%s/%d) of the application has expired. Please 
upgrade."" Very annoying.",
it's just annoying,
"The app is very good. I wish the app on Android would allow us to customize push alerts according to section. If we could choose to have alerts pushed only for the book section for instance, or the movies section and so forth, or even a group of sections together would be great. Being limited to politics or breaking news alerts that I have no interest in is very frustrating. Please consider this in a future update.",
"The New York Times is an excellent news organization with on-point, accurate news and deep, insightful analysis of said news. One can listen to their podcast, read the latest news updates or just discover more about our world with their project, 52 places. And people complain about ads, but as a digital subscriber, I only see them occasionally on stories, and they are far from intrusive. Happy reading!!",
"The recent update broke the ability to recommend reader's comments. If one recommends a comment, they cannot recommend any others.  Navigation is not nearly as easy as with a computer's browser, but I guess that is to be expected.  In general, the app is stable and it presents the content as intended. I am pretty satisfied with it.",
"I am a longtime paid subscriber, but the ads have grown out of control and rendered this app unusable. They are big, bright, clunky, flashy, distracting and there are way too many of them. The app was supposed to be minimalist and pretty. It's not anymore. It's unusable, and I now prefer to read the paper in a web browser with an adblocker installed. I want the Times' content, want to read it on my tablet and am completely happy to pay to do so, but at this point the user experience is so bad that I don't see much point in paying for a subscription anymore. Why don't paid subscribers get a better reading experience? I'm giving it a few more months, but if it doesn't get better I'm going to cancel my subscription.",
"The app is a power hog.  The app is fine but I have two complaints. First, it's rather sensitive to side to side swipes to change articles, so I sometimes end up half way switching articles when trying to scroll. Second, and most important, the app drains the battery causing the phone to run hot and kill the battery life. Please look into ways to trim battery usage in future updates.",
"The best most usable news app on the world. Easy navigation, ability to save articles. Top quality writing. Wide range of viewpoints. Simply great.",
"I like the articles, but I HATE the notifications I keep getting even after turning off ALL notifications. Please stop it.",
Ads and popup surveys. Ridiculous way to treat paying subscribers,
Love NYT & their online format. Easy to read. Great articles.,
Uninstalling due to the NYTimes treatment of the obituary of Thomas S Monson,
Nice way to get updated!,
Why has a lot ads in middle of text??? It's awful to read something this way,
Love the in-depth reporting,
NOT USEFUL,
App drains battery.,
Very useful,
"Serves many and obtrusive ads even in the paid version, not acceptable in 2018.  I'm switching back to using the browser version again.",
"NYT digital version simply put is awful. Can't you create something with current stories, new stories first?. Why is a two day old story still listed in the top of the news? Hire someone who knows how to do a digital paper.",
This version of the app does not work with my Samsung Galaxy Pro 10.1 tablet which runs android 4.4.  Had to downgrade to an earlier version.  (the app kept closing and was unuseable)  Very disappointed as the NYT is a an impressive newspaper with so much diverse content.,
"Its not a bad news paper, compared with The UK's broadsheets. One thing that does annoy me is the absence of a one click ""cancel subscription"" button.  It turns out I am going to have to phone their UK sales office and speak to them.  A Somewhat old fashioned approached and time consuming.",
"The version of the app I have since updating about a month ago, no longer shows the scroll bar that gives you an idea of how long the article is and how much you have left to read. I dearly miss this feature and am frequently frustrated by its lack in my current app version  Edit: the developers so ever kindly fixed this issue. Back to loving the app!!",
"Great content and functionality on the app. My only criticism is that even the ""world"" section of the news seems to have largely US focused stories. I realize it is an American newspaper, but I would think the world section would have mostly international headlines. Overall it's a minor gripe as I just have to scroll through more US content",
I hate that you can only read a certain number of articles per month without buying a subscription.,
"When scrolling down on samsung galaxy s8 the bottom bar, the one with the home ans back buttons, keeps changing colors. It hurts my eyes with the constant color change between white and black.",
"The articles are great, but app sometimes has an annoying delayed scroll making it irritating to try to read.",
High CPU utilization. Fix or I'm terminating my sub,
"LOVE THE NY TIMES, HATE THIS APP!!!! I try to open day's headlines and it tells me I need to pull down and refresh. When I do that, I get a full page ad that I can't get rid of - ever! Don't mind ads I can scroll past, but this one blocks me from reading articles. $15/month and I have to be subjected to this bs? And no, I refuse to click on these ads!",
"I read some stories, really really disagree .",
Besides that the daily newspaper can't be read from this app the app is pretty solid,
Great articles & easy to use - loved the mini crossword puzzle too.,
I hated the constant notifications...,
Very informative and renders unbiased acct of events,
If I'm a paying subscriber why are you still showing me a bunch of ads in the app??,
Good app,
Liked it,
There isn't anything in here that you can't read somewhere else for free..... This app lost the privilege of being in my cell phone for trying to charge me,
"Double dipping much? You finally convince me to pay for a subscription, but I still get hounded with rediculous scam ads on your app and online. I'll be cancelling if this isn't changed because it betrays the values that your organization supposedly has. I expect ads if I'm not subscribing, but for the amount I'm paying I shouldn't be inundated ads. Bad form NYT. This is the first time I finally decided to subscribe to a newspaper and this will probably be my last.",
"I actually love the NY times. The app itself is functional and well designed, bugfree. The negative rating is due to the times's approach to ads. Multiple animated ads appear on a SINGLE page view, making it impossible to read, or at least highly frustrating. The Times would do well to take a page from the Economist's approach to serving ads.",
"I love the journalism that NYT offers. We need such sharp and incisive reporting in times like these, and in good times as well. Keep them coming!  Update: Changing it to 4 stars because they removed the scroll bar in the app. The scroll bar helped me figure out where I was within the article. Without it I have no way to tell how much of the article was remaining and if I was close to the end. I see no reason to remove the scroll bar, it is not a useless feature. PLEASE put it back!",
"My morning coffee companion! I love skimming through current articles, then stopping to thoroughly investigate those of more interest. I read another review that complained about ads. Apparently someone who has never read a print paper. Reality is that no newspaper or magazine could stay in business on just subscription prices without having prices so high no one would ever subscribe. Those ads pay for the hard work that goes into producing the articles and multimedia offerings we enjoy. I'm blown away by the variety of offerings provided.",
"Use to rely on local media, cause I didn't want to buy content. Took the plunge, I am soo Happy! I read every day! So informative  and breaks ground on new news. That I had no idea was important. Other than politics, the Times continues to bring great reporting from around the world!",
"One of the most reliable new sources out there.  The app isn't perfect, but the NYTs does an excellent job of reporting.",
"Despite the fact that I pay over $60 a month, I am forced to endure raucous, loud and battery-draining video ads.  They can't be turned off.",
The app is well organized and easy to read.  No search looses a star and  would loose another half if I could.,
"Yes, This So Very Awesome And Wonderful To Me It Helps Me Stay In Line And Updated $$Alway's.",
What happened to turn you into a pathetic excuse for a news outlet? I'm out and I'll spend my money and time elsewhere.,
Bring back the scroll bars? A recent update made them dissappear. Can't see right away now long an article is or my progress in the piece.,
Please bring back scroll bars!!! Really want to know where I am in an article.,
Better Experience and Happy  with it.! Thanks for giving us a  nice time.!,
Full of fake propaganda.. fake news,
"Absolute trash, never worked",
very good information New,
Nice,
Must have,
Battery hog,
"The app let's me read, but will not display the photos. It displays all the ads perfectly, but none of the in article photos with the exception of the very first photo at the top of the article. I've brought this to their attention multiple times but they don't seem to be doing anything to correct the problem. All my other news apps work fine.",
"Normally 5 stars, it works great offline, better than most news apps. However recently the app started crashing, and I get multiple breaking news alerts of the same story, usually 5 or 6 if I don't check my phone for awhile.  App might have been updated recently, not sure, but something broke.  I'm on a samsung s8",
"Same problem as others, I am a paying subscriber, but this app refuses to recognize me.  Weirdly, it does know if I enter the wrong password, but every month it locks me down after I reach the 5 article limit.  Very bad programming.  Fix it please.",
Irritating frequent notifications. Biased articles as almost all the news outlets have been seem more editorial than news. Very difficult to sort the news from the noise.,
Consistently forgets my log in..the only way to fix is delete and reinstall.  Help desk clueless. DONT BOTHER,
I am a paid subscriber and they're still cramming the articles with ugly and intrusive advertisements. My review stays at one star until they are removed.,
"I love the New York Times as a newspaper.  I love reading it and I like supporting it with a paid subscription, but this app serves ads with extremely distracting moving images that make it very hard to concentrate on what I'm reading.",
Ads periodically turn into a black box that covers the article and makes it impossible to read. I finally removed the app and decided I'm going to read NYT in chrome from now on.,
Just got off phone with renewal service and the manager said the Times would not fulfill the rate we were quoted two days earlier.  Very unprofessional.,
"Latest version does not display article images - advertisements show up, however - disappointing.",
"Doesn't work, I sign into my paid account but still get told I have reached my monthly article limit.",
Recent update makes the app crash with a dialog many many times a day. This happens when the app is not in focus. Often see if when just walking around the city - take out your phone and there is a crash dialog waiting for you.,
"Great, just wish there was an open in browser option, I currently have to text myself links.",
"New version keeps crashing, paying over $100 a year for this...do not buy",
very bad app its honest but at cost show some ad but charge to reader is not a good decision,
Doesn't keep subscriber login info straight forcing you to re-log in. Uninstalled it,
There are issues with the contrast in the recent version. The text is not readable on the homepage.,
"I've subscribed for years and use the app daily. In the last week (since early January 2018) the app began crashing multiple (5-20) times a day. I get error messages that the app has crashed even when it isn't open! I turned off all notifications, didn't help. If I force stop the app it helps for a while. (Until the next time I open the app and forget to force stop it). I'm really annoyed. The subscription is not exactly cheap.",
Hi i turned off notifications but it is still keep coming.  What can i do,
Does not update and articles can't be read.,
Multiple crashes on Android today.,
"13 euro a month to occasionally read a newspaper, good luck getting that",
Still photos consistently do not load when viewing articles on a Samsung NotePro12.2.,
Forced install on Samsung devices.,
"I got subsription and I must say.. Totally pointless. Too much ads in a paid subscription and I must say, they made me fed up so much, they are so intrusive, that I will just cancel it all. No Way!! Call to cancel subsription? Stay away!!!",
I really like the dark theme in the lab settings,
I don't want to subscribe a News App. I prefer donating them or... simply seeing ads instead of notifications like 'subscribe to get full article....',
Macke  me sharing and teaching with friends and family.,
Contains way more ads than the website.,
Yello W paint ankle .,
Read a few articles and now wants money to continue reading.,
Night mode temporary workaround seems to do the job.,
Wozt ever.... need subscription to news....,
great content & excellent layout,
Crashes all the time,
favorite!,
Drains too much data unlike other news app. Why does it take so much data to read a few articles?,
Fake news,
I love it here,
"I'm a subscriber, but in the app I keep getting an ad per page per article, so I'd rather just read in my browser with an ad blocker.",
New York!,
Not really free,
Ok,
"Ok so it seems clear as to why Trump hates this media outlet. No it isn't due to content. He clearly had to deal with their customer service. Which are horrible. They refuse to close your account and will retain your credit card on their site. They say that we, the customers are the only ones who can see this... But as with all other sites, I call bs. It's just calling to he hacked. I don't understand why sites no longer want to delete accounts nowadays. It's so disconcerting. Be wary when downloading this app. I didn't even provide my CC. It pulled it from my Google account I signed up with. It didn't even ask of it was ok to pull my Google cc to save to their file.",
After reading about how paid subscribers still are subjected to ads I will not be subscribing to the New York Times.,
Bundled with my Samsung tablet. 1 star because NY Times and Samsung have conspired together to prevent me from uninstalling it from MY device.,
I am a long time subscriber and love the quality journalism. Only problem recently is the night mode beta is causing erratic text colors that display alternating white and black backgrounds and light text on white backgrounds in story lists under each section. Please fix this ASAP.,
"Recently I've started getting a network error whenever I try to log in, which makes the app useless since my subscription is not recognized. Help desk did not fully read my help ticket, and thus has not been helpful.",
"I love NYT and my Sunday subscription, and the app is great...when it works! Even though it recognizes me as logged in, I'm constantly asked to subscribe and my article views are limited. I have to remove and reinstall the app constantly. So frustrating!!",
How dare you to show advertisement for paid subscribers?  ANY news you get on NY times you can get on ANY online free news site. Nothing special about it.,
not able to open the app after last update,
"I'm a subscriber I already pay for this. Stop with the video ads, and 
flashing ads. Save that for non-subscribers. Uninstalled",
Serving ads to paid subscribers is really obnoxious.,
Battery hog.  1% battery per hour.,
It's a great app for an awesome newspaper.,
Keep having to enter my log in credentials every time I click on an article!,
Why does an that needs subscription have so many ads,
Best app news.. Love it...,
A good source of information,
"Works well but wish it had a ""Today's Paper"" function so subscribers could have a replica of the print version.",
Very good,
No comments.,
Free or i wouldnt have it.....,
Hard to unsubscribe,
"update content more often and fix broken internal links!  sometimes it doesn't update for more than 24 hours... yesterday I uninstalled and re-download edited to jump start it. but there are many dead links (to other NYT articles) in today's Daily Briefing. Come on, guys, we pay for a subscription to see actual content!",
Typical biased opinion driven reporting. Great for the anti-Trump crowd. Disappointing if you're just wanting to keep up with current news.,
my name says it! also i just three free months. im on my first hour. im gonna uninstall and unsubscribe because if i make a comment. i dont want to wait for your cencors to approve it. post it whether you like it or not. seems you only care about political correctness and your opinion I am uninstalling this I don't care about 3 months subscription. Flipboard rules!!!!,
"While the news content is second to none,  the app presents content with a lot of animated ads and distractions that make reading difficult and frustrating. The Washington Post app does not distract the reader in this way. If it were not for this, the app would be great.",
"Got lured into 3 months free, then they started charging. If you try to cancel, it's a minefield trying to do it. I'm still not sure if I've managed to get rid of them?!  Good journalism spoilt by tacky sales techniques.",
"App is fine. But when you try to normalize Nazi's, I am not going to read your paper. Disgusting. Whoever gave the okay to run a fluff piece about a Nazi whould be fired.",
"I love the app, it is very convenient. However, I wish there was an option to view newest stories first so that I'm reading the most current stories instead of seeing similar stories all the time.",
Works well except for the three notifications I woke up to on the same story...,
Won't stop spamming me with notifications even I have set them all to off,
"An organisation that employs an UTTER ILLITERATE like Asgar Qadri, makes for a third class news source. So I am uninstalling this piece of s#!+......",
Wish it wasn't so expensive,
Widget disappeared,
Installation was First and efficient,
yeah,
Its bias new paper it's supporting terrorist nation like US and Israel,
One of the better newspapers in today's time.,
"This app is so slow and crashes so often, it has to be one of the worst out there.  It crashes about every other time I use it, and it can take a minute or more to load. Pictures often have to be opened in new windows and then the slow slog to reopen the article.  I came to Android from IOS recently and this app really has me baffled.  I won't renew subscription, but it's sad.",
"Easy to sign up, impossible to end subscription. While I love the quality of their reporting, holding readers hostage after starting a subscription is dirty.  I was unable to cancel The New York Times by phone, by chat, by email, by website, by Google Play subscriptions, within the Google Play App, by Google play support, by Google Payments Center, or within the New York Times App!  Finally was able to terminate the subscription fee within PayPal via the PayPal website.   It took me three months to figure that out. There was no information anywhere, no official website, no forum, nada, nowhere.",
"Great news and information, but the app itself is unstable. It crashes regularly, fails to update appropriately, and often fails to pull up articles. Frustrating.",
This last update has bugs. The ListView is not generating properly(some whites and some blacks). Please make the devs look into this.,
I just cancelled my NYT digital subscription due to the disturbing trend of articles normalizing Nazis and other proponents of hate. So I don't need this app anymore.,
THE VERY BEST THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ANY MEDIA AND MAINSTREAM PUBLISHING HOUSE IN THE WORLD OF TODAY .....  KEEP IT UP .,
"The reporters like Asgar Quadri are writing non sense articles, so uninstalled this app",
Fake News Propaganda for the far left and Soros. Listen to Trump. MAGA!,
"I received a free 3 months of NYT from Google as a ""local guide"" and was amazed by New York Times. They are an incredible, in depth, and high quality news source.",
"Too many ads.   I'll just bookmark the webpage.   Much cleaner, less annoyance",
"Love the quality of the reporting BUT way too many ads for a subscription I pay for- one article I just read had 21 ads as I scrolled down and some have annoying videos, really frustrating when I'm happy with the news content I pay for",
Will not support news organizations that sympathize with Nazis. Uninstalling,
"Performs well, attractive design, great journalism.",
The Best app for op eds!,
"Keeps freezing and crashing, used to work fine",
App works well but there shouldn't be ads if you are a paid subscriber,
When you subscribe they still show ads.....,
It says it free so why do they want you to sign up for a free week. Then pay to use... it's either free or it's not...,
Biased News,
Cool,
"Generally I like this app, and it is done better than many other news apps (plus it has VR, etc. though I do not use on phone). However, it would be nice for app to use SDCARD rather than gobbling up internal. But we live in a world of apps who want to own the phone, and where users have to constantly be removing some just to get other updates to run. BTW; 4 stars for this app for those without ""storage"" issues.",
"It is incredibly frustrating that every article viewed on the web shows a content-blocking popup saying ""read this in the app it's better'. First, it's not better at all. Second, I'm a long time paying subscriber who wants to read articles in the browser - please respect my choice!",
Keep getting warnings that this app is draining my battery. Samsung says I can save 10% a day by disabling it from notifications,
One of the main concerns I have is that it is hard to find the past articles I already read or was notified about. I like how its organized. There are always notifications to keep you updated.,
Periodically when it updates it will not allow me to sign in and I have to call customer service. Have to search for their number.,
"jerky movement when scrolling, makes it difficult to read articles.  app delays almost a full second before executing scroll command.  tried reinstalling, same problem.",
"Signed up on Google home promo, support kept saying the codes are being sent out and three months later no one agreed on anything and decided to not refund me, or provide the code. Support literally just drops the chat LOL",
"I like the style and feel of the O.P. system,aside from that historically speaking,The NY Times is must read  The editor takes chances and backs his reporter's",
Impossible to link your Kindle subscription to the app. No option provided. Worthless.,
Since the 6.13.5 update there are continual crashes with the Galaxy Note 8.,
Great for content but gets buggy on my Samsung tab3 which can get infuriating.,
Pretty good Little by little the NYTimes is doing what it takes to survive in the 21st century.,
Unparalleled investigative journalism and mob-type opinion section. Pick your poison,
$12 a month and I still get ads.,
"Great app, works well and provides a really great way to catch up on the news during my commute!",
Racist screed -- fake news orifice,
"I have an up to date subscription and I am logged in, but I keep getting a paywall.",
"all apps feal a bit sketchie in regards to the news, but the NY times has gotten it right this long",
Airpushes wouldn't link to the article.,
The app resets to the top of articles on screen rotations.,
Amazing app but add live tv option 👍,
Its good just the subscription charge was completely unnecessary.,
Useless Bloatware,
Horrible app,
HOW CAN I FIND MY SAVED AERTICLE IN APP?,
Good,
Latest news,
Articles not loading,
Gd,
"Lately, photographs have been out of order.   I subscribe to both print and online versions. This app is so useful that the printed news is ""old news"" when the print edition is delivered. Rarely use Google News now. Use the ""night setting"" in options for a nice easy-to-read look. Easy to navigate. Breaking news alerts pop up. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to access the NTY via this app. I would give it 5 ""thumbs up"" if I had 5 thumbs.    PS: The bad reviews of this app seem to be from non-subscribers using the trial version.",
"Please, please, please make it possible to receive notifications by user preference, instead of all or nothing at the editors' whims. If I could get 1-2 per day, tops, I'd be a lot less inclined to disable notifications. A ""digest"" option to highlight relevant stories at a specific, user-defined time each day would be perfect!  Sick of being interrupted any time POTUS says something else stupid, or weather occurs a thousand miles away.",
A great way to read the NYT. Refreshes frquently and never a hang up with Android phone. Loads fast and is interactive. I use it and wouldn't go without it.,
"New media on this app is highly problematic. The 360 videos never work and as of the end of September 2017, the mini-crossword has become extremely glitchy.",
"This app crashes a lot. We pay good money for the nytimes, and this app is unacceptable.",
Im in Pakistan and cant pay in dollars. So i have just few articles each month to read. I get a sense about daily happenings in the US though. It helps me in staying abreast with global news and issues. Thanks NYT,
Great app with insightful content.  It's very easy to find any type of article.  I especially like the 360 degree videos that go to far flung places like Antarctica,
Rock solid news. Intelligent and challenging  opinion pieces. With some fun culture articles thrown in as well. My first go to for news.,
"Great reporting, excellent interface. My only issue that is during huge news stories, the app seems dominated by one subject.",
The Times is a godsend for honest accurate and timely real news. POTUS attempts to denigrate honest journalism must not prevail,
"Thanks Google, for the NY Times 3 month subscription! I already love the stories and the way the app is designed to be search and user friendly!",
Ever so sorry I updated this two or three versions back. Comments ARE STILL NOT interactive. Articles freeze.,
"Always have been a reader since my days at JHS 217R, Queens, New York. My lunch money was a quarter, which I would usually save to buy NYT on the way to School",
"I love the daily mini crossword, and having all the interesting news that I feel I can trust right at my fingers",
I read the NYT every chance I get but at least once a day every day.  It provides me with the knowledge I need to go through my day at work or at play. NYT is investigative journalism at its best.,
Its great but I'm using it for a current event and it doesn't give me a link to the article on the web,
"To my knowledge, the NY TIMES has articles that attract readers, who want the truth. The reporters  are not intimidated.",
"Best news app, reliable, timely, and on point. The interface is really clean and navigation makes sense. Daily Brief is really useful if you don't have time to read up on everything. Also, the developers are active and they actually put freaking release logs! Love this!",
"Balanced, clear journalism, engagingly presented. Worth the subs. Interesting angles on world news, not just America.",
"Intuitive, well-designed app that makes finding and navigating through stories and sections easy.",
"Excellent, can't do without it. I only wish there were an in-app shortcut to the cooking section, too.",
Amazing stories and top-notch journalism keeps you reading on after starting 1 article.  A Pleasure to read!!!,
"Reliable, a simple interface, easy navigation. Adding a full crossword would make it even better!",
Great app for both quick reading and longer articles. No pictures when offline. A discount for students!,
"Other than the ulcer and sleep disorder I've developed from the breaking news alerts, I'm very appreciative of this app for keeping me up-to-the-minute informed with the apocalypse.",
"This app advertised that you could read news with it. You can, so, 5 stars.",
I enjoy having The New York Times at my disposal every day: quick and easy!,
It would be much better if it can integrate the Chinese version into the app as the Spanish version.,
Evening Briefing is great. Entire app works as promised.,
"Can't live without it. Brilliant writing,  superb columns, life changing insights.",
"The most trustworthy news, reliably delivered.",
Convenient and easy to use. I love it!,
The best journalism you can find,
Wonderful app that starts my week off right.,
"Well organized, easy to use, reliable - I use it all the time.",
Pay for journalism. NYT is the best there is and the app works well.,
The news app I know I can depend upon.,
Best source of news on the web. App is easy to use,
Everything I need today!,
"Great articles. Love Down, Krugman, and more",
The best news source.,
Superb app. With high calibre reporting,
Way better than the WaPo app,
Easy to use. Daily mini crosswords are a bonus.,
Good app.  Great journalism.,
"Excellent,  no glitches, smooth operation, limited resource usage. Well - written.",
Awesome App..👍👍 but Plz  enable voice reader on this app too like any other; would be grateful if u guys fulfil my wish.. Make it ASAP...,
Great once you subscribe to the newspaper online.,
One of my three go-to morning reads,
Love the app - easy to navigate,
Excellent way to read the times.,
I don't want to pay when they said its free,
Its so biased... Not even worth reading.,
Love New York Times!,
Lots of choices in checking out stories. Works well on my small screen.,
Use it daily.  Love it,
Wonderful app and great travelling,
Nytimes and its app are the best,
Nytimes is the greatest paper in the country,
Easy to read.,
Too expensive,
Awesome.,
Well done,
Great app,
Very good,
Great,
Works well!,
Good,
Excellent,
I like it.,
autist,
Won't let you sign in with Facebook unless you share your friends list. Totally invasive and I don't appreciate my account being held hostage since I'm paying money. Only app I've ever payed for and still had advertisements too. Unless I'm missing something you can't find your daily briefing again if you close the app.,
"Great app, the individual articles load up so much more quickly than the old way, it's a real pleasure to read now. I miss the ability to load up a story in a new tab though, and I haven't seen a way to reload a section without scrolling up to the top or reloading in a new section and returning to the previous section. I hope you fix these issues in your next release.",
"App is very quick to load, well organized, and intuitive for those used to print newspapers. I find it somewhat frustrating that stale stories sometimes disappear when I click on them, so -1☆ for that (I think the links should be chained, even if the article shifts placement or gets updated from the initial alert). Otherwise, a near perfect app for Android. Subscriber for about 6 months now, in support of their renewed, vigorous journalism, and now can't live without a daily check-in.",
"Absolutely the best & easiest way to get whatever level of news you want! From skimming headlines to delving deep into the background of a trending story; you can have your news tailored to your specifications. The ease of app is ground-breaking.  Visual pieces, including 360° video & photographs are extraordinary. This is what great journalism and cutting edge technology is all about. It's simply a joy to have it all in the palm of your hand.  Get full access! You'll not regret it. Know that the NYT supports bringing news & information to students across the globe.",
"The NY Times app is a great reader with excellent content from one of the world's leading news sources. News is a big part of the experience but with the breadth of subject matter you'll be hard-pressed to limit yourself to just news. I enjoy the daily mini crossword puzzle, curated and archived recipes for cooking are worth the price of subscription alone. The biographical and historical material is really par none. This is an excellent app with excellent content that keeps providing greater and greater value.",
Been using a week and It's the best newsreader out there. Cannot find my saved food recipes on the S8+ android version. Almost needs a short manual as I inadvertently discover new features like offline reading.,
"Great app to read the US's main newspaper of record  The content of the Times is unbeatable (some other papers are close, or better in specific areas, but none is better overall). This app is a terrific way to read it. I've stopped even getting the paper version.",
"As a complement to a digital Times subscription this app is wondrous. I. Love. It! I marvel at the writing and creativity of the Times' material from headlines to Opinions and cooking features. But all this would be locked away from me in the printed version if not for the incredible app that synchs up seamlessly with e-mailed notifications, allows for bookmarking etc and even surpases a standard newspaper with inspiring video content like the 360*. I gave up printed papers years ago and this app finally makes that decision look and feel like a ""no-brainer""",
"Terrific app that takes me right to the articles I need to be informed quickly.  Super helpful on days when I'm not plugged in to my computer, but still want to stay apprised of what's going on in the world.  Very easy to navigate.  Love the mini crossword as well!",
"Thank you, NYT. Just thanks for the increasingly intrepid reporting, skilled & masterful writing and attention to fact-based evidence. Please continue the thankless work of holding power accountable. We need you more than ever.",
"NyTimes has always been my standard, through Journalism classes and the two southern newspapers I've worked at. The job I dreamed of.",
"Google login is broken.  App is acting like I'm on an expired trial, but the same Google login works fine for NYT in a regular browser.",
I love the ease in which the articles are presented and the look.  I bought a subscription thanks to Mr Trump hating it so much.  :).,
"Only flaw was the app no longer allowed me to comment online, which I think is a major flaw, BUT THEY FIXED THAT.  The opportunity to read latest news accurately, and opinion news when I have a free moment is priceless.And sending articles to others or posting them on Facebook or other social media is fast and foolproof. Only drawback is that others can't read articles without paying. I think if I post people should be able to read, that's how you get new subscribers. They don't ALL ALWAYS  trust my judgment that I picked the best stuff!",
"Liberal pukes but a great app. I read it for 1 reason ""Know Thy Enemy"" which the NYT is",
"A good source of news with ten free articles per month. Unfortunately, does not give the opportunity to read or skip the article.",
"Thank you, New York Times,  for providing us with the breaking news, for illustrating within a single app the complex beauty and horror, the juvenile and the mature, the heart-rending and the and the sublimity of life in all its multi-factorial, multi-valent permutations.  I appreciate you immensely.  Thanks for all that you do--seen and unseen.",
"App itself works fluidly and crash - free. Presents a great representation of the print version, and has a diversity of articles that make it worthwhile. Its the 'Times so what can you say. One of the best in the Nation for comercial, main stream print.",
"I cannot start my day without this app.  Great succinct rundown of everything that's important, complete with 2 minute mini-crossword.  You can share articles and pics, plus cut and paste key info when needed.  It's a delight for international travelers....",
Much improved since I complained 2 months ago about stale news.  As a longtime subscriber I am relieved NOT to see multiple pix of POTUS on every page. Disaster coverage is 1st rate in last 3 weeks.,
"The NYTimes app should be your go-to news app. Regardless of your interests or needs, all are easily and quickly accessible. I appreciate the daily summaries, the categorization, and scrolling and swiping features.",
"Every morning and evening there is a  briefing that is a list of all the important things happening around the world in a variety of fields. I feel that most articles are well written and present facts to back up claims. I also enjoy the daily mini crossword, of course!",
I begin every day reading the top articles and refer to the NYT throughout the day.  Keeps me up-to-date and informed on all the big issues.,
"Love my NY Times app. In-depth reporting, easy to search, instant updates of important news, great op-eds, 3-D videos, and the greatest reader comments of any newspaper. I refer to my app multiple times daily: wouldn't like to live without it!",
"I stopped watching the nightly news shows; they were ruining my evenings. This app allows me  to stay on top of national and world events, read editorials, and remain informed any time I wish. I no longer have to choose between ignorance and sanity!",
"The world's best newspaper working to create the world's best news site.  I miss the paper, but don't miss the waste.  I love the brilliant and beautiful interactive charts and graphics that can't be presented in hard copy.  Gorgeous photography. And the editorial content of the New York Times.",
"Great source for information. I read the paper, but use this app for all its award winning content e.g. video and informatics.",
"In these times, I rely on the New York Times for news I can trust. I love getting breaking news alerts on my phone. I also appreciate the NYT's compilations of reports from other sources on all sides of the political spectrum.",
I am not a tech literate person so I  know about any  of the ?'s about cast but I  do enjoy being able to read the news without waiting for a paper that would have to be mail delivery so no holidays or Sundays. I got a good deal on the price also so I am very happy with the NYT.,
"Enjoying for the past couple of weeks. Stories are quite relavant and on ""Time"". Would like an option to open stories in a browser for independent posting to social media.",
"I do like this app, however, and this is what irritates me, once you watch a video, it disappears. The app also doesn't allow the paid user to search for content  For instance, this morning I watched an Opinion video regarding Facebook and how it controls content. How, for instance, in Kenya, it's offering free internet access through Facebook, but controls its content. I wanted to share to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, just everywhere I could, but once I watched the video, POOF! Gone!   I would like the app techs to add a search option (without having to go to the actual website online), and I would like to see an option that has an area allowing the user to see what articles, videos, etc., a user has looked at.   I'll update and give 5 stars if you fix that. NYT app techs please respond providing information how to do the foregoing if I have overlooked the foregoing. If I haven't overlooked, olease provide a fix to this app including the above options. Thank you.",
This is the most convenient way to read the NYTimes when you are not on your personal computer. Breaking news come straight to my attention via notifications. I highly recommend this app.,
"I'm a fan of the newspaper, however the app is crushing my battery and I have to uninstall. Google pixel",
I loved this app until it started crashing constantly about 2 weeks ago. My digital subscription is essentially a waste of money at this point.,
"Great news app from the NYT. Easy to find and save articles, user friendly interface, special features like video and links to other articles.",
"Works well on my Moto g except for occasional freezing. Sometimes the photos don't match the articles, especially if the app has been open for a while.",
"I ❤ this App 😍very smart and well designed it's a real pleasure reading the top breaking news  and the articles all the way from Sydney . However, this app is a free trial at the moment.  Why is it rated 3.9 though? should be higher ratings i think.  Would i want to pay $14.99 per month afterwards? Not sure at this stage. 😍",
"I wish my local paper's app was half as good. Rarely a problem when I use it. Or never, really. I've used it for two years or more. LATER: Now three years or more using it. Rarely a glitch.",
A great way to get news... until it started continually crashing every time I open it,
"Easy to use, breaking stories, love the features especially cooking, and well thought out editorials. Love it, one of my must reads several times per day",
Start my day by opening this app. Too bad there isn't an option to filter out Trump.,
"Morning and evening highlights are great for catching up, notifications are nice for breaking news, and I love the ability to read related articles when I finish one.",
"Excellent reporting. Intelligent and respectful notifications. Clean app that makes articles easy to read, navigation enjoyable and efficient, and interfacing with email links seamless. Gold standard.",
Love the convenience and access of having a great news source on my phone. Days wouldn't be the same without morning briefing,
I've been using the app a very long time but  suddenly only  the lead photo  of the article loads. The rest of the photos  in the article just show a placeholder,
"Very nice user interface, easy to navigate. One of few apps that do not look like sloppy copy of their website. You can do easily what you can on desktop/laptop.",
"The app is fine, its the negativity, anti American rhetoric, and distorted reporting that makes it painful to read.",
"Of the three apps I've tried for news, this is the best. NPR app doesn't let you see the entire synopsis of a story notification. WaPo was draining my battery. NYT app is perfect. I've had zero problems.",
"Very easy to use, move around from articles, categories. My favorite is the backdated stories listed at bottom of the articles. You can read history of the current subjects back many years. Awesome!",
Main problem for me is video content. For some reason NYT videos are very slow to load.,
"Loving this every day. Relevant, quality content - only one article from reading hundreds has left me critical of how the quotations were presented.",
I love the daily briefings on the most important issues of the day. It helps me keep informed without being overwhelmed by a barrage of articles. A really useful app!,
"Easy to use, relevant stories, breaking news alerts. One simply can't wish for more features",
"While I prefer to read the NYT on my Kindle, this is a good backup. It's nice to see photos. And there is some content that isn't in the Kindle edition. Easy to use.",
"Best mainstream news site in the U.S. Comprehensive coverage of issues. Great features, like the puzzles and Nytimes Cooking.",
I read NYT on my app every day to keep up with the news. I cannot imagine life without it.,
"Very up to date reporting, clear articles with impartial reporting seems to give you the options on everything said at the time and allows you to make an informed decision on how you feel about what is being reported on, not biased. Very happy with this on my phone.",
"No matter where in the world I am, with the New York Times I have up to the minute news. It's wonderful.",
Wide variety of articles. I'm very interested in reading comments by other readers.  It gives me hope that there are still many thoughtful and intelligent people that care about truth and the good of humanity. Thank you to all who take time to write.,
"Maybe the best newspaper in the world, and still noticeably improving. The app brings all of it to the reader.",
Not real time ; if you desire it write on rohingya issues in Myanmar ( Burma),
"If you value quality news - and now is the moment to do so - the Times app offers an accessible, clear take on news/opinions/lifestyles.",
"Prompt in-depth reporting available from a huge staff of trained journalists. We subscribe also to the paper version, but the digital is quickly overtaking it with the exception of Sundays.",
Downloaded the app after receiving a 3 month promo code to only be capped at the 10 articles a month limit. Dishonest promotional tactics and I will not be continuing with this service.,
"App needs to reset to the top of the page when you click on the section header. If I'm in the middle of ""top story"" articles, when I click on the ""top stories"" header, the app should scroll to the beginning of that section (like wapo).",
New York Times is one of the best news apps there is. Always reliable and interesting information. I overwhelmingly support New York Times.,
"Pretty straightforward, great to keep you updated. I specially enjoy the ""news to start your day"" push, sent every morning.",
"This is a great news service. Limitless options  The daily is great. Unable to find ""The new Washington"" tho. Podcast service is on time every morning.",
"I never expected that the NYT app would be better than the website, but it is.  Simple to navigate. Easy to read stories.  Easy to save for future reading, or to share with friends.  Well worth subscribing.",
Very easy to use. There's a lot of information accessible on the fly or if you have time to dig in. I'm on it several times a day.,
"I am a digital subscriber. Love the variety and quality of content. I have a very long mass transit commute, and the NYT app keeps me informed and entertained.",
Running on Samsung GS6; use it daily; love the little x-word; always appreciate the videos and 360s; welcome back Night Mode!,
"App has improved a lot recently. I just miss some functionalities like: beeing able to play the article on audio (something available some time ago), customizing the sections order of appearance, and an algorithm to recommend top news according to my reading history.",
This app is very clean and easy to use. The key of course is to have a New York Times  Digital subscription so that you can use it to its fullest capability.,
"Very informative and trustworthy source , updated regularly,  all breaking news and in depth analysis is covered . Mini crossword rocks.",
I wish I could share articles to my friends however messanger (Android smart phone) won't allow.,
The one issue I have with this app is that it chews up a lot of battery on my Samsung.,
I find the best news and the most intelligent comments here. I love the recipes in the cooking section. I enjoy seeing the red carpet fashions in arts and entertainment section as well as the reviews! The real estate section is interesting. This is a huge publication that is worth every penny! Nothing else compares.,
Awesome app being able to keep up to date with world news. Much better than our local paper. Thank you!,
Refreshes indepth Worldwide News events throughout the day. Interesting and varied  catergories of information  for personal selection.  Love the quick daily crosswords and intriguing recipes that can be personalize. Easy usage  a def keep.,
Downloads the articles in the early morning so I can read them on the subway - a staple of my day. Great app.,
"Gives you peace of mind that you've gotten a good national and world summary in one place, Plus a quick, fun crossword puzzle!",
Only minor quibble is that notifications appear in the middle of the night. US politics is not conducive to restful slumber.,
I have depended on The New York Times for decades as my main news source. I find the app easy use and it keeps me updated on breaking news.,
The NY Times provides me timely updates on all key issues. The app is dependable and well organized.,
"good app, but it is not user friendly in helping you to find links to other nyt features, such as nyt cooking.",
I rely on access to NYT and their format makes smartphone viewing better than most. The paper is the most important in the   US,
Difficult to search. No night mode. The actual reading materials quite good,
I like the cross section of news the Times presents. The format of the content makes easy reading and whilst there are ads embedded they are not obtrusive.,
"Good app,  my only other option is the local  mullet wrapper. And the newer version is even better.  Support free press and real news",
Simple to use and nice alerts for breaking news and areas of interest.  Also like the AM and PM news wrap-up and associated podcast if I don't have time to sit and read.,
Great source for breaking news. Fantastic journalism and the app makes it a breeze to browse.,
NYT is my main source of news. I'd give five stars if the app could remember my spot in the article or feature when switching between portrait and landscape mode.,
"Well designed app, easy to use, good interface and runs smoothly. Obviously, only download if you like the Times.",
I got a free 3 month subscription from Google. I accepted it because it was free. What good could the New York Times be to a guy from western Canada I thought. The paper has great articles about stories that affect everyone. I will subscribe once my free period ends.,
The Times app is my de facto daily paper in the weekday mornings. Since I leave the house before our hard Times reaches the stoop I can depend on the Times app to get me started with my day!,
"Great app, good paper - the leftist slant both amuses and saddens me.",
You just can't beat the times for comprehensive objective news. Simply the Best.,
I love waking up to a morning briefing and going to bed with an end of day briefing every single day! Love the layout and vivid images. Can't be without it!,
"Love!! The New York Times app. It keeps me up today on all the latest news, from the local to the world news.",
"I like news that is more factual, and is founded on real investigation. The NYT App gives me world-class opinion, too, from writers who understand their subject matter.",
"Easy to read without the fancy graphics of the WashPost (which are handsome but distracting). Too many videos, a common distraction with all news sites. (If I want video there's always CNN or TV.)",
"If you don't have a subscription you can still read 10 Times articles a month, which is how I got hooked and bought a subscription. Great decision on my part!",
"This app continues to be improved and is a pretty good mix of informative headlines, video clips and access to articles off the beaten path",
Recent update has a lot of image-headline mismatches on the section homepages. Still this is quite a decent app and I really appreciate the offline reading function.,
"Great source of information for a wide variety of topics.  There's been some bugs once in awhile but they fix them.  Aside from politics, there's an incredible amount of good-to-great info about 'everything'.  What a great value!",
"Got the app free for 3 months as a Google contributer,  I'm using it regularly, and enjoy the content.",
The nyt app is fantastic. Notifications are not overbearing and when they do appear it's for important pieces of news .,
"Top shelf journalism, commentary covers many points of view. Excellent photos and overall layout too.",
I start every day reading the New York Times in bed on my phone. I really like the format of the mobile version of the Times.,
Excellent content. I expect far fewer ads for a paid application.,
"Great app, I actually find it easier than reading the news online on the nyt website. Can't change widget font size, tho",
"Especially with the worrisome Trump situation,  I appreciate the NYT' thorough reporting.",
"Great app! Quick to update content and load. User interface totally in sync with the print edition and website. Even though we do get the actual paper, I find I read the Times 60% through the app and 30% through the website. This is wouldn't be possible if the app quality were lacking compared to that of the website - which is the case for some other digital content. Given the very high quality of the NYT website, this says a lot about the app...",
"I pay for a subscription, log on, and continue to get the 'please subscribe' when attempting to read any articles.  Quite annoying (Google Pixel w/ Oreo).",
Easy to navigate. Does not overwhelm the reader with excessive information unasked.,
"I love this app. I get the breaking news, excellent features in health, science, and other non political news. Easy-to-use, I can swipe back and forth, and I love the internal links. A winner.",
"Good content presentation, decent low level of ads for subscribers, reasonable level of news alerts and of course respectable journalism.",
Lead paragraphs give fuller information than most other news apps. Well sectioned and easy to use.,
"With the exception of Judith Miller and the 2003 Iraq war, the NYT's is cutting edge investigative journalism at its finest !",

Easy to use and great content. The New York Times app is an exemplar of what all news apps should be.,
The NYT is delivered seamlessly in a complete and easily navigable form through this app: the best media app I use,
All great except that the comments api keeps pulling repeat comments after you tap the LOAD MORE COMMENTS button.,
Good for breaking news and easy and comfortable to read articles in depth. Not all articles are easily available.,

"Critical reading to start and inform my day, each and every day. Great photos and videos, too.",
"I like the hard news coverage, articles, and opinion pieces.",
Preinstalled on tablet can't uninstall. Is very fake news.,
I can't live without it. And they've made it progressively more user friendly.,
Great app with professionally done journalism. The ability to automatically download stories for offline reading is phenomenal.,
"I used love reading a paper newspaper, but this makes it so easy to browse from one story to the next, plus the videos, plus the 360s, plus ....",

"A sturdy, well done, reliable and easy to use app from an essential source of information.",
Good app though I like Washington Post's better.,
Latest version crashed repeatedly rendering it unuseably. I have a digital only subsctiption. If I can't read the Times digitally then what's the point of paying for that subscription? Fix it. I've sent several crash reports,

"The need for supporting strong investigative journalism has never been so imperative.   Edit: The app was great, and the journalism was top notch. However if you want to cancel your subscription you have to call them and withstand a barrage of questions as to why. Not a consumer friendly business practice at all.",
"Subscribed to the free trial, and didn't really like it that much but to unsubscribe you have to call a number where you're left on hold. The fact that they make it so hard to unsubscribe when all other apps make it easy to unsubscribe is very frustrating.",
"Why does Google allow people who clearly do not read the NYT just spout off ""fake news"" etc. The NYT is a gift. I couldn't function without the in depth articles, even those negative toward HRC, which a real reader would know. Google, why do you allow these ""fake reviews"" from nonreaders?",
"Easy to get top stories, breaking news and informative article. Well written opinion pieces, too.",
"Keeps me up to date with all the latest news and opinions as well superb photojournalistic pieces on the terrible and beautiful world around us.  Recipes, fashion, art, book and TV reviews as well as my fave a mini crossword.",
New York Times is very bias and quite liberal. I can't comment on any letters because I support Trump.,
"As a news consumer for 30+ yrs. The Times, the Post (Washington NOT NY) and the WSJ are the best printed news sources in the country, probably the world.",
"If you like information you will ADORE this app - it feeds your craving for knowledge, is easy to navigate and presents well.",
"The NYT Android app is clean and simple, just like the news service's other multimedia platforms. Expect a seamless experience, with logical in-app navigation.",
"Editing my old 1* review up to 3*. The app works well enough, but every time I use it and then put it in the background, I receive a ""high battery usage"" warning from Android and have to force kill the app.",
Fake news. Designed to divide and distract us from what's really going on.,
An improvement I would love is for the home screen widget to bring be to the homepage of the NY times. From what I read so far the articles are the best I've found and the app is very well layed out.  Top marks there just one improvement I would really appreciate.,
"To many obtrusive ads, especially given you're paying to subscribe.",
I love the way loads of different stories are summarized for your reading and preference.,
Nice clean interface with very readable fonts. One of the best news apps!,
"Very nice format, easy to skim through to what I want to read about.",
You don't need to be American to appreciate this informative newspaper.,
Overall great! Would like a search function please.,
I love getting news that I trust as quickly as it breaks!,
"Great app, keeps me well informed. Highly recommend.",
Ads!! Ads!! Ads!! If you're excited about buggy power sucking ads and don't really care about news then this is the app for you!,
This app is a must have!,
Doesn't connect to my account. Reading other reviews seems like a common theme.,
Great content.  App has performed flawlessly.,
I wish it updated without pushing notices.,
Very complete and easy to use.,
Really like how the app is setup...,
Failed to connect to my account,
My go-to news source!,
Great Journalism and reporting.,
So far very good,
I love it.,
Very informative,
Good,
good,
More than 6 times out of 10 it says unable to load the story.   Not a desirable message when you're a paying customer.   As of 9/2/17 the problem is no longer occurring.  Thanks much!,
"For years I have relied on our paid subscription to the NY Times and the app has been my go to for news. But over time it just feels like the Top articles aren't news-driven, and are chosen by an inexperienced intern who doesn't really know what news is. Probably.going to switch to Washington Post for awhile, the NY Times right now feels like it's by and for high schoolers.",
I keep myself informed with this daily and we have a print subscription for the weekend too!  The TIMES is real news not fake news.  The antidote to Fox news.,
"Love the app! Helpful and push notofications for breaking news are relevant and not overly annoying. Also, new night mode is great for someone like me who prefers less bright lights. Nicely done.  Question: I used to get a push notificston for my morning briefing every day and now I don't. Can you change that?",
"wow! what a pos! i was not sure at first whether to believe the stories, but now i tried it out and am completely disgusted! worst news source ever with annoying notifications, ads and pushy content! and the app is so slow and unusable. horrible!",
"Loved this app until I just updated. Now, every time I try to share an article it crashes. Plz do something about this!",
"The app is fine. I'm having an issue using it though. I'm a subscriber through Google play and the app is constantly telling me I need to subscribe, despite my subscription not even being two weeks old. It was working fine until yesterday.",
"Live in Florida yet N.Y. Times has me staying up to date with the latest news, u can take me out if NY, yet u can't take NY outta me!!!!",
I think i am the only man in the world that honestly luvs taylor alison swift...will u j.ber my children....god willin u remember me in armada,
This app is very helpful. I can find anything which is important to me. And the installation of apps is very easy.,
"Am a subscriber. App works on my phone, but does NOT recognize my subscription on my Samsung tablet. Keeps asking me to login (I am) or to subscribe for further access. What's up with that? Did email your feedback line to fix it. We'll see!",
Nothing but unpatriotic trash with a political civil war agenda.,
I appreciate journalism that I trust and realize the hard work that it requires to produce. THANK you.,
NUT is my news anchor each day.,
"It isn't the paper, but it's not bad at all.",
Video ads ruin experience,
FAKE NEWS!!!!,
Great way to keep up,
Great,
nyc app,
O K,
"Avid user (NYC local and need good journalism) - it's the main utility for my phone - but on Galaxy S8 it's sucking up mobile data like crazy,  even after turning off all background activity. When I hear this is not the new norm maybe I'll reinstall. For now,  I don't need close calls with my data limits when all I want to do is read the news. Good bye NYT, I don't know what I'll do without you, but it has to be this way.",
Great reporting and top notch journalism from NYT! The app has a nice look & feel. There are quite a few ads that clutter things up. My biggest complaint is that if I subscribe I feel as though I should not see any ads. Most apps do this - or at least offer a subscription level that removes ads. Please consider this.,
Piece of absolute trash. Crashes constantly. Articles wouldn't load until app is forced stopped and restarted. Rip the programmer's arms from his ass and move their point of attachment somewhere closer to the shoulders before continued development.,
"Apart from the use of poor English, surely there is more news than Trump. Since his inauguration, there has been very little reporting on the rest of..... A very expansive land! Don't you think? There must be more interesting things to write about than a grown man throwing his toys out of the pram. To quote: 'Sad'",
"New York Times, despite any protestations to the contrary by right-wingerd, remains the nation's paper of record.",
"With the latest update I can load articles but they freeze once I try to scroll down, making it impossible to read more than the first few paragraphs.",
"Generally a good app, but they have stated to include distracting, data-hungry video advertising in the middle of stories. Very annoying in an app I pay a weekly subscription for.",
every time I open an App this bloody App takes over.I don't have it installed. So how do I stop you from taking over my phone. Can anyone help get rid of this PEST,
I think this app is great. I just wish for threefeature. One would be a dictionary embedded into the news by highlighting the word and selecting to search on Google or by dictionary and maybe also a find word option so I can find certain places in the news. Also if I can heilight then look at my highlights like a label that would be great. Make it more physical news in a digital medium,
"I won't comment on the content of the app, but the application itself is top-notch. It's seamless, and has so many features that work bug-free. Kudos to the devs 👍",
Latest update makes scrolling in articles sticky. Dumping cache and data provides momentary relief at best. Please fix.,
"Night Mode option is BACK, BABY! Thank you for replying to my previous feedback. Fantastic app with unparalleled content. I'm a very happy subscriber.",
The stories continuosly kick out.  You cannot uninstall and reinstall it.,
"The app worked fine prior to the latest update. Now, I can't even read an article for two seconds without it shutting down on me. Terrible.",
"The app is great, but constantly shuts down mid-article. Uninstalling/reinstalling doesn't help, and neither does clearing the cache. Super frustrating when I'm trying to read these great articles.",
"Wonderful in-depth investigative reporting. However, despite paying for a subscription i encounter ads in every article. Theyve started including video ads that play automatically on a loop and cant be stopped. Shameful. Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
I love most of the features in this latest version of the NYT app. Glad to see the return of night mode! Twilight just wasn't the same. This app is very much my preferred way to read the Times on the go or on my tablet.,
On my device when I purchased it.  Dont want this app.  Can't remove the app.,
Black screen now after a few minutes of use. Installed and reinstalled twice. Still an issue,
Won't even open. Always force close,
This app is not optimized for my android device,
"Always loved the paper, now I can carry it easily wherever I go.",
It's a great app to get up to date news from one of the best companies,
The news is new everyday but this app keeps the same stories at the too for way too long.,
The best news source. You don't get too much news.,
New version uses an inexplicable amount of data.,
it's amazing to know about many things in a row.,
"Very impressed with the ""your daily briefing"" feature. Very handy.",
"Great app, amazing content!",
One of the best apps for navigating the news.,
Allow full offline reading and access!,
Wonderful stories and lay out.,
Propaganda at it's finest. Smile for the camera ladies. ;),
Had to reinstall because app kept booting me out of articles.  Hope this fixed it.,
I'm an old New Yorker and have been reading the times since childhood. This is basically how I deal with waiting on line.,
It is great.,
Laggy and crashing,
Not timely,
All the best okay,
"This are biased and the best part is that they don’t even try to hide it now. Remember, What they published when India launched a successful Mars Mission. The violence happening in US is primarily due to the utter bias of US Media lead by NYT and CNN towards Certain sections of society. These publications will lead to destruction of US Society. Thank God, we don't have such a biased, Racist and Hypocrite News Provider in India.",
"It is because of your biased reporting aka talking bad about Trump and cheerleading for clinton is why Trump was elected! Shame on you! News organizations were supposed to tell us how things are going and to encourage us just to vote, not who to vote for!! You shoved Clinton down our throats so much no wonder he got elected. If it wasn't for your reporting clear back in the primary election we all would have had a better choice instead of what we wound up with.",
"Greats work in public, always true news publish on public.",
I just don't like the app,
Extremely fake! Sad!,
Filled to the rafters with fake news,
Awesome+interesting.,
FAKE NEWS!!!!!,
Fake News,
"Unstable. Screen often goes blank on the middle of an article. Repeated attempts to refresh cause the app to die. When it happens, no new content can be downloaded, all articles exhibit the same problem. If using Android 7.0 on a Motorola phone.",
"Has crashed on launch every time for the last few weeks. Completely unusable. Have submitted bug reports daily, never gets fixed!  Probably going to unsubscribe because of this.",
This app cannot maintain the logged in state. Get ready to uninstall and reinstall multiple times per week. NYT should be able to do better.,
The latest android version on all my devices doesn't recognize subscribers so always asks for money. It's very annoying. I deleted the app and web version works fine.,
"The app is fast, reliable and well-made, but changing the default text size sometimes leads to formatting problems, and why do paying subscribers still have to see ads? In any case, please at least get rid of the obnoxious animated ads, which are extremely distracting.",
"This app keeps installing itself on my Samsung tablet. I've tried disabling it, uninstalling it, but it keeps reinstalling itself and resumes annoying me with notifications. Stop it!",
I am a subscriber and I would love this app if it allowed me to sort stories by date and if it would open when I click on links to NYTmes stories in Twitter.,
New York Times is the best newspaper in the world. It's the most trusted and accurate in everything is published.,
NY times is no more truthful than the national enquirer.  Will NEVER use as a reliable source of news!,
"The app is a little bit funky when it comes to updating, but otherwise it works well.",
من این بازی رو خیلی دوست دارم,
Sound journalism is a rare commodity.,
App is not accepting my username and password.,
Couldn t remove it from my phone,
10 free views? I'd much rather have access to free limited content. I've uninstalled the app.,
"Just one think to fix, the subscription",
Fake news app. Came preinstalled. Don't want it.,
YOU ARE FAKE NEWS!,
Imposed on me by Samsung. Can't delete.,
Very kewl,
Great app,
Sucks,
"I love this app overall as the design and interface are excellent.   However, I have recently been experiencing a problem with my login information not being recognised by the app (including​ after changing my details and reinstalling). I notice that others are also experiencing this and it needs some attention.",
"I have followed NYT for 10 years.  But I can no longer trust their news reporting due to NYT's biased, slanted, highly partial, and too often inaccurate reporting. Report the news accurately and fairly, not based on your biases.",
"App works much better now. Still a bit pricey for a subscription, to still contend with ads.",
"I like the look and feel of the app. Unfortunately, it was draining my battery. I hope this will be improved in the future. For now I'm back to reading the website.",
"Great app, I turned off all but breaking news notifications but still getting other ones. Very annoying, please fix",
"Get majority of my news on the New York times, so I recommend this app too you 🌍🌎🌏",
"It's very informative, covering fast news issues. I still like the print edition, but considering going online  for the my NYTIMES.",
I use this app daily and find it informative and easy to use. Aside from daily news and op ed articles I enjoy using NY Times Cooking and love the mini crossword. I do wish there was a full crossword included with subscription.,
Most recent so eliminated twilight more in favor of a brightly lit black background. It's too bright for night time reading. Please bring back there twilight mode feature.,
"I would add another star but recently the app has taken to trekking me I'm out of free articles, urging me to log in, acknowledging that I have done so, then not removing the pay wall. My lig in registers if I read in Chrome so...",
Great app. Highly recommended source of news in these troubled times.,
Format is the best for easily picking the stories you want to delve into. Writing as always is informative and professional.,
"great app, always good and informative read, and finally night mode, thanks so much! 5 stars!",
Nice app. Sorry to see twilight mode go away.,
"Always works, good-sized bites of news, lots of variety!",
Pretty good but I like the Washington posts app layout better.,
I enjoy reading the reality of New York Times writes their articles. I love this newspaper.,
I love this app. Very responsive.,
"No dark mode, dark mode dark mode dark mode. Bring back the dark mode. Still waiting on that order of Dark Mode.",
Outstanding app for followings Trump's disaster of a presidency.,
"Very good, easy access to the sections.",
I Am very happy for the New York Times.,
This is a good app for international news. It is convinient to use.,
"Convenient, read anywhere at anytime, real-time updates.",
The best news app I have.,
Very good app for news.,
Elegantly simple layout; easy to read and navigate,
UX is definitely not on their priority list.,
I depend on this app for real news every day!,
"Accurate,  timely!",
I hate the photo,
An intelligent news source,
Fake bias news,
I love my subscription,
Awesome ☺,
Very informative,
This app combines excellent reporting with a layout that doesn't prioritize advertisements or unnecessary flair. My experiences with all other newspapers' apps have been far below this one. Even for nonsubscribers the NYT never has ads that take over the screen and force you to read or close them.,
"I pay under $10/month for the NYT subscription, as I feel it's important to pay our journalists and spread real news while providing enough money to have less advertising. I enjoy the morning and evening briefings as well as the well-written full news stories. 4 stars because the app doesn't always update stories and I will have to pull down to refresh 3+ times before getting the current day/time feed. Galaxy s6.",
"Beautifully executed, this newspaper app is almost perfect for my daily reading fix on both in-depth news and human interest stories. The only thing I wish was better would be a better built in way to share to social media with a full URL instead of a tinyurl, since that is required on some sites.",
"Through and through, the best news app out here. Even better than the print edition because headlines and breaking news are updated and published throughout the day. Beautiful graphics, unbelievable video quality and a neat, seamless flow of the news items and topics make this app an indispensable part of my day. America would be lost without the NYT...I would be so, without the NYT app.",
"Like its robustness. Not as happy with auto serve of items based on predicted interests. Rather see everything from NYT & then I choose myself. This is main reason I can't rate news feed more highly. Otherwise, News is superb. Love that writing from all opinions can be found in 1 feature/area.",
"The NY Times app is that rare thing: an app that moves seamlessly wherever you ask it to go. The notification option works as it should, it never freezes up and boots me out when updating. It doesn't try to sell me anything more than what I have bought (I am a digital subscriber). I am very happy with this app.",
"I love this app, which allows me to continue my strong connection to my home city, despite living elsewhere. The concise, visually accessible format lets me skim through the news, or go into greater depth if time and interest allow. I go here first thing every morning, and whenever an event is unfolding. My go to source for world news.",
"This is my go to app every morning. Even if I just browse the headlines I can glean needed information about what's going on in the USA and the world in moments. Furthermore, their stories are well written and interesting, whether breaking news or opinion or editorials on social customs, food, art, whatever. I travel a lot and don't have a while lot of time or access to newspapers, so this app gives me quality researched journalism the way I need it.",
"As a vociferous Times reader for years, I've long loved this app for its intuitive format, great suggested reading and factual journalism.  And at less than $10/month, it's a simple way to support the fact based journalism that we so desperately need right now.  Plus it retains information for offline reading while on the subway or plane!  Love it.",
"The NYT app makes it possible to keep up with News of World Affairs; thus, it is a means of being and keeping informed. By keeping me informed, such News Reports helped me stay a step ahead in knowing World history which affects our daily lives today, and by allowing me to view, through this app, current events occurring both in the USA and throughout the World, the NYT makes it possible for me to keep up with current affairs that affect us today and help direct our lives in the future in a positive, informed way. By doing so, this NYT app makes it possible to make informed decisions for our future based on such historical and current affairs. May your decisions be based on staying informed, through this NYT app, so that we can work together to make our World more humane and thus, more free. Debbie",
"I love this app, i really do. Got a subscription in, and have been relying on it for news ever since. However, whenever i try to share an article with my friends, it says cookies not accepted, and im not sure why. If it's my issue, i hope to get help soon, and if it's a bug, hope this review brings it into light. Keep up the good work!",
"In this age of necessary and responsible journalism, the NYT brings it home for me. The app has an easy interface and I like how easily I can pay videos, clip and save articles and make comments from it. Now too I love the daily audio program, a real worthy addition to the digital edition of the NYT.",
"Best damned English language news source on the planet, bar none. Use app every day, every hour to get up-to-the-minute notifications on the most pressing issues, world news, US politics, sports, fashion, culture & opinions from the greatest staff in journalism practicing today. And, speaking as a digital native, I have been thoroughly impressed by the latest efforts to keep the Times on the cutting edge of multimedia -- 360 VR/AR experiences that combine top notch stories with award winning photography, videos, and background data layers",
"Most of the low reviews here are people upset with the journalism. Ignoring that (which is considered, rightly so, world class) the app itself is quite accessible. Fairly minimalist, it's easy to browse and read articles by chronology, category, or popularity.   Do yourself a favor and give up cable news.",
"I love NYT's style of reporting. There is just one thing that I would like to see: a dark mode. The white background can be a little much when you're reading at night. The app has a twilight mode, but it's not very good.",
Appreciate the high quality of journalism & variety of op-ed pieces.  NYT should be at the forefront of informing a thinking democracy.  I believe they are making a good effort to do so.,
"A good sampling of the justly world-famous journalism practiced by the NY Times staff. Read politics, world events, fascinating profiles, recipes you'll make (and keep until they're in tatters). Immerse yourself, fall in love --- and subscribe, so they can afford to keep doing this important, awesome stuff.",
"Set notifications for ""breaking news"" and ""morning briefing"" only and you will get all the news you need without gratuitous push notifications. This app (with affordable subscription to the digital edition) helps me consume trustworthy news in moderation. ESSENTIAL in times like these!",
"Robust coverage of global, national and local news with thought provoking editorial content. I feel lost with my daily intake of The Times.",
"I use it every day. First the morning ""what you need to know"" and, if commuting by car, listening to the Daily"". I read the print edition at lunch (and sometimes later as well) though check back for breaking news during the day and evening.",
"I've been using it for years, and have nearly no complaints. I really like the ability to read offline. The search function is truly the worst but that goes for their whole site so don't blame the app for it.",
"The layout is crammed with info but not chaotic, as many are today.  Easy to scroll through and find stories of interest.  Easy too navigate.  Good for leisure reading or to catch up when you're on the go.",
"NYT is a long running and trusted news source for a variety of reasons. But speaking in terms of just the app and it's utility and ease of use, it's phenomenal. Push notifications for only breaking news, well designed layout and intuitive controls make this news app worth the subscription.",
"Appreciate the objective analysis of current issues and topics.  Also, enjoy the the opinion columns and especially, the summaries of the late night comedy shows.",
"I love being able to quickly and easily access the news anytime I want. As a mom of 3 this is the best way for me to be able to get my news, written in a smart, meaningful way, in the moments of free time I have throughout the day.",
It's the only app I've ever paid for and I don't even think about that while I'm using it so that must count for something.,
"The only thing better, would be having the news printed on paper, at the bottom of my door in the morning. The depth and quality of writing is tops.",
I read NYT every day. I find the news delivery factual and informative. The opinion columns are diverse and on the point. The app gives me the opportunity to read news on the go.,
This is the worst $H1T ever. These people get paid to send hate notifications everyday.,
"This is the best way to stay ""in the know"" as each & everyday unfolds...Some days the pace of developing news is overwhelming,  but I count on the Times to deliver the facts in a well written & well organized fashion to always keep its readers informed...",
The NYT is simply without equal in the world. It is something Americans can be truly proud. The work of the NYTs is more important than ever. The App is excellent but it is the journalism that makes the NYT special.,
"Very user friendly. I like the palitable way the morning and evening briefings are presented, so I'm not overwhelmed with stories that I'm not interested in. Great articles and talented staff.",
Deleted after they reported leaked information on an active terrorist investigation putting lives in the UK at risk.  There is no way I can support an organisation this callous and stupid.,
"They need to add a tab for the Cooking section. Otherwise, a very good news app. Marking which articles have already been read is nice.",
"Great, intuitive app with a clean interface and fast loading times. Well designed and leagues above some of the other major publications' apps.",
To preserve our threatened democracy we need to financially support our responsible news media.    Subscribing to The Times is the best place to start.,
I appreciate the New York Times for keeping me informed on the latest news and opinions of relevant issues. Their phone app does a great job and I wouldn't be without it.,
"Up to the minute breaking news, important analysis of politics and policy, great social, cultural and arts articles.",
"It's a good plase to read the news, but I feel there is room for improvement. I like it better than CNN that's for sure. ♤",
This is my main source of news - I trust them for facts as well as  opinion. I'm happy to be able to read my paid subscription on my phone and tablet as well as my laptop.,
”This article failed to load due to an error”. Not acceptable to receive this message when on WiFi and paying a subscription fee to NYT. 🙄,
Well-designed good news app although lacking in the attractive aesthetics of say the Washington Post or Wall Street Journal apps.,
"I was skeptical and hesitant about buying a subscription to the NYT. It pissed me off, frankly, that they forced the issue by limiting access for non-subscribers. But, I asked myself: where will the objective journalism come from, once there is no more NYT? And I have subscribed, and will for the rest of my days.",
Always been a good and comprehensive App. Wish my Phone subscription covered my tablet. Not likely to try reading both at the same time.,
"The app is easy to use, but I wish it was easier to access the Watchlist feature. It should be part of the main menu...",
I enjoy all of the features from the daily what you need to know to cooking. The fact checking is very interesting as is the opposing views section.,
Very easy to read and find the news articles you are interested in. Excellent coverage of current events and so much more.,
"I subscribe to NYT for the journalism in an age where we need it more than ever. The app keeps me informed and up-to-date, and offers analysis that I appreciate.",
"Just the right level of notification. I've cancelled other news apps because they were alerting me to ""news"" that I did not need to be interrupted to be made aware of.",
I always liked The Times when I visited my Dad.  Now I can enjoy it on my phone.  I sneak a quick article or two now and then.  It's addictive.,
"This app.is very easy to use.  It works perfectly everyone and gives me the most respected newspaper in America, at my fingertips.",
"Love how easy to use and intuitive this app is, also the ability to copy/paste (not all apps offer this)",
"This is a great way to read the  paper any time, even if you have slow or intermittent connection part of the day.",
Beautiful well made app. I'm a subscriber and it is my go to news app. I like the breaking news notifications and the descriptive and understandable​ toaster messages like if the app refreshes or has an error. It's awesome.,
"Dependable news source and an easy to navigate app, what more could you want? I love the what you need to know section, along with the crossword. I have it set for notifications, so I receive news throughout the day. It's perfect for a news and political junkie like me, as well as for the casual reader.",
"The NYT's app is my favorite way to get trustworthy news. I can listen to top notch podcasts, watch videos, and read articles on my phone.",
"A great way to catch all the headlines that matter from a trusted source.  Love the mini cross word puzzle, too! Thanks",
Excellent variety of articles.  I find comments a great way to get added perspective on issues and public opinions both pro and con.  I subcript to local papers as well to my local news.,
Can't beat the depth of The NYT and an easy way to subscribe. The up-to-the-minute information is important to me.,
"Overall, highly satisfied with the app. It is the best newspaper app I have seen as of now and a model for other newspapers to go digital. However, one suggestion would be that paid consumers should not have to see advertisements.",
"Love this app. First thing I check in the morning,  and last thing I read at night .  Makes keeping up on the news a breeze.",
"Easy to use, access specific sections, move through articles. So happy I can access NYT no matter where I am",
My favorite liberal fake news app. The app is really easy to use and gives a lot of alerts throughout the day. It also offers much more control over the type of notifications you get than other news apps.,
"Essential reading for those with intelligent curiosity, don't always agree with articles or opinions, however useful for forming my own.",
"The app goes beyond the printed newspaper, in providing mini crossword puzzles, news alerts if you register for them, and updated stories, videos, and podcasts. Much easier to view and search  content than the Washington Post's app, which is more confusing for me.",
"Stellar app. One can tell that NYT is pushing new formats and concepts for stories that are enriched by the mobile app environment. The app is well-organized, reliable, and especially convenient with its ""Save for Later"" feature.",
One of the best and innovative apps coming from major newspaper. Behaves good even when no data available.,
Great way to keep up with events.  No issues with app. Favorites sections: Opinion and the Briefings that appear three times a day.,
"Despite the fact that I have an unlimited access subscription, this app is not synched with that subscription, and repeatedly warns me I have approached the limit of app articles allowed. Aggravating!",
"It's the New York Times, first major newspaper to get digital right, of course their flagship app is on point.",
"Absolutely necessary! With a well-designed and easy to navigate layout and breaking news push notifications, it's impossible to not be well informed with this app.",
"The app is visually appealing, offering an overview of the news. It does not distract from  more thorough reading. It is possible to learn about many topics and events in a short time.",
I love the convenience of having the times on my phone...especially with all the tumult in our world right now.   I love supporting the free press in this easy to access manner.,
"I have a paid online subscription to the NYTimes which is not recognized by this android app.  After reading a few articles, the paywall pops up and I sign in. Despite a successful sign in, the paywall does not go away...",
Great articles for a few days and then I'm cut off. Not all of us can afford to pay the price. Too bad. Otherwise I like it.,
"Quick news to in depth, you can choose what is right for you. I liked the free version but would always run into the max story limit so I am now a subscriber!",
Keep accidentally selecting an unwanted article due to surface sensitivity of device. I have to use a mouse and a PC to properly select an article.,
"This is a great app. I've used other newspaper apps, and this is by far the best. Good for browsing, and finding just what I want to read.",
"Wide-ranging, literate, love the mini-puzzle. I should not be so miserly and subscribe, I blow through the 10 free articles way too fast.",
I waited awhile before giving up my printed daily paper - and am very happy with the NYT everyday. I enjoy the current news and easy search capabilities. I do maintain my Sunday printed - something about that & my Sunday am...,
"Most informative news app I use, best looking, best layout, smaller data usage than other news apps",
App has fewer interruptive ads and pre-roll video ads - letting the news take the stage as it should.,
"This is the fastest, most trustworthy way of staying up to date with the world. I don't know what I'd do without it.",
"I appreciate the background and depth of articles, but also the selection and variety of topics.  Not to mention the updates all day long, especially when there is breaking news of national or global significance.  So nice to have this on my phone everyday.",
Great news app with limited access to all articles. Free preview for all headlines but needs subscription for full article after 10/month free options. Great coverage of news. App gives a quick overview of news of the day.,
"APP works fine and that's a good thing because I rely on the NYT for news about the world, nation, science as well as fun stuff like the mini crossword and recipes.",
"I am an avid reader of the Times, mostly on my PC. However, when I read it in the app I am very satisfied. I don't do crosswords​ or anything, I just read.",
"Very easy to switch between top stories, opinions, most popular articles, and other categories. Easy to save articles. Top notch writing combined with excellent interface, 5 stars",
"My husband got me a NY Times subscription as a gift. I love this app, it's definitely my favorite!",
"Excellent, easy to use app that provides a simple doorway into the highest quality reporting and editorial writing that distinguishes the New York Times",
"Say what you want about it, it's still the best newspaper in the world.    I've had my complaints over the years, but there's no other newspaper that is as good.",
App stopped updating so was showing 3 day old news. Uninstalled.,
Comprehensive news app. The navigation works well. I can easily review top news or delve deeper into the sections or stories of interest.  The search engine is effective.  Its responsive view on my mobile phone   enhances readability. I love it.,
This is the newspaper that I trust the most for news. The app is really user friendly; always a pleasure,
"Despite what our President might say, this is some of the best quality journalism around. Use this app every day to stay current. And the recipes section is awesome, too!",
"Very frustrating that I persistently get stopped by the paywall even though I'm a paying subscriber. I get asked repeatedly to login but still don't get access to articles after logging in. I've tried logging out and back in again, updating the app...no luck.",
Thank god for the failing New York Times for being the leader of the axis of enemies of the people.,
I use this app everyday sometimes several times a day! Easy to use -easy to share. Love having N.Y. Times  at my figure tips,
"Excellent app, excellent stories. Works flawlessly. It includes everything I want and nothing I don't.",
Great investigative journalism. And I like to think my subscription just pisses off Trump even more. Please keep up your great work!,
"Great App for giving instant updates and reading relevant articles. I enjoy the news update theme and it notifies you that an interesting event is happening. The ""What You Need To Know"" to start your day... Is a brilliant idea. Superb!",
"You have to read what intelligent people are trying to convey so that their opinions and information can be compared to others as well as to the original source so you're thoughts and speech are based on knowledge and vetted opinions, not just beliefs and myths",
"The standard of American journalism, its resources and perspective more valuable in this troubled age than ever.",
I check this app several times a day. It's the app I use the most.,
"Really enjoy reading the Times on my phone. Yes, I'm still addicted.",
This is such an excellent and trustworthy news source and the app is easy and helpful. I'm addicted!,
The app is intuitive and easy to use. It works well and stays in the background - never gets in the way of the stories.,
Get important news and analysis of the day at a glance.  It's easier with the mobile format than the Web one.,
Too bad they limit the number of articles one can read...,
"Smart, informative, a beacon for truth and justice. The Times has successfully navigated the transition from print to digital with this app. I hope other news papers will make the leap as successfully. Thanks NYTs!",
I HAD TO re-up my lapsed attention to The Times and the world,
One of the best news apps out there... I would not give up for anything.. The articles are great and well put together..,
I get more news in ten minutes with this app than I get from a 30 minute TV news show. Plus so much more.,
"If more people read the New York Times, we could make the planet great again.",
"I have always loved the Times, now I get all the breaking news as it happens .",
"I would prefer a digital picture of today's NYT to allow me to browse and read as if I had a copy of today's paper in my hand, dince I subscribe!",
By far some of the best and varied writing and reporting there is.  Thank you so much for this free trial.,
"I'd like to use the widget of the app, but it doesn't work properly because it's sluggish.",
"A beautiful app. Clean and simple, brimming with intelligent reporting and thoughtful writing. My daily companion.",
Very reliable and easy to navigate.   I now use this app more than my computer for reading The Times.,
Easy to use and keeps me up to date. First thing I look at in the morning.,
Use it a lot and like it. But I find it annoying that I get ads despite being a subscriber.,
Excellent reporting with thorough depth that often gives essential context to truly understand complex issues that we so often find today.,
Used to be a great app. But the new version is very cranky. Loads large photos for each start of each article. Slows or stalls my Droid for 30 secs. UPDATE: Works like a charm now.,
"I use the free side, and just browsing headlines is more efficient than doing so in phone browser.",
Great app.  Worth the small price to stay informed.  Investigative journalism is vanishing. Our civic duty to support it whenever we can.,
Great cross-reference to validate news on NBC news; plus I like the daily mini crossword puzzle.,
"Less flashy than the Washington Post, but easier to use. Real journalism isn't free, so I pay to read it. I could do with less video and 360-surround stuff, but then, I'm a curmudgeon.",
I think it's a fairly decent app you should include more free access to stories and encourage more feedback on the stories you cover,
Great content of course but doesn't always update properly.,
This app keeps me connected with our rapidly changing world.,
"Well designed app allows moving between stories easily. Subscription price is worth it, too.",
Early every morning the digital Times is delivered to my notification bar. It couldn't be any easier to use! (18 months later and getting better all the time!),
Best news stories. Wish they would implement nighttime mode though (twilight is not the same).,
"Good and accurate news.  Well trusted.  Keep up the good work, New York Times",
Started reading paper version of NYT as college student in 2002 - this app is very easy to use.,
"What more to say, it is Times quality. Stellar, authoritative news and commentary in a perfectly functioning app.",
Most new apps feel busy. Not this one. Display makes it easy to use and to find content,
"I love having access to NYT on my phone, and the notifications are reserved for actual breaking news, unlike other news apps.",
"Despite being frightened to read breaking news alerts (a byproduct of the Donald Trump era) ... it's at least comforting to know that whatever I'm about to read on the NYT app is well-researched, well-sourced and well-written.",
"I think everyone should take a deep breath and slow down on ""breaking news "" format. I think it's useful but it seemed a contest between the Washington Post and NYTimes 2 weeks ago",
"Easy to use, really like the ability to cache stories and photos for reading when Internet is not available.",
Worth every second and every penny.  Who doesn't want to be informed?  Democracy depends on it.  So read already - bigly.  So great - still!,
Well designed and easy to use. Optional breaking news notifications are helpful.,
"Easy to navigate with interesting, well written articles. Great news source. One of the best!",
Crossword (mini) first thing I do every morning. Then onto world news. App makes me feel like an adult. What's not to love?,
Same stories with a smattering of new stuff.  Not worth the price,
News updated continuosly.Using for 4 months no issie encountered so far. Good App,
Love having all my saved items (including recipes) across platforms.,
Articles take forever to display and often flicker.  It is just text and photos.  Why can't you get that right no times?,
I like having a quick and easy way to check in with news I can trust. So cool!,
Great way to stay informed of REAL news!  The app just works and is always there.,
I love your reports about Trump. We need your investigating. Thank you!,
I truly love this app! Request is a front page option😁,
Best format for staying on top of important national and international news from some of the best journalists in the world.,
I'm proud to support the nytimes. and the app is very user friendly!,
"Learning about our world one story at a time. Keeps me sane during this ""presiduncy""",
"This is my all time favorite news application and I just can't get enough! Excellent reporting, writing and photography as they are world renowned for for hundreds of years. Keep up the great work!!!",
"Works well, but sometimes doesnt refresh correctly",
I can't imagine not having TNYT app on my phone. Love it,
Doesn't get much better than the NYT.,
"Easy to use, can move easily from section to section, can save stories, I subscribed.",
"Helps me stay informed. Wish I had access to the full crossword, though.",
"Let's me follow current events with top notch reporting, cooking, and opinio",
"Can't get through the day...hours, without checking NYT!!  You're staff is providing a desperately needed service and doing it beyond great!  Thank you!  You are what will make America ""great again.""",
A broadsheet newspaper ascually readable om a phone. Excellent app. Kudos.,
No better way to keep informed from a source you can trust!,
It's the best news app ever!  I can't start my day without it!,
You get what you pay for. And I'm enjoying paying for the NYT.,
The only thing missing is the sound of newsprint crinkling.,
All the news that's fit to print and has been for years and years. My source for staying informed.,
"An indispensable medium for past, current and seemingly future events.",
"Love the app, my news source every day while I'm on the road",
Would be better if there were an easier way to refresh than scrolling all the way to the top.,

Thaksin you!!!,
Works for me,
"Long time subscriber who is a registered NYC Democrat. I am fed up with the 
NY Times anti-Trump one sided bias. The last straw was when they hired an 
openly racist editor in Jeong and vigorously defended her racism. 
Subscription cancelled and app has been deleted from all my devices.",
"Good app, but WAY too many notifications. Even with only ""Breaking News"" set and everything else off, notifications are almost daily.  I wanted a ""another 9/11 just happened"" kind of level that would notify me of major events but not perpetually interrupt my day. To the news people at the NYT though, apparently every day has news worth interrupting me for.  I don't agree, so I deleted the app.",
Breaking news notifications are becoming a burden. A suicide bombing is breaking. Not the comment of the victims or the death of a movie star. This is very disappointing.,
"The latest  version has made it more unstable to update contents in the beginning of every morning, either using wifi or mobile data. It didn't happen before. Another problem which showed up with this version is adapting text size. The other version was better.",
"Disturbing notifications that I can't turn off, can't disable sources / topics of news I have no interest in",
"Except for the inability to change font size for headline listing, the app is the bomb for getting the top-shelf journalism of the NYT in electronic form.",
Purchased to support press but canceling because some of op-ed pieces that are waste of time.,
"The most info in the shortest amount of time. Depth is there, too, if you want to go deep. Infographics are unsurpassed. After all, it's the NYT!",
"Obvious bias, disgraceful editting and deplorable morals. Shut it down.",
The best reporting on the planet. The app could be better. The Washington Post has the best newspaper app. The Times should take a look.,
I can't uninstall it and I don't want any news app.,
They have clearly devoted alot of time and money to the user interface.,
Great app! I appreciate having access to good reporting.,
It's great and has enough content to know if I want to read the article.,
My notifications disappear after a while,
"POTUS stated make America grt. again,NYTimes one it's grtest",
Articles that are found no where else. The Favorites are great.,
Great app. Clean and minimalist design.,
Not now until I finish the tryout.,
Why can't I unintelligible it,
Clean and clear layout with excellent journalism,
Great newspaper! Love it! Good value!,
Fantastic and easy to use.,
Great app!,
Thorough and superbly credible.,
Works well.,
Like drinking from a firehose. The NYT app offers soooo much info it might seem a bit intimidating. Is very easy to get lost in the vast wealth of news and information delivered by the NYT. I spent over 4 hours just wandering through the NYT Archive.  The 360 video is just amazing. Highly recommend. The Daily Briefing gets me caught up quickly on current events. Best money I ever spent.,
"I love having one of the world's great newspapers in my phone, made possible, in my case, by the special price for educators. I am enjoying the special features that come with the digital edition, the links to related articles, updates during the day, the graphics which give you extra information at your fingertips, the photos, the hard, serious news in detail and articles about more relaxing topics too. I enjoy the recipes.  Don't get me started about how great the crossword app is....being able to ask for clues and whole words has opened up the pleasure of seeing how the harder puzzles were designed and has helped me get better and have more fun. Thanks to the whole NYT team for keeping me informed and entertained.",
"Nice interface and reporting. The journalism is top notch. Why one star? I'm paying $10 for this app/subscription every month but I need to pay another $10 to view all NYT articles in my Google news feed. Sorry, $10 a month for full access is reasonable but two separate subscriptions to view (in my case) 2 articles a day is not worth the price. I'm switching back to viewing content in my browser.",
"I count on the NYT app to filter out the noise and curate the most important news of the day, so I don't have to waste my time sifting through the oceans of news. It's outstanding--I'd give it 10 stars, if I could!",
"Dependable and easy-to-use app for following some of the best journalists and editors in the world. Ten free articles per month is great but I would prefer paying a small charge for 20. Thank you, NYT!",
The morning briefs make this a great app for everyday news,
I installed it because I get a free subscription through my school but the NYTimes is just pure cancer so I uninstalled minutes later,
Would love it if white on black background option is offered.,
"Nice, good content. But it's more suitable to subscribers.",
"Please add a dark mode, ideally with both pitch black and dark gray options.",
Pretty good,
Awesome,
Great,
"""N.Y.Times""",
I'd love to read the content but three of the four links I clicked this morning were VR links that required a VR app download. I just want to read the news. I don't want another app dragging down my phone's performance and I definitely don't need VR just to read the news. Even Ted Talks come with an interactive transcript for this of us who read faster and better than we can listen. What a bummer.,
"Not sure why the low reviews. Works great, good present ration. Tablet mode doesn't utilize all the screen space but oh well",
"Why would I want to pay you subscription fees when I get the same feed with other news outlets, for free, , some of them much better",
"I'm a news junkie, so I love the NY Times app. My only complaint is that I wish there were even more stories!",
To many of there writers have their own agenda . Against our president. If you like that kind of stuff you will love it.,
"It is a great supplement to receiving the paper subscription, especially when travelling. The NYT has responded constructively to technical issues when they have arisen. Thank you, NYT!",
Love the NYT but this app's tablet layout looks downright primitive compared to its iOS counterpart. Wish they didn't treat Android users as second class citizens.,
Freezes too often. It is better to use a browser.,
The usual tremendous articles and wide array of topics from one of the world's greatest newspapers.,
Perfect news app to use among the other few good ones,
Very easy to switch between articles. Well written an researched information at my fingertips.  Love it.,
"This is just works well. I've had no problems with it. It's clean, fast loading, and looks great.",
"I get quick news coverage with this app, and generally trust the NYTimes reporting.",
Simply the best app for instant news delivery.,
The very best news app,
All the world's news in three palm of my hand,
If you are the political type then this is your paper.  Very topical regardless of the subject matter.,
Way too many ads,
Where is the recipe app?  Why is that only available to the cult oh Steve Jobs?,
Best news website,
Is nice,
Brilliant,
love it,
Works well on iPhone and Nexus,
"I'm having a hard time staying logged in. Even when I do log in, via facebook, it prevents me from viewing some articles. Isn't subscribing supposed to let me read that stuff?",
"I am a subscriber and happy with the subscription. I get annoyed that I have to keep logging in so often, sometimes with each new article read in the same session. The reading experience should be smoother than this. It is less hassle reading from links sent via their email service.   NY Times good but find the app annoying",
"I subscribed because Nyt did good investigative journalism.  However they just hired a climate denier, Bret Stephens, for editorials so I can no longer support them.  I'll give my money to another publication to do investigative journalism... However if Stephens goes I'll  be back",
Good but can't seem to remember my login for more than a couple days. Frustrating.,
Every time I try to use the app it tells me I only have 10 views before it shuts me off. Even though I subscribed and am logged in. Very frustrating.,
The New York Times is by far one of the greatest institutions of America. They are fantastic and a vital group. They're not failing. And truth will always be Timely.,
I'm not sure if you have any questions or concerns please visit the other side of the other side the future of Micronesia Federated okay,
I like it but the widget has issues. It just keeps blinking over and over as if it's trying to load and reload. I really depend on news widgets so this is a problem.,
I have a Moto E with an old Android OS. This app crashes as I start to read it. I have a subscription and read this wonderful paper on my Mac laptop.,
"Since the last update, the app will just close, or freezes and refreshes itself. Please fix.",
"The app is not well designed. The content has gone down hill over the past year. The comments section doesn't relate any comment to any other, so you have no real discussion going on. Also, you can subscribe online but you can't cancel online.",
App works ok but it quickly asks for a subscription.  It's a bit pricy.  Not worth the money in my mind.  I can get similar news for free elsewhere.,
I am a subscriber and I hate that the app wont let me access the archive  I can only read articles from that day or week. Also often it will only show one or two articles per region which are not North America. I am also perticularaly annoyed that you cant clickmon the authors name and view other articles by the same author.,
Frequently has teacher bashing articles also shows bias in other areas.,
Very bad newspaper. It is not balanced and vert rigged regarding Trump for no reason.,
"great content, well worth it, but the app doesn't size properly when I click into stories on my Asus Chromebook flip... it worked last week",
App stuck on tab-less screen showing just the nyt banner for 9 secs before showing a spinner. Happy to share screenshot. HTC Desire 10 Pro.,
Im a student and I love this app! Subscriptions are way cheaper for students so I'm probably keeping this all four years :) honestly I'll probably get a subscription too just be cranky about spending the money.,
"The news is very biased, does not tell the whole truth, slanted",
New York Times has a wonderful app. I can't live without its morning and evening briefings,
"app will not open, at all, ever. Tech dept. at nyt cannot help. (Lenovo Yoga book)",
"Notifications are too frequent. I only have ""Breaking News"" turned on which according to the NYT is almost every article they publish. So I'm notified 10 times a day that there is breaking news. If everything is breaking news, then what's the difference between breaking news and just News? Just tone the notifications down. It feels like harassment to buy a subscription.",
Very helpful and keep me informed and up to date on latest news. Very easy to use. Nice pattern!,
I love the briefings but your messages about subscribing can be rude.,
"Can we get a ""night mode"" setting? If​ you read the news at night the screen is so bright because of the white background and black text. Give us the option to turn the background color a dark grey with white text. That would be great.",
"Fine app, I guess. Problem.....If I want to use, I have to pay but if I don't want to pay, I cannot remove the app",
"A Bit Buggy The app seemed to be working well last Nov-Dec-Jan, but now often shows old stories (from previous day or so) and clicking on some heads yields a ""story not found, please refresh"" message. The refresh function does nothing- you have to find the app in Applications, delete its cache, force-close it, then re-open it. THEN it shows you new material. Started happening a few weeks ago on Samsung S6 mobile. Tedious...",
It's terrible too much notifications,
Thanks for sharing this with me and I will have a great day,
"Content is great, and the app has became very stable with the recent updates.",
"I like the app. It works well, but I'm unhappy that it contains ads when I'm paying $10/month. This isn't right.",
Just thankful the NYT and its courageous journalism is still with us!,
"Excellent and balanced journalism,  except on political reporting.",
"Ads take up valuable screen space. Why?  Great newspaper, shame about the app.",
All together it gives me good news so I have no reason to argue,
"Professional, impartial, great journalism !!! Thank YOU !!!",
At the forefront of news and technology.  The future of news delivery is here.,
News alerts are the best!,
What's to complain? It's the Times.,
Why just 10 articals?,
Looks free but it isn't,
"The journalistic content and reporting is world class. I am a subscriber and have been using the app for years. However as of the late Feb 2017 update, the refresh does not work well anymore. At times it will say all sections are updated when in fact nothing has updated. Sometimes the following workaround helps to force an update : switch app to Spanish, get Spanish articles, switch back to English, refresh.",
"Much smoother than the stuttery nytimes mobile website, offline caching, but a little slow to load sometimes.     Now crashes all the time, and I can't even read one article! Terrible and embarrassing for such a simple app.",
"I resubscribed using android account, but cannot get to content. Please help.",
This app is very well designed and easy to use. No issues with stability. And the content and coverage are more important now than ever.,
"Deeply researched, thoughtfully written, reliably balanced news. The app does a great job of putting information at my fingertips.",
Content is good but not enough of it. I'm sure the hardcopy paper must still have more articles.  Application is a little glitchy.  Sometimes links to articles don't work. Today two of the articles were in Korean.,
I only installed cause I love the TRUTH and hate Donald Trump. Keep up the good work nyt!,
"Visually wonderful design, consistently engaging content, and as was recently pointed out to me by a very helpful developer, a very straightforward menu for customizing notifications. The ""failing"" New York Times hits it home.",
This app offers the highest quality reporting from the world's premier news organization.  I cannot get enough of it!,
"Started off liking it, however as a subscriber being bombarded with ads every second paragraph is enough for me to abandon it. Seeking another news source which is ad free. If I don't find one I'll skip subscription news (just like cable).",
"Great app, bug free. The NY Times is the best source for the truth about government and the world.",
"No problems with the app. And facts can not be overrated nowadays. Great job, New York Times!",
"Push notifications keep me up to date daily , easy to read and most informative app available!!  Thank you",
"Love this app- it is important to be informed of what is happening in the world,  and this app is a trustworthy source on a range of issues.",
"Totally biased, inaccurate, do not use. FAKE NEWS",
Great app with sign in request when ever you want to read news.,
"Thanks for getting out real news, please don't stop!",
Really really good! Great articles all around with an outstanding user friendly app!,
I love the NY TIMES and the app makes it easy to keep up on the news,
App fails to load/refresh most times,
"Great app, simple, intuitive and easy to use.  But what I'm really paying for (and I guess help support) is good quality journalism...",
"Very good, this news app great!",
"Get off my tablet. Joke of a ""news"" organization. FAKE NEWS.",
My favorite news source. Big league.,
Up to the minute news at your fingertips,
All the News That's fit to print,
The Very Fake News. How r u holding up?,
Fake news!!,
It's awesome and cool,
Fantastic journalism with an app to match,
Balanced and factual.,
"If it has ads, why have a paid subscription?",
Absolutely the best,
Sections don't update,
I have trust in this paper,
Precised andskilled,
Donald Trump this subscription is a protest buy all the way from Africa - oh and it is a great App and the content is fantastic....,
News I can count on to be impartial and thorough.,
Outstanding journalism.,
I love the app,
Good,
"Obviously if a blithering psychopath like President Cheeto slanders NYT, they must be real news. Although I'm not sure what these mindless cultists political misconceptions have to do with the quality of this app. Even if you disagree with the truth, the app runs like a charm! Well done NYT. Never read you guys before this hot mess of an administration started embarrassing the Republican party as they have. Well done.",
"The Times is an excellent news source, but the app keeps asking me to log in. Then I do, and it says I logged in, but it won't take the ""10 articles goes fast"" banner off the screen so I can read the content I paid for. This happens every day, but not with every article. It's very frustrating.",
"As international subscriber I don't want to see the app clogged up with repetitive US-centric ads that cause freezes and crashes. I pay for quality news and hope the NYT realizes its global audience - and runs some testing before it releases updates.  Update following NYT comment:  Unfortunately, it is technically impossible to identify any rogue ads as the app freezes then crashes while loading an article. Hence, the suggested solution is entirely impractical.",
"This app has some nice features, but I still use the mobile Web version because of the handy content indexing. Specifically, being able to pick Opinion section and scroll to a table of columnists to read the work of one in particular without endless swipes past unrelated articles.",
"I liked the previous version better. I pay for a subscription, yet this new updated ap is FULL of ads. The previous ap had fever, less intrusive ads.",
"Thanks for bringing back search, comments and copy and paste! What's the a powerful app, except the ability to turn off notifications. I went into the settings and notifications submenu and unchecked all the present boxes. Yet, I still get breaking news updates in my notifications shade. NO!",
"Buggy. Blank pages show up near end of categories. Ads slow to load, then page jumps to random place. But only way to get the times on mobile.",
I log in as a paid subscriber but the app still throws up the 10 article pay wall. It's useless like this.,
"I like the app, especially on tablets. However, it has incongruous behavior whenever I open a link. Typically, from a link the back button takers you to where you started, but not this app. Each tap of the back button brings up more stuff in the app. I have to minimize the app to get out.",
"I've uninstalled this app several times, but it is continually forced on me. Please respect the fact that not  everyone shares the views and opinions of this newspaper.",
Don't ever let the much needed truths be silenced by 'alternative facts' or hostile political tweets,
"One sided political views. News with an agenda never helps the people, it breeds discontent. Respect your President. Love America or leave it.",
"running in Samsung Tab A Marshmallow, crashes constantly. half the time won't open at all.",
I wish you could highlight words so that I might define it search people and phrases. I wanted to search who Abu Khaybar is was while reading the article.,
"Can't log in ""network error has occurred, please try again later"". I can log in on other platforms just not the app unfortunately.",
It's great toilet paper. Nothing but fake and inaccurate news. Total garbage.,
"Brainwashing fake news. This company is destroying America from inside. God, please let this company bankrupt!",
"Reliable, Factual, and Compelling news outlet in a time when we need it the most. We need to support real news outlets like the New York Times to keep the Fake President in check.",
"This is some of the highest quality, lowest bias journalism you'll find anywhere and the app works great.",
"Overall the app is very good. However, videos simply do not play correctly. They will begin, but then freeze with the audio continuing in the background. Also, live videos will begin for the start of the broadcast and not from the current moment.",
"Good, but please provide a white on black text/background theme. Much easier on the eyes",
I only wish there was a night mode. Otherwise it works great. I've uninstalled it for the time being since their mobile site has night mode and works pretty well (articles on mobile site would open in app when installed).,
I tried to find an article I previously read and it is absolutely impossible to find. Even when typing in the exact name of the article.,
"Top 2 news app (w/ Guardian) for reliable world news and excellent op eds. I just don't understand why I cannot preselect the ""Music"" section like in the iOS app.",
Application is good for reading online and offline. It automatically downloads the daily news which I read on the go without internet.,
"I'm deleting a complaint from last year; use has been smooth for many months. I never notice as many good things on line as I do in the paper paper, but this is about as good as it gets.",
"Smooth app, I wish it had a dark mode instead of just controlling screen brightness.",
I subscribed because I hate what TRUMP IS DOING TO THE REAL NEWS MEDIA.,
Failing digital app. Can't believe a word so I bought a subscription so I can complain. sad... 😂😂😂,
The most unfair news outlet on the planet earth,
Annual subscription courtesy of Donald Trumps viral marketing success. Keep up the good work seriously need you in these troubles times,
"Works as it is supposed to, very robust content. The digital content, especially the videos, makes a digital subscription worthwhile.",
"The New York Times is necessary reading all day, and the app makes it easy.",
Great news app! Very credible and informative information. Layout is easy to navigate and the app is very fast.,
This app is extremely user-friendly and just works yes it cost money because the articles are add free!!,
"This Is Why I Hate This Kind Applications , I dont use this , and i barely know about it when it needs to update .  Why do you have to keep this apps . THAT YOU GOTTA HAVE NO MATTER WHAT LIKE IT OR NOT , AND THAT YOU CANNOT UNINSTALL ??? THIS PIECE OF SHAE  TT 'S  So Annoying !! That Is Why Rooting Existed To Uninstall This Garbage !! I Can't Wait To Have Mine Done",
Love the California today and daily briefing. Rich images and a nice widget.,
Biased fake news. Not worth installing.,
Why pay to read a news article if it was free I'll give it 4 stars,
Excellent  reporting and opinion pieces.,
I like to read the news (especially Donald Trump😂),
"Smart, informative, real news and the subscription price is reasonable.",
it keeps me updated and it points me to relevant stories,
Crashes on launch.  Not working at all.,
Default setting sent audible news notifications at 6:30A.M. Make sure to disable notifications.,
It's really  brilliance thank you guys good work,
"Amazing, impartial journalism and great app.",
Way too one sided.,
Crashes a LOT. Like the content but jeez did you guys even test on Android 7? Unusable.,
Quality journalism. Beautiful app and works flawlessly,
Fake news...enough said.,
All the news that's fit to print....,
App has ads even after paying for subscription!,
Too much fake news,
Trustworthy and interesting articles.,
Great app !!!,
Up-to-date 👍,
Let's try it first,
Fake news,
What is the difference between paid and free version?,
Fast news app,
Love the Times,
So nice,
Easy to use,
Awesome aap,
Informative,
Sux,
"Some kind of weird bug, whenever I open it there's nothing there. I open the app and a little thing pops up on the bottom that says app sections are up to date but all the sections are empty and there are no articles or anything anywhere, just blank pages. I can still see the categories and switch between them and such but there are just no stories anywhere",
"I enjoy the push notifications I'm sent, and the user interface is very easy to navigate. I love reading articles on here between my Sunday papers. I'd give 5 stars, but occasionally the links in an article to another article don't work.",
too biased to subscribe,
Fake news,
عالی,
"I have a smartphone subscription but I am unable to read and prompted to subscribe the tablet version. It means the app doesn't recognize my large phone as a smartphone.    Update 12/30  It turns out it has nothing to do with tablet or cellphone. The issue is from where you subscribed the paper. I was unable to read on my cell phone because I had subscribed on a desktop. I later subscribed from google play store and everything is fine. Of course, I had to call and unsubscribe the early subscription that is duplicate.",
"Update: Transferred myself to a replacement phone, but now I don't get notifications. Contacted support, and they want a screen shot, of not getting notifications. Still true: Good way to read top stories, terrible way to try to read the whole paper.   Alas, cannot use PressReader on Android to read NY Times, on new Nexus 7 that could be nice.",
"In one of the recent updates the NYT has decided that device owners don't have the right to control their own devices. I get numerous push notifications per day now, and there is no way to turn them off. I will use the only option I have left..... Uninstall the app and cancel my subscription.",
"2nd Update. The click bait has gone away Halleluah, but now the app keeps stalling after the latest update.... Original review--Tech: responsive app, loads easily, doesn't crash only slow loading picture galleries. Ads take up space, but are unobtrusive.   Content:  love this paper especially the readers' comments.  The ability to share analysis of the opeds has really opened my mind to other trains of thought.",
"I like the app very much overall but cannot for the life of me turn off the notifications! I've tried the settings numerous times, reinstalled the app, etc, even contacted customer support but never heard back. I'm about to uninstall the app and cancel my subscription because it's so annoying getting half a dozen alerts on my phone each day, either for stories I already know about or ones I have no interest in.",
"I recently switched from a Kindle subscription (terrible) to this app and am very pleased. Articles are laid out crisply, multiple photos can be found in an article and I like the customisable alerts. My only recommendations are to have the articles sorted by descending date (right now, it's mixed up from the past few days) and to allow more than 10 section tabs across the top.",
"I love this app, wonderful, thought-provoking journalism. However, I wish the twilight mode did not just decrease brightness but invert the text colors (white text on a black background). That is my only complaint. Everything else works smoothly.",
"I love the NYT, but this app suffers in two major ways: 1) No actual night theme, like on your mobile website 2) Unacceptably intrusive audio ads that play in the background. This makes me nervous to even open the app, because if I'm on the train, in a cafe, or at work, I can't be sure if my phone is about to shatter everyone's peace, including my own.  Fix these two things, and it will be perfect.",
"After using for several years and providing feedback each time it got glitchy, I finally decided to uninstall the NYT app. Here is my last feedback to developers: "" I am tired of nyt app problems. Please stop building fancy interactive features and just make the basic functionality more robust."" Hope to use it again one day.",
"Great app in general...but I can't open or save recipes to my Cook Box section of the NYT app on my Samsung. No matter what link I click (""Save to Box"" or ""Read more""), I am shown a ""Recipes saved"" page. I can only ever see recipes that I already saved into the Box from my laptop...  strange little bug but it needs to be fixed. Thanks.",
"I don't seem to always have the updated articles, even when I pull to refresh. For example, today, every article appears to be from yesterday or earlier.  I'd love an option to read the paper page by page and at least see the front page similar to print.",
THE GENTLEMEN USED TO RELAX WITH THEIR CIGARS AND SNUFF ON THE COMFORTABLE BIG CHAIRS OF THE WALDORF-ASTORIA BROWSING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGH THE STOCK MARKET PAGES OF THEIR FAVOURITE NEWSPAPER THE NEW YORK TIMES (NEW YORK CITY STYLE WITH A SMILE FOR THIS GENEROUS PREMIUM APP)....FROM JAMES MICHAEL CHAPESKIE BETWEEN YER GREAT NY TIMES AND MY LITTLE RHYMES: DO WE HAVE A THING GOING?? MICHAEL CORLEONE THE GODFATHER,
"For over a month now, this app has had a bug that causes some headlines and paragraphs to appear as black text on a black background, making it unreadable. I have contacted support, and they know of the issue, but have not fixed.",
"Besides articles being horrid, kind of a terrible UI. Including the fact you get 9 or 10 articles free per month. Whoever writes some of these poor articles is the exact reason I will not pay to use",
"App crashes with every use and locks up my device, forcing reboot. Long time user. Seems worse the past few months.",
I trust the NYT. I despise fake news. In these times we need to support our honest media.,
I can not support the nyt after they decided to hire a climate denyer to spread misinformation and promote forced ingnorance.,
"Not a bad way to read the Times, but seems to reload the entire app when it gets new content, dumping you back to the homepage in the middle of reading an article. Quite frustrating.",
"Latest update now tells me I need to subscribe for more articles, however I am already subscribed.",
Love the times but the app hijacks the brightness of my Nexus 5x (Android 7.1.1) and puts it to max. You can turn down the app brightness but then it's not balanced with the phone controls. Result is its unreadable at night so I'll stick with the mobile site...,
I want to read David Brooks article but there is no link for it. There must be a columnist list to read the favourite one.,
"The app isn't a ton different from the mobile site. However, it runs smoother, preloads some articles - helpful for offline areas - and sends notifications for breaking news.",
Love this app but I suddenly stopped getting push notifications for breaking news and no matter what I do I can't get it back.,
"Excellent paper, good app implementation. Monthly subscription cost too high for me. Sadly will uninstall.",
Pull down from top all day and nothing happens. Set to manual refresh but app doesn't work!!! Also Morning and Evening briefings only randomly show up at all. Please fix this app for Android 6.,
This app will not push notifications to my phone. I reached out the NYTimes but they have not helped to addresses the problem.,
"I love the app. The reporting is fantastic. But, one thing is missing. I wish there was a column to show the latest stories. I love to stay up to date with the latest news. I wish I could sort articles by the time written so that I could stay up to date.",
"When the app works it works great but when I try to sign in I always get ""A server error has occurred (error code 200) Please try again later."" So I can never log in.",
"I have a new Android tablet.  I have tried calling  times to get the app to run,  but it smashes immediately, every time.  I have submitted feedback in the app itself but no one responds",
"Intercepts NY Times URL intents and shows them in the native app, so even a link on Twitter is displayed to best advantage.",
"Uninstalling due to blatantly false headlines like the Trump ""intense criticism"" of Republican ethics agenda.",
"I love the New York Times as a news source. However, I have to take a star off for the ads I find in the news service I pay for.",
"Uninstalling the application very soon. I've reached my tolerance of NYT biased reporting, and no longer consider them a viable source for news.",
"When I watch NYT video, it runs Not as smoothly as on peer app of iOS",
Great news source and great app. May not be compatible if you're an illegitimate narcissistic demagogue orange baby man-child with small hands.,
To limit articles to 10 free articles a month is an awful way of attracting new comers,
Excellent news agendas to begin and end my day; up to the minute breaking news alerts!,
I use this app daily to get all the latest news in an easy to manage app.,
Very one sided. I want the real news not fake news,
"This is unfair reporting, to much propaganda, a totally useless newspaper.",
Hard to find unbiased news these days when it gets to Trump. NYT Def not one of them.,
Having trouble with app telling me I don't have a subscription when I do. This is a new bug with a recent version. Will someone please fix it? It's blocking me everyone I read more than 10 articles.,
"Great app, love the comment section. Ads need to be removed for paying subscribers!",
"Works well, clean interface, a oleasure to use.",
You ate very anti Trump and too liberal,
When you go to settings it immediately gets brighter. Hard to read otherwise.,
no uninstall button.  get your software off my device now!,
Solid app to read the news and book reviews,
Very easy to use!,
Retired,
Morning coffee and click on the NYT app.  Daily ritual.,
It's very complete.,
Never be not well-informed.,
Typical non news American lies,
Top news,
Can't be moved to external SD card. Why not? Not enough internal storage space. Removed.,
Keep fighting against him!,
It' a really great app to know up-to-date news.,
"Great news. App works well. Looks good, too.",
Night mode needs to be dark background lite/white text,
为黑而黑，代表中产阶级，垃圾,
Is it too much to ask for an ad free experience when I am already paying for the content?,
Why NEED to access to my file?!,
Easy yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Loving it...,
journalists.,
Why do I get ads on the paid subscription?,
The screen occasionally dims when using settings. Why?,
Very good info,
Great updates,
Great app,
Fine,

Awesome,

"I love the mini crossword and the morning briefings. The search function is completely useless and navigating to previous columns within a regular feature is almost impossible. Still, it is the NYT and the content is excellent.",
"I am a daily paper subscriber who does not always have time to sit down and read. I sometimes like to listen to the article by transferring the article to the app Voice Reader. Although I am logged in, the article doesn't transfer but instead displays an error message, ""Log In"". This is currently occurring more and more frequently. Does anyone know how to fix this or is this coming straight from this ""app's authorities""? If that's the case, then allow a device internally to read aloud the article. Listening and reading allows me to absorb the material better.",
"When opening an article by clicking on a notification, most of the article is obscured by black boxes.",
One sided point of view. Look for alternatives so you can get the real picture.,
"Fabulous news paper. Incredible worldwide reporters and analysis. My family has been reading for generations.Keep up the good work. Thanks for enlightening so many of us, here in this country and across the globe.",
"An oasis in an era otherwise marked by a drought of reliable news, analysis, and informed opinion.",
Don't want this app. HATE the notifications. Very annoying! Wish I could uninstall this crap!,
"I can't get this to automatically update stories on my Android phone.  Why can't the Times give us the Today's Paper app, which works well on my tablet?",
Why do I continue to get NYT notifications when they're all unchecked? Running latest app rev on Google pixel.,
Bugs and lies thats all thats here,
Great if you need an app that crashes right after you open it.,
Good news items from U.S.A.,
"To the Heart,straight up!",
Save article feature is great for reading later and not missing news,
I didn't ask for it and I can't uninstall it.  Bad Samsung!,
App works fine but 10 articles a month is a bit ridiculous when there are also ads and a lot of alternatives for news. No thanks.,
It's full of fake articles. What gives?,
too much liberal bias,
How could I go on without it ? If only we could go back to when we had white on black background.,
Love it,
Best ever,
N Y Times,
"For a paid subscription there is a lot of advertisements, have to have a light touch when scrolling.  Reviewing latest news is simple and the search is powerful.",
I get blocked after the 10 free articles even after logging in...guess I'll go back to reading in the browser.,
"Used to only read free news, but realized quality sources is super important. Cool interactive features sometimes, and amazing infographics. Highly recommended",
Easy to use app puts all of the NYT's resources at my fingertips.,
"It works smoothly and quickly.  Easy to use, natural gestures.",
"Easy to navigate,  pleasing to the eye...love the mini crossword!",
The perfect news app to stimulate the mind and stay informed.,
It gives me a fun few minutes in my busy day.,
Well thought out and usable from navigation to font choice.,
And stories worth reading.,
This is real news from a real newspaper.,
"Good journalism,  expertly delivered",
This is great,
Good app,
Great app,
"I really like being able to read the Times when I find small spaces in my day.  Overall the app continually is improving. It used to hang and crash  occasionally, and sometimes has trouble updating with new articles.  The content is great, and the new feeds from other sources are a nice addition.",
"Started subscription in late summer, recognising that the reporting at NYT (not alone) is critical to our democracy, not to put too fine a point on it. However in the digital format, the headlines feature one Trump head after another.  May I suggest other photos behind the story: follow what he does, but not the bombast he peddles.",
The NY Times is so far from reporting real unbiased news. All its news stories are articles ruthlessly bashing on the people they don't agree with or fluff pieces on awful people that should have hate pieces. If you want propaganda come here otherwise maybe try the WSJ. The app is designed really well through. I'll give them that.,
"I don't pride myself on very much. But one thing I do pride myself on is that I read the New York Times every day.  This app puts it on my phone. I am more informed about what's going on in the world than anyone I know. There are a lot of news sources out there these days but if you want to pick one, like I did, this is the gold standard.",
Thank goodness for NY Times!,
"Be warned I'm subscribing if they offer a small monthly payment deal.  Now that I have the app, there's no turning back. I'm hooked. They deserve to be paid for outstanding journalism in a sea of fake social media news. The transcript of the recorded Trump interview alone is worth the price of a subscription.",
"Absolutely the best newspaper in the country. I am constantly amazed at the breadth, depth and quality of the stories published in the Times. It is a must read for any serious news consumer. I begin and end my day scrolling through the app and often visit several more times each day.",
"I subscribed during election 2016 and have not looked back. The navigation is elegant, easy to understand, and of course the content is superior. I mentally moved in to the ""digital newspaper"" space with this because I saw how nice it could be. Many other newspaper apps are clunky, and reading web pages on my phone is clunky. Not this.",
"There's little excuse for not giving the New York Times at least a skimming every day. I'd give its Android app five out of five stars if it more closely mirrored the printed edition; as it is, with the app I feel like I'm missing stories that are easy to find in the printed edition. But even having just the app is far better than having no New York Times at all.",
"The New York Times cannot be trusted to provide reliable news, in light of its recent election coverage. The newspaper ignored most candidates in the Democratic primary,  and didn't report what Trump and Sanders were saying about trade.  If you want the truth, go elsewhere.   This newspaper should change its name to Pravda.",
They have they're own biased agenda.  It is truly disgusting how tarnished this rag has become. Anything! Associated with Time Warner is tainted and politicized left and is so self righteous they never realize its there own corruption that drives the right.           ZERO HEDGE IS THE NEW NEW YORK TIMES.. . .for those who want to know what good journalism was and still is.,
"Had a reoccurring problem that limited access to ten articles with a paid subscription.I accessed the subscription by application, and the NYT website.Spoke to NYT representatives, who told me that I needed to contact Google.I spoke with Google repeatedly, who told me to contact NYT.After several calls, and two months of paid subscription, I spoke with a NYT rep, who sent me a confirmation email, that fixed the problem. Now both Google, and NYT are saying that the other is responsible for past charge's.",
I've been a NYT addict since I first got my paper subscription upon moving to NYC eight years ago. This app has just made the addiction worse. Stories update progressively - before they appear in the print version. You can read articles when offline (on the subway). You can save and send articles. Of course there is the world class reporting. It's irresistible.,
"NY TIMES is well-laid-out, attractive, and it's easy to find the sections. Lots of new content daily, and worth the subscription price, especially if you hold out for one of their frequent reduced price deals. The writing is good and informative. I use this app several times every day.",
"I tell so many people about this app I should be paid by the NYTimes. This app not only keeps me informed, it gives me ideas, stimulates endless conversations and helps me impress clients. I have deleted the  Facebook and Instagram apps so I use this app more. It's just as addictive but it feeds your brain rather than drains it.",
"I use the NYT app every day as part of my electronic subscription.  It is a joy to use, absolutely 0% frustration level. I like that I can select the sections that I want to save to my phone, so that I can download those quickly in the morning and read the Times during the day even when I don't have an Internet connection.",
"Great app that is easy to use and gets you to the news you want to read quickly. The news is real news based on real facts not an opinion slanted to a populist position that appeals to the masses. Yes they provide opinions but it very clear when they do and they are often balanced, you get two sides of the story. Finally an app and news service worth my time.",
Love this app. One small issue with the photo widget navigation (left/right arrows) not working. Otherwise I'm in this thing every day and finally made the leap to subscribe because of how much I found myself using the app. Overall well done!!,
"With Trump elected as President we are in uncertain future.  Fear among minorities and blacks is valid,  divisiveness cuts through America, hate and racism is just around the corner and every streets of the nation; Democracy is in peril.   NY times serves as a beacon of free speech.  It's fearless unyielding reporting, excellent investigative journalism and top notch army of journalist will serve as check and balance to bigotry and fascist tendencies of present leadership.",
"10,000,000.. that's the size of the in-crowd, those elite, arugula eating, latte sipping connoisseurs of hard news, thoughtful insight, and, of course, New York Fashion Week - not to mention the Mini Crossword (my record is 41 seconds). Coffee and the Times: the definition of morning. This is far and away the best newspaper app of them all - and I've tried them all. But you don't realize what a treasure a subscription is until that first time you do a search. Indispensable.",
"BOUGHT NOV 5 16 IT SHOULD NOT BE A OLDER VERSION whPlay store says it's valid but cannot get over 10 articles.   Unable to remedy.  I have been on hold for 25 minutes because they say can not find my account.  They just checked in with me to say they were working on it @ 27 minutes.   They found my account but still can not make it happen.  They will be back ""shortly""  ok they got back to me.   Need to send screen shot and they will call in 48 hou s. 1hour 10 min on phone.",
"5 stars because real journalism is critical to fight the post-truth era.  App is good, quick and responsive even on my crappy wifi. Briefings, morning and evening top story summaries are an outstanding feature.  Needs improvement though, old news and stays in feed even when it's been read.  New articles and ""lesser"" stories should replace these. There's no way to browse through the entire day's news the way you would with a physical newspaper.",
"No newspaper is perfect, but at least the New York Times admits it. I wanted intelligently written information on a timely basis, and I get it from the New York Times. Plus Cooking!!! It's wonderful for anyone who has an education and enjoys the truth whether they like it or not. People who have no respect for the truth, or fear the consequences, don't speak the truth. I'm glad you are here NY Times, during this assault on democracy!!",
"I read it because it's true you can get the facts if you keep going to the bottom, but a huge number of news stories are not news but opinion, often just speculation. Choice of what to cover is also heavily tilted left.",
"The Opinion section is especially informative, given the inclusion of guest columnists and diverse viewpoints. I also find the addition of the column by those living with various mental and physical challenges crucial to educating and encouraging readers and those with whom they interact.",
"I'm glad to have a quick, easy way to read news I trust. I think that the subscription fee is a necessary part of  supporting good journalism. The one drawback for me is that there is no Education section on the app. I have contacted them about this, and the reply was pretty much to read that section on the real site. I wish they would just include the Education section on the app!",
"These days I find myself reading The Times across 3 different digital devices, often all in the same day. This app has proven more convenient than using a web browser for this purpose.",
"If you want to know what's going on in the world, you can read other papers. If you want to be educated, read the New York Times. It is one of few papers left that still do investigative journalism. It is one of only several who are still willing to spend the time and the money on it in a 24 hour news cycle when most papers and websites care only about clickbait and pushing out material. The work the Times does bringing corruption and injustices to light is imperative for our democracy. We must support it.",
Pre installed on my tablet but the last thing i need is a tabloid paper trying to pawn itself off as news.  They are more in the dnc tank then huffington post.  I visit huffpo but they at least are honest where they stand.  BTW - i never vote by party but the media in this country either needs to be honest that they are mouthpieces for the dem party or return to writing the NEWS!,
Once venerated news source is now reduced to biased propaganda machine like CNN. Do yourself a favor use BBC or NHK for real journalistic intergrity. These guys are so biased you'll have a hard time keeping your lunch down.,
Nothing wrong with the app. The problem is the NY TIMES Staff. After they totally miscalculated the presidential election they now try to discredit the winner.  They are the real loser. And by the way I did not vote for Trump.,
"I have been using this app for a couple months now.  The app is great and the news is even better.  We NEED to be plugged in to the world around more than ever before.  Print news such as the Times (there are others,  Post,  etc).  We need to support this deep journalism more than ever.  Our Democracy depends on it.  And print news is struggling.  Get a subscription!   Support you Free Press!!!",
"They are biased, but that's because they're on the right side of history. They can be wrong about their guesses and predictions, but they're not wrong in being reflective. The negativity against the Trump campaign, for example, is completely warranted. You may not agree with them, but maybe there's a reason that such a respected news site argues for the things it does. Take the nyt with a grain of salt. Not only that, but they're very good at what they do. I love the daily mini-crossword, too.",
"Nyt is garbage. This isn't news, this is a bunch of progressives whining about why the world just won't revolve around them. They deliver half the facts and spin it to fit their right/left coast ideology. The rest of the country doesn't matter!",
As much  information as the desktop version with the ease of a user friendly app. I love it. No complaints. I look forward to opening the app. No annoying notifications - just enough. Layout doesn't trigger information overload. You want to click articles and read more.,
"This app is the first one I look at each morning for news, culture, cooking, and humanity. I don't get the physical paper, so I pay for a digital subscription, and it is worth it. I have seen criticism of the Times, but, I find myself more aligned with its perspective than with conservative institutions.",
"Professional journalism is seriously undervalued these days. You should look outside traditional media for underreported stories, but don't throw the clichéd baby out with the bathwater.",
"The Op-ed pieces are a mix of styles and outlooks, and always male me open my eyes a little wider in our world",
"The new article trying to normalize pedophilia is disgusting. This news organization ,if it can even be called that, is in serious decline",
"In all of the crazy, I am relieved to have the talented writers and a gray lady at my fingertips each day.",
Able to get my daily news quick and easy. If I have time able to access plenty of other content fairly easily.,
Recently joined the ranks of the NYT subscribers and I love the app. Keeps me reading long form instead of mindlessly scrolling Twitter. I docked it a star because the header bar is not customizable. I would like the California section up there instead of sports.,
As long as  conservatives like  Maureen Dowd are given a huge voice..reporting remains suspect,
One sided biased reporting from the New York times... they accept money from the Democrat party in exchange for this bias reporting and fake poll reaults,
"Couldn't live without my NYT.  I am thrilled that I can access it on my android phone.  If there are any imperfections (as others claim), just having the NYT far outweighs any of those ""flaws"", for me.",
The app is well designed and caches most of the day's articles so they can be read offline at your convenience.,
"False information being presented as ""real"" news stories, just a leftist propaganda hate machine.",
This app keeps telling me how bad our President-elect is and how afraid I should be. I'd rather spend my time uniting our great country. Horrible organization. I don't trust them at all.,
"It was included on my device and can't be disabled. Opinionated political junk pops up on my screen every day, I Hate it.",
"Works well for me on all my devices. No problems, really easy to navigate and read the paper on my phone.",
The most reliable news in a format that really works for mobile platforms.  I couldn't go a day without it.,
"Lots of resources poured in, but all with a very obvious agenda.",
"I much prefer the Wall Street Journal app, in how you can essentially read through the days edition, and not rely on stories I'm interested in bring ""top"" or ""recent"".  I like the webapp for today's paper- I would love to see an android app look like that!",
"The New York Times is my newspaper of choice, has been for a long time.  The app is easy to use, videos are interesting, and love the crossword.  It's reporting is the best, bar none.  It's especially important since Murdock bought the Wall Street Journal.",
"Hate filled, fear mongering propaganda. Any thinking person can see this.",
"Downloads day's paper for all-day reading of best written, most thoughtful articles in the English language",
"Easy to use and navigate. Good news alerts without being excessive, and I love the morning news summary.",
"In an age where facts are ignored or discarded, you can rely on The Times to deliver them faithfully.",
"Not perfect, but so much better than almost anything else. These days, outside of  reliable and committed sources, you have to assume most of what we're told is hogwash.",
"So many lies and biase. Dont waste you time, this an CNN are in a roll getting caught lying to the people and being biased.",
Can't tell the difference between them and the DNC propaganda.,
"I get the daily on app and the weekend in print. I've had a subscription since I was 18, no matter where I lived. I cannot function without this newspaper.",
"NYT has became too opinionated, no idea why they went from news to opinions is my guess. If your looking for news without opinions, look elsewhere",
"No longer even readable due to the absurd degree of blatant bias. Honestly can't call it journalism,  it's simply a never ending loop of identically slanted opinion pieces.",
"Love this app, easy to navigate.  Disappointed crossword puzzle subscription for IPhone only, but otherwise, I have no complaints.",
"Visually attractive and well organized, but it is not a replacement for the standard browser based newspaper format that is better suited to PCs and tablets.",
I am really enjoying how incisive the NYT is. From Australia the NYT provides a clear point of view of the machinations of the election.  I am going to subscribe.,
"I use this several times a day. It's how I stay in touch with the world. Events happen and change fast, NY Times keeps me up to speed. I also use it for recipes, book and movie reviews, it's got everything!",
"NOT promises to be more honest, really isn't that supposed to be business as usual.",
"I open this app throughout the day. I particularly like that it downloads the first time I open it so I can read it offline later, like when I'm on an airplane.",
Mostly fluff and censored corporate media coverage. 146 US Citizens injured by US police last night at Standing Rock. Ignored by the Times.,
"Bunch of liars.  Used to be a fan, until I realized how biased NYT is.   Manipulative and misleading are words I would use to describe the majority of their stories..",
"The wide range and authoritative reporting available in this app are not surpassed. The app itself is good, better than others, but not without flaws although they are not major.",
"The Times is great. The app, though, tends 2 open articles that u may not want 2 open, but too bad. That causes ""10 free articles"" to be a lot less in reality.",
On multiple devices I get the error that I am offline when trying to log in. No response from tech support yet.  Edit: I just forwarded my existing support email to the address provided by a response to this review. I'll update the review if/when this is resolved.,
"Love this app.  The only drawback is the 10 free article limit, but I still enjoy it.",
"The whole paper, with the outstanding  writing on everything,  is in the app.  Too bad they forgot to cover Bernie.",
"Really well-designed and makes it easy to read the majority of articles and other features. Occasionally has issues with some of the more interactive articles, but that's really a rarity.",
This is the worst news source in modern history. Mostly opinion  based with almost no facts backing up there claims. Fake news....,
Works good on my HTC M9. Video streaming and map features work best on Wi-Fi.,
"The reading experience is very good and the app makes it easy to skim headlines.  If it were easier to search articles and save things like recipes, it would be 5 stars.",
"The New York Times is nothing more than a corporate owned propaganda outlet for the Democrat party, elitists, and globalists, and former Nazi George Soros",
"My most used app.  I can depend on receiving timely updates, and look forward to the mini-crossword every evening.",
"I was frustrated with the ten free article limit, which convinced me to try a one month of this at the discounted student education price of $4 a month. It's worth it. For the price of a RedBull, I get legitimate news that otherwise blocks me out if I had exceeded my limit before. Try it it's worth a shot!",
"When I open a NYTimes article on a link from facebook, annoyingly the app doesn't open it as a default. I must choose manually to open it on the app.",
"So easy to navigate to my favorite sections of the paper. Also, great use of new and interactive media.",
"Love this app and the NYTimes.  Great journalism, great recipes, exceptional opinion pieces and a daily mini crossword, too! Thanks!",
STORIES ARE ON POINT AND INTERESTING.THE SHORT CROSSWORD IS A GOOD WAY TO GET YOUR DAY GOING.,
Terrible bias and a poor app. You'd be better spending money on real journalists that aren't liberal sponsor puppets NYT!,
"I use this app when I wake up in the morning. It's easy to use, moved easily from story to story, and allows me the read what I wish. It is easy to navigate on my cell phone.",
"This company is a racist fake news outlet. I cancelled my subscription because of their bias, and the fake news they keep putting out. Everyone at this company should be ashamed of themselves and fired.",
i consult the NY times app multiple times every day and in a substantial manner. i really enjoy my subscription.,
"Clean look, thorough and timely. Just what you would expect from the New York Times. They get the facts right.",
"Stop writing and publishing false equivalencies, like someone being threatened to be lit on fire because she wears a hijab with someone who is a Trump supporter white supremacist, just like you did with Hillary Clinton's emails with Trump's frauds, sexual assaults, etc...and by the way, the Alt-right is a nazi white supremacist group, not just a bunch of innocent hipsters...you are misleading readers.",
Headlines are here first and they do some incredible investigative journalism. Plus their recipes are for real people. You don't have to be Julia Child,
"Support the NY Times, the app works very well and we are going to be depending on the writers for the road ahead.",
"This app looks good and is easy to use, but it does not let you review the articles in todays paper.  Instead it reorders content into what it wants you to read.  Often showing days old articles, andmaking the most recent news nearly impossible to find.",
So far the NYT app works smoothly. Good design. Now a year later the NYT app ranks among the few I can honestly say are reliable. My coffee and NYT app start my day.,
"Easy to use, articles are easy to find again after I've read them. Use this app every morning with my coffee.",
"This app, particularly the daily briefing, keep me in the know about important stuff instead of my Facebook feed.",
"Yes. It's the New York times, but not everything can be a subscription service. And considering how much free news exists on the Web, the 9.99 per month to pushes this one off my list.",
At least I know what I am reading is legitimate.  $4/month student discount is an unbeatable price,
"So great, I only wish they had the front page and full crossword. Then it would be 5 stars.",
One thing I can't seem to figure out is where my recipe box is after one of the last updates.,

I enjoy the times although it reports the news through the prism of the eastern liberal establishment and is quite far from an independent news source.,
"Love the app! I read more of the paper than I ever did with the print edition, and the app provides superior navigation of the site.",
"This app is a great source of reporting issues around the world. Unlike other news apps that focus on entertainment news, NYT app focuses on the issues affecting others around the world even if it had nothing to do with the United States.",
It's really easy to check out everything going on and dip into the stuff that interests you. Support journalists that bring us the news!,
"Easy to navigate, well defined sections. I love the morning/evening collection of important stories. Great for skimming subjects or in depth interests. Journalism at its best.",
The Times remains the US newspaper of record. Facts matter. No paper better represents factual reporting better than the New York Times.,
"Excellent articles and I have something to stand on during these days of unprofessional entertainment that calls itself ""news.""   But I do have other things to do besides ""read the paper"" Hard to put down!",
"There's no way to cancel a DIGITAL subscription without make a phone call, because they apparently want to make it as inconvenient as possible. What garbage.",
This isn't so much a news app as it is a propaganda app for the Democrats. The bias and low level of journalistic integrity is stunning.,
I work over night at a group home and enjoy this app during down time and to catch up with news on my schedule.,
"NYT app offers news of the day in concise, well-written articles.  Appreciate the ability to swipe right or left for the next article.  Enjoy the mini-crossword",
I treasure having the NYT right at hand. The articles are informative &  more even-handed than most US newspapers. The entertainment sections are tops. But... Why am I supposed to pay so much for a subscription to the NYT crossword puzzles? Sigh...,
"I only miss the option of night reading (black background,  white font) but everything else is great.",
"A great way to keep up with the full spectrum of news, from global to local, plus insightful commentary from a variety of viewpoints. Can't do without it!",
Not able to read any article.unless there is no subscription. Come on times this is not fair.,
"This is where I prefer to get my news. The app functions well, never had any trouble.",
"I love getting the morning and evening briefings on my phone. I'm a news junkie, especially politics, and this is perfect! Small, interesting bites, with depth and breadth easily available.",
Called again [3rd time] to cancel because I no longer need it. Took  few calls and emails but the rep I spoke with today was extremely helpful.,
"The NYT is quickly becoming the champion of the first amendment, and by extension the heart of American identity. Their articles are not extraordinary because they are well written; they are extraordinary because of the emotions they are able evoke.",
Read it twice a day also subscribe to print edition. All the zeitgeist of the human spectrum is here...and the comments are amazing with all POV represented.,
"I never thought I would forego print for an app but this really suits my busy life. Easy to navigate, well-organized, the typical Times great writing.. and access to the NYT cooking resources!",
The ease of use of the new york times app is great. I use it for most of my US centric news.,

I don't have to read anything else even in social media. Thank you for such great news and analysis. Great app as well.,
"Sometimes responsive design isn't so responsive across devices, but that's not the case with this app. It's perfect and reliable. Love the way it presents the news on my Android device as well as my tablet and desktop.",
Very easy to use. No operational  flaws are apparent. It's an app that I would recommend.,
I wish the app was reporting much different news of late - not NYT's fault.,
"No other complete news service compares to the comprehensive,  engaging copy and imagery available here.",
These people that work here are out of there minds. Constant liberal lies!,
A great way to get a head start on the news of the day. I also love the mini crossword.,
"Most stories and they are stories are beyond biased you never get an apposing view, this is brainwashing gone into overdrive.",
Love the evening brief. I get all caught up on news of the day.,
The app is constantly evolving and getting better. You can tell that there is a lot of effort being put behind the scenes. Thank you NYT!,
"Access to the articles, notifications for breaking news and a small crossword. Even better if you're a subscriber",
A solid and capable app delivering news from a generally credible organization that sometimes digs deep.,
Please just report the news instead of telling us what we should think.,
"The app like the paper itself delivers great content, well organized and reasonably easy to search . Although I still get the Sunday paper in print, I use this almost exclusively for both breaking and in-depth coverage",

"Anywhere I am in the world, I get up to date world news from a reliable, rational news source.  Appreciate the regular updates and daily briefings via the app.  Reading the daily paper with the app is crucial to my daily activities.",
I discover articles I wouldn't read in print - long form that I'll avoid to not spend the time on normally.,
"Does what I need.  Gives me the news and timely alerts. I do, however, wish the alerts were customizable. Also, since the inexcusable errors in election predictions, I am less inclined to trust the reporting.  Something I would NEVER have said pre-election.",
"NYT is the best ever newspaper, and this app is worth it. You can find everything easily, the font is very pleasant. It's a pleasure to read my favorite newspaper with this app. I do not regret that I do not have a paper copy of NYT",
"Great way to enjoy the news on the go. Brings all the features of the print version and teams it with all the videos, graphics to your fingertips.",
"If you want a newspaper that makes you think, look no further than the NY Times.  NYT journalists don't dish out pablum to their readers; rather, they create an argumentative edge in their stories that leave readers satisfied and wanting more...",
Great newspaper. We need this now more than ever to keep the corrupt Trump administration in check.,
Whether at home or abroad authoritative news is always at hand! I like being able to adjust the brightness for reading in the evening!,
Reliable synopsis of key stories each day is the best way to summarize the latest news and then choose articles to read in depth.,
I have always enjoyed the new York Times. It is great to get it online every day.,

They learned nothing from the election.  Still catering to progressives and liberals.,

"After getting a bit of it free, I willingly--&, by then, knowingly--bought the rest of it. The Times' almost instant, encyclopedic thoroughness & reach isn't always what I want to spend even my retiree's extra time on--until it is.  And if I've saved pieces, which some days is all I do, I can go back, find them, & follow the links, either purposefully or whimsically. As now.",

BUT App,
Thanks.,
All my other news apps are free and have ads... This one limits your reading and also has ads. No thanks. I'll just read NYT on my home pc where I can block the ads and read all the articles I want. Thanks.,
NYT,
"Now, more than ever, it's time to support the Fourth Estate.  It's under attack, and the ""Gray Lady"" New York times is on the forefront of journalistic excellence.  This app reflects that excellence in every way.",
"New York Times is no longer the truthful and honest news media outlet I have grown up with and loved. It is truly sad and disgusting how biased and one sided this news media outlet has become. They never display the narrative for what is it, instead they do everything in their power to smear hate on anyone who opposes their opinions. I will see you again when you decide to be a news media, instead of a brainwashing machine for the left.",
"The NYT is a bulwark of professional journalism and I'm happy to be a subscriber. App runs fine for me with no problems. The only negative is that you still gets ads in the app even if you are a subscriber. I guess they have to do that to keep the lights on, but it is annoying since I'm already paying monthly.",
"Says I'm logged into my subscription, but I continue to get the ""10 articles goes fast"" screen/obligatory subscription solicitation.  Makes this app useless.  How do I access NY times on my Samsung Galaxy 5 Active (Android 6.0.1 AT&T)",
"After using several news apps for a few months now, I can honestly say that this one is my favorite. If you only pay for one news source subscription, it should be NYT (their student discount is extremely helpful). Also, I'm a big fan of the ""daily briefing"" feature and the daily mini-crossword.",
"The app worked great - for one week.  Now I keep getting an error message saying I need to subscribe, even though I have already subscribed.  When I click on the subscribe button, it says there is an error and that I am already subscribed.  In the meantime, I can't read any articles, but my credit card has been charged.  I have been on the phone with both NYT and Google Play, and each blames the other.",
Overall the app is pretty good but there is a bug in the app which doesn't allow direct email login. I always get offline error when trying to login. I'm an existing subscriber so this is a bit frustrating. Update: found a workaround. Link your google account to your nytimes account in the browser e.g. chrome & then login to the app using your google account. It works. But hopefully these issues will be fixed soon!,
I've subscribed NY Times for a while and the auto payment just went throught on the 2nd of this month but today it keeps telling me the 10 free articles go fast and I can choose either option to subscribe in order to get unlimited access. Please fix the problem.,
"I pay every month for the times on my ipad. Then this site asks e to pay again. Phooey.  The Washington Post will work on iPad, internet, or Android for the same subscription",
First thing I look at in the morning; check it throughout the day. Easy to navigate and read on my phone.,
"All ready a subscriber, I loaded this app on my new android phone.  It constantly prompts me to subscribe or log on. I do so, go back to the app and it IMMEDIATELY prompts me to subscribe or log on. This repeats over and over. Pain in the ass.",
"Great content, great app. Looks beautiful, has few if any glitches and is easy to navigate. I recommend it to anyone who wants to read U.S. or world news.",
I would have given it 5 stars but the stubborness or laziness of the developers prevents this app from being moved to External storage. Too many developers think their app is too precious to be move to external media.,
"Reading an article. Click home. Open app. Back at the home page. What an awful experience. Not to mention garish, intrusive adverts.",
I m enjoying. A lot reading nyt I am very frustrated and ican t understand.   why. even if i lautomatically renew every month my subcription i can t read the whole articles  YM,
"Cooking section ""recipe box"" not supported in Android. Only Apple gets that love.  Most ridiculous thing ever. Not really work the money.",
Support for a free and independent press has never been more important. I'll do my part by subscribing.,
Ridiculous that I have to call a phone number to cancel my subscription.,
It's easy to decide what you want to delve into based on the headlines. Cover all interests.,
"App works great - as for the paper itself, its still my go-to source",
Adding this to bolster your subscriptions to prove Trump wrong.,
Totally incompatible with Android 7. Must cancel subscription,
"Why does it take away my backlight option on my phone? The screen is too bright, and I find it very intrusive they take away that option. My screen brightness is not yours to control.",
I rely on the NYT everyday for my news to learn what is going on around the world.,
Fantastic way to stay abreast of daily news and NY scene.,
Efficient way to get daily news,
Biased dishonest reporting to the extreme,
Every time I try to log in it says that I can't log in because I'm offline.  I am not offline.,
Terrific reporting in the post-truth age.,
The best newspaper in America in digital format.,
I use it every day.,
Remember when NYT was actually news? I don't.,
Great news app,
Works great. Really clean,
Excellent app.  Stay informed and support journalism.,
I can't afford to read the news now.,
Hoping to increase NY Times readership after Trump says it's decreasing.,
Terrific App!,
Great interface.,
Amazing experience,
Biased stories,
Works great,
Greatest newspaper,
TARZAN.SUPERMAN.SPIDERMAN.BATMAN,
"I'm already a subscriber but when I try to log in, my screen goes dark, and it's says I'm offline when I submit my credentials.  Please help.",
به دردم نمی خوره,
"Gone are the days of unbiased journalism, if the NY Times is anything to go by.  The Times is unapologetically absolutely the most biased, slanted, and crooked news outfit in existence today.  It's flat out disgusting the way that their articles are written, carefully selected, and censored when the occasional slip does happen.  Go find another outlet that actually has a desire to report the true news without a side agenda.",
"I generally like reading the NY Times, however, receiving a half-dozen Trump notifications each day is an annoyance. What was once an informative news source with valuable push notifications has become an hourly digest of Trump misquotes aimed at making the administration look foolish. It might be an easy target but a little balance would have been nice.",
"The content is mostly excellent.  Every paper has its editorial slant, but the NY Times is a worthwhile read. The 2016-10-20 update froze my phone until I cleared the cache on this app.",
"Regardless of whether you agree with the editorial content of the NYT, their app is superior to nearly every other news app out there. It is easy to use. It does not crash. When you get an alert, no matter when you click on the alert, you go to the story mentioned in the alert and not to something else entirely. One can save articles. One can comment on some articles and the comments are moderated (a definite plus..just check out comments on sites without unmoderation...appalling). Articles are categorized.",
"You get to read 10 free articles per month? If you swipe that's considered a read even if you only read the headline and move on.  There  are plenty of free read news apps, why would I subscribe. NY Times has been involved in so many scandals involving bias and outright lying, they should pay users to read their garbage.",
"Latest update freezes articles, then phone when you try to close app. Congrats, NYT! Great accomplishment to cut off paying customers less than 2 weeks before 2016 Presidential Election.",
"I think the ads should pay for this app not the ppl, so I will use CNN and others for free,  unlimited articles.",
"App is good, but contents are partial and misleading, I could not follow election news on this app bcz it keeps favoring Hillary and I am willing to see more impartial contents and just news. Sorry about my honest review.",
"I am a Times Insider digital subscriber - in other words, the NYT already gets $25/month from me for full-blown web access.  Either this app requires an ADDITIONAL $10/month to be useful beyond 10 articles a month, or it doesn't work properly on my Samsung Galaxy S2 tablet.  I routinely hit the 10 article/mo limit within the first 2 days of a  new month, and for the rest of the month I get a useless daily notification with links I can't follow.  I try to sign in with my NYT user name and password, and it still blocks me.  After several months of trying, I've uninstalled it.  Update: the problem turned out to be an issue with my old digital account.  After several strings of email with NYT, the account has been corrected; I have full access to this app without additional money (in fact, I may be paying less! time will tell).  The app works well.  Updated from 1 star to 5.  If there were a separate rating for NYT Customer Service, I'd give them 5 stars as well.  Thanks, folks!",
So long are the days where journalists reported freely. This outlet is operated completely by the corrupt Democrats,
Im giving one star because NY Times is charging money to read articles. It should be made free and they should rather earn money from ads.,
"It's a great way to catch up on what I want to read later. I like the combination of videos, and large and small photos.",
"Select a news to read, go to page then automatically goes back to main page. It counts that as a read also. Take it back to redevelopment. Absolute rubbish!",
Easy to navigate. Best journalism in a newspaper comparatively. Comments implementation is horrible and extremely frustrating. No way to easily review comments that you have posted and the replies. It's actually easier just to use the website.,
Constantly drops out. Extremely frustrating experience trying to read article.,
"This has improved steadily and has achieved true excellence. Easy to read, easy to navigate.  Visually stunning.  Provides the nation's most essential newspaper with reporting on national and world news, arts coverage, and science like no other.",
"I have been a subscriber to the replica edition which gives me an image of the actual newspaper with all the ads just like the paper version.  You scroll through it like reading a newspaper.  But the subscription also gives me the digital version.  If the computer has enough power it works just fine.  Like to think my monthly subscription supports the journalists of this fine newspaper, the press being the foundation of our democracy.  The pictures on the replica edition are amazing.  The digital version is more convenient because there are articles from the recent week or so mixed in with the articles from today.",
Thankful for the ability to pick up the Times at any time. Well written news plus interactive features.,
Family physician (pension),
It's not really news!,
Great app. with high load speed and tab between pages,
I really enjoy the times on my cell phone.,
Great source of news. Sometimes difficult to update.,
Super easy to find the best articles any time.,
Edition world news paper,
Great app for the greatest newspaper in the world!,
"Well researched, balanced, concise reporting. Enjoy the ""Daily Briefings""",
Love my NY Times.,
Wonderful to read interesting stories. I like it.,
Headlines  enough to alert me  to the news,
News paper,
"Hometown News and World News , National News.",
REAL News,
Can't adjust notifications - bye!,
App works well...  delivers news efficiently,
"I love most of this, but my daily cross word? Where is it?",
Monthly subscription fee? Why bother installing this pathetic app?,
Great!,
Liberal propaganda,
Indispensible!,
Most convenient way to stay abreast of news,
"With the latest update they removed the option for selection between US and international version of NYT. I'm now stuck with US version, there is no section for Europe news now.",
No longer is the fair & balanced paper of record. This paper continues to show such open bias & political partisanship it has disgraced itself as respected journalism,
"Slants too much. Just give us facts. Throughout the paper, its more of their opinions than straight up info.",
Media should not be picking sides in an election . Plus there's so much news not being reported . Bye bye,
The option to disable notifications has recently become broken. Had to disable in Android app settings.,
"International reader. Way too many political stories that are so obviously bias against Trump. I don't like the guy either, but give us some variety!",
Provides all the latest coverage on whatever Hilary Clinton wants you to hear.,
Past and present information is always a keystroke away! Have been a Times reader for decades. But digital takes it to a whole new level. Kudos!,
"This app is terrible from the bottom up.  Bloated, slow, nonsensical UI.",
Reliable reporting and clear photos. Easier then reading and folding the actual newspaper.,
But when ever we open the App the  brightness increases that's why 3 star please resolve,
"Really? Someone please explain why you would ""improve"" something that worked perfectly well. Did y'all learn nothing from Yahoo?",
"Clean, responsive, and updates quickly. Leagues ahead of the new Washington Post app",
"Very good app overall. One issue however is the recent removal of the Asia Pacific section, why was it removed ??",
No better than the National Enquirer nowadays.,
Great news app features all the top stories I need every day,
It's my favorite newspaper.,
Doesn't always tie in with existing  digital subscription.,
The NYTIMES app is the best!,
"Spam, remove it.",
You subscribe and still you have to pay,
Fake news,
great jewel of America,
what coudln't I access saved articles?,
Loved it,
real facts,
"I look at the NY TIMES app many times a day, and always find interesting stories there.",
"Quality of app starting to improve. Although, it is slow and sometimes the images I get for some articles are totally unrelated. Weird.",
"Trust your readers.  Drop the spin.  Feed them objective news.   Often. Looking for news within  the biased  shitposts defeats the purpose.  NYT lack of discipline hss allowed bias to permeate it's content, severely weakening it.  Do you really want to compete with Drudge?",
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SO NOT DOWNLOAS THIS UTTER CRAP,
Bringing Jersey out here in the West. Yea Yea,
Really good app !,
Like it,
Crappie news,
"With them endorsing Hillary, the marine killer in Benghazi, I can't use this app with people so stupid to support someone taking donations from foreign countries, which in turn she'll be returning favors. Probably why she deleted all her encriminating emails. Didn't know they were classified? And you want her as president! Unbelievable! Watch Clinton Cash on Amazon video, YouTube, or other online service. Nevermind, poll showed 71% democrats would still vote for her even if convicted of felony charges over email! That's why I'm not Democrat anymore. Values have flipped on parties and people don't even realize it. True Christians don't  support same sex marriage and Clinton didn't either until she needed their votes. Needs to read the bible. Leviticus 20:13   Romans 1:27 Amazing how dumb people are now!",
At any free moment in a day I know I can open up the NY Times app and catch up on what's happening.,
"Im NYT subscriber. I log in with my email and password and after accepting it, it still keeps giving msg that 0 articles left this month. I have reinstalled and restarted device. No change. This is frustrating and i will cancel my subscription from next month. What a waste.",
I am asking God must let my dear fiance Byron to video call me immediately!,
Phenomenal!,
Content fairly well organized. Like the saving article feature.,
A news app,
"This is than just a news app, the articles include links to the information being cited by the journalist, and if a study is one of the author's resource materials there is a link to the study or, this is so cool, a pdf of the study will download and open in Adobe's Reader app automatically. This is one of the best news apps I've downloaded and the journalists are thorough, intelligent, and well informed. I would recommend this app to anyone who actually reads the news, not just the headlines..",
"Coming from places where press is regulated, I only truly appreciate the value of quality journalism after reading NYT for a while. It gives us a better picture and help us become better thinkers. Even though the context is often US, the lessons are similar. I hope its internationalization goes well, makes more money and creates even bigger impact. And by the way, the app works really well too.",
"Have been a loyal NYT app reader since it came out. Every year it gets better and better. The reporting is always, of course, top-notch, but the presentation of stories has immensely improved and today it's excellent, really pushing the medium. I love the new Top News section, which now covers more kinds of articles. They've also developed fun, creative, interactive ways to tell stories, many of which were featured during the Olympics.",
"When I went to unsubscribe from the digital service I was shocked to learn that in order to cancel you have to do so by phone.Their phone system is ridiculously frustrating and dated, but eventually I reached a customer service representative. When I told him I wanted to cancel he tried to talk me out of it before finally telling me my subscription would be canceled. Four days later I was charged *again* despite having apparently canceled. When I called customer support they refused to issue refund",
"I love the NYT. It is the high point of my day. There is such a wonderful range of subject matter and food for thought. And even though I am still furious with them for screwing over Bernie Sanders, I sill cannot live without them.",
"Latest update (or maybe my new phone - HTC One M7) seems to ignore the chosen ringtone/sound for breaking news alerts. Even though I've selected ""None"", my phone *rings* when there is a breaking news alert, so I've had to shut that off.",
"Augment the New York Times with the Economist and you are pretty well covered. For a more complete understanding of standard conservative political viewpoints in the US, add the Wall Street Journal. If you desire some European standard liberal perspective, add Le Monde. I would love to have great local Asian, and Middle Eastern perspectives and hit up Al Jazeera on occasion, but it's unsatisfying and very inconsistent. Good local African and South American? Major cause and effect of American and European ++",
"Can read offline and ariticles are up-to-date but in short of world news. And what i wanna stress is the deal is pretty cheapy compared to other newspaers written in english and avalable where i live (if i would subscribe TIMES of newspaper in japan, it costs over $50 ).  But the only thing to be changed is How to stop subscription. Currently,  we ithink cant stop it ,opening this app, unless we visit this page.  As a conclusion, I like this app so much! Keep ur great work! :D",
"I've been a New York Times reader for 50 years. Despite a high tech career, I clung to my morning paper until just a couple of months ago. The current version of the app improves the Times experience to the point where I no longer read the hard copy.",
"Up to the minute coverage of the truly significant events in our world.  Brilliant writing, vibrant images, curated by world class editorial staff and delivered in real time to the device in my pocket.  It can't get better than the NYTimes.",
"Love to sit around all morning and read but I barely have time for coffee. Times briefing covets nothing so much as accuracy, closely followed by depth.  Ones awareness is bolstered by seeing a footnotes correction from Buzzfeed to BuzzFeed! Also an excellent bulwark against the constant flow of bile , an island oasis in a sea of drivel.  In short - love it. ..",
"App is easy to use, sends alerts of breaking and daily news updates, and allows me to stay up to date on current news stories. The NYT reports and articles are top notch and this app allows me, a person who lives in the West, to get quick and easy access to the best newspaper in the country.",
"This is the most used app on my phone. I love it, really I can't live without it. Sadly, I'm not a huge fan of the Twilight option. Since it just dims the back light it's not really helpful. The previous version allowed for the black background and that really helped  with reading at night.",
"Would be 5 stars except that sometimes the comments don't work right on my phone, but this is the best way to get all your news in one place.",
"easily accessible, promptly available. superb journalism with thoughtful analysis and opinion. A great aid to understanding our crazy world.",
"Developers are constantly enhancing the app and fixing shortcomings. Good source of news, though slightly biased and some entertaining articles and puzzles.",
The app is easy to navigate and the articles are thoughtful and well written. This has become one of my primary sources of news.,
"I may never agree with the writers and that's okay, the gift is in finding new ideas every day to digest like a good meal for the intellect.",
"Fantastic app for keeping up to date. The only issue is ads. If I am a paid subscriber, I don't think i should have to see ads.",
"The app works well overall and rarely behaves oddly. Searches could improve a little, but overall the app is handy to have.",
I am using 5 news apps and the NYTimes app is cut above. I am always see what important and spend no time on TV.,
"The grey lady adopts to devices. The paper paper is still superior, but you can't beat the price for the app.",
"My digital NYT subscription brings me such joy! The immediate updates on breaking news, the editorials, thought-provoking in-depth articles - it has everything but the crossword.",
I check in on the NYT app when I wake up and when I finally get to sit after work. It is invaluable during this election cycle.,
Works very well on Android 6.01. Suggest it has a clock so one is aware of updates and know if one has the most recent news in front of them.,
"I'm on this app dozens of times a day.  Moving between articles is effortless compared to a couple of others,  CBC & BBC, that I use regularly.",
"I really appreciate the NYT Daily News Feed. As a high school English teacher, it allows me to access quickly and accurately what the top news stories are.",
I enjoy the breaking news as well as the access to the Times' in-depth articles and analysis,
"One of the greatest, if not the greatest, newspapers published - either in print or digitally.",
I play close attention to several news apps and use the Times the most. Plus the opinions are always interesting.,
The Times app on my phone lets me preview the paper wherever I am. And I can read full articles if I'm on my phone for a while.,
I'm a web and phone subscriber and have found this to be far and away the best way to get instant access to  national and international news.,
Quick and easy way to have my daily dose of news right at hand. Love it!,
"NYTimes gets it right. There's a great balance between local, regional, national, and international news. Great graphics, too.",
"The New York Times is my first source for news. They cover a wide variety of subjects with in-depth information. The app is reliable, quick, and full of the features I want.",
Delivers concise news etc in typical NYT format and style. Excellent for on the go info on headlines features etc,
Start my day with tea and the NY Times everyday. Monday thru Friday that means with the app. Love it! Also love the breaking news notifications throughout the day. If it's important. The Times app makes sure I know.,
Just got android version 6.0.1 on my tab 's and now the play store says can't install app with error code 504,
I use the app every day and haven't encountered any bugs or annoyances.,
"I love this app. I especially like the morning and evening briefs ""what you should know"", the California-specific news, and the mini crossword puzzles. I also like that this app adjusts the screen brightness to the best level for reading. Cool.",
Also endorsed Hillary... so I will get more detailed news elsewhere!   Biased to the max.,
Actual in depth reporting on complicated subjects with good app navigation.,
"Provides very detailed account of events covering on the ground news and multiple perspectives. You don't feel short changed. News is presented with honesty, integrity and courage.",
I read the newspaper on my phone now. The app is set up to be intuitive and easy to use.,
"I have used  this app daily for years and it has only gotten better with time. It is the first app I open in the morning. I like the features, and it's ease of use. Thanks NYT, keep up the good work!",
"This is my go to read because of its solid and trustworthy reporting on both national and international news. Plus, the Android app keeps getting better and more intuitive.",
"Clearly laid out, so easy to navigate - wish all other news sites were this well done!",
Just have to get in my mini puzzle first thing...then off to the news and opinions.,
"I love article summaries and the ability to slide through different sections of the paper. It makes it easy to get an overview of the news. It's fast, smooth to use, and the layout is very clear.",
"I never subscribed to the NY Time before, but I have enjoyed reading it on my GS5 using the app.",
The Times is irreplaceable and the app keeps the news well organized and makes staying up to date easy.,
"My main complaint about the app is that it lacks some functionality that should be obvious based on usage. Example: making it easy to return to the top of a section page. Also, if I have the app on my phone, why don't NYT stories posted on Facebook open in the app?",
Always a good read at my fingertips.  Easy to navigate.   Headlines in a hurry and everything when I have time,
"I prefer to read NY Times with the mobile app, rather than a computer browser.",
I read it multiple times a day. The articles are well-written and interesting.,
"I am a moderate who likes to read articles from both sides but the Times is just too far left, I can't take it any more.",
"And the best coverage. Too nany ads, but we learn to live with that",
A well-integrated and customized portal to the newspaper's many articles and features.,
"I check in for quick updates, and read the entire Sunday paper on this app.",
I start my day w a hot cup of joe and my Times! I'm also a high school English teacher and I use many articles as a writing prompt for my juniors and seniors here in the west Texas Borderlands,
"It works all the time. Literally, have the world at my fingertips.",
I love that the app doesn't get in the way of the news. Just works. Thank you!,
The Times is one of the world's great newspapers. This app puts that in your pocket every day.,
Much easier to navigate and read than the website and mobile website on a small screen.,
The published paper with breaking news and commentary.,

"What's not to love about holding the New York Times in your hand every day? Each morning I awaken to the most important stories in every category, plus I get to do a mini puzzle! Love love love it!",
My go to app for indept new analysis.,
I'm not even American or in America.  Why on earth is it compulsory for me to have this? Why can't I completely remove it?,
Can't imagine being without it anymore,
"JouJournalismrnalism that focuses on delving deep into issues, investigating them and providing various great platforms to deliver. While the Times has been a great paper for decades - this app is awesome because it combines the in-depth information and analysis, with with a myriad of interactive charts, designs, pictures and videos that let's you explore what you care about, and get exposed to new things.",
"First thing I do in the morning is open the Daily Briefing. A gathering of the highlights of the past day, editorials, new articles, and a mini crossword puzzle. With subscription, the app gives you access to the full website and every article in NYT. I receive up to the minute news when something major happens. The app never fails, easy to use. I love it and, living in the south, I love having digital access to the New York Times, especially at my fingertips and anywhere.",
"The app downloads the tops stories for the morning and evening, so it's easy to scroll through the day's news without lags. I'm much better informed since I switched to the NYT for my news, and much more relaxed than when I got the news from FB click-bait. This app is one of just a few which has literally changed my life for the better",
"This app presents exactly the same experience as the Web version of the NYT,  streamlined and mobile-formatted. If you subscribe to the Times you get everything here the same as you get on the Web: same stories,  same videos,  same interactive graphics,  etc. Great integration with the mobile way of doing things,  responsive and easy to navigate. Among online newspaper apps,  this is as good as it gets. Extremely stable and glitch-free. This is the gold standard.",
"The NYT app provides consistent and simple access to the paper's excellent content. However, it doesn't hold a candle to the website. Without more costumization options (both in terms of content selection and display) this app is simply a ""better than most"" dedicated newsreader.",
"There used to be a reverse font (white text on a black background ) that was great for nighttime reading. .. and it was especially useful for my aging eyes.  I wish that was still available instead of the low contrast dimmer in the ap.  And, I can't figure out how to find the sports standings.",
"I am reviewing the app not the paper or the subscription price. App is fine but has glitches, with some graphics popping up when scrolling, that later settle down in the correct place. I don't mind the ads, nyt has to make a profit, but they seem inordinately large. Scrolling is smooth. I'd rate it about as good as the FTs app.",
"I'll read the 10 free articles this app affords me each month, because I've always loved the New York Times. But I think the revenue they generate from ads should be enough to render it unnecessary for me to pay 10 bucks a month for more than that.",
"I love this app, especially the daily briefings, which summarize the news without counting toward the (non-subscriber) readers' monthly limit on articles.  Non-subscribers do need to be careful not to click inadvertantly on other articles that come up in notifications, though, as they do count once opened.",
"Compared to the Boston Globe's horrible app, the nytimes app (I read both daily) is a dream. The times keeps the content steadily updated, cleans up after itself, is faster by orders of magnitude, and is yet to freeze, crash or otherwise misbehave. This Bostonian says ""good job NY""",
"No crossword puzzle  To the NYTimes respondee: I don't care if it's in development. Not only has the update to the Android app been in development for several months now and is still not out, but it was not written anywhere on the Crosswords subscription page that there was no Android client, which is absolutely shameful. I'm going to leave this 1 star here for the world to see until the update comes out.  Also: I want black-and-white background/text as an option alongside screen dimming.",
"Just awful. You'd think that something named after this city would be careful with space. For some reason the company abandoned an efficient, compact display with five or six headlines. The new layout often fits just two headlines on the screen at a time, accompanied by an intolerable amount of unused white glare. Result: you scroll a lot more than you read. The app works fine on a tablet (and that's where the money is) but it's a miserable experience for the masses who use a smartphone.",
"Admittedly, I get a subscription through school, otherwise I wouldn't have it. Still I love this app and it keeps me updated so that I know what ""Aleppo"" is. Daily mini crosswords are tons of fun. I also like the daily digests as they make it easy to stay up on things.",
"This is one of my favorite apps of all time--I will be very sad when my free year of all-digital access ends in a few months.  The NYT is my window on the world, and to be able to click on an icon and have all that information at my fingertips is such a joy.",
"It works as all news reader apps should.  The return bar shows up when you scroll up, you can zoom on the photos, the crossword is an excellent little app inside the main app, it is well organised, etc.  The one thing is that the captions are a smaller font than the main font and barely legible for me.",
I like the way the news timeline is chronicled and the Op Ed is filled with great articles. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because of the limited news read per month and why we have to pay for it. It's 2016 mates! No one pays for news no more!,
"I love the times, one reason I love it is because it gives you timely notifications for breaking news. This app used to allow one to choose the notification tone, now it just vibrates, I hate that, please go back to the old system, more choice is always better.",
"I did not normally read the New York Times until I started using this app. It makes it easy to have something to read when I have spare time. I now use a Nexus 6 so the screen is bid enough to use a fairly large font. I previously used an iPhone 4 and I  used a small font, but it was hard to read for more than a few minutes at a time.",
"I've previously used this app on Windows Phone which had limited ads. The Android version works even better but is made less readable with the inclusion of many more ads peppered throughout the content. This is true even for those who subscribe. It rankles to think that even though I pay for full access, I continue to have to wade through numerous ads. I wish the Times offered an ad-free subscription option for this app. That would push this app from a 4-star rating to a 5-star one for me.",
"Started reading the Times for a High School civics class, have gone from a paper subscription, then Laptop, now I finally have a mobile app, for all my devices, @$10.00/month, much better than what the Times itself offers. This isn't Drudge or Gawker, it's credibility and a balanced world view.",
"Of all the news apps on my phone, this is the best. I have customized the app to see the sections I want to read first, I have access to the entire paper, I can save, clip, share, and socialize all content. I can read the reader comments (often entertaining, enloghtening, infuriating). PS: my phone is an old Samsung 4.",
"While the app came pre-installed on my tablet, I was very satisifed with Customer Sevice helping effectively turn it off. I can't say I read the NYT often, but the responsiveness and helpfulness of the app team, I must say app itself is good.",
"The NYT app keeps me informed and manages to organize the information so it is easily accessible, from the headlines to the most obscure article.",
"This app is almost invisible, like the power supply. I barely notice it, just ""read the paper"" that shows up in my phone every morning.",
This app makes reading the NYT on your phone very simple and straightforward. I find I am able to better navigate the editorial on the app vs. the website.,
I have a paid subscription to NYT but it says I ran out of articles for the month. Keeps prompting me to log in but doesn't recognize my account as a paid subscriber.,
My #1 source of news and info on wide ranging topics from politics to running to literature. Simply world class.,
The times brings the current world view into my hand. Varied and informative topics that have meaning and depth. Highly recommend.,
"The NY Times app provides an incredible breadth of information. Occasionally humorous, frequently deadly serious, often instructional articles and podcasts that bring the world to your phone.",
I noticed that all of the best stories came from the Times. It was time for me to contribute to the process instead of being a leech.,
Although their videos do get hung up in buffering occasionally.,
"It installs well, rarely has any issues and gives me the nitty gritty on what is happening in the US on a daily basis.  Plus I'm addicted to the mini crossword.",
The NYTimes app keeps the world at my fingertips. The mini crossword puzzle is a nice bonus. Good for staying on top of the news.,
"I love that I can start my day with a quick review of the headlines.  My only complaint is not of the app itself, but of the Times over reporting of Trump.",
As an ex-patriot American I depend on it to keep up to date with what's going on over there.,
It's time we started supporting journalist si they don't have to turn to special interests to support themselves. NYT has my vote.,
This app is really nice to use and straightforward. Everything loads really fast. You are not bothered by pop-ups.,
I am an avid NY Times reader. This app makes it easy to access anytime and anywhere. I am always up to date     with news events.,
"Well researched, trustworthy, hard-hitting news in the palm of your hand.  The best of the best if you really want to know.",
"Best news ap. I already love the paper, so that's part of it  but the ap is the best I've seen",
First thing in the morning. Last thing before I sleep. And many times during the day.,
Love the synopses sent on what's happening each day and what to know on the political front for the day as well.  It keeps me well informed on the go.  Thanks!,
I pay for a subscription but it still says I reached my free article limit even though I'm logged in. The message keeps appearing no matter how many times I login.,
Very reliable platform for news reading. Easy to move between articles. Love the mini crossword. Be nice if the subscription model allowed cross platform use though.,
"The app tells me I am logged in, but when I tap on a headline it switches to the request to log in again. Can't get stories. Frustrating.",
"Love the way it provides headlines and a brief high light of each to allow us to get excellent oversight of day's news in a two minute scroll.  Of course,  the mini crossword is an addiction.",
Great content.  Supports comments and offline reading.  This app can be installed to run from your external SD card.,
"The app is great - I like the daily briefing in particular. In general it is easy to find what I'm looking for, and wonderful to have the entire NY Times with me everywhere I go. But when you get right down to it, what I really love is the content - thoughtful, comprehensive, and essential to an engaged citizen of the 21st century Planet Earth",
"I am not the most informed person in the world,but the Times helps.",
"I'm very happy to pay for NYT access. They consistently produce a wealth of quality journalism, and I love that I never have to worry about the paywall to follow a link. Speaking of links, I love that deep linking from apps like Twitter works so well, because the native in-app reading experience is far superior to the web.",
I love NYT. Read it daily. Been paying for print for many years for my parents to read. I read the app. Like Krugman. Videos.  Science and Technology. I grew up with Times and will likely die with it. :-),
Need to correct biased reporting to save yourself... uninstall,
"I think the Times coverage is great. It bravely picks an angle to cover each story, without becoming a opinion without facts coverage like some organizations. The BBC is good too, but too neutral for my liking.",
If Trump's candidacy teaches us nothing else it shows us the value of a free press that has the will and ability to question the actions and statements of our leaders. Support the NYT and support democracy,
Very easy to use and I've had no issues with freezing or crashing.,
The NYT app has undergone significant improvements since I first used it years ago. Easy to use and navigate.,
I've used this app for over a year now and I love it every time. It's never died on me and gives me the news I'm interested in.,
So easy to stay on top of what's happening with quality journalism.  The NYT ap is an outstanding example of the transition from print to digital media.  I won't be without it.,
The NYT app makes me feel part of one continuous conversation about the most important world events.,
It is so intuitive and seamless that I forget that it is an app. It's just the best reporting on earth delivered to my phone constantly.,
Read it everyday & love the quick puzzle to get my brain going 1st thing in the AM.,
"I'm not investing in a paper that employs and tolerates articles from neo nazis, defending sexual assault or political saboteurs.   You're the NYT not the daily stormer.",
"I really like the app, it let's me keep up with what's going on in the world in real time.",
I've been reading the Times since I was a kid. This app makes it very easy to keep up with the news daily.,
I just retired and I travel alot. This app is my companion . I can read the latest news anywhere.,
"One of the best news apps out there, not to mention some of the best news as well. It has little bugs sometimes, but they are infrequent and I use the app a ton. Everyone should have this app",
Can't make it thru my day without the knowledge and information the NYTimes provides.,
"The NYT app helps me keep track of everything going on: in the elections, other states, in tech, in movies. And internationally. I can't imagine life without it.",
"I read the NYT all the time on the bus, but when it notified me of Earthquakes in Central Italy, I was able to find out that a friend over there was alright.",
"There is no better news app. Arrives promptly, reports and delivers timely updates to active national and international events, covers books, arts, fashion, sports - - you name it. And it's a breeze to navigate.",
An App  is only as good as it's content. This app works great and the articles are world class. Eady to post on Facebook.,
Good content. One minor glitch. Text selecting stops working when ads show up or change in between news list.,
Excellent journalism delivered with a worthy app.  They've even started covering the West Coast! 😏,
"The perfect news app, loaded up with fascinating and newsworthy content. A steal at any price.",
"Though we also subscribe to the NYT paper, I love this app for its convenience, especially for checking in on the news first thing in the morning and before bed. Comprehensive, good layout, never has glitches.",
"A digital subscription is cheap and you will never run out of articles to read. In addition, access to the various blogs, podcasts, and the daily crossword make this app one of the best around!",
"I installed the NY Times app over 5 yrs ago. It just keeps getting better. I get more content than ever, and the interface and graphics are first rate. It's the best app I have.",
The app is easy to use and is the first thing I read in the morning. I also like the updates during the day.,
This is just a sad organisation that dispises  Trump with a passion like none other. Every second story is Trump and its just a discusting mess of hateful stories toward a loving man. #failingnewyorktimes,
"Great way to get the latest world news.  It's an executive summary,  succinct yet highly informative.",
I have used this app for many years.  It formats so well on my Android that sometimes I take screenshots of the page because of some photo or arrangement that catches my eye.,
Love the app. It works perfect. Have never had a problem. Easy access to see what is going on in the world,
I love the way NY Times present daily news.  Easy to navigate and use.  Content are relevant and interesting.,
The NYT app makes it easy to stay in tune with current events.  Excellent tool!,
Easy to use one handed when on the subway.  I always have it with me and check the news morning and evening.,
An indispensable news source and great app. Love that stories load so they're available when my train enters the downtown tunnel in SF and I lose my cell connection!,
"This app gives me access to the NYT, both current and archived content, and even the reader comments. It's stable and easy to navigate. Much better than the apps from other publications that I have tried.",
Easy to use and to browse thru. Updates frequent. Also appreciate international news.,
"I love the NY Times app. It is well laid out, the content is always relevant, and, for me, just the right amount of detail. Pictures and videos highlight the text, so if I don't have the time to read, I still get the message.",
I look forward to catching up at the start and end of each day - the mini crossword is a self indulgent part of the day!,
I love how most of the articles are available when you are in offline or airplane mode. Helpful when you flying. Also love the puzzles.,
I really appreciate the ease of finding and reading the articles that interest me. And the NYT reporting is top-notch.,
"Great articles, short news/documentary films, and an awesome crossword puzzle every day.",
"Easy to navigate, but I will be happy when the US election is over and the deluge of related articles stops.",
"I read the NYT, so of course I use this app. However, it's also a stable app that always seems to work. Bravo",
The leading newspaper in America has the leading app. It is such a reassuring pleasure to take the NY Times app all over the world. The brief introduction of the story is always interesting and informative. I never leave home without the NY Times.,
The app is very well laid out and easy to navigate. I love that I can read the NYC when I have a few minutes to spare. Over time I have come to prefer this to the print version.,
"To use this you need to subscribe to the Times, and fall into a customer service nightmare.  If you need to make changes, it's almost impossible to get a response.  Took me seven contacts and three days to cancel.",
but the devs have done a fine job implementing material design guidelines. Nice work.,
Excellent app.....makes it easy to read a wealth of articles covered a multitude of subjects,
"Only thing(s) I can hold against it are how you often can't go back to the story you were on before inadvertently clicking a notification, and how limited -- nonexistent? -- the archive is.",
"This App is comprehensive, easy to use, and brings excellent information from the New York Times quickly.",
"Orderly, both swipe able and scrollable. Fine curation of what's important now.",

It's my connection to the world and what's going on in it. This and email are the two most used apps on my phone.,
Awesome app. The place I go to for world news and incisive opinion pieces.,
Love getting the hradlines and access to articles. Never had any app trouble on my Samsung Galaxy Note 5.,
A very good way to read the USA's best newspaper.,
"The app itself is easy to use, ell organized and you can read well curated comments.  If you enjoy reading the NYT, this is a particularly easy way to access on your phone, a tablet or laptop.",
The mobile version is perfect for the morning catch up over breakfast. I read more in depth later.,
"Best news app today. Clean, easy to use desigh, high quality writing and excellent photography and graphics.",
"The app is great and the interactive features fun. As for researched reporting, there is no other. The internet is a giant cesspool of worthless garbage that the NYT inoculates me against.",
"I use this app more than any other on my phone. It is SO well worth the monthly subscription cost. The NYT is the nation's most respected news source for a reason. The writing and editing are consistently excellent. I can always find something interesting to read there. The Cooking section is a fantastic recipe engine, full of reader comments and suggestions. Something unique to the app: The daily mini crosswords, which, unlike the real NYT crosswords, are easy enough for mere mortals.",
We travel a lot and it is great to have the news I trust with me....and the crossword puzzle is  fun.,
This app is indispensable for my morning and when news is breaking.  I subscribe to the print for Sunday edition.,
Best quality of news and opinion.  Provides broad spectrum of coverage with intelligent and balanced reports.,

This app has helped me stay in touch on my terms.,
"Works well including strong multimedia stability.  Nicely organized,  and notifications work well.",

"No news source is objective, but this one is way over the top. Shameless.",
The latest version is USELESS!  Does nothing but crash. This has been going on for a couple of weeks.,
Something has changed. This used to be a very reliable and functional app. Was there a recent update? App now crashes CONSTANTLY.,
"This is essentially the most Pro-hillary news source you can find, outside of maybe Salon or Gawker or literal clickbait. I'm not even that conservative but I value having objective media. This isn't it. Even worse is that you lay for a subscription and still see ads. It crashes all the time too. Simply a bad app. Avoid!",
"The NYT app is well-designed: Easy to use, very stable and well-behaved, thoughtfully organized and attractively styled. I've subscribed to the free daily headlines email for many years but found that videos linked there would not play on my phone (Android), so I installed this app. Problem solved, and there many other benefits over the headlines email as well. My main news source... I don't care for most TV news.",
"The reporting, writing and opining in the Times is consistently best in the world. And I appreciate how they keep experimenting with digital technology to tell stories well. Please keep pushing the boundaries, Times women and men. I don't have to forgive your mistakes before the disasterous 2003 war in Iraq to say that, today, I am glad to subscribe to your online service.",
"Originally installed because i was looking for objective news. Now, in its current state, it's more like a random north korean propoganda advertisement. Sorry NYtimes, but i really liked you better before.",
"I have a paid subscription, I should not be seeing advertising. Also, inability to switch off vibration on notification is an irritant.",
"Reliable news the old fashioned way. Easy to read. Love the daily digest for morning and evening. Notifies me of breaking news, which can be annoying when PEOTUS IS GOING OFF THE WALL.",
Balanced and interesting reporting and IMO the best US based news site. Wish they would add back TTS function.,
"This app is easy to navigate, stories are compelling, alerts keep me informed. Can't live without it.",
Can't post a comment from the app. I had to delete it to post a comment on line from my phone The browser kept opening in the app and I kept getting an error message. It's midway through 2016. Fix the damned thing,
"I'm logged in, fully subscribed through the New York office. STOP ACTING AS IF I'M NOT SUBSCRIBED.",
"NYT app makes the paper redundant. Easy to use and clear interface, good use of photos.  Always up to date.",
Received an obituary piece as a push notification in spite of the fact that I turned off all notifications in the settings.,
Wish you could set notifications to only show up for breaking news. I don't need my phone to buzz for an editor's pick. Other than that a good app.,
I am an international subscriber of an an old package  (NYTIMES + tablet) so I can't use this app. I emailed NYT customer care to change my subscription to support android apps - no answer. I am stopping my subscription to NYT now. Avoid.,
Constantly asks me to log in. Every few hours!  I've used the app and have been a paying subscriber for years.  A total pain you have to log in for every other story! Fix this!,
I love getting reliable national and international news as I get going in the morning. NYT has it all.,
Edited news for the ones bringing us down...,
At inexplicable intervals I have to log in to read EVERY article. Extremely irritating.  Update.. NYT support fixed this... for a time. Now I can't log in at all.,
Your starting to understand facebook,
Easy to use and read ..,
Excellent articles from best paper in the USA.,
Not worth a free trial..losers,
"Sharing seems to be fixed, thanks for the info; will send feedback this way from now on.",
Have no title,
I need a find option in this app where i can search for words.,
I love new york,
I love to read tyms,
Why pay for information that should be free to the public?,
BS,
Great daily news,
"Says the version I have is expired. Won't let me read news. I download the latest, same deal. Very frustrating for a paid subscriber!",
"The daily crossword puzzle is the only feature worth a look. The NYT is not a news outlet. It is a collection of biased articles with a common thread: anti-conservative, anti-Christian, anti-Republican, anti-traditional marriage. The NYT consistently insults the intelligence of its readers by parading its hate-filled opinions as fact. Despicable.",
Best source of news around. Totally worth subscribing for unlimited views. Save articles seems to be having issues on Android lately...,
"It's my favorite,  great, true info n useful 4 me,  my family as well friend with best personal regards from James.",
"can not copy and paste comments, like in desktop version. I need this feature, as some comments are so well expressed that I want to share. Please make this happen, please!",
"Very good, I use the app daily and am very happy with how it works.",
"For me, as an international oriented person, a good news source",
Very easy to use. Super clear layout.,
Non based @ to the point.,
Has been my references all this while. Thank you.,
The app seems to be running in the background and drains the battery in under an hour. Please fix.,
Paid subscription and ads,
Read it every day,
Garbage,
Good app,
"I preface this by saying I'm a liberal, but one who is willing to view the other side's argument and take it into account. This publication has become little more than a mouthpiece for Hillary that has nothing but vitriolic, hateful speech for conservative viewpoints and individuals - with no legitimate factual basis for the claims made. I am disappointed but not surprised that NY Times has fallen victim to the absolute polarization of all media.",
"For both my LG G3 and Samsung NOOK the app seems to be stable and works and updates properly. My one complaint is that a proper dark mode (white text with black background) seems to be unavailable in favor of the lacking ""Twilight Mode"" which still gives my eyes too much strain, especially at night.",
"07/16: The NYT app has really fallen off due in large part to piss poor customer service. The subscription offer states one thing but the reality has been something different. Phone calls to inquire devolved into pass the buck conversations. Emails have gone unacknowledged. This used to be my favorite app but I can get news elsewhere. Old 11/15 Review:I love this app because it brings the world to my fingertips. Great variety of topics, writers and breaking news.",
"I loved this app and was a subscriber for a long time but recently the regressive left bias is just too much for me to stomach. Your supposed to be unbiased as journalists, do you job properly.",
"I am considered centrist on the political spectrum, however the NYT is constantly trying to push a liberal viewpoint. Uninstalling this worthless ad filled app and cancelling my subscription.",
Forced to have app by service provider. Drainsthe battery. Spams me with notifications. Cant delete or disable.,
"Works the way it's supposed to do, I suppose. Content wise I've always been a big fan of the Opinions section.",
"I already pay for digital access, but if I want to use the app, it'll cost more than double every month. NONSENSE!",
"Is there any particular reason invisible audio ads randomly begin to play while I'm browsing for articles? I'm on a newspaper app, not a torrenting website. I don't pay monthly to be disturbed with audio (though print ads are fine). EDIT: I have not heard ads play in a long time since the app was updated after their response to my review. This app is now a very pleasant experience.",
My first choice for traditional international news reading. I would have paid for a digital subscription if it was affordable for me here in Asia,
"This app seems strictly worse than using a browser since it has no tabs and shows ads, even for subscribers.",
Love apps that are easier but will use this one in the meantime.,
Loads easily to give access to probably the best designed and written site for news on the web.,
Excellent app for a great newspaper source.,
The best of news and excellent features.,
I read it every day,
The best news network on the planet,
Use it every day,

"Keeps saying download latest, but I have the latest version!",
"Been a digital and hd subscriber fir years.  digital account is linked, and have had no difficulty reading/accessing the NYT via browser on phone/tablet/pc without difficulty.   download this ap, log in, get the 10 article countdown.  get to zero, given the option to log in even though theap says im logged in.  log in again, via email.  still cant get past iit, same with logging in via fb.   ck digital faq... confiirm my hd and digital are linked.  still no trouble via brower on the same tablet.   Right.  Uninstall, back to reading via chrome.",
"When the app works it has a nice interface and reads very easily, but is very buggy.    I use the app mostly through a home screen widget which crashes constantly, only occasionally reloading properly.   Then when accessing an article from  the widget the app will claim that article as unavailable,  regardless if I am on wifi.   ####update#####                                   working really well for some time. Widget reliability much improved.",
"I disagree with most of the complaints. I love the new layout, it looks much better than the old version. I do wish there still was a night mode, and I wish there was a light colored widget to blend in with the color scheme of android lollipop. The white on black widget is ugly on a UI that now mostly uses light colors. Could you add a light option?",
"I can't uninstall this app, it came preinstalled on my Samsung NotePro. I am from the UK so for most users outside the US, the New York Times would be too USA focused, although I am moving to New York in the near future so I can see its positives. But as a news app it is irritating and virtually useless. Half the time articles don't even load, giving an error. Then when you do find more than 10 articles in a month that are actually relevant and interest you, opening any additional articles gives you the message that you have reached your max of 10 free articles this month and must pay $10 a month to access more! 10 free articles per MONTH, not week! For around 30 days you can only access 10 free articles! But you still get notifications from the app pointing you to articles you can't read! If I could remove this app and prevent it wasting my time and space on my device, I certainly would!",
"This is the worst piece of garbage that is nothing but bloat.  Oh you want to use it? Subscription only, I get free news of much better quality through my local news paper but Samsung decided to put this rubbish on my tablet because.... well.... why?",
"The content within the newspaper is entirely gre focused.For those who want to get innured to reading comprehension section of gre,reading certain excerpts from nyt will surely have a salutary effect in terms of comprehension and also in terms of reading speed",
"Basically a browser, with updating widget. Pretty stable now.",
Great app to pass on their propaganda if your a retard son of a retard please install,
"Very happy to find that I can now launch the NYT app from browser links. This makes my daily march through Today's Paper, which can only be accessed through the website, MUCH more pleasurable.",
As someone who values in depth reporting there is no one better than the New York Times,
A mediocre App for a substandard 'rag' .... pressing 'Uninstall' ...... now.,
Biased Journalism on Asian countries,
Best news source,
Nytimes,
Perfectly... Amazing GEORGE WASHIGHTON,
"Edit: so bummed that the radio-function was removed for no apparent reason. It could read back articles to you. But not anymore. - - - Original: I'm very happy to pay for my subscription. Quality news is something to be cherished in a democracy. Love the 'radio' function where articles are being read out loud. Only thing I miss, is more of a 'front page feel'. It's hard sometimes to get a feel for what's todays top news and what's more of a 'nice to know' kind of article.",
"Why do these companies make us have these apps that are useless crap. NY Times, you should be ashamed of yourselves for forcing us to have this rubbish",
"The NY Times used to be great over the past five years, but now it freezes all the time, even on my new Moto Droid phone.",

;),
"The app doesn't allow me to turn off notifications. I deselect them in the notification settings but the next time I look, breaking news is still selected. To me this is the most infuriating thing in an app, if I could give zero stars for it I would. If there is no correction to this I will be uninstalling.",
"One of the best news outlets in the world! (The New Yorker, The Economist, FT, and maybe The Guardian are the others that I count) though each got its own issues. Only hope (and worry) is that the quality will be sustained, because there are  no shortcuts, good reporting takes what it takes - quality people,  time and effort (and you can see through it otherwise, as with many other newsmongers), and in the face of today's world of instant gratification and quick results, sustaining high quality is tough.",
"The design of this app looks very nice, but it doesn't allow me to select text after I scroll down a ways into the article. When I can select, I can only select one paragraph. I can select any text in the iOS version.",
"America is such an important country. The NYT provides the clearest and most intelligent analysis. If it's annoying Fox fans, then it must be doing something right.",
"Cannot turn off notifications, even though turned off in settings, Others have same experience. Galaxy s7",
Pice of totally useless bloatware that you can't get rid of.,
Can't shut off the notifications.  Very annoying.  Fix this.,

I continue to get notifications -- at 4am! -- even after turning off all notifications.,
"""Be the first to know..."" etc. But no choice to stop receiving notifications.",
Good,

"I'll have to lower my initial rating due to basic bugs.  There are times when the application won't respond, or refuses to open an article.  For the most part, it works, but it is surprisingly fragile, especially early in the morning when it looks like it's stuck loading the next day's news.",
"Enjoy the nytimes, but the app has been continuously crashing - most recently on my s6 edge while trying to read 'Trump and the Judge'. I get to the middle, & it vanishes, & I get 'unfortunately nytimes has stopped' message. Maybe Trump is hacking them - insidious.",
"Please fix your app, I can't read a thing with how frequently it crashes",
"Something like disabled comments on all articles and ""news"" stories where facts have been replaced with opinion are two things I would expect from NYT but no access at all to the Archive? It's the only thing of any real value by NYT",
Crashes all the time. I have a brand new note 5,
"Saw your ad on Facebook with food on a table and there is no bagel in the ad! Are you guys tired of the whole thing? You may ask why, because bagel is love, bagel is life.",
"NYT is the best mix of news, analysis, and other content.",
I rate this app 3 stars because of the ads! Why would NY Times put ads in a paid subscription????? Terrible! Absolutely unnecessary! Get rid of the ads!,
Fantastic work. Beautiful design. Stable and speedy.,
"Cool, an app just for fake news",
Love it,
"As a student trying to study in the states, i wanted a daily magazine to know the present condition of the country. And this is my best experience through this app. It's handy obviously as well as has a good way to express news. Developers just keep doing great works.",
Kool application,
Very good.,
Extremely bias news is no longer welcome in this world. After months of absolute garbage articles I had to uninstall. I can't believe the number of falsities and misinformation published in this previously great paper. It is now obvious trash. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.,
"I cannot get past the article limit for non-subscribers. I sign in, receive notice I am logged in, & still cannot get past the article limit notice. Please FIX THIS!  ... Initially written on 5/13/16, still on May 30, 2016, I cannot get past the article limit for non-subscribers. Do you not care that your subscribers cannot access what you publish? F-I-X. T-H-I-S. !!!  I will be accessing my subscription via the web until you correct this. Your app is worthless to me.",
"Articles do not open upon click half the time.  Reported issue, but tech support says no one else is experiencing the issue despite many other recent reviews that mention the exact same issue.  Seems like a good app otherwise.",
"Delivers the news just fine, but I had to turn off all the notifications. Even when I only requested ""breaking news"" I was still awakened in the middle of the night with notifications of human interest articles & other fluff pieces.",
"Links often don't work or don't take you to the article being described. No immersive reading, the top navigation bar is always in place and the general navigation leaves a lot to be desired.",
Bloatware. The New York Times is irrelevant in my country and the constant notifications irritate. How I wish I could get rid of this unwanted app,
This is an app I have used on android platforms since it was introduced. It always worked well and dependably. I refer to it many times everyday. I just upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S7 and I am finding the app to be buggy and erratic. Articles simply don't open. This happens randomly and frequently. Sometime the article above the one I want to read in the headlines list will open and I can then advance to the next article in that mode.  I hope this is corrected quickly.,
"Great app, but one of the recent updates dropped copy/paste functionality in articles, usually in the lower portions of the article. It will often work above an embedded ad, but long press does nothing below the ad.",
Crashes or hangs on all my devices on a fairly regular basis though.,
"Stories frequently do not load despite repeated clicks, and won't until the app is killed and restarted.",
"The past few weeks, many article titles aren't able to be opened. Shutting down and relaunching works but not always. Buggy.",
Easy to use. I like the NYT. Well written.,
Latest app update doesn't work on android 5.1. Only see a blank white screen.,
"The program tends to crash. Constant errors occur. Articles do not load consistently. Comments are sensored, planted, and prevent feedback through erros and instantaneous closures of allotted time for comments. The articles have recently decreased in quality and quanity. More opinion pieces are treated as real news.                           Do not subscribe or use. It is not even worth being payed to read.",
"I have used this app for over a year, but today, no more. It used 4gb of background data in one morning, all while I had background data set to wifi only in the app. Thanks NY Times, you cost me $40.",
"Mi vida , Te Estoy esperando besitos!!! Te amo .Gracias mi vida Por acompañarte en la graduation de Chris , la estamos pasando lindo en la ciudad besitos y gracias pir todos Los Dias y las noches juntos de verdad que me ha Es el hombre mas Feliz Del mundo mi amor besos . Te amo !!!!!",
"App works pretty good, but uninstalling due to unreliable news coverage !!",
My only issue with the app is that it sometimes does not refresh.,
Can't open some articles without restarting the app... 5 stars if this is fixed. ...Love my Times. I don't know what I'd do on the train without it.,
"Occasionally Unresponsive, but Worth It",
Great app that keeps getting better,
McDonald's don't deserve our money although they have dam good 🍟!!!,
This is seriously behind the times. In 2016 you want me to pay for headlines and coverage after 10 articles? Get a life.... I'll read this for free on Google or the Washington post.... uninstalling.....,
"Asked for subscription to see more news. It was uninstalled 5 seconds later, 10 seconds ago.",
Very informative.   Happy to have this app.,
Awesome app,
Is all foreign.,
New LG Tablet,
"It works, but in all the wrong ways.  I'm updating my review as I've been a long time (years) user of this app, and have seen it change over time.  Back when I last left a review -- circa 2009 - it barely worked on Android because they were bending over backwards to serve the iPhone craze, before Android became popular.   Fastforward to 2016:  it works.  Hooray!  But, and here's my biggest beef:  In every article I read, there is an embedded advertisement, flashing and moving (not static), and CLICKABLE.  So, when I scroll down in ANY article, I often hit one of these ads, and then get brought out of the app.  I worry that since NYT changed management they've gotten greedy, and their goal is to get their subscribers to 'accidentally' click on their ads to generate revenue.  If so, shame on them.",
"As a subscriber, I'd appreciate having a 'Today's Paper' tab. The website has it and the Washington Post even ""delivers"" the morning paper with a notification through there app. I want the whole paper, not just what other people think is interesting.",
"This app is annoying and useless to someone who doesn't want news. You cannot uninstall it, and it fills your notifications  with random news updates.",
"It gets BIG. Billed at 10 megs, it installed at 33. And grew to 133.",
"Much better, more affordable payment model. But signing in simply doesn't work - so sick of getting an error message.",
There is nothing diagnostic or sweet. It is like any other news paper viewer,
Biased liberal crap. Obviously unable to tell both sides of the story,
To bad it's only 10 articles per month,
Expensive to read articles. I couldn't pay that amount,
Make it a paid app.,
Great app find out about my home town,
Can't live without it!,
Good app!,
Well covered.,
Love the app...,
The best of the best,
Delete,
I refuse to read nyt because this app is forced on me. Taking up space on my phone and no way to get rid of it.,
"Difficult to share to other networks, bookmarking ability is lame. Should have option to read more articles by viewing ads or something. Signing in / connecting Google account should give a bonus of additional reads/month.",
Love this app. All the info I need. Breaking news alerts only when it's really news.,
"I have a NYTimes digital subscriber for over 6 years, and the app is always improving.",
I pay for access and for physical paper. Why then do I also have to stare at several ads per article? Bad idea. Free = ads. Paid subscription should NOT have ads everywhere!,
"The ""new"" version was released prematurely, but problems like the loss of search have gradually been fixed.  Works fine now.",
"Paid subscription has ads.  There is no way to customize sections in the app, even there is a screenshot showing it.  The website mentions ""Have your articles read aloud with text to speech"" - no such option is available.",
Links to other NY Times articles goes to Web browser which is limited to 10/mo.,
I always liked NEW York Times but can't subscribe no credit card,
Why would I pay for what i can see on the website for free. No.,
Works well. Don't like seeing ads when I'm paying for the service.,
Indispensable.,
good,
"Very easy to use UI and updates are pushed very frequently. Morning ""here's what you need to know"" articles are my favorite and I am glad there are always mobile data interactive articles available. Would recommend!",
Reading the Times via the app while drinking my coffee has become my morning routine.  Great intuitive app.,
"STOP INSTALLING ON MY PHONE, THIS APP IS UNWANTED",
Hyperlinks don't work in this app. Extremely disappointing to see such basic functionality broken.,
We have 3 subscriptions in our household. It is the best written up to date and balanced reporting that there is.,
Nicely organized highlights and in-depth articles... and the mini crossword puzzle is a daily joy.,
"Since I live in an area where The Times is not delivered,  this app keeps me up to date and well informed. Wish it didn’t freeze or crash as much.",
"For anyone who wants real reporting, not just headlines, but can't find the time to read the entire nyt daily, this is the perfect compromise.",
"This is hands down the prettiest and easy to use news app in the store. I am hoping that eventually they will introduce the crossword to the app (not just the mini) because I hold that subscription too. Worth the price, trust me!",
This app behaves very well and is dense with data and content as it should be. Good stuff.,
"In morning briefing, can't open the links referenced in the articles. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still doesn't work. Please fix!!",
One of the clearly best designed and most useful apps I have ever used. Always awesome.,
"The NY Times is an excellent news source.   One of the best,  if not THE absolute best!",
But need more than 10 or at least abit more article preview for free version,
Wish I could remove this liberal nonsense from my device,
This app is easy to use and is very dependable. A great way to access the NYT.  I use it constantly.,
does not work application  suddenly stopped,
Love my free subscription. Thank You Google Maps. For being a local guide #5 ..,
"Still get the paper NY Times, but read most of it on my phone. Love the way it's set up, highly recommended.",
Don't know what people are complaining about.,
Love having this great paper with me always. Easy to navigate and use. Well worth the price of a subscription.,
Well functioning app for mobile delivery and interaction.,
I look forward to the daily read.,
Love having The Times in a pocket wherever I am and whenever I need a news fix!,
What a news app should function like,
This is how I get my news! Love the app.,
Great value for the best source on current events,
"Easy to use, looks great, and cheap for students",
My Bible of daily affairs. Consistently excellent news and analysis.,
Easy intuitive  navigation make this a great app.,
Good app but horrible liberal bias,
Great source for news. The best,
Daily news source,
It won't link to my subscription,
Do not want,
Good,
Response immediate.,
"Love it. Only drawback is lack of cut and paste abilities within articles, instead of having to share the whole thing. Plus trouble with commenting to an article and letters to the editor. When these get solved or incorporated, they would not only make it more user-friendly but, more importantly, interactive. Please let me know when the change is a-coming.",
"The NY Times is an excellent newspaper and this app is the best way to read it electronically. I read through the news summary every morning, read a few of the  articles   and then check it periodically during the day. The mini crossword gives the little gray cells a pleasant wake up call. Recommended for everyone who wants to remain informed.",
"Used to work, but now displays only a blank screen with NYT banner at the top upon startup.  Attempting to login elicits a (spurious) message that device is offline. We have a paper delivery subscription and can use this mobile app on other devices. A conversation with Tech Support only confirmed the impression that they are clueless about such a problem.",
"Quality journalism (in fact any quality products) are hard to replace, especially when we don't have enough time or resources and want to get the most out of everything we read or purchase. The app is well-designed and easy to use. The charts,  slideshows and videos are nicely integrated into the app. The only complaint I have with the app is that the ads are kind of annoyingly situated in between paragraphs of the articles. But it's the same way how articles are displayed online and I can get used to it.",
"My life would be empty and meaningless without the NYT app for android. The white background and black font give me a reason to get out of bed, each day. Seeing a NYT notification pop up is better than receiving a romantic text from my imaginary girlfriend.",
"I use this app everyday, the NYT is the best way to stay on topic. But the ads are obnoxious. Please make them static rather than floating around the articles. It's enough to make me close the app sometimes. Also the links often take me out of the app to some weird browser. What a strange UX. Edit: The links don't seem to work at all.",
"Nice format, has just enough free use to get away with not paying. Worth the subscription though, support the printed news. It's the last press that gives us the details and content we need, like candidates actual platforms and plans if they win their offices, international affairs, and some good news...",
"NYT makes good use of graphics, video, text. I think everything in the print version is in the app, but it does take some searching. My criticism is, like many apps, it's too ""busy"" and crowded. Touch points are to close together for the typical phone screen. Text is (at least at default) small. The sections of the print version are maintained, which means trying to touch small text in drop downs or headers often.",
"Since becoming well-informed, thanks to this wonderful app, I am apparently more interesting to talk to and people enjoy my company more.  My self-esteem has improved immeasurably and I've given my therapist a pink (Freudian) slip.  Also, I'm much wittier.",
"The app has become my primary news source and I truly enjoy it and the opinions section. Two things wrong: no comics section and I cannot reset choices of sections I get. Still, I would never give it up.",
"The new app is extremely easy to use. Everything is smooth and quick. Great work!  One request: Somehow have our daily feed customized based on what we read. For example, the first thing I do is the mini crossword before reading stories. It'd be nice not to have to hunt for it.",
"This is a very well done app, nicely organized. I enjoy the daily briefings and do the crossword puzzle every day. It's never once crashed or been unable to update... It seems very solid and reliable, just as news on your front door step used to be.",
"The only non-social media I never get bored & tired of. Thank you for providing me well written news articles! Someday when I get my money right, I'll spend them on a lifetime digital subscription of The New York Times (it's on my bucketlist).",
"Having only 10 articles a month to read, l choose those articles very carefully.  However, when l am scanning my finger can lightly touch an article that l have no interest in reading thus reducing the number of articles l can read.  I am so careful, yet this keeps happening. Please do something about this. Helen C",
"I work for The New York Times. Some reporters risk their lives in war zones, others toil to make our democracy and little bit better and still others find stories that are just quirky and fun. It is the world's greatest news organization, full of people who find great tales and investigations that make the world just a little bit better. If that isn't worthy of support, what is?",
"Best news application I have used.  Really appreciate the links to related stories, some many years old, that give context to the articles.  Writing is of a consistently high level, and the writing is fact checked.  None better and worth every penny.",
"Terrific content, scope and presentation, riddled with all the biases,  distortions, and omissions typical of corporate-controlled media. Kind of makes me sick.",
Same results on different android devices. No comparison with cnn's interface which zips along. Either a flawed design or underpowered servers.,
"It's truly impressive just how natural it feels to read the NYT in this app. Long stories read well, interactives work, and it's lovely to happen across stories with the swipe of a finger.",
"Thanks to this app,  I keep much closer tabs on what is going on around me. The daily summaries make it easy to find the most important events. Less rage,  more knowledge & understanding.",
"No complaints about the writing and the app works OK but shocked that a 20USD sub only gets the app on one device. When I switch from tablet to phone I'm asked to pay an extra 15USD for the privilege, seems very out of touch with user behaviours.",
"As an independent, it's astonishing that the New York Times can not offer two different view from both sides of the political spectrum. No wonder people are leaving American news networks for al Jazeera and bbc. Please provide articles and opinions from both parties? The only reason I'm give this app 3 stars is because of the app. That's it. Not so much the columns and opinions",
"I like this app pretty well but it sure isn't like getting the paper. This Sunday morning the most recent op-eds and Magazine articles are dated 2 days ago. I get more info from my Facebook feed, actually, but I'm hooked on the mini puzzle,  lol",
I'm so glad I installed this app. When I'm having my morning coffee I look over the days top stories without having to open my tablet or start up my computer. And the alerts for breaking stories have been very helpful as well.,
"The native in app articles are great but sometimes web only articles, like recipes,  rendered in app  get wonky.",
Pointlessly large article boxes and a Top Stories page that hasn't updated in well over a week. Pathetic.,
"Very easy to read, well structured access to news and all sections of the paper and the various editions. My goto source for news nowadays.",
"A good, quick read in the a.m. to get the day started. It hits the major stories and fills in overnight gaps.",
I use this app several times a day. I get the latest news plus interesting stories. It's my go- to news source.,
"This is where I get 90% of my news - NYT is superior in general and the app is very intuitive and easy to use, and it's great having articles downloaded if I don't have internet access. However recently it's been crashing all the time with no obvious trigger, which can make it very difficult to use. Also, the ""breaking news"" push notifications can be useful and informative, but too often they're for news analysis and special reports that could easily have waited until I next opened the app.",
"The NYTimes app is a great choice for those wishing to anchor or supplement their news coverage. The app is well thought out, and I especially like the daily summary of notable news items.",
Love the NYTIMES and the app is great. I can move around quickly to my favorite sections or start reading from the home page. The interactive features work great. And I love the ease of sharing.,
"Would you rather live in a world of celebrity driven ignorance, or a world of well informed self righteousness?  Not an easy call. I recommend spending the few dollars a month and reading the NYT.  You can get old versions of Time magazine from the dentist.",
"Love the mini cross word and great for picking out a few articles to read. Some minor limitations but this is not the website on your computer, it's an app on a small screen that updates well.",
The app's daily briefing tells me what I need to know to be informed about the world on that day.  I like receiving notifications about big news on my phone. The app rarely has glitches. It's become an integral part of my day.,
I enter my credentials but it still tells me I've read the amount of stories for free.,
Works well but from time to time posts reminders that I only have a few more free articles to read for the month.  This message is confusing as I am logged into my NY Times acct through the app.,
Love the fact that the articles are easily accessible on the app. The video content is also very good. I remember prior versions that weren't nearly as good.,
"Just as timely and accurate as the paper.  Just remember to turn it off when done, unless you travel with a spare battery.",
Works - easy to read many parts of the paper.  Good mix of other media.  Do not miss all the print ads but not happy seeing more banner ads entering articles.,
"I grew up reading the NYT, and I never knew how much I missed it until I got the app.  It is so much easier to review headlines and catch up on articles on my phone because it is always with me.  Newspapers are not.",
My favourite read but I quickly run out of the free article limit. Would rate it 5 star if there was unlimited free access.,
Maybe the most difficult thing to achieve for a newspaper is to port the handheld experience of a printed paper to the small screen. NYT put it together and has made my daily news fix a reason to whip out my phone several times a day.,
"I check every day, first thing. Great way to stay up with the latest news. I love the mini puzzle too.",
"Responsive, easy to navigate & loaded with content. By the way most of the low reviews were positive, just no stars were given.",
One would have to actually be brain dead to pay senior slim (flaco en la cabesa) to print this parrot cage lining.  Is this the wake of cnn and nyt all rolled up to collect doggy turds ?  Be ashamed... be very ashamed.,
The app makes more of the Times easily accessible. I like the daily summary that allows quick look at depth stories. Great,
I use this app several times a day to get in depth news but also to play the mini crossword. I also enjoy the wide array of well written articles on topics of interest such as books or cooking.,
The photography and interactive graphics that support the reporting are excellent!  The one feature I sorely miss with the app upgrade was the ability to listen to the news stories as opposed always having to read them.  If this feature was still available I would give the app 5 stars.,
"Love this app, check it multiple times a day, the 'breaking news alert"" is one of my favorite features, best source for news, get this app, well worth it!",
This app nicely designed and easy to use. I appreciate how easy it is to share a link to article to friends who may not have an NY Times subscription.,
"After opening the NY Times app, a link in an article will work the first time I click on it but subsciquent attempts don't. This happens in the daily briefing and in articles.  I've uninstall ed and reinstalled and it doesn't fix it.",
"Downloads stories on wifi so perfect if you go somewhere with spotty data. Fantastic ui, easy to use, and very clean",
"I was born in New York and still have family there.  The New Yorkers' love of literature and theater was one of the biggest attractions to The New York Times.  As a retired journalist, reading Times reporting and commentary is a pleasure; the written word expressing human opinion and perception.  This is one of the newspapers I read daily,  and find it hard to imagine life without The New York Times.",
"Love this app. It is easy to navigate and never freezes.  I especially enjoy the mini crossword puzzle, which I have come to think of as gentle morning stretches for my brain.",
Used to not load articles but this has improved. Otherwise works very well.,
"Came already installed on my device, but I cannot get rid of it.",
Simply stopped working altogether after the latest update.   Which has more or less ruined my life; I'm a veteran NYT reader.,
Links don't always work in the app and it says I have no internet connection.,
"Why pay for a subscription, when there are many sites that are just as good, if not better.",
"The app automatically downloads the news for offline use for you, so even if you're on a plane, you can catch up on the world.",
"I didn't know how much I missed the in depth reporting of a real newspaper.  Internet ""newspapers"" I've grown accustomed to just hit the high spots.  This is a real treat.",
"Super impressed with this app overall. I wish it would cache the crossword clues when it fetches all the headlines, but otherwise no issues. I'm on Note 3 and a NYC subscriber.",
This app causes my battery to drain at an alarming rate. Please fix the power consumption problem with this app.,
But I pay for subscription. So should not see pop up ads,
"Five years ago this was a terrible app, now it's been overhauled and is probably one of if not the best news app.",
A media source with a long history of respectable and responsible journalism.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is their recent bias against Senator Sanders.  I hope it is just an anomaly,
"Clean layout, easy to navigate, & I enjoy getting the breaking news notifications.",
"My print subscription synchs this w/ several other devices, can bookmark articles, search & access all sections, vide run well- invaluable.",
"It's the content i like most. The best investigative news reporting anywhere. Thorough and compelling. Would like to have more content customization options, but no real complaints here.",
Always great.,
I would love a color scheme with a completely black background and white text for early-morning reading on Amoled displays,
"I am doing the free trial but it keeps telling me that I have zero articles left for the month! It tells me to sign in, by I am! At this rate I won't be getting a subscription, that's for sure.:-(",
"I love The Times, and this app has never gotten in the way of my daily reading. Thanks!",
I read the NYT before getting out of bed. All the news at your fingertips. Love the MINI puzzle.,
Very convenient and easy to keep up with breaking news and popular topics on my smartphone.  Mini-crossword is fun.,
This app allows me to keep up with the latest stories in the New York Times wherever I am.,
"Offline reading is back, but can't reorder sections to my liking",
"NY Times has really spent thought and time into making this app look great and function as it should. I open it and I feel like I'm getting the content in the same way as if I were actually reading the news paper, which is fantastic. I can read glimpses of stories I don't care much about and dive down into the stories for which I do care. The font chosen and the words per line chosen make it easy and enjoyable to read. Fantastic work, NY Times.",
"The Times is a great news source and this app works well. It needs a better search feature. The Morning Briefings often have recipes in them, but trying to find them that same evening is a laborious task.",
"Always well written, generally conforms to my bias, often entertaining.",
Appreciate & always love the NYT and now in digital form. Still love reading the paper as first choice.,
"This is the first place I go every morning. Catch up on the news from an NY perspective, then do the mini-crossword to keep my brain limber. I save or share articles with my students and feel empowered and aware of the world and my connection to it.",
"The app works fine. My only problem with it is that saving an article does not save the pictures in the article, it saves just the text. Please make an option to enable saving the articles with pictures.",
"Easy to navigate, consistent experience and loads quickly via Wi-Fi or cellular network.",
Easiest way to get reliable updates on world news. I also am addicted to the daily mini crossword. Highly recommended.,
was currently reading or watching in some other outlet.,
"Before this app I didn't really read the news. Now I have a quick, easy way to learn what is happening in the world.",
"The app is good, the content is even better. The Times has the best graphics of just about any news source, something that has always drawn me in, and they've successfully adapted those graphics to small format.",
Love the NYT app. I thoroughly enjoy reading the Times and learning so much about not just the world but also the universe.,
Easy to use app keeps me up on what's happening in the world.,
Hands down the most in-depth source for news analysis long form reporting arts coverage and lifestyle tips including cooking and fashion,
"I like the notifications. For some things (like the archived mini-crossword), I have to go to the web page.",
Love getting real time news when it happens. NYT is most informative and not just repeating news you find every place else but fresh subjects and global interests.,
"Can't live without it. Even if you can't afford a subscription to the Times online , getting the headlines and news alerts keeps you in the loop of world news. If you have a scrip, then it's the gateway to easy navigation.",
I'd love a feed style prioritization based on past read stories. Other than that A-OK. Also like the daily minicrossword. Would live the Sunday xword digitally.,
"It's great app easy to use. But problem is only 10 articles you can access in one month, otherwise you have to pay month basic !!",
"The features works as they supposed to: swiping across articles, interactive graphical features, videos, etc.",
"if you like the paper, this is the best way to read it..  easy to navigate and all the great content.",
Love this app!   I can catch up on the news (and David Brooks) on the go and it's extremely easy to use.,
Staying current is so easy with this app. It's format is great; I recommend it for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date with the world.,
"I adore the NYT app. It's as easy to use as their regular online version. I particularly like the morning briefing, a curated synopsis of events. Plus you're greeted with a ""good morning"" and a mini crossward puzzle which is almost as good as a coffee and croissant. Good morning to you too NYT.",
"Very easy to navigate, links always work, ads easily scrolled past.  Pleasant visual format.",
NY Times right at my fingertips. Easy to navigate... an excellent way to follow the news from the wild north coast of Maine.,
"The NYT app has come such a long way in a few years. Nice design, great reading experience, and (needless to say) great content.",
"The app is a great way to navigate The Times, it's really intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. But by far the best feature is that once you'be refreshed the app, you can see most stories even without wifi or mobile reception!",
Good to hear the price is discounted $5 per month especially for students with good marketing would increase subscription,
NYTIMES is my favorite and most frequent source of news and articles of interest. I use it multiple times a day.,
I love that all the content gets downloaded periodically and I can read whichever article even while offline... Looking for an option to be able to reorder the sequence of Sections. Proud subscriber of digital access for many years...,
This is the best news app that I use. As a New Yorker I particularly like the way it allows you to select sections for caching to enable reading on the subway.,
"Handles content better than any other app. Easy to use, read, etc. It's  my goto app for all things New York times .",
"It's easy to find everything I'm looking for, and if I'm short on time, I can save longer articles to read later.",
"This is my favorite news app.  The articles are well organized and you can catch up on the headlines quickly.  It also has in-depth stories that read well, even on smart phones.  Site is clean and uncluttered.",
"Love the app. Works very well on multiple Android devices. I have one criticism- the app is missing Recommendations, which is a feature I use heavily on the NYT website.",
"The content is excellent, the layout and ease of access extremely intuitive and especially the font makes it extremely easy and comfortable to read big articles on a tiny phone screen.",
"Various information related to politics,literature. Motivation is good.I download many articles from NY times.Each article has great value.(India )",
"I've been reading with this app for years, and I'll still be reading on it until they beam the news straight into my head.  Great app!",
"I love this app, and am glad I subscribed to the NYT, but I could do with an  'extra' extra large font for those lazy mornings when I can't find my glasses.",
"When you are board with the adolescent charm of buzzfeed, and infuriated by the idiocracy of the Huffington Post get this app and watch your brain develop before your very eyes.",
"First class, easy to read and the morning & evening briefs cut right to the most important and most interesting articles.",
I've read the Times for years. Always ahead of the rest. The one to turn to for the latest and most informative information.,
Still the Newspaper of record. The app loses nothing of the Times uniqueness,
Only thing is you used to be able to change background to black and have white text. Very useful feature for night reading. But can't do that anymore. Lame.,
"The most comprehensive news app available. As with the print NYT,  there's much more than news, with reviews, science stories and in-depth articles looking at our world.  I love the mini -crossword puzzle! It's easy to use and updated regularly. Earned the 5 stars!",
"The Times app is a simple, essential window on the world. I use it everyday and love it.",
"Excellent design, easy to navigate and extremely stable. Probably among the best news apps out there.",
I spend more time using this app than any other on my phone. And then on Sunday the beautiful thick paper is delivered to my home. All for one low price. Who could ask for more?,
"Well designed: easy navigation, appealing smart connection among topics and stories, convenient intuitive access through triple layers ...should make easier access to The Sunday Magazine...worth the price - thanks!",
"We know already that the Times is THE source for broad ranging coverage of world and U.S. news from politics to fashion (wait, are those the same?). Having it on your mobile device makes waiting for anything time better spent.",
I don't know what else a picket sized version of a newspaper needs. I love it.,
Who needs a big bulky newspaper when I can read its best content in the palm of my hand?  This app is absolutely ideal.,
Top News list regularly shows items from weeks back,
"Much improved, easy quick downloads for reading on the train. Easier to get all of the content.",
It's well condensed and enlightening. Sections are very well organized. Great archive. NYTimes is the best news journal in the world.,
The app is easy to navigate and the article presentation is nicely done.   The quick 5 minute crosswords are a plus.,
"I only have one complaint,  there is no search feature.",
The NYT app is becoming the template that other news apps should follow.,
Easy to use on all devices & great response time. Nice to use offline. Good articles & Paul Krugman.,
Works consistently and without trouble. Brings news alerts and good journalism to my phone.,
"Again, thanks.",
"My favorite news app (and source for news). Extremely informative, and well written. I recommend it to anyone interested in keeping abreast of current events throughout the United States, and the world. :)",
"The best newspaper in the US, hands down.",
"Great in-depth coverage, opinion pieces and daily word game.",
Makes it fun and easy to keep up with national and world events and issues.,
I use the NY Times app daily. It has a clean and simple interface and is easy to navigate.,
"Easy to use,  great content. NY Times is the best paper by far.",
"If you enjoy an app that constantly resets itself, this is the one for you!",
I'm a relocated New Yorker so having the Times at my fingertips is great.,
"Definitely among the best news apps, in terms of navigation and user-friendly UI.",
First app I open in the morning and the only news I refer to throughout the day. NYT is the paper of record.,
If all the apps and tech products I had were this dependable it would be wonderful.,
"Stories before their out in print, brilliant writing, well organized and beautiful photos",
"When I get up in the morning, the daily ""What You Need to Know..."" is where I turn first. Then the oh-so-clever mini-crossword. It makes the subscription cost worthwhile.",
THIS IS A TIME TO GET TOGETHER AND SHEARING OUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND PREYED ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND LET'S GET TOGETHER AND WE CAN WIN I WILL TRY TO COMFER ALL THOSE WONDERFUL PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE LOST NO RESON AT ALL LEVELS IF THEY TRY TO STOP THE NETWORKS I HAVE AL CONFIDENCE TO RETRATER MY VONLINTEERS AND SEEQENCES THIS I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE TRUST ME I KNOW NO ONE CAN TRACE IT'S NOT EVEN THE GOVERNMENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ANYWHERE YOU CANNOT GO ON SAYING THAT YOU ARE THE ONE WHO BRAKE,
"Very professionally done, we'll organized with easily accessible content and directional features.",
"Information about the world at your fingertips. The entire archive available,  and puzzles too.",
I enjoy the daily mini puzzle and the web version with the additional puzzles,
Love the app and having such great reporting accessible everywhere I go.,
NYT App gives an excellent overview of the latest news & happenings of the day. Easy-to-use & well presented.,
Won't accept my subscription which uses a Yahoo email address. Insists I use gmail. I need 2 subscriptions - one for my phone and another for my tablet?,
Content is great and it is very easy to use.  Enjoy doing the mini crosswords most days.,
"Great app for top news from around the world... with a New York bent. Hard to use to find stories buried deeper in the ""paper"". Videos don't always play well (Lollipop).",
"Easy to use, easy to navigate",
"Top News 12 days old for my subscription version? Really? How can anyone be satisfied with an app that serves mostly old news?   ------    Continues not to update on tablet. Subscription only works on computer, really not what we signed up for.   :((",
"The NY Times is the best paper for news, opinions and it is has wonderful special articles",
News feed of daily articles.  Loads quickly. Easily access full article. Free w /paper subscription.,
I love the background information the articles provide! I enjoy the mini puzzles! The videos are unique! The recipes are amazing!  The best resource in the world for information and viewpoints.,
"Get the subscription, get the app, put the widget on your phone, I love the paper and it's been well worth it to me!",
"if you are into fake news, then this is for you; otherwise, avoid it.",
Great app. Love the front page and the crossword!,

Not as bias as most other papers and good investigating,

Great content and get to cheaply support quality journalism in a digital age,
Miss the ability to invert colors to white text on black background.,
I appreciate when an app does what it says it will do and it does what I think it should do,

"I get all my news from the NYT app. I subscribe to the Sunday edition, but I hardly ever open it because I get it all from the app.",
Good,
Essential,
A-,
Works well.,
Read it every day,
NYT,
Conversation Starters is a nice feature. I can find previoisly overlooked articles.  One minor annoyance: links don't always work.,
"I've put off upgrading the app for about a year because I like the text to speech function and I read that it had gone.  I don't know why I upgraded now, but I wish I hadn't.  The images do come out better, but that is the only improvement. The text when reading an article is too densely packed, no matter what the text size.  Conversely, when I'm scrolling through headlines, every headline takes up most of my 5.5 inch screen. Someone forgot reading (and listening to) the articles is the pont. Too many ads!",
"Gr8 articles, usually, even tho I often disagree politically/philosophically. I can comment via laptop/desktop & virtually always get published, but almost never using app when signed in2 same account. I've written app team 2x & now talked 2 customer service 2x. They say you (app team) handle tech issues, not them. I think part of problem is, comment interface via app doesn't auto-populate w/my personal info as does interface via PC. It's as if my identity is not being recognized as it is on PC. Fix please!",
Excellent source of news from around the world. So many thoughtful and interesting articles not usually covered by other papers.,
"Unparalleled in its content, beautiful in style, but no longer gives access to  more than a few saved articles. That major drawback means I'm not getting my money's worth. I'm disappointed in what is otherwise my favorite app.",
"I have had a devil of a time making the New York Times Android app ""know"" that I have a paid subscription, and that I should not be limited to 10 articles a month.  It is still not successfully connected to my New York Times web account.",
"I have a subscription and no matter how many times I sign in, I can't read articles or do crosswords. Basically I can't use this at all.",
"I use this app daily and try to refresh it mostly on WiFi. Somehow I end up using nearly 1GB every month. It might be the updates or the refresh rate, but my WSJ app gives the the same updates and uses one tenth of the data.",
Hate it keep trying to uninstall but keeps coming backnow i cannot even get the uninstall button.,
I read in the night. White text on a black background would be really easy on the eyes. And I'm afraid the twilight mode just doesn't cut it for me. Invert colours is a must have feature for apps that require reading from its users. Would be much appreciated.,
I love reading The Times on my phone and am now addicted to the mini crossword puzzle. Perfect while taking the bus to  work.,
"Concise, useful, topical, current, intelligent. I can't say all those things about any other single news source.",
"I love this app. Most essential one I have, and accessed the most.",
This is a well designed app that helps the user see top news easily and conveniently from a respected paper. I like the simple design and quick functionality.,
"I live the app and the layout. But but on my new SGS7 phone, the app dims the screen brightness and effectively disables both the manual and automatic screen brightness.",
"The quality of the NYt journalism is hardly up to debate. The app is fantastic to use, fast, fluid and relevant.",
I got a new phone and every time I try to login it always say login failed.,
it's annoying that I can't load puzzle. also can't find blogs. or rearrange my sections,
Unnecessary bloat ware force fed by Samsung,
"6 articles per month!? Even if I just read the headline, it gets counted as an article I read for my monthly 6. I'll just look for the story from another source. Uninstall! Fail.",
"The world's top news source, always, and a well-designed app.",
Blank screen after update app,
The presentation of the news including election statistics is great,
Clear and concise stories of the world. Well done !,
"Use this every day, throughout the day.",

"Great way to get to the news you want, though every once in a while the reader is broken by their ad delivery. Very frustrating when you're interested in an article but can't scroll down from the top for more than 0.2sec because some banner ad keeps forcing their viewer back to the top. No way to read beyond that 1st screen. (Galaxy Note Pro 12.2) Now imagine you're paying for that content. At least it doesn't always happen, just some of their ads.",
"03/03/2016: Bloatware which, WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, already has access to my Device & App History, Identity, Photos/Media/Files, and Wi-Fi Connection.  It also has permission to make In-App purchases.  I would NEVER install this or grant it access.  Samsung included it as part of their crapware, and it's been sitting there on my tablet, doing God-knows-what for God-knows-how-long.  This is why I no longer trust Samsung.  As soon as Google makes a decent 10"" Nexus tablet, it's Good Bye Sammy!",
"I wish, and so do lots of others, that canceling was easier! You might retain more if you made it easier!",
Yep another cheap app that fails on my device. All because app makers push lolly puke and puke on my device.,
"It has obviously become too dependent on its financial sources, too obidient to its political masters, and has gradually turned into just another weapon of mass deception. They do not even try to hide their bias. This is the exact opposite of what good journalism is all about.",
"In many of their articles about President Obama the writers refer to him as ""Mr Obama"". In my opinion, this disrespects the man and the title.",
"I was a subscriber for a while. The app makes you login often.  With better free options I can't justify it.  Reporting has also gone down the road of a kids temper tantrum on the play ground. We get it, you hate Trump.",
"I love the app and the articles. But there is simply too many options for free news these days to justify $9 per month. Maybe that isn't a lot to some folks, but it is to me.",
"The phone heats up in seconds after opening the app, might be running code unnecessarily. Please optimize",
"Great app and excellent content, but videos never play well (on android at least) despite good cell coverage. Always seem to have buffering issues. Fix for an extra star!",
$9.99/mo for all digital is very reasonable and worth it. The app is really nice and rock solid.,
This version still lacks txt to  speech feature. Also the reverse color scheme was removed. This increased the battery drain and eye strain created by use of this app. Twilight mode is useless. Why were useful features stripped from this app?,
I wish the web version of the paper with front page news etc was the same as it is on the app. I want to feel like I'm reading a paper not a bunch of random articles that are broken down into categories.,
"I suggest a ""lite"" $4 tier that would give users their morning briefing and headline articles every day...or 3 full articles a day...or just a larger number of monthly articles...whatever, just something in between for users that really like it but find the full subscription price to be too steep.",
"Really nice app. Used to use Google news, but this beat it for me.",
Latest version crashes after a few seconds.  Useless.,
I am fed up of trying to u install this app. Please fix it.,
The only news app that I rely on and they suddenly decide to permit you to read only 10  articles per month. Completely disappointed in the NYTimes,
"Rating updated 2/27/16. With all of the latest updates, the App is now working well. Thank you for the reply to my previous post - and for the well done app.",
ny times is good at misleading with selected fact,
Waste of time. Unecessary app that you cannot remove,
When I hit a NYTimes link in other app I expect to have an option to open it in the app. Standard in other news apps. Please fix.,
Great way to get all the news in a quick easy format,
"I love this app, always work.",
"Don't want it, but Sa~sung does not let you delete!",
Great journalism. Easy to use app.,
When did a respectable (the best?)  journal turn into shady bought out gossip? 3.9? Embarrassed much?,
i like your perspective...thnx,
It's just unneeded bloatware.,
Bloatware,
Excellent,
NY times AAA,
I like it,
NYT is one of the best news resource on the planet.,
"There is no journalism anymore. Most of the time the top ""news"" stories are opinion. I want to hear the TRUTH, not what abunch of liberals want me to believe. I guess its what is expected when its housed in a liberal state, meaning liberal writers, meaning liberal OPINIONS not news. Seriously what happened to the idea of reporting and exposing the truth. I still like to read the stories and get some chuckles about how dumb people can really be in this world.",
"The app keeps telling me I've read all my free articles for the month I should log in, though I never logged out. Then when I do log in it tells me I've read all my free articles for the month.  Please fix this. Galaxy tab a.",
Like the app but not subscribing all other papers that are online you don't pay for at all so why this one. Sounds like another thing where everyone wants money what happened to the days where things were free.,
"5 stars, I still buy the printed version partly out of habit, I guess, but partly to insure access to my favorite opinion writers.",
"Although the NYT is heavily skewed towards iOS (no full crosswords or NYT Now on Android), the app they do offer for Android is fairly solid. Well laid out, responsive, and reliable.",
"I see there's a new price that is half the subscription price charged to my credit card every month.  How does treating new users better than long time subscribers make sense?  Also, I still run into the 10 article barrier when I go to articles directly from the daily ""Top Stories"" email.  Not good.  Unsubscribe at the end of this payment period.",
I don't want to be pestered by this but I can't get rid of it. Kindly get them off my back.,
I love this app and use it several times a day. I love that it automatically downloads articles so I can use on the train. Well designed.,
"For you news junkies,  this should be your first stop.",
I was wondering how you can publish something as bad as it...,
"I don't know what's wrong with it these days that I am not able to access the articles on it! When I want to read the whole story about a news, suddenly a message appears on the screen: "" you have 0 articles left this month..."". Though I've signed in the app, I cann't read news free.",
Would be 4 stars but ads even for paid subscribers.,
Try to remove it from my tablet and it won't let me.  Uninstall updates and turn off notifications and they turn them selves on. Also lets it set own permissions.,
Never asked for it on my computer,
For shame.,
"Easy to use, navigation is clean and the app delivers.",
"Clean,  easy to use design",
Better than most yet still biased,
I don't need it.,
Much much better now,
Useless,
Great,
Tested and reliable.,
"Great interface, newest version causes strobing like experience.",
"The mobile website is better at a lot, and the app is better at the rest. Makes it tough to decide which to use. Also, notifications for daily summary worked great on my Nexus5, but broke on my upgrade to Nexus6P (same Android version)",
Since last changes having subscription it's telling me that I have 0 free articles. Sing in doesn't help at all. Tell your development team to test whole application before release new version not only latest changes.,
"As others mention, paying for content that am unable to access. Hours wasted attempting to cancel or receive access.",
"By far the best newspaper in North America, and well worth subscribing to. However, the app is very frustrating due to the intrusive banner ads.  It's actually better to read the site on a browser with an ad-blocker.",
"It's a real shame that I'm paying for the service, and am still bombarded by intrusive ads that distract from the content. I'm super disappointed. Please consider removing the ads for subscribers to improve the quality of user experience.",
"This app isn't worth it, especially when the daily news brief stops and you forget you even have the app...",
"This is by far my favorite app. For those who want unbiased and informed news (minus the editorials which are necessarily biased), this is the perfect addition to your app collection. Can't recommend enough.",
"I love this app,  I  use it  many times a day. The breaking news alerts are informative and keeps me up to date with what's going on.  The UI works well. I  have no trouble navigating the site.   I would recommend this app.",
"Well designed, one improvement would be to have a button that downloads all current stories manually if you are going in a plane, etc.",
New York times reporter Judith Miller n her lies helped the bush regime sell the illegal invasion of Iraq to Americans. Yet this paper parades itself as the voice of America. I only downloaded this app because of the free 8 weeks. I will uninstall it afterwards.,
"This was originally included on my Samsung Galaxy Note tablet, downloaded to my current mobile phone, Xperia™ Z Ultra. Because of article limit, I rarely use. Refuse to subscribe again, as subscription is extremely expensive, and to cancel is a nightmare.",
"Tap the print icon in a recipe, nothing happens. Samsung Galaxy S6, Android 5.1.1.",
This app is the best way to stay in tune with the world and local news. Be less ignorant!,
"The NYT really has a wide definition for ""breaking news"". I got a breaking news notification for an opinions article on the merits of virtual reality. Hey NYT, this just in... you've been uninstalled.",

"I consider the smartphone app of The NY Times to be excellent, however the ads bother me a lot (especially the pop ups). I am a paying customer, the least you could do is give me the option to opt out of receiving ads if I want to. The space in a smartphone screen is precious and that is where I mainly read the Times. This is an important issue for me and one I will ponder when the time comes to renew my subscription again.",
"This app used to be fine, but the last 2 months it constantly freezes and I have to opt out, ten reopen, and hope it works the next time. Very frustrating.",
"Gives me new information as it occurs, I rarely have time to check what's going on so when something big is happening the app lets me know.",
Annoyance: Special reports are NOT breaking news and notifications should not be used to disturb users for something that is not the definition of breaking news.,
It really helps stay me updated on current events. Have yet to find a real problem with it.,
With the new download I am now getting crashes and can not open certain articles such as the special report on navy seals and the editorial today on guns.  I have a MI phone.  I updated again and same problem,
It is simply the best news app around.  All other news apps should just copy this app.,
Great app. Love receiving the breaking news!,
Just what want and need from the best news organization in the US today.,
"seriously, who came up with this number?! 😃 uninstalling immediately, it's not worth the space for one day per month",
I don't pay for liberal media bias.,

Ads disguised as linked content? Not what I expect as a subscriber who still sees plenty of overt ads.,
Excellent if it had built-in dictionary.,

"I am a print subscriber and use both my phone and computer for the Times. On my computer I can save recipes to my recipe box, but not on the app. Also,  the recipe title in an article is not a link, so I would have to save the whole article. Could you make recipes a separate link, provide an option to save to the recipe box, and provide access to the recipe box on the phone app. The separate link and option to save to the recipe box existed on prior versions.",
"After a phone switch, I successfully logged into my subscription only to continue getting notification that I had hit my 10 article limit for the month. Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice and restarted my samsung galaxy 6 phone to no avail. Frustrated.",
"Samsung and Google just love to mandate certain applications on your android device. Only way to get rid of them is to Root your device. I don't like doing this but alas that's what i have done to have control. If i dont want your app, let me delete it!!!!! (Without rooting of course)",
The NYT stepped up and fixed a tech issue/customer service issue I had. The response seemed extremely sincere. I love the spread of articles and am glad to had the issues resolved. I will continue being an avid reader. Thanks NYT!,
"**Edit: I have uninstalled the app per below advice, reinstalled, and hope that will solve the problem.  Thanks. I love reading the NYT as a digital subscriber, but this is the buggiest app I have EVER used. Frequently when reading an article, I will be kicked back to the home page without warning or action on my part. This can happen multiple times before I am able to read an entire article. It's as though the content is trying to refresh, but nothing visibly changes when I re open the article. In addition, the app often crashes without warning. I have used the ""report issue"" feature numerous times. Fix this nyt!",
"Updated: 11/30/2015.   I love the content and this is what i am paying for but my subscription isnt cheap. On my NVIDIA Sheild tablet; the photos for the articles are not appearing when offline. So i don't get the full effect when traveling. I use the option to cache pictures etc , the articles only are appearing. This is very disheartening.  Moto X 2014: There used to be an option where you could schedule when to download the day's issue. This no longer exists. There used to be an option where you could invert the color scheme, black background with white text. This no longer exists. In addition, the app uses up background data cellular data at a tremendous pace - i see no indication updates are limited to WIFI only as indicated via the apps settings. The application is constantly on the top 5 apps using my battery due to modem use! Please fix these issues.",
"Pretty boring even when it decides to load, then sometimes it but ts in even if you haven't requested it to do so.",
"On stock S3, just installed NYT, have restarted phone twice. When I tap the vertical ellipses for options, the menu flashes briefly on the screen. I have had to log in each time I've started the app. Both are unacceptable. The adbar/infobar at bottom is annoying. I do not want to go to a browser for tips on how to use the app. Put that in the options. Update weeks later: problem persists. I'm a subscriber, yet am article-limited in the app. Not clear how to fix that. 2016-05-25 Thanks. Fdbk option via app?",
"I've been ranting about it for years, prices were too high. Seems they finally listened! Here's my promise NY Times. Keep it under $10 and I will stay subscribed forever.",
I love the offline feature of this app because it makes it easy to remain informed despite having a poor or no internet connection. Great app for spending time on a train!,
It's good that it contains much stuff but still it lacks news from Pakistan China Etc. NYT should categories things according to continents.,
"I hate it. It only gives you access to a portion of each day's issue (I am a subscriber). I want to read the NY Times as it appears on its website, not some scrambled eggs version of it.",
"Mr. Belcher has increased my understanding of segments of the Arts in arenas which I previously had very little interest. Bravo, sir!",
"Sometimes  I wish  I could have more, but you can't argue with free. And, its the NY Times. Five stars if I could get a longer story without charge. The news is always timely, and on point. Well done!",
Support is slow to respond and gives clearly pre-written messages.,
"I usually log in using an email address and password but this app never accepts it. I've installed it twice and will uninstall it again, even though it seems attractive.",
It's good app 4 people like me.,
"NYT has done a great job with this app, but $15/month is too much. I believe I'd go for $5/month. They just need to figure out they can't charge everyone New York prices. :)",
It's not a free app actually. Only 10 articles for each month...Ridiculous.,
Cant completly remove it.,
My go-to for news all day long.,
Please bring back the Play Article feature!!,
I like everything about this.,
"Don't want it, don't want the updates, don't like the content (beyond biased) and can't remove it.",
Pathetic app for such high caliber paper,
Does not work,
I am indian,
great,
"Despite being a subscriber, I am limited to 10 articles a month. What's going on, NY times? I expect more from my paid subscription.",
"Nothing has changed my worldview so much as having a subscription to NYT. I've tried a lot of other daily news sources, but NYT is by far the best, with the most breadth of coverage and content, the best writing, and the best app. The New York Times is 10 steps ahead of the rest of the traditional news media in terms of the digital presence. Couldn't be happier.",
Being informed has never been so easy.  The app is easy to use and does a fantastic job of curating the news for me. I like the breaking news alerts and the daily news briefings in particular. It is perfectly designed to inform and entertain whether I  have 10 minutes or an hour to spend.,
"Its much better on the Iphone vs the andriod I like the notifications I get regarding current events.  The reader comments are typically well thought out.  The writing is also very good although given the topic, a little to left leaning.  My wife  and oyr 2 daughters  read the 'social Q's  and automobile sections are my favorite.  Thank you.",
I check the app several times a day and it always works.,
"Best news app for presentation and finding what's wanted. Top news should be required reading for all Americans, Opinion must be popular enough to warrant increased visibility.  Mobile first design success and intuitive navigation. Bring back night mode now; WaPo has it and its easier to see in more varied light conditions and is read more as a result even tho it's harder to navigate.",
"I put off subscribing to the mobile NYT thinking there wasn't enough time to read another publication. Wrong! It's superb writing brings politics, travel, food and the arts to life and has increased knowledge and pleasure in my life. I'm also enjoying the NYT VR app. Thanks!",
"Overall, this is a fabulous app. I love reading the morning briefing and being able to read articles throughout the day, even when I'm offline (like on the subway). One thing is lacking, however. Ever since the app was overhauled, the comments section has technologically regressed. I can no longer view the number of ""recommends"" on a comment and can no longer add a comment. This has definitely diminished my enjoyment of the comments feature, which I loved. Please fix this!!!",
"Personally my favorite app. The quality of writing offered by the NYT is unparalleled is journalism. Granted, I am of an age where the actual newspaper is preferable, but I am also of an age where discarding the daily paper is a chore...days of papers become weeks of papers and the piles become too much...I now only get Sunday's NYT. This app is invaluable...a morning reading ritual that has replaced my newspaper...without the unsightly pile of refuse left behind. I implore everyone to download and enjoy.",
Full subscriber but redirect loop from app when I try and view browser based content. Links to desktop site but when tries to serve up the mobile content instead spazs out. Cleared cookies and still issue when trying to log in via chrome on my phone. Not sure worth 35 dollars a month if I can't view articles that have multimedia content due to app login fail. Rooted CM 11,
"The NY Times is the beginning of my day. The app on Android in bed is my principal access. Not as easy to scan as the paper but I have it when I want it. And, the Times may are [e.g. WMD and Iraq] but it is comprehensive and thorough when the editors put their minds to it.",
"I grew up reading the NY Times and I love having it available 24/7 with breaking news wherever I am. This is an excellent app, has never crashed on any of my cell phones.",
"I am a convert from a 7-day  subscriber to a Weekender subscriber (Friday,  Saturday,  Sunday). The reason: the piles of newspaper I recycled every week. Now, alas, even on the weekends, I find myself 'cheating' on the print edition with the app on my phone. Why? Late day updates, the opportunity to catch up with in - depth articles I skipped when they first appeared, the daily mini-crossword, breaking news any time of the day. Wouldn't do with out it now.",
"Not the same functionality as the web version. Couldn't find any easy way to favourite or flag a comment. Can't find your own comments with any ease. Additionally, links to NY times pages don't redirect to launch the app. Most apps have that now, twitter, YouTube, guardian, etc.",
Very easy to use and aesthetically pleasing app. I like the ability to save articles for later (which you need to do since they disappear after a day most of the time). The interactive features and videos are great. I wish the old night mode (white text on black background) was still an option since Twilight mode is meh. I wish archives were searchable and that links to stories could be opened in the app. Overall though it's great!,
"It was with some trepidation that I subscribed to the NYTimes and began using the app to read it on my phone. I tend to read actual magazines and prefer holding a real newspaper. I am actually quite pleased with it (2+ years now) and enjoy using my phone to read. There's even a mini-crossword puzzle. I enjoy reading something interesting and forwarding to a friend or family member, and it's very simple to do. Plus, my hands don't get covered in ink...",
"Never thought I would enjoy my NYT digitally. Turns out, I do, although I still subscribe to the Sunday paper. Love the Morning Briefing. Well curated and concise while leaving room to explore more. And that Mini Crossword! Utterly addictive! Would love to access ones I have missed.",
It's the new York times in your pocket. The app is crisp to use and looks good on the screen. Only complaint is the lack of the daily crosswords (even if you subscribe to the puzzles part of the digital subscription),
"I've been a digital New York Times subscriber since their election coverage in 2008 got me hooked. I deeply appreciate their app and even more so the app team who have always been responsive about my bug reports or features requests. I am especially thankful that they built in the ability to copy text from articles as I always include a short except of an article when I share it on Facebook. I'm also a big fan of the breaking news push notifications. Love those! Anyway, this is an excellent app. Thanks!",
"Great way to get reconnected to the world each morning, plus no need for a daybreak search of the bushes due to a wayward throw!  The updates and flashes sent during the day become an efficient time saver in staying current.  My next frontier is engaging in VR, can't wait.  My Smartphone got a whole lot smarter since I joined NYT digital.",
"For the year or so I've been a subscriber, every time I try to connect my account so I can read NYT articles linked from Twitter, I get ""error 400 - call customer service."".  C'mon guys, get your act together.",
"I feel like the app doesn't load а new content by itself in the morning, but it should",
"I found this app very convenient--until it stopped working recently. The widget is blank and every time I try to open the app, it immediately crashes. I have uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and have the same problem. I have a paid subscription so this is disconcerting to me.",
"I love the alerts for breaking news, mini crossword and new virtual film features. Only complaint is I inadvertently use my free article allotment of 15 rather quickly. Still, it's good if only for snippets and headlines to  jump off to searching  other resources. Great service!",
"Love, love, love the New York Times app! Am now an avid daily reader of the paper & adore the mini-crossword. My great-grandmother had the Times mailed to her in Waynesboro, GA for her entire adult life. Now I am delightedly following  in her footsteps!",
"I have to say, the NY Times app in Android works thousands times better than its iOS counterpart.",
"I love how nyt continually pushes the boundaries of what's possible in telling a story.  Great graphics, easy to navigate and trusted current reporting.",
"You can't do better than the NYT for professional news, and the app is beautiful and highly functional: text, photos, videos, games.",
I've had so much trouble finding a place to get my news. I want a well written headline as well as a well written article. NYT provides that. The app works and looks great.,
"At the forefront in news reporting-- in immediacy, in accuracy, and in depth.  My only complaint with the app for Android is the general inability to find anything through the search mechanism, and I'll not drop stars for that-- this time.",
"The navigation is great. The headlines are on point, and the sections are well designed. The only downer for me is that the integration with Web views from email is weak, so I have to log in a lot if I have not started the app.",
"Every once in a while there are articles that 'can't be found' even though their headlines appear, but otherwise great.",
I love this app. I have been through many iterations of the NYT online and as far as I can tell it's getting leaner and better all the time.,
The app frequently fails to open an article it has alerted me to. It occasionally fails to update to the latest front page. It refused to update the opinion page for weeks at a time.,
I have several newspaper apps on my phone and the New York Times app is the best one. It's only fitting that the best newspaper should have the best newspaper app.,
"My go to source of news. I've seen all the others, I take this one and do not look back. Specially addicted to the mini crossword. Thank you NYT!",
"Hard to put a finger on exactly what changed,  but the user experience is much smoother now.  The app crashes less often too.",
Love the NYT app. Haven't had any issues like other users have reported. My favorite features are the morning and evening news briefing. Great way to get a quick update on what's going on in the world.,
This app is a very easy way to read the paper - I sometimes use it even when the actual paper is on the table next to me.,
It's very convenient that the app downloads the entire content for reading later when signal isn't available such as on an airplane.,
"The morning briefings are great, I read them at breakfast. The ui is good, no crashing problems. No complaints here.",
I have a digital weekly and weekend paper.  Haven't been disapointed.  You can dig as deep as you like.,
"I don't care much for their editorial voice, but the app itself is excellent.",
Slide number on top of Slideshows shows 1 out of n for all the slides and doesn't update.,
"Great source of news and opinion.  Leans hard left.  I lean right, but enjoy hearing the other side.  David Brooks is my hero.",
"Quick, easy to use.  Drawback is lack of real time stock mlt updates and sports scores.",
"The NYT app makes my smart phone even smarter.  Easy to read, timely and comprehensive.  I'm a bit of a news junkie, so it's perfect.",
Love the opinion pieces and analysis. Also very text/image based so it works well for cell phones and people interested in limiting their data usage.,
I grew up with the NY Times & am so glad to be able so access it anywhere,
All the information and stories are easily accessible. I love the mini crossword. This is my first go to news source.,
"Access to breaking news, features, Sunday mag. at my fingertips. Look forward to my daily briefing. We can't get the paper at home, so this is the perfect substitute.",
"Very well designed and great choice of content. Easy to get a quick overview, with the ability to jump to more detail as required. Highly recommended.",
NY Times app is a source of national & international issues and profound opinions that I refer to multiple times daily.  The frequent updates of the site keep me informed in real time.,
"While nothing can beat having a hard copy of the Times,  this app does an excellent job of providing all the functionality you need to keep up with the news.",
Its a great app try it you end up loving it. Very informative lots of news story you like to read.,
"Always something good to read. Easy to use. Easy to carry with you, obvi. Good mutimedia features. Love the mini cross word. It will probably get better too.",
I have always looked to the times website as my link to the world at large by scanning the headlines for events of interest. Recently with the daily briefing I have been able to review the issues of immediate interest more quickly before going on to delve more deeply into other more obscure articles.,
"NYT has been degraded by limiting dissenting opinions, ignoring reality, and building an organizational culture conducive to groupthink.",
"News you find everywhere. Rich, deep, balanced opinion delivered  at your fingertip is what I appreciate the most in NYT app",
"Helps me keep up-to-date and exposes me to ne material, but I'd like the monthly digital nyt subscription cheaper",
Everything works.  It's become the gold standard for digital news.  Neither content or UI comes close on anything else.,
I previously cancelled my subscription I had become so frustrated with the bugs . After a year I missed reading the great content.  Wow! What an improvement. Pages load fast and it has yet to crash.  Good work NYT!,
"Best digital newspaper around.  Easy to navigate, relevant videos, smart columnists of many persuasions.  Would not enjoy my day as much if I was unable to  read the NYTIMES Digital edition.",
I've read the NYT for 40+ years and can't stop now. The app is great. The paywall is too high. I pay about $35 a month for the Digital All Access sub. Something like $10 a month would be much more reasonable.,
"With daily crossword puzzles, lists of top news stories, and smart navigation, the NYT app is a great way to start the morning.",
I use app often and its good for use offline but really would like it to have more site function.  You aren't able to make comments on app in articles where comments are allowed,
The NYT is the news source that all others try to imitate. It is the one most cited in other stories. They have reported on scene instead of getting their news from AP or other paper's reporters. They report a story in depth and not in just a few paragraphs. They have some of the nation's best thinkers writing their editorials. It is the number one news source in America.,
"Overall a nice looking, easy to use app, but too often I tap on an article and get a message that it can't load. If I wasn't paying it would be a mild annoyance, but it's not acceptable when you're paying for a subscription.",
I appreciate the clean and simple layout of the NYT.'s app.  Easy to use and free from clutter,
"The New York Times and radio 4 have been my go to news source for years.  I can't get the paper delivered here and am only stopped from subscribing by the choice of devices. Love the journalism, love the app, please make the pay wall less of a barrier.",
"Innovative and easy to use. Seems like every update has actually been an improvement in how the app functions, not just aesthetic.",
Good news source. Generally objective. Liberal media bias only occasionally shows thru. I will continue to use this so app.,
Started spamming me with notifications after I had previously disabled them. No easily found option in app to disable notifications.,
Murdock killed WSJ.  After a few months all the in depth articles disappeared. I moved over to the NYT for the in depth articles I need.,
I'm no expert but really enjoy these bit sized puzzles.,
I love that I automatically have articles on my phone to keep reading on the subway or airplane.,
Long time subscriber to paper and digital versions. Mobile app is just what is needed to fill the gap in time and access. Breaking news alerts are well calibrated to inform and not annoy. Ad content is acceptable and not usually intrusive or distracting.,
"Doesn't scroll smoothly, often get accidental opening of news item you don't want to read",
"I am an avid reader of nytimes and the app is great. Minimalist design, no unnecessarily complicated fearures, user friendly. Only thing is i can't write comments in this app",
"Easy access to top news, works well, downloads stories in background so I can read on the subway without planning ahead.  Love the new mini crosswords",
Easy to use and read articles. Only wish I could look up words like I can on Kindle while reading.,
Only issue is I haven't been able to figure out how to add a comment.,
"The app is easy to use and gives you what you need to stay up to date, especially with a NYT subscription.",
"Sort of wish there was more value add to the app vs the web, but a nice interface for the paper if you are into the app experience.",
The mini-crossword is the most enjoyable 1:53 minutes of my day.,
New York Times app saves time and trouble. Helps you read all the news that's fit to print.,
"I love being able to read the Times in a miniaturized form, and being able to take it with me when I leave the breakfast table. The mini-crossword puzzle absolutely makes my day!",
The apartment gives me a quick look at the top stories and I can read more if I like.,
I have been using the app for several months. A new virtual reality section has been added. I will be interested in trying it out.,
The most current version of the app has fewer glitches. I use it daily along with other news sources.,
"Every thing may be a news or article ,The New York Times has the best coverage and very articulate  information.",
"The content is clearly the primary reason to exist, and NYT doesn't disappoint. The app itself does a great job of getting you there.",
"I lived in Texas, now Wisconsin. This allows me to stay in touch with the Northeast, where I grew up. I use the android version....never had a complaint.",
I enjoy the easy format of this app. I can read all the important and interesting articles with this app. The format is clear and does not hinder my reading of the NY Times. I highly recommend this to anyone.,
"Black screens within pictures widget, it seems pictures no longer load and cache correctly. Please fix.",
"Updates on news, culture, travel art. Only minor issue is sports concentrates on NY area teams.",
"Great content in a format that is intuitive and easy to read. Love the Briefings too. The Mini Crossword was a nice addition, also.",
"I love the app- much easier than bringing a full newspaper on the subway!  The morning and evening briefs get me caught up, and I love the mini crossword.",
"I used to really enjoy the NYTimes app for breaking news, since those were usually free by nature of being breaking news. This is no longer the case and now I need to pay a subscription to read basically anything.",
Reading this has replaced a printed newspaper for me; it's easy to use and pretty bug-free.,
"I still subscribe to the hard copy, but I find myself spending more and more time on the app. Really love the new daily mini-crossword puzzle.",
"Nicely gives brief overview of daily news stories, with links to full story.  Really like the mini crossward puzzle - I can actually complete it!",
"Well presented, easy navigation.  Top notch app for reading / catching up on the news while on the move.",
"I've used the NYT app for a long time. It delivers the content in an intuitive,  concise and easy to use format.  Never any problems.",
I appreciate being able to easily read quality articles from NYT any time I want. There are not many ads.,
The new version however does not allow me to mark a favorite in comments.  Still love it.,
"Incredible source of news, however, the app leaves much to be desired. I'm disappointed that they took away night mode.",
Love everything about this app. Easy to navigate and very responsive. The mini-crossword puzzle is an added bonus.,
This is the US National newspaper.  It is excellent in in reporting and in its use of technology. NYT is the standard for what journalism should be in the modern age.  There is only one NYT and here it is....,
"A daily dose of news and culture that spans my need for wide range and novelty. Reliable, insightful, and a bit of fun. Thank you, grey lady.",
"My go-to app for the best in breaking news, analysis and insight into fascinating subjects: from sports to the arts, government to human interest.",
"Fast, current, well presented. The Mother of all News Organizations has birthed the Prince of all News Apps. And, ferchrissakes, support journalism and pay for your subscription.",
Comments disappear on articles sometimes and I have to restart the app to see them.,
"I enjoy the nyt mobile app more than reading on a computer. Easy to use,  good format.",
It gives me breaking news immediately when reported. I also love how easy it is to navigate.,
"I don't go a day without reading the nyt.  My current rave is the daily mini crossword.  My son and I do it every day. He's a 100 times faster, but it has become one of the best parts of my day!",
There's always something fascinating to explore in the NYTIMES. And one article leads to another or to looking for more information  (on Google) because of something just read. I get the physical paper on the weekends. I love both formats.,
"One of the first apps I use each morning for local & int'l news. Concise, frequently updated articles and great video segments.",
"It's the NEW York Times!  Still one of the few remaining, trusted sources for world news.",
Opening and reading The New York Times is the first thing I do each morning. App is reliable and well organized.,
I've been enjoying the digital version for a few years. Its been reliable and delivers everything I need from NYT.,
I have been using for over a year and can quickly scan the paper and still dig deeper when desired.,
"Great app, although I sometimes can't seem to find my way to the comments section when I'm in an article.",
It delivers NYT to my phone so I can read them offline on the train. No major issues,
"The 5/15 update would crash on open for me until I cleared the application's data: Run ""Settings"", then select Applications : Manage Applications : NYTimes : Clear Data.",
"The NYT app is the best. It's easy to use, functional, and attractive. It easily surpasses all other periodical apps. It's now most used app.",
I love this app because it's intuitive and easy to navigate. I love the mini crossword puzzle and the daily morning brief.,
Unlike some other apps it works well with a variety of font sizes . Everything is easy to get to and nothing floats annoyingly over the text :-),
Quick download no bugs easy to read even on telephone.,
"The Times consistently comes through with reliable reporting and analysis, and is a ""go to"" site during major developing stories.",
A quick and easy way to catch up on the headlines during breakfast.,
"Relatively easy to use. Lots of info and all of it is readily accessible. However, recommend submitting any comments about articles using a laptop or desktop.",
An outstanding source of news and general knowledge. We use it multiple times a day.  Great readability along with a wide variety of articles.  Great on a smartphone. Even slicker on a tablet.  Highly recommended!,
"Can't believe I've waited this long for the digital edition. It's quick, informative and the VR thing is other worldly! Oh! the mini crossword is actually doable! Love success in the morning!",
"Many reviews have reported this problem. Clicking on ""Read xx Replies"" results in an endless spinning cursor.  So fix it already!  10/29/2015 - still not fixed. Well actually you can't see any replies now.  I suppose we should just shut up about night mode and the inability to comment on articles.",
Has stopped working on my Droid 1. Please fix!,
I would give it the full 5 stars but the fact that I'm limited on articles per 30 days is why I give it 4,
It keeps me up to date on current happenings and I like the broad choice of subjects they cover.,
Excellent app. Dropped night mode forced me to drop  the 5rh star.,
I find the daily reviews excellent! It keeps me updated on news around the world not just local. It's concise & informative.,
Not sure what I'd do without this handy source of professional news coverage. Probably just lose track of everything that's happening in our world and our universe.,
Mostly pretty good. Would prefer ad free since there is a subscription fee. Also no ability to search for old articles,
The New York Times is the best there is - using this app enriches your life,
One of the few places you can get reliable news.,
"This is, by far, my favorite app! My morning routine includes a cup of coffee and the NY TIMES.  I can't remember what I did before?",
"I always use my mobile, so it is really useful having this app.",
"Well organized, easy to navigate. My phone is the only way I read NYT",
This newest iteration is easy to navigate and glitch-free --  a great news app.,
Its annoying beacuse spam come up on your tablet.,
Have been an avid reader ever since I could read and the New York Times has always been an excellent source of news and information. They continuously evolve to be  better with new and exciting innovations to keep us up to speed with all the news that matters from current events to theater and the arts among others.,
Best newspaper with great journalism. I just wished it had a technology section more easily findable.,
So much free and quality content. I look forward to doing the mini crossword every day.,

Excellent functionality and ease of use. Love the morning and evening briefings and the cute 5 by 5 crossword each day.,

Great stories and pics. Read it everyday. Love the mini crossword puzzle.,
I use this app constantly. The best newspaper in the country.,

A pretty decent app for arguably the best newspaper in the English speaking world.,

Best news reader and mini crossword puts it over the top.,
"Great app, works beautifully. I only read the times when commuting to work",
"The adverts get really annoying. I'm paying NYT a monthly subscription fee, why the endless barrage of ads?",
"Terrific app, reliable and innovative features. Love the mini crossword",
This keeps me up with the Times when I can't read the hard copy. Love it,
"Love the quick news summaries I get on my phone each day and the ""back story"" features at the end of the summaries...good stuff.  The NYT mobile keeps getting better at graphics/photos.  And its most recent experiment with Google Cardboard and virtual reality...wow.  Now THAT's the future of mobile news!  I also get to share my access to digital NYT with one member of my family, so my son enjoys it, too.",
Happy to have the Times at my fingertips.,
I use it daily on multiple devices.  It does what it should and always works.,

This app should have white text on black background.,
Teamed up with my digital subscription works like a charm.,
Love the offline capabilities. Really recommend it to everyone especially if they are commuters.,
Having the world's best news in your pocket is like a super-power,
Best way to find specific articles of interest. Thoroughly reliable. High quality  illustrations.,

Caches the articles before my commute and then just works. Love it.,

NY Times was one of first newspapers to start online paid subscriptions way-back-when. It is worth it....,
The app is not free. It let me read for 10 article then it telling me to pay $14.99 for 10 article? Wth I look like? Deleting it.,
Supper,
Hey,
Dusdaram,
Reader,
Writer,
"Unfortunately to get access to more than 10 articles per month I have to pay a fee. Which is ridiculous since information should be free to everyone. The News' main objective is to inform people. The poor. The rich. With information we all should know. This is not the Paper I pay 2,50 to put my hands on it. This is the internet where I'm also surrounded by ads that make every website host wealthy thanks to us. Nowadays some companies have forgotten its principles.  Everyone. Support free information",
Previous version listed one story sfter another.  New one replicates printed page with stories all over the  place.  Movement is jumpy.  Text is very small.  Stories badly formatted if you increase font size.  Give me back the previous version please.,
Can't customize it despite false advertising on Play.  Lots of useless junk like celeb gossip and sports. Can't comment from app. And only 10 articles per month? All the UK news apps are unlimited.,
I really think the New You rk Times App does a fantastic job of over viewing the news.  Thanks!,
"What we really expect of the app is actually a night mode in which white font contrasts against black ground, not just the twilight mode this app is currently offering. Thanks.",
Make it go away,
No thanks.,
It is very nice app,
News (not) Paper,
"Don't use it, can't uninstall it!",
This was the one improvement over the ios app but now it's gone.,
"Needs a ""Today's Paper"" section",
Why can't we do a search or comment on articles but can using a desktop bowser?,
Nice,
"It would be great if users can comment on articles in the app. It seems that users can view submitted comments, but I have yet to find how to leave a comment myself. Also, I do wish that in tapping a link within articles, I would be directed to the source within the app's standard interface and not necessarily an in-app web browser. Because of this, users do not have the same options for functions on articles and pieces as they would if they were to then search for the same article within the app.",
just so you know the view behind the status bar is white not your actual toolbar background. It looks a bit awkward. #eeeeee bro,
"Not all are rich,  you cant charge us for news... we can google it tooo from other good sites",
This app should be optional. It came stock on my tablet & I do not want it. There is no way for me to delete it or turn it off!,
"Just discovered it on you tube. Great Work, Christopher Buck! Zachary Green;good narration.",
"The ""Share"" feature now doesn't provide a link to the story! It says ""Read More"" but has no link.  I love the app aside from that. I'll happily give this app the 5 star rating it deserves once that is fixed!",
I love the new app. Thank you for adding google sign in.,
"Good, but beeked on certain things.",
"I'm a former paid subscriber, but refuse to pay again until: 1) there are no ads in the very expensive paid version, and 2) night mode returns.",
Will not let me log in to my existing account!!,
All,
NYT Crossword on Android?,
Requires money.,
Don't like it,
Xxx,
Tooling,
"It won't open, app crashes when I open it. Well this update didn't work either. I'm gonna cancel my subscription. Save myself 15 bucks a month",
Always  love NYTIMES. The app for amdroid ales it so easy to navigate to sections and share articles. My source for news 99% of the time...I do have to get local news occasionally!,
Love the app. I'd love it even more if I could view the comments and post comments on the articles.,
"Can I Uninstall these useless apps that came with my tablet,even tho it says may cause damage?",
Excellent app. Terrific editorials.,
The new York city news,
Uninstall,
I'm beginning to hate this app. It refuses to update automatically. I have the settings to update via wifi and data but it refuses to update. I spend half the morning with the previous evenings news. I have to see the Washington Post for current news.,
What happened to night time mode?,
"First, I have a paid subscription and I've been a reader for years. Now, you're reading an interesting article and boom... the screen refreshes after only a couple of minutes and kicks you out and back to the home page. You now scroll down to find article again and start from where you stopped. In a few minutes it repeats and kicks you out. There is no option in apps settings to stop screen refresh to enable you finish a long article. This is highly annoying. NYT should fix this asap.",
"News when you need, in a blink of the eye. It's scalable interactive graphics, videos are must-see and share. Although the OpEds NYT publishes sometimes pander to the less well-formed, NYT digital delivers on its promise: all the news that fit to print",
"Most efficient, reliable source of valid political, economic, social & geopolitical information available without a ""secret"" security clearance.   While no single source should be relied upon completely, the NY Times, combined with the World Service of the BBC, is the best starting point I am aware of. It has sustained my habit of critical thinking for almost 50 years, with far fewer surprises or disappointments than I have observed among the advocates for Fox News, Info Wars, Facebook, Twitter or Pravda.",
"If I click on an article by mistake and do not read it , the count down starts  and I'm left with only 9 more. No way to deselect  wrong article immediately and no "" selected articles "" option with free articles  from worldwide.",
"Smooth. Simple, easy to use. It works! Beautiful design and typography whilst also being respectful of Android conventions. Shame about the slightly confusing separation of tablet and mobile phone subscription but that's not really the app's fault. I'd also like to be able to customize the sections on the International Edition like you can with the regular edition?",
"It seemed like a good app, every day sent me a news summary for the day, but after one month it stops giving even that and demands payment. Now all it does is deliver ads and demand money, so totally useless unless you are looking to subscribe to something. Why they couldn't continue to provide a headline summary is beyond me, but since I don't need an app that takes over my phone with ads that I don't want, I am uninstalling this now.",
"I've been unable to login to my account and access my subscription for at least 3 months. Contacted support, followed their instruction to no avail. App has been updated many times since then, and none of them have fixed the issue. Very frustrating.",
No real journalists. Go back to journalism school and get your money back. Nothing but gossip tabloid. Need to report real news from both sides.  Nothing but professional paid liars. Cancel subscription.,
This app will have to be forcibly uninstalled since an uninstall option is not available from within Google Play. I was able to uninstall the update but not the application itself.,
I've tried saving articles on both mobile and desktop. But nothing ever appears in my Saved.,
Why does this app freeze up all the time can't they understand my game has it all my game can do it all,
"Update: the latest version changes how ads are handled, and its much better! Thanks for listening to feedback! I'd still love a way to fully pay away ads, however.",
"Easy to use, smooth, and can navigate well considering all the content in a day's paper.",
"None yet, just downloaded app to my phone.",
Hillarys media channel/snowflake whiny crap,
"New update ruined the widget. I only want to see Movie articles on my widget, not everything. Why can't I change any settings on the widget anymore?",
Best News App so far! Every upgrade just makes the experience better.,
It looks SO COOL ! Soft regards from James.,
Samsung bloat ware on my tablet taking space.,
10 articles free per month,
It seems that launching the app causes the brightness to dim all the way (not in twilight mode)  causing the screen to become unreadable.,
Thanks for the news delivered from my fingertips!,
Lack the latest business events,
"It keeps getting re-added. I do NOT want it! If & when I decide I do, then I'll add it.",
How things happend during the renaissance,
Looks like the scrollable widget is back. Thanks! Will try this app again and see how it goes.,
Much better....  Copy and paste has a bug... only allows 1 paragraph...,
"Retired,pension",
Great newspaper,
Accurate in professionals,
Great app! Works perfectly. Great value!,
Can't stay away from this app!,
NYT is my first choice for reading news online.,
Gr8 reading!,
Top,
FAKE NEWS,
Good job baby,
10 articles per month why not a week?,
Love it,
I have paid subscription but the app still displays an ad at the bottom of the app.  The iOS version does not do this. Please remove this ad for subscribers!!,
Truth,
This is an excellent way to read the NY Times on an Android phone.,
"Please, for the love of god, give your readers the same option that you offer them on your website: light text on a dark background. You may have noticed that there are a lot of reviews noting the lack thereof. That would be because the 'twilight mode' feature that you offer simply duplicates built-in functionality and isn't what your readers want in a night mode. I'm not reading the Times with your app for this reason. I'm rather disappointed, truth be told.",
"Please bring back Night Mode (black background and white text), as Twilight Mode is unusable.  Please also bring back the ability to up-vote reader comments.  Finally, please add the ability to post article comments from the app itself.  And please do not respond by claiming that 'very few users ever used Night Mode,' as I have seen you write in response to other reviews that requested the return of Night Mode.  The sheer number of reviewers requesting the return of Night Mode indicates otherwise.  Thanks.",
"I know it can be difficult as hell but, articles should be refined more to be as effective and efficient as possible, and I found quite a lot or redundancy in important news. I know you can do it, Editors! Keep up the good work! Haha, but seriously. Your work, guys, is not an easy thing to do. Demand a salary raise! Jk.",
"I have not been able to add  comments to any articles via neither; phone nor tablet. This has been going on for awhile. I literally have to switch to desktop version, in order to add comments.",
Doesn't always load new content.  Annoying when you want to read the morning paper.,
"The NYT has been working hard to ruin this app. Recent efforts include removing night mode, removing the ability to comment on articles,  routine failure to update some of the nyt blogs, and removing text to speech.",
"As a paying subscriber,  I just want to read the news and not ads constantly. The annoying ads completely ruin the reading experience.",
"Had to uninstall. It kept saying app out of date. Wouldn't let me read or 
do anything.",
"More than reading articles, I'm combating all the pop ups that keep opening continuously. Too much adware!!",
"After the new update for the app, it has not been working. Everytime I open the app on my phone it crashes. The app was really nice before please fix the bug.",
"Loved it. The new info comes as a msg, wich I loved very much.",
I thought the new update would fix the errant /lazy reporting on Hillary Clinton. I was wrong!,
"Fatally stops when I load comments like  comments on White police officer charged in killing black Ohio motorist dated 29/7/15, otherwise quiet improved.",
Every time I open it it closes saying unfortunately NY TIMES HAS STOPPED. NY times does not respond to repeated emails!!!!!!,
What else to add? It's another crap which cannot be unninstalled from my device without rooting it what would void warranty. Not happy.,
"I don't need this, why we must have what we don't need?  Sistem useless app, we cannot uninstall, then give the right never update.  I don't need this and more others.",
Does every thing it says.,
My most used app.  Nothing else comes remotely close.,
"UPDATE: I still cannot comment, respond, or even like others comments. I made a comment back in April and still nothing.  April, 2015- Why can't I, as a PAID subscriber, comment on stories? Extremely annoying.",
I'm very happy with the best  newspaper  in the world.,
"Can you bring back the white text against the dark background mode as another option relative to the twilight mode? Also, the current twilight mode reverts to regular brightness when moving between articles.",
Too much readable.,
Pleaseeee,
Online newspaper,
The daily crossword is the cherry on top.,
Great but.. keeps crashing,
Often doesn't update and app has to be deleted and reinstalled.,
Fake News!! Stay away!!,
Would not open,
Quality content. Daily read.,
10 articles per month..,
I like it,
Of what?good,
Love this app,
Prefer CNN and BBC,
Super poor journalism,
Iamdondada,
"Nice interface for reading news, and I appreciate the timely updates on important stories. However, the threshold for what is considered ""breaking news"" worthy of a push notification is frustratingly low. This results in entirely too many interruptions (at least several per day) by the app if you want to have breaking news alerts enabled. Please consider reworking this feature, as the app is a nice experience otherwise.",
"The app is nice, and I like the daily news wrap-up. However, as I use the touch screen to scroll down, the app registers that I've selected an article. As a result, the 10 free articles disappear in 1-2 days.  And the screen that pops up whenever I use the touch screen, reminding me that NYT believes I've used all of my free articles, is extremely annoying.",
"After I install this app it will eventually say I need to log in when I'm already logged in. I'm logged in on my computer and tablet, they work ok. On my S5 it doesn't work. Disgusted with it because I can't carry my tablet everywhere.",
This came pre-installed on my tablet and there's no way to get rid of it. Everytime I uninstall it the thing reinstalls and updates on its own. For what I paid for my tablet I should be able to uninstall any useless app I choose.,
"If I tell you that it doesn't recognise my subscription while my browser does, ask yourself if you need it.",
"Nearly full articles, well-written as expected from the NY Times.",
Forces itself on you and the worst part is can't be Uninstalled!,
You took away the night reading feature.,
"LG G4 logged in but still getting ""no free articles left""",
"WaPo has night view (white print on black), why can't the NYT bring that back????? Twilight view is not valuable since you can adjust the brightness on the phone.",
How to remove this on my phone i dont need or use this,
"I'm just curious as to why there is a free service available to iOS users, but there is still a subscription based service for Android users? This really just turns me off to using this app.",
New version has been capable of full off-line reading.,
Consider yourself fortunate if your device didn't come with this.,
"I miss the Night Mode!!! So much easier on my eyes. The updated version only has a dimmed down capability which is useless. If it's dimmed down, that means it's harder to read. Who's dim now??",
I don't  want this  app on my tablet - apparently not my choice,
Very good app,
"The New York Times makes you call to cancel your subscription. I will not 
subscribe again until I can cancel online.",
10 articles per month,
Love the Times,
Rubbish,
Can't remove it,
"No, no, no.",
Disappointed with this app -- once again. The commenting features are limited (number of recommendations among other features found in the desktop version are nonexistent in mobile). I see no benefit to using the app over the website with perhaps the exception of notifications. I expect more from the New York Times. What a let down.,
"I found night mode to be very useful, and it was a better solution than anything that can be done with a third party screen dimming app, because it applied only to the text and background. Using the reverse video accessibility option is no good, because it makes the pictures look weird, and more importantly it turns the partially transparent black mask that essentially all screen dimming apps use to make the screen dimmer than 0% into a white mask, which is the opposite of what I want.",
"I enjoy  reading  the times while on the train  going  to work.  However,  since the  last upgrade  i am having  bad experiences  reading  an article  and suddenly  it just freezes. This is my first  attempt  to un installed  and reinstall to see if this would  fix the problem.",
Shame on the NYT. I have a paid subscription yet am still subjected to banner ads while reading the paper online. Terrible business decision.,
"I am deleting this app in protest of the Times omitting Ted Cruz's book from the spot it earned in their Bestseller list. I'm not even a Republican, but I regard this as deceitful.",
"This has to be a first, I am paying a decent amount to subscribe to nyt and I am being welcomed by banner ads at the bottom of the app. Completely unacceptable and will think about not renewing the subscription.",
"The app they should recall, when my FREE tablet intro expires im sooooo done with it, like the NYT hate the app",
I very much enjoy being able to get my NT Times fix with this app. Also the quick crossword puzzle is fun.,
"I prefer software that doesn't nag.  I don't want to subscribe, and I'd uninstall if that was possible without rooting my devices.  But hey, thanks anyway.",
"Navigation great,  smooth.  And I can read offline the daily issue after updated with no bugs",
"NYTIMES, you know what you did. Among other catastrophes, such as removing the easy ability to control all font size, still not way to comment or search on the app? Garbage app. How much did the NYTIMES pay Google to get the ""Editors Pick"" rating in the Play Store?  Did Google even look at the app?",
Excellent on my Moto G and on my 2013 Nexus 7. Fast and responsive.,
Like the title caption for quick read on the go.,
Remove the ad. Show some attitude.,
"Works great, nice features. Reliable.",
"The app itself is great, but it's quite ugly to have ads in a paid app",

Newspaper,
Finally the New York Times app behaves predictably and does not crash frequently. Updating the stories feels faster and the interface is smooth and intuitive. The earlier version wasn't terrible but it was far from great. This one is. I rely on it daily for news over breakfast and it never lets me down.,
"But the current version does not work. Each time I want you launch it says that the app has quit. A real nuisance. I read the news articles several times a day. The support people at the NY Times have been very helpful but despite following their instructions to the dot, the app continues crashing.",
"I love the app but there was a problem with trying to cram too much text into a space and by not leaving enough space between the lines the sentences merge together, well some text appears to be written over the line before. All in all I really enjoy reading the NY Times even though I am British and live in the UK. *Update. The problem is caused by 'architect's daughter' font on Galaxy Note 4. Nothing to do with the app just in case others get this problem.",
"Easy to use app with a great range of interesting cases. Handy headings and the layout it's organised and logical. Love how you can choose your favourite topics making it so much easier to find a good read. It is also so nice to not have to worry about stearing away from the gossip junk...!!! A user friendly app delivering quality news, just what I need and want.",
"I'd something longer and more complimentary written, but alas, it does not fit. To the complaints, then! 1) I'm a subacriber. I don't want to see ads on my app when I'm paying a buck a day for it. 2) The saved article feature is both nifty and annoying: The app needs to differentiate between online and offline viewing for saved articles so that pics and videos and whatnot could be included 3) Could be me, but it doesn't seem that the app gives us the same quantity of articles that appear on the NYT website.",
Lots of news apps out there.  But I am a home subscriber and only use this app when traveling.  What I really want is to find the nearest spot selling the Times when I'm on vacation.,
"Every time that there's an update, the settings in the app reset. I have notifications turned off, but when there's an update, I start to receive notifications again. I shouldn't have to redo my personal settings every time.",
"I subscribe to the NYT but refuse to pay extra so I can read it on a tablet. As such, I can only read the paper in a browser or in the phone app, not the tablet app. That is pretty silly, I think. Overall the app works just fine.",
"I have stuck by this app through ups and downs from the very beginning. Unfortunately, saved articles do not access photos with latest version, whether or not I have a data connection. I hope this is being addressed.",
"The new app is fine. It does seem to have some issues on my wife's phone. In general, on my Android phone it's fine. It is a shame they can't get their act together enough to get the crossword app to work on Android.",
The NY times doesn't report the full story but presents a good description of the story. I just wish that they were brave enough to report the true story of police violence in 2015,
NYT app layout is easy to navigate. Breaking News alert takes you directly to the story. One of the best news apps.,
"The “Breaking News "" notifications are almost as bad as cnn.   Rarely is it breaking news.   Whomever is responsible is not meeting NYTimes standards.   Fortunately this feature can be easily disabled.",
I subscribe to the NY Times and this app means I will not miss a beat when I don't have Time for the paper version or The Nation.,
"The new version of night mode is dimming the screen. Not the same. The white text on the black screen was much easier to read and easy on the eyes even in daylight. Dimming  the screen isn't night mode, it makes it harder to read. Please bring back the ability to inverse the contrast.",
There's nothing more frustrating than an app that sends you a push  notification only to take you straight to an upgrade prompt. Very spammy.,
The NYT app is one of the few news apps that is far superior to reading the website.  I love that it caches the days news so you still can read it despite not having reception.,
"It says nothing but lies about Egypt, you trust your self or just you see nothing.",
Quick headlines allow me to sift through stories I wish to read.I have found the articles well written and very even handed in a world where everything is written with a slant.,
Getting less notifications of articles on app than the one's I see on Web version,
"I am a subscriber to the digital NYTimes, but no matter how many times i log in, i am still shut down from reading more than the 10 free articles. I now have to return to the web site...",
Over $400 for a years subscription - far too expensive. Lots of news is free,
Very nice app however should have more content in each section. Also...the stock market indices would be  nice in business .,
"Photos are still not loading properly on a Galaxy Note II. If they do load, they are often not viewable when you turn to landscape mode. I hate the new twilight  mode. Please bring back the black background, which puts out less light when reading in bed.",
Terrible now. Refreshing is slow and I can't figure out if it's happening.,
Couldn't do without my daily NYT.  Doesn't kill trees. Easy to send interesting articles to family.  Handy department headings. Easier than paper to skip dull departments. Undowithoutable.,
"After the disgraceful reporting of the Berkeley California Tragedy, I want to get this off my Tablet (Galaxy Tab S). Every time I try to unistall it only removes the last update. How do I get rid of this 'rag'.",
App works well but needs an upgrade to keep up with accessibility like smart news and flip board.  NY times is great news source that deserves a better app.,
Love the app. The new revamp is even better. Smooth and user friendly. Just the way anyone would want it..,
"This app delivers. Sure, the NYT could do a better job editorially, but the app delivers the words and pictures, with judgment, intelligence and knowledge, at least as much as human beings can accomplish in 24 hours. No criticism of the app here...the paper itself, that's another assignment.",
"...there is one feature missing, search. I can't easily find articles without tediously scrolling through the limited number of articles shown in the available sections.",
Probably the best news app out there. I always find the most interesting stories and perspectives.,
"It's actually faster to open chrome, type in their url, and start reading, than opening this app and waiting for the loading time..",
"I love the app. When I am not busy, this app is my companion.  I use the app more than the web site",
I'm torn between this app and Newsstand. Is there a way to disable the app's backlight control and just allow the ambient light sensor to handle it?,
"Sometimes articles don't open, for no discernable reason. Unreliable app.",
"I seldom rate apps, first time download Nytimes , Love that material design , ui is surprisingly smooth! Texts with HD pictures is a big plus. Full stars no regret.",
"I'm looking forward to them, yuuuuumm🍹",
GOT A DEAL TO WHERE IT SAYS FREE BUT U WILL LET ME SEE TEN Articles then I will get charged. DELETING REAL FAST.!!!!!!,
Where did the black background with white text mode go? Almost completely stopped reading in bed because the screen is so bright now. Sad,

"As others have reported,  I get a popup after 10 stories telling me to create an account or login even though I'm already logged in. Who has time for that? Fix that.",
"Good updates, twilight mode is really useful for new since my moto x doesn't really dim down enough for night usage. Adding more features has helped the app along. Still annoying having those lower banner ads on the bottom for paid members.",
"The performance of this Times app needs some work, lots of work. Every couple weeks it refuses to recognise my subscription, locking me out. Logging in again doesn't help... I just get a message saying to try again later.  Writing to customer service asking to fix the problem doesn't help either. Of course there's never a problem with collecting the subscription fees. I've just about given up.",
In reply to dev comment: your helpdesk claims they can't solve the problem of people being unable to sign in and advice me to call Google. Many people here describe this problem- perhaps you shouldn't leave it to the customers to solve. Cancelled my subscription.,
"I am unable to find the latest article from my favorite columnist in the app. Very frustrating. Reading reader comments is much more difficult now, with small font size and no ability to vote on comments. I am not happy with the upgrade.",
"I have the free version of this app. I am constantly hitting my tablet with my hand accidentally and using up my allotment of 10 articles on stories that I have no interest in.   This can be easily fixed with an update. After a person selects a story, you can have the first few lines appear with a message confirming the selection. "" Would you like to continue to read this article? This is number 6 of your allotted 10 articles this month.""   The current method is totally frustrating.",
"New version is great, except on a non-touch screen HDTV, where the UI uses a mouse to scroll the text. The new UI requires pressing left mouse button while scrolling in opposite direction.  Works as expected on touch screen devices though.",
Improved but my tablet's app does not recognize my paid subscription for the same account as my phone. Same problem like many have described.,
"Apparently they're working on it, but removing this feature and replacing it with a rather useless twilight mode has really irked me.",
"The previous version had a black background night time mode, that I used all the time. This new version has a ""Twilight"" mode that is useless. It lowers down the light in a way that makes it very uncomfortable to read, to the point of being unusable. I wish they would ditch the new Twilightmode and bring back Night time mode.",
"the widget used to auto update, now it doesnt even update when i hit the refresh button. i have 3 day old headlines on my phone. useless!",
Won't recognize subscription after working fine for a couple of months and support service won't help. Note: I have been approaching the android support team.,
"Getting better for the performance but   don't like the way to show news, prefer old version",
Bloatware that turns itself back on and spams my notifications bar. Not international.,
"Live the sliding from section to section, how I can customize my section list, search is great.",
The app has made progress with feature. But there seems to be regression with the removal of the night mode (ie. White text on black background) and this new twilight mode that is not as good,
"You know generally when you pay to use an app, the annoying ads at the bottom of the screen disappear. If the ads are still there after my 12 week trial, I'm canceling the subscription. One star until then.",
Bring back nighttime mode. Twilight mode is vastly inferior.,
totally crummy...  don't you have any sense of responsibility to build an accessible application?,
Make it free please!,

Hate it.  It won't recognize my log in.  Ever.,

"longer articles jump when scrolling which is super annoying cause you lose your place when reading. also why was the dark version removed / can it be brought back? I for one really liked it. and finally, updating doesn't seem to do anything, the update spinner just spins and spins... oh, and there seem to be more ads.",
"On my Samsung device, if I disable this app and remove all updates, it just re-enables and updates again. I can't uninstall it because it's stock. It is a constant nuisance.",
The quality of the app build is great. It's simple and doesn't have any clutter. The is for taking care of Android users.,
"The New York Times app is great, especially for keeping up on Breaking News.  The one down side is the coverage of International News.  In general, it is a great news app and worth the subscription.",
Add a dictionary (as in many e-book apps). Lots of fancy words that are not used in daily life. That would enhance the experience especially for non-native speakers.,
"Can't remove, not interested in the corporate media lapdog elite.",
Not a trust worthy news outfit.,
"What does it take to convince you? Go on,  try it. Try the new.",
I pay monthly for a subscription so I could LISTEN to the NY Times articles while I drive in the car. This function us gone.  On other reviews i have read responses from the NY Times explaining that they had not decided what features to add to the new app.  My question: why update an app if you have to remove any features? Isnt that a downgrade rather than an update.  Also why do you punish subscribers by postponing a decision on what features to include until after the app is released? Btw can't click link,
"Are you kidding me?? You couldn't ""implement"" the search function? That's the ONE function that you can't omit, all your visual junk can be omitted but not the search function. You have pretty a looking useless app, congratulations to the New York Times",
Crash upon launch every time.,
"Like most of what I've seen from the update, but do miss the 4x1 article widgets by category.",
"Previous version had a beautiful widget that was an approximation of a physical newspaper (I.e. photos, text and in sections); shallow as it may seem that's was one of the reasons I became an NY Times subscriber. It also set the app as distinct from other news apps. Current widget is a basic list format that is generic.",
"Night mode was removed due to ""limitations"".  4.1.1 had deficiencies, but many of its strengths have been discarded.  Thanks but no thanks.  NY Times now favors glitz and noise for its app over basic functionality.  I am a long time subscriber to the real paper and user of the mobile app from its beginning.  My response to their misguided priorities is boycott.  I am removing this new app from my mobile devices.",
"The new app design is great, but there's still the persistent, long-standing bug where tapping on a headline in the widget doesn't actually take you to the article. I'm also missing some favorite features from the old app. In particular: night mode, and the ability to set a widget to show headlines from a specific section. I'm hoping this stuff will come back as the new app is iterated.",
"I am not the sort of person who writes a lot of negative reviews, but as an active user, I feel the new layout is a mistake. So much LESS information is now available on screen. Especially with the bloated top-heavy interface, the giant first story panel, and advertising at the bottom, I can see only 2 headlines now instead of 5 or 6. There is absolutely nothing about the new interface that makes it better.  If I could give this zero stars, I would.",
"You used to be able to use white text on black background for nighttime reading that was easier on the eyes and less disturbing to sleep rhythms. That feature was just removed in favor of a brightness control. White on black has good contrast and is legible. Dimming the whole screen just makes it progressively less legible. NYT has always had a great interface, but I think this change knocks it down a few pegs.",
"Love the app and love the Times, but if you could stop changing the size of your widget with seemingly every update, that would be great. Hate having to costantly replace the widget and rearrange my screens and other widgets just so that I may continue using the widget. Widget.",
"In the print days it may have been acceptable to charge money, and show (much less annoying) ads, it no longer is.   I can't give it higher than one star, because my eyes keep being drawn to the ads. I find it surprising that the New York Times wants its app to feel like those free low quality spammy games.",
"New version on a Samsung GT4 is stunning. The news feed is fast and transparent with n entire new navigation scheme that places your sections on the top bar.  Flipping articles to Flipboard or Evernote is one step process. If you stayed away from the older version, you need to try this update.",
"With the removal of Night mode, read aloud + playlists and an advertising scheme of the circa 2010 consistent bottom ad banner I will now use Google Play News to get my NY TIMES content.    Oddly confusing digital strategy for a paper transitioning to digital.",
"Ditto everything that was said below as about the new version.  Skips during scrolling and worst of all, the widget NEVER UPDATES even after clicking the refresh button.  I'm having to now remove the widget and considering other news apps.  Why did you have to ruin a good thing, NYT?  Shame. (Galaxy S4)",
"As pointed out, lost features with lame excuses about ""we're workin on them"". I lost access twice (10 free article limit). Uninstall/update fixed.  Twice articles quit updating. Ditto uninstall/update.  Three days ago wife lost access on her tablet (10 free etc.).  No fix yet.  We are about 2 days from going to the Washington post.  I wish I could politely express to you the lameness of this ""update"".  I designed/coded programs for 33 years before retirement.  I would be ASHAMED to have put out something this unready.",
"I purchased this subscription in Jan and have been paying $14.99 each month since then for access to the NYT. I was getting access to the service without an issue, until about 3 weeks ago when I got a new Android phone and installed the app to it. However, I could not activate it because the app would not acknowledge my subscription. After several attempts at resetting passwords and multiple emails and a call to the NYT, they could find no record of the subscription. I had to contact the Google Play app store, who refunded my payments to date and suggested I cancel the subscription, which I did.       Seems like pretty shoddy account management to me. Something in the back end of this app is not working.       Frustrated",
"This new version of the most used application on my phone is a disappointment compared to the old version:  1. Slow startup. The new app takes about 7 seconds between when it is launched until the screen is populated on my phone during which time a blank grey screen is shown. The old app was nearly instantaneous.  2. Night mode has been removed. I prefer white text against a black background, and it is also uses less energy on my AMOLED equipped phone by not having to light so many pixels. Its supposed replacement ""twilight mode"" (which really should be called ""dim-hard-to-read mode"") is one feature I would not miss if removed.  3. The blogs are now waaaay down at the bottom of the menu. Additionally, they do not appear to be getting refreshed, even when manually initiated.  The standard reply to the (many) other users complaining about the shortcomings of the new app is basically ""complete rewrite -- still adding features"", but this new app should not have been be released until it was at feature parity with the old one. With Lollipop rolling out so slowly, I do not see what the rush was to inflict this app on your (paying) users before it was ready.",
"Great news app where I can be up to date with everything is around me. The interface is  great and everything flows really nicely, but the only thing is that the saved articles don't sync between my tablet and my phone. I have the same account for both apps but it just refuses to sync. Hope this is fixed!",
"In re-designing this app (which seems like the 10th time in the past few years), the search functionality was completely removed. If you want to find an article you read a few days earlier (or if a friend says you should check out a story that was in the Times about X ) you need to manually search each section of the app and hope it is still posted somewhere (which it will not be if it more than a few days old.) If you can't find it, your only option is go the the NYTimes website, log in and do a search there. This seems like a poor design choice, especially since the iphone version still allows full search.",
The new update removed key features from the app - such as the ability to adjust font size on the headline pages and even the font sizes on the articles are  limited to just 3 sizes. It is really inexcusable since the current fonts make the app virtually unusable for many. It is not sufficient to say that these features will be restored later - you are charging for the paper now and have made it impractical to use for many. Don't you realize that many of your subscribers can no longer read minuscule fonts.,
"Can't comment on articles anymore, can't recommend comments anymore, can't enlarge print size as much as in the previous version, and can't enlarge print size at all for previews. Night mode is gone and replaced with ""twilight"" mode, which simply reduces the contrast and makes text harder to see.   NYT: How about if you finish the job before you release an update? Really disappointed and frustrated with the new version.",
"Feed no longer updated daily in the widget. Every morning I woke up with yesterday's news showing. No more scalable fonts; only 3 presets now. Comment feature missing on many articles. Can't switch display to black background w/white text. Can no longer display both text and photo of all of a section's articles in widget. Widget choices are now an uninspired RSS text feed, or an all photo feed that displays only a few articles. Let me know if bugs are fixed so I can resubscribe.",
"Regarding the content of Times, there is of course no need to say that it is the same high-quality professional journalism it has offered for decades. Its new app interface is boldly simplistic and accessible, yet without sacrificing its fashionable and striking beauty. BBC and CNN should learn from this beautiful app. Quality reporting presented in a monochromatic resplendent manner. UPDATE: The comments section is not working. Please fix this!",
"The NYT had one of the most well designed, easy to use and feature rich apps out there. And yet they decided to release a major update that was worse than the previous in almost every conceivable way. The new design uses too much screen real estate on headers and footers, leaving less room for the news. The ads are smaller and more awkward. It is more difficult to navigate between sections. And of course, night mode was removed. I know they won't, but I really wish they'd just bring the old app back.",
"Please bring back the ability to choose a larger font size!  With the most recent version you can only pick a larger font when reading the text of an article -- in the main summary section (lists of available articles like ""Top Stories"" you don't have to use the default (tiny) font size. This is not how things used to work before...  In my case I have a small phone to begin with, so I find myself squinting a lot to make out the text, and my eyesight is not even that poor -- the app must be pretty much unusable for someone with more visual impairment.",
"My favorite feature was the article player. I'd queue up articles for the commute home and catch up on the day.  If you loved it too, don't update!  I wrote tech support about this,  asking for it back, and they unhelpfully wrote back to turn on talk back for my phone. (if you haven't tried it, it's a complete change of the phone interface aimed at the vision impaired). People with no sight issues used the player too! Not sure why such a stand out feature was removed... The opposite of an upgrade.",
They dropped night mode and replaced it with twilight mode. Night mode was white text on black background. Twilight mode is a contrast setting that turns the display from atrociously bright to mud. I don't know why anyone with eyeballs would prefer to read black text on white background when it is so much more pleasant to read white text on black background. This is a big issue for me. I will be canceling my nytimes subscription.,
What are the Google Editors thinking!! AWARDING THIS MESS...must have involved a big big payoff. Lastest updates will not allow comments or recommendations on comments on androids ...it still costs the same but iphones only get to comment. Try The Guardian. ..its free and fully functional,
"No more night-mode, font size flexibility reduced...you've just tremendously reduced my enjoyment of your news service by altering the things which made my time spent reading the NYT via app a pleasure. Make it right folks, the less I use you the less motivation I have to pay for your service. Who in their right mind thought the graying-out the view as the twilight mode does would be helpful, I can't read what I can't see.",
"FAR too many 'breaking news' alerts in the new app update. While subjective, a lot of these updates are definitely not considered breaking news.  I am disabling the feature entirely because these alerts are no longer informative; they are simply annoying at this point.  Seems like a funny coincidence that an increase in 'breaking news' alerts (presumably to drive readers into the app) also coincided w/ an increase in in-app ads.  It is such a shame to see the NYTimes app user-experience degrade so far in such a short period of time.",
"I've been a loyal reader for many years. The new app in some ways is better than the old app, but it's now missing the ability to give & see ""thumbs up"". Is this a voter suppression strategy? The people will rise up! The comments sections are more entertaining than the articles half the time, so please bring back the thumbs up.",
"Removed: night mode, readable font sizes, search.  All important features, just removed because team doesn't know how to roll out updates. Stop using the excuse that you couldn't include all features in initial rollout. If you don't know how to roll out an update without removing essential features, you're simply incompetent. Look at the recent ratings and get a clue! You should have kept it in beta until you could roll it out with the ESSENTIAL features included. We don't need bullshit excuses.",
I can't understand how they can 'update' this and remove really good features. The ability to set white text on a black background was one of those features that is gone. Who are you guys talking to about what to do to improve the app? PLEASE revert to the previous version until the missing features are added back. Terrible update.,
"The list widget no longer offers an option for how often to refresh, and it only refreshes once per day on its own. You seem to have to launch the full app and then wait for the widget to catch up to get it to update, negating the whole point of the widget. The widget also no longer has images -- why? This is a huge step backwards from what was a perfectly functional app. There was a massive failure to test the application before release.",
"Please bring back night mode!! It was so helpful to have the black background with white text. I always felt sorry for my friends with iPhones who didn't have that feature. It allowed me to read articles before bed (using my own screen dimming apps). I can adjust to all the other changes, but please include night mode again!",
"I understand the need to update the base code after 5 years, but it's greatly disappointing to see so many important features missing from the first release of the April Ver.5 update. There is no search capabilities  (at all!), no ability to post comments or see comment replies, no ability to see the number of ""thumbs up"" on comments, and no inverse background mode for easy night reading. These are all basic features removed. I'll be using the mobile website. If the app doesn't improve I'll just cancel.",
"I like the layout, except for the extra clicks to get between sections not on the customized shortcut bar.  I would also like to be able to add more sections to the bar, and to have the ability to sort the items. The Food section still completely fails to load, as do (frequently) the images associated with section advertising. The hangs and crashes that plagued the app a few days ago are now rare...",
"On almost every page there is an ad bar at the bottom. After paying a subscription, I feel this is inappropriate. Good quality ads within articles are (barely) a better solution. None at all would be my basic expectation.",
The update said readers with subscriptions to the Times could have unlimited access. The app told me I had read my 10 free articles & asked for subscribers to log in. It does not recognize my account. Guess I will have to go back to the browser. Upgrade fail.,
"I know the description says that there are two new widgets, but I can't see any.  Maybe this is because my Galaxy S4 doesn't have the most up-to-date OS, but I can't help that, that's tmobiles fault.  Please make these widgets functional again",
"Please bring back black screen/white text. When the grey screen is dark enough, I can no longer see the text (nor any photos). Also, where is the search feature? Some changes are very nice, but I do not read at night now, which was my primary use time. I miss reading it. Disappointed.",
"Most of the time, tapping an article in the widget just opens the top stories page without finding the article I tapped. This has been a persistent problem for a year or more. How hard is it to get this right? Furthermore, a recent update increased the minimum size of the article headline widget (not just the photo widget) to 4x3 from 4x2 for no apparent reason, which forced me to rearrange my home screen.",
"I am a subscriber. The removal of night mode was a terrible idea. Twilight mode is fairly useless. Fortunately, I was able to download an older version (4.1) and have turned off auto update",
"It's slow. Sometimes it crashes. I can deal with these issues to a degree, but what tops me off is that you can't copy from the articles, for example when sharing an article on say, a little website called Facebook, I can't share from the app if I'd like to copy some of the articles text. Have to go to the website on chrome. I'm trying to SHARE the article and it handcuffs you! Very silly indeed. *still can't copy text from the app and since latest update the comments section has been dumbed down...No good.",
"It was a great app. The night mode was so easy on my eyes that I could read longer than other news apps.  It was replaced by twilight mode, which just dims the screen and makes it harder to read? I can do that myself with device settings very easily. To invert the black and white without messing up photos is hard for me to do.  What a dumb change lost two stars over this. Never take away features... Only add. Duh.",
Headline font size is way to small and there is no setting to allow us to change it. Please fix that asap. This app I'd unusable for me in the current state,
"For the past couple of months app keeps on freezing, crashing, going back to front page, getting system messages ""wait or close app"" This is getting too much. Please fix NOW",
I can no longer see the replies to comments the way I used to. It's hard to follow conversations. I'm just annoyed and disappointed.,
"Black themes is gone and the twilight mode is a joke. New layout for Top Stories is not am improvement, please go back.  Likely will not use this until another update is released in the hope that it is fixed.",
"Update:  My original rating was 5 stars. Then I downloaded the latest update. It's terrible. It doesn't even update its stories! Clicking the ""review"" icon does nothing. Also, it's not possible to open the app itself. One *must* select a story. Clicking the app frame does nothing.",
"I'm surprised the Times didn't wait. While there is some new visual appeal, there are a few things that have made this worse than the previous version: 1. There is no reason for the top navigation bar. It eats up space and duplicates the side bar; 2. No search! That alone should have put this release on pause; 3. Comments? It's a guilty pleasure, but I enjoy reading them. First rule for doctors and web revisions: First, do no harm.",
NYT app working great until today. Google has now converted it to an Android,
"Your new app has impaired the ease at which I had previously read your excellent content -- to the point where I now prefer reading the computer, and have almost all but given up trying to read on my android phone.  One, the widget is huge and unresponsive -- why did you take away the smaller, more nimble widget?  Secondly, the new headline font size is minuscule.  Yes, I can adjust the size of an article once I am already reading it -- but why must I ruin my eyes before that?  Also, let's be clear -- I'm in my mid-30s.  I doubt anyone younger than me will have the patience for the widget, or anyone older than me will have sharper eyesight for your tiny font.",
"The new update to this app has been annoying. I miss the white text and and ability to vote on comments. I don't like the new layout of sections.  Bring back the old version, which was fantastic!",
I don't understand why the ability to search would be removed . Shouldn't an update be to better our subscription. I'm not happy. I went crazy looking to see how I can search articles,
"Updated app has no search function ; it doesn't display content it deems unimportant. For instance, Art in Review is not visible at all.",
"All my complaints (performance, difficulty of changing text size, and more) seem to have been addressed, and there are a bunch of other improvements I hadn't thought of.",
"The New York Times has the highest quality news coverage available anywhere!  Only the Wall Street Journal comes close. The writing in the Times is the most captivating, and this app brings that to my smartphone!",
They eliminated night mode (twilight mode is a poor excuse for a screen dimmer) and reading aloud capability from the app. Please rerelease the previous version until these issues have been addressed.,
Updated app offers very limited options to increase font size.   Text to voice is gone.  This is an expensive monthly subscription. And now this update makes the app extremely difficult to use.,
The update is a disaster. Offline reading doesn't work so it won't work on the subway. Crashes every other article.,
And share button is not standard. Widget is useless. This version is a step back,
the dim version strains the eyes. I read 80% of this newspaper at night. need night mode back.  also the section heads keep winking down when I'm reading really annoying.  The older app was much better.,
"I pay for a monthly subscription and recently received an email stating that my subscription would newly enable me unlimited access to the NYT app as well. This email should never have been sent because I continue to be told that my app privileges only cover ten free articles per month, even after signing in with account information.",
"After the last update the widget will not refresh. When I open it I am taken to current nyt but it's annoying that I can't use the widget. Also, can't seem to locate politics section. Hopefully fixes coming soon.",
"Waste of time. Used to be able to participate in comments, now you must use the website. Essentially, why bother with the app then? Bit of advice. When you redesign an app from scratch, release it after you redesign it, not during the redesign. You've disabled all the features we all used and made the app undesirable. Deleted",
"""...weren't able to include search in the initial relaunch""  So, why is that?  An artificial internal deadline to please your management?  As everyone else is saying, why relaunch with removed valuable and compelling features?  And when you advertised the update, why did you neglect to tell unsuspecting users that you would eliminate key features in that update? I have read the NYT on night mode since that feature was first included and use Seach all the time.   I am hoping that I can find the apk for the old version somewhere on the internet.",
"OMG. I had many recipes saved in the old version...the new version erased them all. After that all the other annoying changes seem trivial. The old app was the cleanest and simplest newspaper app around. Not this one. Why clutter theo top of the screen to create a 2nd way to jump sections? Why eliminate night mode, one of the old versions great features. New app is a perfect example of change for change's sake.",
I like the tabs for each news section. And it's  not as buggy as before.,
Less customizable. No more text size option and no more black background. These are must have features,
It's hard to find good quality news these days. Especially you have no brain like fox news,
"Nice UI but I was hoping that the app will finally open when opening links from Google search, Facebook, or Twitter. It still goes automatically to the browser instead. Please do as The Guardian does and open links in the app instead of opening it in the browser.",
"20% or so of the articles that I save are ""empty"" when I click on them. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and sometimes they reappear. Very frustrating!",
"The latest update is really refreshing, very intuitive and easy to use now. A big step forward...",
"Like many apps and websites, designers here have chosen form over function. Text-to-speech has little impact on the new design. Why is it gone? And one of the replies from NYT says that they are evaluating whether it should be included?!? Shaking my head... Start getting facts about how people use the app (e. g., search function too) before ""improving"" it based on designers' hunches & inadequate qualitative research.",
"New version eliminates Night Mode, which I used exclusively.  Maybe just as well.  Was spending too much time reading the Times. Now I'm considering canceling my subscription.",
"I'm their infinite wisdom, they removed the inverted night mode. That sucks!",
This app used 600MB of background data last month and 320MB already this month.  STAY AWAY from this app if you have limited data usage!,
"May '15 update: New version has removed white text mode and also dropped customizable update frequency. Boo!     This app downloads and saves content, but always needs a live connection, maybe for the ads. Can't believe I pay for content and get ads.",
It is bad enough the paper version has small font now the app does too. And it is in gray not black. Must be getting too old to read the NYT.Time to switch to the wall st journal,
"One of my favorite things about the previous version of the app is the night mode. Although I do not mind many of the changes to the layout, which makes it look a little less barebones, I can't live without my night mode.",
Black background with white lettering on the previous version was a better nighttime option. I have the option to dim the screen and would adjust my phone accordingly. Please bring back the older nighttime format.,
"My problm solved. We all have different needs. It's not easy trying to please everyone, I know. Keep it up. Thnks again :)",
"Removing Text-to-Speech was a huge mistake, your on-the-go readers suffering the most.  White text/black background night mode rocked too, but not as critical.",
"Did the latest update remove the search function?  That's obnoxious. The only two positives of the movie platform were crosswords & searching. While you're ruining a perfectly fine UX and function of the app, why not get rid of the ""save for later"" that's too geared towards mobile readers. The only update this app needs is backlighting, that's it.",
"You all changed the widgets that we can choose from or something, the widget that I once had is no longer and with the widget options provided they don't fit my old screen so I have to add a page just NY times widget 😔",
"The new ""twilight mode"" dimmer leaves my phone far too bright at night before I go to bed. if i dim it as much as i want, i cant read it. This is after I double down with a screen dimming app called twighlight.",
10 free articles a month? Are you kidding me. All the news that you have can be read for free on apps as good or better than yours.,
"I just updated this app and now not only does the widget take up nearly the entire screen, which I don't like. It doesn't show thumbnail pictures with stories nor does it ever update. It just shows the same headlines even when I hit refresh.",
"You cannot scale the text on the front page. You can scale the text in frontpage linked articles, you can now remain in the app when you click links in the app other articles, but you can't resize the text on those linked articles. unbelievably apathetic to the needs of the vision impaired",
Prejudice 🇺🇸,
The new version crash when launched.,
"Seems much improved, most of the issues I had have been addressed.",
"This is a great app if you only read it with the lights on. Please bring back the nighttime mode. Twilight mode doesn't work at night, and is too dim  for the day!",
Disappointed NYTimes eliminated ability to adjust font size.,
Twilight mode is simply a redundant brightness setting. Night mode was perfect for OLED screens - the screens of the future.,
"Lost various functionality such as night mode, which I used to keep battery life. Some articles don't load.  I use the browser window instead.",
Last two updates: the app crashes all the time. Nearly unusable.,
New ones seem intended for phone.  Lost are the beautiful ones for my tablet. Gone is my ability to scroll through most emailed +pics.  Bring back the old in addition?  NYT wouldn't be the first to offer more than two.,
No night mode with White text on black.  Lack of complete offline viewing.  Addition interface providing eye candy without true additional functionality.  Sad steps in wrong direction,
April 2015 update - pros: links to articles in app instead of browser. Cons: way way too much white space for mobile. Compact layout please!,
Annoyed that it evidently lacks the clout or competence to address such obvious defects as search and comment.  Really.  Were you ever personally users?,
No way to expand or read any article,
"I liked the version before , it had better widgets  than the two ones left.",
The new app without night mode and search function is awful. Can I get the old one back ?,
"Design is great, but please bring back the best feature, night mode. White background apps are really hard on the eyes (and battery life).",
This is very important when reading left wing drivel.,
Some updates are nice and smooth but night mode is the only feature I care about.,
Please remove Twilight Mode. Stealing the screen brightness control from the phone is inconvenient and annoying.,
The loss of TTS makes me sad. Otherwise a great app!,
"Why do I continue to get ads down the page, even if I have a subscition of over 30€ active (all digital subscription done with Google Play)? Really really annoying! !",
"Old and balding, getting fat!",
"As soon as the app opens, it crashes. Older version worked fine, but this upgrade is a problem. Is this happening to others?",
Twilight mode is awful. Night mode was simple and perfect.,
I have a subscription. I can access the content on the web and via the app on my cell. Yet when I use this app on my tablet and I am signed in it still wants me to pay. Seriously? I just go to the mobile website,
"App itself is very good, however the World news coverage priority sequence is not as good such as the Yemen conflict is way at the lowest portion of the news as if it is not of any importance.",
"I wish I could delete this app, it means nothing to me",
Still a good app but they removed my favorite feature (night mode),
"I've been using the iOS version for a few months. I was about to switch back to the android version specifically to have access to night mode -- only to find that it had been removed a few days before! Please bring it back. Night mode really is the ""killer app"" of this app. (Well, that and Paul Krugman.)",
It doesn't seem right that NY Times does not warn you that they have removed the tts function in the app update. Shameful and not honest.,
Never seems to work in the subway. Should at least cache recent articles.,
WHY no night mode???  This should definitely NOT have been removed from the app - VERY unhappy!!  Long time home delivery subscriber who reads on phone in bed.  GIVE ME BACK MY NIGHT MODE!,
"Much improved over the last two years since I gave NYT a 2-star review. The UI is much better, background data use is now configurable to be wifi-only (so you have an updated copy to take with you on the subway in the morning, but don't get socked with data charges while out during the day), sections to cache and access easily are now customizable, blogs are more easily available, and generally snappier AND prettier. Overall now among the best news app UIs I've seen.",
"This time, they took away the ability to fine-tune font size, so the text is always too big or too small. Are they trying to make this as unusable as possible?",
Pop-up ads make this app worthless.,
"Latest update removes night mode, scalable fonts and search.",
Easy to read and to navigate on Samsung Galaxy Note 4.,
"Why did you get rid of night mode?  And what's the point of subscribing If you still throw in ads on the app? Sure you read more articles, but some us sub to get rid of ads.",
Version 5.0 is terrible. bring back version 4,
"What happened to night mode (the option for light text on a dark background)? Twilight mode is basically an unnecessary in-app screen dimmer, useless at its lowest setting and redundant since my phone already has a screen dimmer.",
"I live for the nytimes each morning but this new version is a bust. Why can't I read the whole paper offline? Why, oh why, do you not include an option to read ""today's paper"". I do no want constantly updating versions.",
Love it. Read it every morning on my way to work.,
Widget is broken in android 5.1 nexus 5,
I read before going to sleep. Night mode was terrific for that. Twilight is not a good substitute.,
Why would the NYT remove the  audio playback option?  Now I can't enjoy while driving or working. Time to uninstall.,
"Why change the widget? Now that you made it larger, it won't fit on my screen where it used to. Please either make it customizable so it can or revert back",
How could you eliminate night mode. Every book reader in existence has it and so did you. Why eliminate it? Makes no sense at all.,
"Slow, and bad scrolling.",
"WHY did the NYT eliminate the tool for reader commenting? Also, like the old app, font size can't be adjusted. On balance, this ""upgrade"" is a big step backward.",
No search function. Disappointed,
Why are there ads on the app now?  I pay for a subscription! The adds are so distracting.  Seriously thinking of cancelling.,
"This app is amazing, and it just got better!",
Latest update is a huge improvement! So much faster,
Most comprehensive newspaper in the morning.,
Bloatware... and I am not American,
"It was a terrific feature, better for the eyes and used less battery. Why lose it?",
Bring back night mode.,
Please bring back the white text on a black background.,
"How do I search for an article in the new interface? Even if it's available, the fact I can't figure it out is ridiculous.",
"Terrible redesign...if it ain't broke, don't fix it!  Night mode was so much easier on the eyes. Bring it BACK ASAP!",
Convenient to read stories on the go.,
Weather's,
Quality news publication.,
You can't get rid of them!,
Bring back night mode!,
Why did you get rid of the option to view things in white on black mode?,
Only 4x3 widgets that aren't customizable at all? Why...,
Love the redesign.,
I use it a lot. Thanks!,
Twilight mode is a poor substitute - please bring night mode back!,
uknow iam still lookin whath is this,
New update is missing features,
...and suddenly night reading mode no longer works. Buggy much?,
Why did you get rid of the small widget??? Can't use the big one!!! No font size choices???,
Pretty good!,
unwanted software,
Nothing,
What happened to the white type on black background option? This is the way I had it set permanently,
Fine!.,
The latest update removed several key settings like switching to a dark background and choosing to update the news listed manually.,
Did you really get rid of night mode?,
No night mode anymore,
"I picked a new york times every time, cos I have my head in the sand",
Buggy and where is the search feature?,
Great,
What happened to the 4x4 android widget? It seems you separated photos from latest stories.  Can you bring back the one interface?,
Helpful,
Why can I only adjust the font while in the article? What about the headlines? They're much too small. I could use the desktop version instead. Why was the nightmode discontinued?,
Ok,
"This app worked for awhile, but when I updated my paid subscription, it stopped allowing me to view more than 10 articles. I now read the NY Times from the newspaper's website and not the app. I sent a note to the developer,  but the problem was not resolved.",
"I updated the app in late March, and the app that had been fine disappeared from 'home page'. After I moved it back, night mode (dark screen w/light text) is gone. Can't use this app anymore, must revert to website. Wish I could undo the update. Maybe I can?",
Love the NYT app!,
"I love the NYTimes and I used to like the app, but with the latest update it has become highly unstable. It's impossible to read an article without it crashing repeatedly. The app is now entirely unusable. I can only hope this will be fixed in a future update.",
"Edit: Well, it seems like the developers of the app have learned that the update was not very well received. However, I would also like to add another problem I have with the app which I forgot at the time of the original post. My BIGGEST problem is that I like to read the news during my morning and midday commute, but I am unable to access a majority of the sections that I normally would have read as I am not able to get internet access in the Subway. This is a really annoying problem for me as I like to read the other sections more than the default ones (more news the better right?).",
This latest updates has prevented me from reading sections offline that are not on the top row such as New York Section. Imagine that I can't open the New York section in the NYC subways. What a disaster.,
No more search. No more night mode. No more offline mode. Failure.,
I like the new design (but the app kept crashing... This was improved with a later release).,
It still isn't showing my saved items.,
Can have a better design of app icon.,
The redesign lacks night mode. Basically 90 percent of my NYTimes reading is in bed. Pleeeease bring back the night mode!,
What did you do with the Search function?,
"I liked the new design of the app well enough. Swiping among all the main sections was fine. But I decided that wasn't enough for me to give up night mode format and the old widget, which I really liked on one of my tablet home screens. So I uninstalled v5.0.0 and reinstalled v4.1.1. I'll wait till the app has a widget like the old one before upgrading.",
UPDATE: 2-25-15 uninstall and reinstall app works. Now i have widget and i like widget. ONE STAR + for that.  I think you guys shuold have varius widgets for your readers. Also main app needs biger picture for each article. APP like this looks like one of thousend same apps. Keep up good work and i will rate you higher and if i like app i will become paid subscriber. Thx..,
"Not a fan of the new update. The typeface is too big and I'm not a fan of the scrolling bar on top - also very large. I like being able to see more stories at once when I open the app, because as of now, I see three. This just feels like any news app... Nothing special.",
"Jury still out... but when reading op-eds, the comments pop up in a small window on the right and the font is very small and there's no font size choice. Why relegate comments to this small area? Comments are often just as interesting as the article, please give them more space.",
"No night mode, can't scan as easily through articles, and some serious battery drain. Fix it NYTimes. I pay for access to this and the app is horrendous now.",
When I try to subscribe the app keeps crashing I mean I'm not losing money here they are otherwise smooth performance please fix this,
I greatly miss the ability to scan through headlines on the widget.  The update gets rid of this and replaces it with a pretty picture. Please return the ability to display and customize headlines.,
"Night mode has to be at the top of the list to bring back. Asking someone to install a screen dimming application is not acceptable. This is my goto news source by far, keep up the good work.",
"But how can I get the widget only show a specific section. For example I only want it to show the ""Movies"" section. I had it before but since the update I can't seem to figure it out.",
"Swiping between sections from the main screen is awesome, and new text/graphics/photo look is sweet.",
The redesign makes it impossible to read my favorite sections offline. There is no way to reorder the sections. I can't read the NY section on the subway! What were they thinking?,
Font is harder to read and there's NO night mode on this latest update,
Why would I ever want to see photos? And only one headline at a time? Terrible update. Uninstalled.,
Where did go?  Bring it back without need to dive into the settings to enable it.   Also how much is it not to see any ads??,
Great in all ways!!!,
What the hell happened to the dark night mode?! That was the best feature!,
where did it go???? that was how I was previously able to read nyt at night in bed... bring back night mode asap.,
"I used to read NYT headlines on Pulse. I added the app to my Google Nexus 7 2012,  linked to my paid subscription, which really makes a difference. Yet it seems to be the culprit in slowing down my phone and draining its battery. Impossible to turn it off, impossible to regulate how often it communicates with the NYTimes website and pulls stuff down. I have to uninstall it--or buy a new tablet. Crazy choice.",
"This app has been greatly improved over the years as to stability and functionality. But it still lacks a string search in the reading pane. For instance, in long articles, when a name previously mentioned comes up again, it would be useful to use a search within the article to remind us of who that person is.",
"Cannot use the app when my phone doesn't have service, even after successfully pre-loading the articles. I read news on the subway and cannot use the app underground. It used to work great before, but not anymore. As a paying customer, I feel that its not worth the subscription price if not fixed in nearest future. 5 stars when works.",
Changed my $10 digital to $13 Amazon's Kindle subscription then linked the two.  That's when I lost my NY Times Android app access.  Just not right.  WEB still works.  Update- I had already called customer service.  They told me it was an Amazon issue.  I talked to Amazon and they said its a NYT issue.  I sent an email.  Just don't see why I don't have all forms of digital media platform agnostic  when I pay!,
"Sometimes it takes many seconds to react to clicks. When it finally does, you may have, in desperation, already moved on to a different article, but it suddenly opens the previous one. Unacceptable. It suffers from the biggest UI faux pas of all: no feedback that anything at all is going on. And then, even on a fast internet connection, it takes for ever for images to load. I feel like it has gotten much worse recently.",
"+Great reading experience, love the night mode on AMOLED and IPS +Great syncing, easy on data usage while roaming. +Save stuff for later, share it. +Useful search  -Glitchy Read Aloud: No way to clear playlist, constantly resets, doesn't work consistently",
"I'm an active subscriber and the app for iPad works well. For my Samsung note 4, the Android app prevents me from logging in. Before my trial ran out, I also noticed that articles had issues displaying (i.e. blank page, until refreshed again).",
"This is amazing app. I am great fan of NY  Times. Even Though being from NEPAL, the first thing I look is NY TIMES.. but 10 articles per month is too less for free version. Too mean of NY Times. 10 articles per day was great.",
"This app used to be very good.   Read the contents of the box.   Users should NEVER have to go through stuff like this,  especially when they are paying good money for subscription access.  The idiots responsible for this debacle should be fired.  FIX THIS.  PRONTO!",
"Love the app (I am a subscriber), but the fact that you can't paste in the username and password is a real pain! I use LastPass and have unique complex passwords for every account. Pretty much every app out there at a minimum allows you to paste in login info (the better ones allow for interaction with the LastPass app so that credentials are automatically filled in). Please fix ASAP!",
"I've had problems with the payment system....  Another edit: I will try calling customer service when I have time, but I dread the cancel/resubscribe process which last time left me with perpetual reminders to resubscribe to the earlier cancellation. Also noted: stupid $. 99 intro fee that triggers bank fraud alert.  NYT solution: call bank & tell them to OK the charge!",
"Scrolling is not smooth on Galaxy Tab S 10.5, it is jerky and uneven. Other apps work well,  this one app does not work smoothly on the Samsung tablet. Please take a look!           Tried to find a list of Linda Greenhouse articles on android,  could not do it,  ended up on the Web site.  Please add a columnist list and better search.  Thanks!",
"I have a digital pass through my CUNY email. It says that access through Android powered devices (I'm using an asus MeMO) is supported through this pass, but I can't read anymore articles now that the initial 14 day trial period is over. A popup informs me that I should subscribe. Reading via a web browser seems to be working fine, but I'd much rather the app.",
"AMOLED screen phones' battery will be hammered by this update (all Samsung flagship, nexus 6). Twilight mode is simply a joke. I have reloaded old version from apk file on my other device, and will have to stop upgrading from now on. If you remove access of my old version to the content, I will then have to cancel my subscription. Do not pretend your mobile website is a valid option, as it cannot be read offline.  Please be sure to list the function that you are removing in patch note, its irresponsible to omit such major item in your release note.",
"What kind of deal is this, ten articles per month? That is a joke because there is more than ten articles in one issue of any paper. If they think I am going to pay them to tell me about the things that are going on around me then they are sadly mistaken. I can watch TV news to hear a story rather than pay out to your bullshit app and your ten articles a month deal",
"It's a pity that the developers decided to remove the read-aloud option (and others), I don't really understand why they'd remove a well-woking feature that subscribers apparently care for...  For everybody not liking this update I recommend rolling-back to version 1.6 (I think) which runs smoothly for me, still has all features and can be found through a google search.   And also yeah, why am I still getting ads when I am paying for a subscription?",
"I love the NYT coverage so I use the app many times per day, but the sw quality is poor. Eg a bug that appeared 2 months ago and has not been fixed: 10% of the time when I click an article it goes to that page, shows the headline but does not load the text. I have to click back and repeat it to make it display. Seriously, this is a news reading program, how hard can it be to test that?",
"Even on a high performance Galaxy Tab S. Freezes for a full minute while updating content. When changing sections doesnt cache , ie when I leave section and come back to it articles have to load from scratch. Back to using Chrome. Most disappointed.",
I am so Blessed with 2 beautiful Children a Son and now a daughter couldn't do tht by myself I have a handsome HUSBAND Tht Journey will continue ...I was sick this  year 2014 but God was in control I am well now 2014 yes has been a journey and I managed to keep tht smile on my face..,
"Like the app, but regardless of sync settings it drains my battery quickly unless I force close it, and sometimes even then it seems to sneak through. Suspect the problem is ad updates... If true, this really bends my axle. I pay money to read the news, not to receive ad pitches that reduce my phone's usefulness. Result is that I use the app less often than I might, and I am considering unsubscribing. Please fix this. Galaxy Note 3.",
"I loved the previous version of this app.  In the new version, what happened to night mode, which was easier to read and used less battery power?  Why am I no longer able to see more than one article at a glance?  This new version is a big step backward.  If only there were a way to revert to the previous version, I'd do it in a heartbeat.",
"App kept losing my password, refused to log me in, yet Google Pay took money every month. Nearly impossible to contact digital subscription services, so I uninstalled and unsubscribed.",
Too many of the notifications are rather pointless. I don't want my phone buzzing at 11pm to read about a game or some foreign election.,
"Application is slow, especially loading ""most emailed"" section, where it seems to hang. Update takes long (on fast connection) and paralizes the use of the app. Also, would like dictionary access, much the same as the Nook has for the same monthly fee.",
"Installed update version 5.1.1 (in Play Store 4/29/15), and uninstalled after one hour reinstalling my previous version 4.1.1.  The removal of the night mode option, reduced functionality of the font size choices, and the omission of being able to choose what news section appears in the widget of the new version are significant steps backward. Why remove any features when launching a new version. If as NYT states that this version is a work in progress...then WHY RELEASE IT AT ALL?",
I used to really like the app and used it a lot but now they've put a full width static icon ad that wastes precious screen. I don't mind scrolling or dimissing ads.,
"The app in general is great - good typefaces, snappy browsing, and stable. But after one of the recent updates, offline browsing seems to be broken. That was a big part of the app's appeal. Additionally, in contrast to the iOS app, there's no dictionary feature, and you can't copy text. Are these function that difficult to implement? Otherwise, the app works flawlessly.",
"Has no Equal in the U.S.A. & Most likely will have none in the not so near future! Current affairs on almost all subjects, its views  are mostly spot-on..unlike Newsday,and the post where the owner tend to be very sided..instead of sighted! 10 stars for informative works! This review was not paid for in any shape or matter..but if you'd like to reimburse me for it please feel free to do so..heck this is still America & we can all dream!  ;-)",
"Great free app but cant navigate, crashes 100% of the time when i hit Android  back button",
One star cuz it doesn't get any lower than this.  Repeatedly I keep uninstalling this app. I don't know what it's doing but it keeps reinstalling itself and now has removed the option to keep me from allowing it to downloading updates.  I have no problem reading the news...but I don't want you. I don't even live in New York! Stop reinstalling yourself! Please!,
Erratic like all Android software. I wanted to avoid Apple products but after 3 months of crummy performance I am rethinking my decision about this novelty OS.,
I update at home and read w/o Wi-Fi or data on the train. Would be nice if links in articles to other nyt articles in the same issue would open in-app instead of trying to open in a browser.,
"This app has suddenly become very unstable on my Samsung Galaxy 3. It freezes frequently, is very unresponsive the rest of the time and often causes the Android system to crash.  I simply can't use it.",
Now holds your place in the article when the app is running in the background. Please add crosswords :),
This app used to work great on my samsung galaxy s2 and then it started to crash all the time.  I reinstalled the app and it's worked great ever since.  Love it. A great app when it works.,
"Why can't I comment?  Looking for a reference for a 'quote', but I can't find a way to ask.  Using Mobile not PC.  Researched it and now I know why, but it still dosen't make sense.  I want to discuss the news not simply read it.  I think that's a reasonable request, and certainly a $ making enterprise.",
You think CNN or Fox are slanted one way or another just take a look at this news paper.,
"I am not able to find the news paper where i live, so this app is helpful. The photography and stories are well written and beautiful. I also enjoy the videos. Thanks NYT'S. :)",
I went searching online and found an apk file of the previous version. Installed that to overwrite this update and I am happy again. Update should not have been rolled out half-finished.,
"If there were no paid subscriptions, I would have surely given a five-star rating. It is quite unusual for a news company to be asking it's customers for such subscriptions.",
"Although I can see I am logged into my digital subscription, it keeps prompting me to log in",
"What made me disappointed was that it asks you to subscribe to read daily news. After 10 articles per month, you can't read it further. Though, I know, these are policies of the newspaper but still there should must be some extension. Exceed it to at least 20 articles. Since, I'm a teen (below 18) and don't have a bank account to pay for subscription. So in my opinion, I didn't like it, pardon. Other than that, it is a good app overall.",
"If you love the NY Times and you have gadgets, you'll probably love this app. Great across platforms. Must have for anyone that reads the NY Times.",
"My digital subscription doesn't work from this app, so I have to use the mobile website to read more than 10 articles/month.",
I hate the fact that I cannot remove this app from mt tablet.  Android forces this junk and aamost makes me want to switch to an Ipad,
Great functionality with breaking news items sending you a notification. It really keeps you on the forefront of current events. Would have been better if links on the web would open in the app when you open them in your phone.,
"I'm still using old version. Whomever decided this was an improvement has no understanding of users needs.  No read article (TTS)? No playlist? ""We're still evaluating if TTS is right for the app""??? What about the users? If I didn't care so much about that lost functionality I would also care about the loss of dark mode. What is the improvement you're trying to achieve? You took a highly functional app and made it useless...  Please face your failure and restore the old version!!",
One star because of ads. I pay them already. I don't need to have my screen covered with ads too.,
I'm sorry. But 10 bucks is too much when I can get the same story elsewhere. Drop it to 4.99/mo and then maybe I'll consider it.,
"Many UI glitches, worst login experience ever, subscriber login not working, slow in general, links to NYTimes open in external browser, Europe section never finishes loading etc. etc.",
This is supposed to be the INTERNATIONAL Version yet there is only 4 items labelled International and all of them are US related. How about REAL International Version that shows world news not just US News.,
"After I delete all the articles I have listened to, they reappear as if I've never deleted them. I don't see any settings to automatically remove articles from the playlist once they are played. I like this read aloud feature otherwise, which is not available on my ipad.",
There are still ads to subscribe on the bottom even if you subscribe.  Pretty lame when real estate is minimal on a smart phone.,
"Ever since I switched from a Droid Razr M to the Note4, the app won't keep me logged in.  I have to keep logging in to continue reading more than 10 articles.  Love the NYTimes but the app is not as loveable.",
"I have been reading New York Times since, purchasing from news stands but now I have the digital version without hassle...",
"I do not own high-end smart phone, thus the experience with the app is a bit painful. On my phone an ad strip at the bottom remains even when subscribed.",
"The app doesn't recognize that I have an account and am signed in.  I used to think it was because I had outdated devices, but it's the same with my new Moto X and Nexus tablet.  Aaaaaargh!  Thank god for the web site.",
"This app just seems to go slower, and slower,  and slower over time.  Good thing it's the best paper in the country.",
Worked fine for years and now it stopped updating a week ago...reinstallation didn't help,
"Its generally a good app the only thing that I find annoying is when I try to save an article on my Gmail for reading later that it disappears , and to send the article to a friend it same problem,  great reading,",
"Love the content, but despite being an All Access paying customer, after i log in, I'm still unable to get rid of the log in Pop up. The app doesn't work for reading the articles, and so i have to go to the external site.   Please fix this!!!",
"It will only allow me to uninstall updates,  then it background-updates itself.  Frustrating.",
Whoever's looking for a free app shouldnt install this one cuz itsonly free for a week plus ive heard that even if u do subscribe it doesnt work very fluently.has a lot of glitches.,
It works well for the first week but now its not working.showing error and cant able to subscribe,
I don't see why we should have this foisted on us in the UK and am unable to uninstall,
The price for subscribe to get unlimited news its completely exaggerated for people from Argentina,
"Any New Yorker - or, like me, ex-New Yorker will tell you that Sundays without the 5kg version of the NYTimes is just not the same. And this, of course, is not that. But it's great to still feel connected to ""home away from home"".",
"I paid good money for a nyt subscription and my reward? Endless ads. Come on NYT,  remove all ads for paying customers. Also, this app is slower than molasses.",
I'm a subscriber. The news rocks; the search feature blows,
Thanks as a free breaking news I'm not going to buy,
"excellent source of information, though app is slow. hoping for the update asap!",
"Turn off push notifications only to still get push notifications. This kind of thing needs to stop, i shouldnt have to root my device in order to uninstall apps that i do not ever want to use",
"Not only must I pay for access, it is loaded with ads.  If the ads did not constantly launch browser windows I would not care.  Very irritating.  I pay for the service!  I should be able to read!",
I have a subscription and for some reason it still displays ADs. It previously wasnt ...if you can get this fixed then I'll re-rate to 5 stars!,
Big fail on the update. Use to update automatically now I have to do it manually and it take FOREVER. Samsung G3,
Great to be able to read articles during commute without WiFi or 3G. Very useful on plane. Great work! Thanks!,
"No longer loads when my phone loses data connectivity, like on the subway.",
Great news and very well authored articles. This app and the quirkys weird news app get my attention everyday!,
"I am a subscriber. App should work better. It still needs work. Update: I 
no longer see Comments.",
Terrific app. Comprehensive and interesting articles by top notch reporters. I subscribe to the print NYT and the app is a great adjunct.,
It's far from the excellence of the content itself. It lacks a smoother experience when browsing between articles; the images can't be zoomed; annoying pop ups throughout the app.,
"No, i do not want useless pay-to-use programs pre-installed on my tablet!",
Often won't update at all.  Gonna uninstall at this point since won't work at all.,
The NewYourk Times  lie sometimes.,
"Keep your stuff to yourself, and get out app business!! Get serious, better app and I'll think about.",
"It's free to download, and free for 1 week, and then they expect you to pay nearly $15 a week. What a joke!",
"For pity's sake, stop shoving apps at me that I don't want and can't even uninstall! If I want it I'll get it. I don't want a tablet with half the space taken up by stuff I don't use, without being given a choice!",
"Since the update, neither the app nor widget works.  Widget constantly says loading, whle the app is just a blank page... Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2, 4.4.2",
"indispensable news coverage, reviews and opinion, now with much-improved sharing, searching and saving capabilities.",
I want the ability to delete this im in the UK I dont need this and dont want it,
$ 15 a month ? Good newspaper but not worth  that much. Thanks for the free trial. Our LA Times is equally good and free..,
Th fry urn uh,
There are plenty of quality apps that I can get the news for free. This one only gives 10 per month? Uninstalled,
"Nothing to complain about in this specific app, but the windows phone and iPhone both have crossword apps. Any hope of seeing one anytime soon?",
Extremely biased. Seems as if the editorial page made it to the front page.,
"Immediately upon opening app, you are invited to a time-limited trial. I try to access an article 1 minute later, and I have to login or subscribe to read it!?!",
"I installed this app now. I feel like ,I have the world at my fingertips. luvin this app.",
"Always works, like continuous delivery; obstificate.",
I pay a premium price for this app. I won't tolerate ads much longer.,
"I can't rate you more than 3 as u let me to use this apps only for a week.why it is not free, why???",
I didn't ask for it. I don't want it.,
A great application but with a lot of bugs.      Please remove the ads @¿¿¿…     😨😖,
"Loving application, easy to read n friendly.",
"I signed up my ""free"" Samsung 12 week subscription and it just goes round and round about asking me to sign up, telling me that I'm already a subscriber and the app just pops up an alert that it stopped working. Sent in an email to NY Times support - not even an acknowledgement. Sorry but this app doesn't look like it's ready for prime time. Hope someone there finds the fix. NOTE: Update came through that fixed the problem.",
Could never login. Even after password reset. :/,
"The New York Times, daily and weekends.",
A nonsense slow app,
Usa propaganda programm,
Widget doesn't work anymore,
More bloatware that I can't uninstall,
Helpful for students..! They compare the world with their society or nation..!,
I'll pick my souces for news! Remove it! Don't push it. Or I'll go over to Apple.,
Its easy to use and obviously useful,
"This is rediculous! I keep trying to un install this garbage, I don't even live in the US! Fix this.",
Loved this app.User Interface is very good.,
the update need wait 1 min or 2min if u on ordinary connection,
Having the NYT on my tablet is great.,
"A world reference, of course !",
Well written articles worth reading.,
"This is not an app for world news.. Its all american. 90% USA news 10% non-usa news, its terrible, uninstalling it....",
"Probably has its ""journalists"" living in Egyptian prisons too?",
Thanks for all people work in this app.,
Very very sharp and accurate reporting.,
Why there is no option to sign in using Google? Bring Google login option to the app too. I'm unable to sign in to the app.,
Excellent news app.,
LIBERAL PROPAGANDA & FAKE NEWS RUNS AFOOT!!! WISE UP & EDUCATE YOURSELF!!!,
It's easy to get International news with in a fingertip,
Apostle p.e.t Rich Lively,
Its a source of news and its very informative.,
It is good to have it.,
Two stars ... two words: night mode.,

Best paper.,
nice app!,
I will love it.,
Drains battery fast.,
"Noticed the dark mode is gone, so is the manual update option. Please bring them back.",
Get this off my tablet. NOW!!,

"I just received a confirmation from the online services at the NYT that they do not offer the Education section for any android device at this time. This was the main reason we signed up for the service. When they do make education available on android, this 1-star review turns to a 5-star review.",
Platform is easy to use. Leveling up can be a bit time consuming. I love that you don't have to spend money unless YOU want to. No impossible levels where the game makes you spend money. The challenge level are equal to your level ability. Recommend downloading the game. It's like final fantasy meets skyrim.,
"Finally decided to unsubscribe due to lack of content, cost and separate expensive plans for each device. To unsubscribe you have to suffer minutes on hold with sputtering music then dumb conversation with disinterested rep paid to abuse you with further offers and a lengthy wait while you they ""update the account"". This was after promising a ""quick and easy"" process. Nobody on this earth deserves this.",
DU Battery Charger and Clean Master tell me every day of excessive data and battery use and I hardly ever use the app because of the 10 article limit. I get most of my need from other free sources. So I'll probably uninstall this app. Samsung tab 4 with kit Kat. Seems to be better on Android4.2,
"The bright,  bright colors (in the banner ads) are just too,  too much. I am a paying subscriber,  I shouldn't have to cover the bottom of my screen to avoid the distraction of day-glo ads. I also hate that text cannot be selected in articles (sometimes I want to search on a term in a story,  for more background or a definition). Back to the web page for now.",
"The app itself is not bad, but the news (if that's what you can call it) from NYT has gotten so bad that I am deleting the app. Their fact checking and research is appalling and flagrantly wrong and the apparent bias in the articles that I have been reading is more like a tabloid than a news source. So sad guys. NYT used to be my go-to news source. Utter crap now.",
"I keep uninstalling this from my tablet, but it keeps reinstalling itself. I have even tried disabling it in the Application manager, but no it wants to come back.  It then keeps Spamming notifications, and demanding money to read its nonsense. If I wanted a News app on my tablet, I would have a proper British paper, not this stupid NY rubbish.",
"I can't believe that NYT can't manage a glitch free log in. Though I pay every month for my online subscription, yet it never recognizes that I am already logged into the app!  It then asks for my log in, which I give again and again.  I will be reading news elsewhere because of this awful experience.",
I pay a monthly subscription. It is super lame that there are still ads in this app.  They constantly open by accident when I am swiping up on the articles. Other than that it works fine. Automatic night/day mode would be nice and easy to implement. Every morning I go and turn off the night mode and every night I am blinded for a couple of seconds before I can switch to the night mode.,
"When I have more than one article on my playlist, it randomly plays sentences from other articles in the middle of the one I'm listening to. It also often reads the title of the wrong article. I think I've only had these problems since last update. Annoying.",
"I would have given it 5 stars if I would have been basing this review on the quality of the app and news provided. But I'm giving it 1 star because it's a BS 'free trial' version that restricts you to 10 articles a MONTH (ridiculous) . I'll go to another provider where I can get precisely the same need for free, any time I want. 1 star booooooooo",
"Slow response to menu input...I often wonder if the app has frozen.  It never has.  It just takes 2 or 3 seconds to realize input.  Also, updating content wouldn't take so long if I could disable sections of the paper like I can in the iOS version.  Reading the times on the subway is half the reason I got an android tablet.  I'm pretty disappointed and looking forward to updates.  They get two stars for working at all and providing up to date content.  The google newspaper and magazine portal to the times doesn't lag but it also doesn't update content and won't on request.",
Disabling and uninstalling this app does not work! I have changed my settings so apps should not automatically install yet this one and another certain app constantly reinstall themselves! I dont use it and never will yet I cannot get rid of it! Deleting this app will not effect the running of my tabletso why it keeps reinstalling when all my settings tell it not to is beyond me and nowhere on google help does it tell you any other way to stop it! I spend more time frustrated with the running of this tablet,
"Edit: I love it now! Thanks for your answer and keep going :).                                                 Old review: I would love the old widget back. I have on main screen NYT widget and BBC news widget and yours was always better and prettier. But now? BBC is better. What a pity.        I don't mind other changes, you are just trying to make it comfortable and useful as well as fast and functional. You maybe should make a testing version - beta and keep this. If changes are satisfactory in Beta version, you can apply them into main version. Like a Chrome Beta etc.",
"So, this piece of bloatware came installed with my Galaxy tab 3. I live in europe and I am not interested in this app in the slightest bit. Getting crazy of the daily notifications I never asked for, I turned them off only to find out I'm now still receiving notifications from this app (although less often)! Please refrain from having this app pre-installed with new devices, especially the ones not sold in America. That, and fix the notifications off function. I don't need this app and I don't want to know about it, I don't care about your updates! The rating on this review will not be altered until I haven't seen anything from this bloatware for more than a year.",
"So irritating!! Don't have this problem with any other app except this and BBC horizons. I can't login without it reading everything out in a scream, no matter how low I put the volume or what I remove in terms of voice-to-text. Keeps blocking my keyboard too. Better on the net, haven't got time to be endlessly fiddling with apps to get them to work.",
"The widget freezes a lot since their last update.  This was a great app at one point.  Now disappointing.  Hopefully it gets fixed..   UPDATE: 10/8/14 widget still doesn't load.  Permenantly frozen. At this point im considering deleting the app and dropping the digital subscription.            Some advice to NYT... printed papers are going out of business, you may want to ensure your digital versions are glitch free.",
"It used to have unlimited articles over time. Then it was like 3 a day then 5 a week and now 10 a month. I get that they have to make money but I would be fine with more adds if I could read more than one article every 3 days. Since the changes, I have primarily switches to the gaurdian which is nice. But the nyt has some really really cool long research style articles that I just can't find consistently elsewhere.",
"Security is appalling, interactions with other apps nonexistent, nearly impossible to log in to account. I shouldn't have to contact support, this app has been broken since at least May of 2014. Hire some developers that know Android please.",
"I am amazed at how awful this app is on my tablet. Incredibly slugglish, articles take way to long to load if they load at all.",
"I truly don't understand why I'm forced to see ads, despite being a subscriber. Other apps have figured out how to differentiate, but The Times can't? Also, why push breaking news headlines with no article attached? Seems strange to notify everyone of ""breaking news"" with ambiguous headlines with no additional information. Links within the app to other NY Times articles insist on opening my browser rather than using the app to view the article.",
This app was installed as bloatware on my 12 inch tablet and now it diffused like a virus on all my android devices. Uninstalling is not possible. I hate this app like toothache.,
"In the bill of rights we have the 1st amendment which allows for freedom of the press.  However, some feel that reporters have gone too far in invading in government policies.  Should the press be more invasive toward the government so that the people of this country know everything that's going on or should the press more shrewd in dealing with governmental news?",
"Not a bad app, but not worth the subscription price.....in my opinion.  Over time the ""no thank you"" button, on the subscription offer pop-up window becomes disabled. Since I can only view headlines at this time, 2 stars uninstall.",
"Used this happily for years (I.e., spent hundreds on subscription).  Then they put ads onto paid subscribers' screens.  The app periodically goes rogue and, while the phone is off, consumes entire battery in about 2 hours.  Too bad the programmers' skills don't match the company's avarice.",
"Whenever it is updating, my phone becomes sluggish. Other software to inspect this issue points to this app as the culprit.",
"It likes to crash almost everytime I hit Submit after bothering to write a comment. It's like the app screens me out!  Also, why the heck are there ads in the paid version of the app? Really bad idea and gives me a good reason to stop subscribing, which I might very well have to do since it crashes this often.",
What is with all the insane permissions? You are a NEWS AP! Provide the news without taking every piece of info from our phones. Uninstalled. EDIT AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE: So tell us why you need to be able to modify or delete our SD card files? Or why you need to 'test access to our protected storage? Or why you need to read our phones status and identity? To diguise these permissions as 'an effort to make our reading experience better' is a fraud. Hold yourselves to a higher standard.,
This is on my sons tablet. It drains battery at an alarming rate using more % of the battery than the screen. I can't  remove it.,
"Update at august 2014 - visual vomit .   Visual layout is impossible. If summary has image, text layout is one or two words per line.  Wish I could disable graphics.    Would like to be able to reorder drop -down menu of categories.   I have no use for ""most emailed"" (do people still use email?), etc.",
"I'm a daily reader with this app. It easily organizes articles by section, with a great ""most emailed"" that's my go-to. Find all the Sunday features you love earlier in the week, too. Blogs are on here. Easily save your favorite pieces to refer to later. Email or text articles with ease. Also, reading comments and adding your own comment is a breeze.  For me, the pop up ads that sometimes appear at the bottom of the screen are unobtrusive. They disappear as you continue reading. Love NYT!!!",
"I was totally caught off guard when the NY Times app blocked my usage until they could force me to subscribe for 19.99 or 34.99/monthly! Considering the number of FREE apps with which to obtain accurate news reporting, it's absurd that the New York Times feels their elite status dictates that readers pay to be informed. Also annoying were 10 per day article  limits,  and clicking on links to articles but being directed to some other topic. Therefore I laid to rest the NYT app by replacing it with News360.",
The Times app is a boon companion throughout the day.,
Before the update my app worked this morning... with the new update it stopped working. I had to uninstall then reinstall.,
"Updated again and can finally login to my digital subscription. However, will not update. Not worth the trouble.",
"I am a paying customer and I have ads in my app.  Furthermore, ads are often in bright, distracting colors that contrast completely with the ""night mode"" I choose to read in.  It makes it almost impossible to read, especially at night in bed.  Ads do not go away even when I start reading the article.  For example right now I have a bright pink TMobile ad that contrasts so sharply with the b&w of the app I can barely stand to read.",
"What is with the HUGE banner ad at the bottom of my screen?  It is a phone app and between the NYT banner and banner ad, you've consumed 40% of the screen. And your separate pricing models for tablets and phones is absolutely outrageous. Why should I have to pay for a separate subscription on my phone and tablet?  I'm on my last nerve with you NYT.",
Very unfortunate to have to suffer through this horrible software they try to read this great paper. I tried twice but uninstalled it after a few days each time.,
"As a digital subscriber I thought that I'd actually be able load and read the news. Not here, won't even let me log in. Don't waste the space on you phone, seriously.",
"This is my 2nd review of this app, not sure where my first went, maybe they deleted it after I said how bl@@dy annoying it was to have an app pre-installed on my tablet that I dont want and cant seem to delete.  This is how they get their so many million downloads, probably got contract with Samsung. Either way,  im based in uk and not interested in this. Take it off!!!!",
"With the most recent update, content is very slow to load and homepage constantly resizes during the process. Very annoying. :/  LG G2",
"It came preloaded on my device. I hate being forced into things. I prefer to choose what to install for myself. The developer responded to the bad review I gave the app, and because of that, I've changed my rating from one star, to three.",
"Just appeard on my device randomly and can not uninstall it, im Canadian so tis app is useless to me.",
"A lot of whining from crybaby cheapskates about ads. Good accurate in depth reporting by intelligent, responsible & reputable professionals costs $. Those who can't bear ads should gleefully pony up 3x more for ad-free, or STFU. Plenny ""free"" news on the wires ...but u get what u pay for. I've lived in a lot of places where a copy of the NYT was either impossible to get or $3-$12 for a 3-day old issue. This app rocks!",
"Unnecessary, predatory, bloatware.  System continually restores ""Auto-Update"" in the Samsung store apps, and program continually resurrects itself even after ""Turn Off"" is selected.  There should be a law against this behavior, and I expect better from the Times!!!",
This app is extremely annoying. It reinstalls itself after being disabled and spams notifications every day. Note 10.1 2014,
Articles don't load. This is unacceptable given that I have to pay extra for the privilege of having access to a nonfunctional app. Do yourself a favor and skip the app subscription.,
The first article that I read after opening the app is always blank.  I have to back out into the main page and reload the article before it'll open.,
"This app is constantly accessing the cpu (SGSV). Tried uninstall/reinstall, and changed settings, still drawing too much power. Will delete for now.",
"We love reading the NY Times online. It is current and covers all facets. We can access editorials, special sections; all the paper has to offer.",
"I spend half my time in this app waiting for the screen to draw. Then it redraws twice. I'll pit up with the crashes, but the slow experience is painful.",
"Hello,this app is using 46% of my battery and the worst is that its one of my android device apps.Pleas fix it!Im on android 4.4.2",
"""We're sorry but an error has occurred."" Frustrating app.  New content rarely loads.  I'm using a Google Nexus tablet.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail.  Please figure it out.",
"This is wrong. I do not want you on my device. Leave me alone please, annoy someone else like Toronto Star or something.",
"No thanks. Hate there paywall system,  and while they promoted this app as free,  the app is free,  but the utility expires in a week. Uninstalling.",
"Great app. I only wish I could 'like,' not necessarily share, on Facebook. Maybe give an option to view an article on the mobile website so this can happen? Mobile site is top notch reading experience too, BTW.",
"Even after turning off notifications, I still get them.",
Every time you click on a news item it hounds you to subscribe. If you don't it gives you a blank page.,
The widget keeps deleting itself and the option for it doesn't appear unless I uninstall and reinstall.,
"The content is great. That's why I pay. The app, on my HTC one at least, is very laggy, does not work well offline even if articles are synced, deals poorly with intermittent service (metro?), and will sometimes not load or respond at all. This is consistent over the last year or so, with multiple wipes, reinstall, and updates. This app needs help.",
"As far as I can see this app is force installed and perpetuated by Samsung! They should realise that many non-Americans (most of the World) are just not interested in such uninformed bias reporting. Much more balanced reporting is available for free from the likes of the BBC. Samsung please allow your users to uninstall this app , but I suppose it might be part of your deal with the NYT not to allow this!",
Too slow to be a paid service. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars. Google news is way faster and smoother.,
"Filled with ads and bullshit, the app automatically signed off when not in use - had to manually sign back in, everytime. Not worth the pay.",
"All else those who share their  believes in a negative. Way, why to, fools",
I have a subscription with new york times and yet I can't seem to be able to login from the mobile app,
It is one of those apps which come with excellent attractive time widget.with news apps what u need is a ready go through with relevant and attractive pics and this app suits the bill perfectly.,
App does not include any uninstall feature. If you do install it (even just to try it) and wish to remove later the app is stuck on your device. Eats up 8 mb of system storage I'd rather use for other files. Very amateurish.,
Pictures frequently do not load at all. Digital subscriptions are still ridiculously overpriced.,
"Crapy app.  Don't like, don't want, but will not go away.  An app at its worse.",
I uninstall it and it reinstall itself. So annoying.,
The android version still doesn't have Times premier and some other feqtures that the mac apps have.  It would be nice if it coyld be more like the iphone NYTIMES app.,
"Easy to set up and read articles.  Ads show up despite subscription and take up too much space. Most importantly, missing a dictionary to look up some words or ability to select text.",
Why would anyone  pay you outrageous subscription  rates for news anyone can already get for free...what's better than free for what should be free ..,
Unresponsive.  The mobile site works much better.  Waste of space.,
"Subscription charges your credit card monthly, but there is zero information on the app or the website about how to cancel your subscription. As a lifelong reader of the NY Times, I'm disappointed the company would engage in this kind of spammy, unethical practice in their digital products.",
"Loads quickly, looks good, works great for offline. Occasionally hangs or has other small glitches, but generally works well.",
"Occasionally headers (specific columns, sections, or blogs) seem to disappear from the side bar only to load after force closing the app with this version. Not sure why, happens both on WiFi and LTE running on an S5.",
Still the best newspaper but app is average and sub rates too high in today's market.,
Love that it loads all the articles so I can read them when I'm on the subway and don't have service.,
"Worked the first few times, but now it crashes before even loading",
Very intefesting articles to read. I have always enjoyed the NY Times Sunday Magazine edition.  Very similiar to these readings.,
"Tank you new york times for unlimited access. Best on the planet, great job ervery day.",
"Being an International news service app I expected buttery smooth experience  with good UI like The Times Of India app. Poor Service!! I'm wondering how Google gave you ""Top Developer"" tag.",
"I understand the need to make money, but I can't justify the cost when there are so many other free news sources.",
"Love the newspaper, content and presentation, when and if the app is working. Every few days, however, it crashes completely at every attempt to browse between topics. Most annoying.  Fix that and it is a five star app.",
Latest update has been overheating my phone and draining my battery. Please fix!!,
Unwanted and unable to permanently remove from my Galaxy Tab! Each time I uninstall it reinstalls itself! I am NOT interested in the NY Times and I do NOT want this bloody app!,
"The team is responsive to user feedback. Although they did take their time, a highlighted issue was eventually fixed. The new version makes the user experience even more pleasant! Surely worth investing in a paid subscription. :)",
Unable to delete from my tablet. VERY ANNOYING!,
The latest version includes ads that have mistakenly triggered about 10 times today. Fix this broken garbage.,
"Bloatware, can't uninstall, a reason to avoid Samsung products in future",
Hate that it is impossible to remove this app from my tablet. Get off my device.,
"I don't use this app nearly as much as I should (especially since I'm paying for it) probably because every time I start reading an article and can't finish it all at once, it has ::poof:: disappeared when I come back to the app.",
No good. Fails to recognize my login as a paid subscriber.,
I keep uninstalling it and disabling it and the app keeps coming back STOP IT !!!!,
"Apparently someone put the wrong newspaper through my door. I returned said newspaper but they have persisted in pushing it through my letterbox. Newspapers have a political agenda, I have the right not to have that forced on me against my will.   NYT indeed !!!",
"Journalism is biased and not one is void of that. However,  NYT is a great paper that does work par excellence to get the best news to you and let's you be the final day about what you've learned.",
"would be nice to have a bit more unpaid content. the app itself is sleek and smooth, well developed and coded. nobody beats nyt! three stars, but only because I would appreciate a greater share of free content.",
"Really,  in order to read an article on my phone,  I need another subscription for the phone? I already have a subscription for my tablet.  It's not like the phone version of the app is any different than the table version. Same stories. I'll cancel the tablet version and read this on Google Newsstand.  It's $5 a month cheaper.",
How can an organisation like NYT put out such a lame app?  There are some very good news apps available but unfortunately this is not one of them.,
Occasionally shows up with blank content so I have to reinstall but still worth a monthly subscription!,
I subscribed the all digital access via Google play and could not make the app recognize the subscription. So frustrated right now,
Cannot uninstall or remove.  Installs itself when apps updates.  Stupid and frustrating.,
I love the app but I'm appalled that I have to pay an additional $15 to be able to read on my phone when I have a paid digital and tablet subscription. Perhaps I ought to cancel everything and restrict myself to 10 articles a month! Horrible!,
The app helps me connect to my fav destinations news update.wht  else do I require.,
The first I do after wake up is read news!,
"Electronic  price forsure! Don,t we know were those phone  were  made  come  on people if they can sell that  dame thing for  99cent it came from China!",
Just got the update and I can no longer choose sections. Fix please!,
"The search option isn't readily available on all screens. Also, it turns out results in a random way as opposed to 'most recent' which I would think should be the default.  Also, I tried to follow the directions to 'link my phone' but my drop down menus weren't even close to what the screen said they should show.",
I don't want to pay to read.  Company should grow up.,
consume a lot of traffic data,
Just like newspapers of ye old yesteryears!,
"There's no unsubscribe button. And if you email they insist on their ""team"" talking to you.... I fell a Comcast moment coming on....",
Need more control over when and what content gets refreshed,
"This is the news I want the way I want it! Works perfectly and is well organized with a few unique features. And yes, I'm paying for it!",
I paid and signed in but it still keeps warning me that I have read x of 10 free articles this month.  Very annoying.,
"I'm pleased I can share links to social media even from within the app, but stunned that there's no copy function. How will I quote from an article? No, that won't fly, I'm returning to the browser.",
Ads for paying subscribers? Articles have disappeared while reading. Its a whole ordeal to find a story and read it with this app.,
"No Performance issues, old articles read well. Good bulletins",
"Potential to be a great app, but I can't really tell because it takes so long to load articles that I often give up.",
Do none of the developers not use password managers like 1password? What an irritating oversight that makes it hard to use unique passwords.,
"Awful bloat ware app. Think you can at least turn it off? Wrong. This thing ignores your permissions and keeps on updating itself, spamming your notification bar to read it.",
I have my subscription but I still can't use the epaper web app because of non compatibility with my device.. FIX IT! If I'm gonna have to be stick to my PC I better buy it on paper!!! ANDROID.,
"I'm uninstalling this app, because it is training me to read less. The 10 article per month limit before having to pay? Terrible.",
Why do I see ads as a payings subscriber?  Why am I not able to get all my content through my choice of RSS reader,
"Very poorly coded, Ltd. Is one big glitch",
It's an amazing implementation of them written paper!,
Greatest source of information to be found easily on the Internet .,
Not nearly as good as the Apple version.,
One of our hometown finest Nothing keeps you connected better then a quality hometown paper,
"Among major news papers, a good source of science and health news.",
Lack of national sports coverage...,
Glad to have an app on the world's most respected newspaper.,
10 free articles a month? No other news source would dare charge for these stories.,
Pre installed = 1 star.,
Much better than BBC and other  newspapers,
"2 free articles A MONTH?! Yeah...I'll just use any of the other scores and 
scores of free news apps. What a superficial joke.",
Are notices in English. I need!,
"I download the app and I open it up.  I'm super stoaked for some breaking news! What? An error occurred? It doesn't work? Okay, I'll try uninstalling and reinstalling. The same error message? I subscribed so I can read news on my mobile. But if I can't use the app, I will definitely not extend my subscription.",
Rubbish,
Have app for Note 4 and it does not recognize my digital subscription! Paying $14/month and am still limited to 10 articles/month? Please fix!!,
"Why can't I choose which apps I have on my tablet? Preload if you must, but give me an uninstall option.",
Lower the price for 99 cent per week then we can see the change .,
Whether I agree or not with thier bent I always enjoy their writing,
"Uses about 25% of my CPU (Note 3). Kills the battery in a hour. Just subscribed, now wishing I hadn't.",
Boston is way better bro. New York is weak sauce.  And Times? Come on how bout Globe bro.,
"Another POS app that I can't delete . Just go away, didn't ask for you don't want you. 0/5.",
It looks good but the articles never load. Unsubscribing.,
Almost turned my phone useless.  Stay away!!!,
Kkkkkkllkkihcvhh,
"Used this daily, just noticed it no longer works. When I item the app I see the content area but it's empty and after 20 seconds or so days, ""We're sorry, but an error occurred."" I'm running Android 4.4.4. Also, I should mention that I am (was?) a digital subscriber.",
This my second time to download it,
I love to read them.,
News is fast reliable.,
There's no option to connect account.,
Can't log in.  Can everywhere else except this app,
Unrealistic cost.,
Does not reflect a true world view,
"If I wanted this, I'd download it",
"This is cr@p as I want it gone, but it can't be uninstalled. Don't put this cr@p on my tablet,  it's using up space and data that I don't want it to. Be gone Samsung and NY TIMES.  0/5.",
That's fit to print,
This is a very informative service,
Wtf,
Buggy at times but enjoyed having it.,
because it always .....taking much time to update the news videos mainly........pls as soo as possible try to fix it,
When are they going to have a decent app that works on tablets and isn't just a small screen app blown up?,
System installed app for samsung,

Interesting news and language,
It all good,
Loved it but too much money,
Crahes,
Good way to know what happen in warld,
"What's going on? When I try to open it, it says that there's a new version and demands to download it, however there's not a new one on playstore. I've entered in a loop &gt;.&gt;",
Yet again....rhe most recent version ruined the widget! Had to uninstall and reinstall.  One time ok..but each update? Come on!,
Because I said so.,

Com'on NYT! Your subscription rates are not cheap by any standard ($14 a month)  and you still have the audacity of peppering your paying readers with ads?,
I'm paying for an all access subscription and can't even log in to the app for my phone or my tablet.,
Well developed crappy strategy / business model app.,
Why is this an andoid system ap ffs,
I will see after 8 weeks !!!,
Krugman's blog is not available now. It was previously. Please fix.,
The app allows you to read only 10articles in a month...  :-(,
"Paying subscriber for years, now they start dumping ads on me? Disappointing.",
Horrible!,
Can't copy and paste password to login,
I am a paying customer yet I have to endure the ads on the bottom of my screen? What the F?,
Really enjoy the app!,
CRAP.,
Need to know on the go?  New York Times.  Need to know more?  New York Time.,
Great application for a premier source!!!!,
Love one,
I pay to read the paper not to get bombarded by ads!,
Just Great!,
Why must I allow it to take space on my device?,
Very helpful!,
Reader's delight!,
Just dumb,
Crashes constantly when offline,

I couldn't figure out a way to access my comments. Can u make a shortcut for this? Also how can I access to yesterday's newspaper for instance?,
"Came pre-installed on my Samsung Galaxy NotePro. I live in South Africa, so this app is of no use to me. Wish I could uninstall it.",

First after redeeming your free subscription you get this email :   Thank you for redeeming your code for an 8-week digital subscription to The New York Times.  This confirms the start of your New York Times Complimentary Digital Subscription.  and then after more wasting time to try getting it work  We're sorry — the gift subscription cannot be applied to your account.  Worst promo ever i received  .... disapointed.,
"The NYT app is painfully and obnoxiously slow. In my case, it takes several minutes to load the entire top page, particularly the  photos. I'm fairly confident this is not due to my tablet or net connection because the WaPo app loads in a matter of seconds. This is a shame considering that NYT articles are more interesting. As a paying subscriber, I think I deserve better than this.",
This Android version of the NY Times works exactly as advertised & gives you a choice between the daily NYC version or the International edition. The menu is easy to navigate & the options offered comprehensive without being overwhelming or confusing. I haven't seen the Sunday edition yet & THAT will tell the story.,
"Bought a Kindle subscription, which includes tablet access. The Kindle offering is very good, but this app is very, very slow on the Nexus 7. Updating content from the server takes forever, and it then takes many seconds to load an article once it is selected from the section list. It's a real shame because it detracts so much from such wonderful content. It's just not quick enough to make skimming the news possible with this app.",
"Just about ready to give up - always freezing up - trying to load an article, trying to load a new section, etc.  Very disappointing.  They know how to print, but their technology people are not up to the task.",
"If you make agreements with Samsung to preload this app on my tablet without the option to uninstall it, then I give it a poor rating.",
I wish this app could prevent the screen from turning off.  I don't want to keep touching the screen,
"Slow and unstable.  I get ""not responding"" messages multiple times each day. Otherwise it is a well laid out screen and it is easy to navigate (when you are not waiting for it to respond.)",
"Have it with me wherever I go.  Rock solid app, just like the NY Times.",
"I think videos could be embedded in the app itself rather than being directed into a browser for watching them. Also, it's a common practice that paid customers enjoy an ad free interface. An ad is an ad, even NYtimes ads.",
Lucid 2.  Subscriber. Crashes evrytime I try and navigate to a new section.,
The app stopped recognizing me being signed in with my NYT account and won't let me read more than 10 articles. Contacted the Android support and they did nothing.,
"Sometimes the app runs amok and uses up tons of battery on my Nexus 10. Updated: Looks like it is the widget that uses lots of battery. This still needs to be fixed. The widget is great, but I had to remove.",
Excellent news with important documentaries.  I just wish it could give at least 15 articles free to read and not only 10.,
This is the most functional news app out there. The fact that you don't need an internet connection to read the stories is perfect for my morning commute on the metro.,
I pay for home delivery and instant Web Access.  However there are still advertisements which is not cool.,
Glacial loading. I can read a Post story in the wait time for opening a story. App is so bad I might subscribe to another paper!,
This is a great app and it is done only the way only the NY Times would do it.. perfectly with a flourish! Gives the day's news from the best with the best.  Enjoy...,
Don't need or want and can not unistall.,
This app is so slow on the nexus 7.,
I am an avid reader of news and this app serves its purpose well.,
Articles are well written and especially the sunday edition is worth reading it,
Just great worth the subscription !!!,
I love the in depth articles of the New York Times.,
Good app just not my type,
Market knowledge is must,
Breaking Headline News at a glance? Very cool.,
Great App to get Quality news,
Only 10 articles per month,
''Harris Kumar''. This app is plagued by hackers. Crazy.,
Couldn't ask for more. Big thanks!,
Great App. Love it,
Easy to use app,
5 stars,
Do I really need all of these ads filling my mobile screen?,
...,
WORLDWIDE- COVERAGE,
Great  app,
Excellent app,
Great,
Excellent,
needs improvement,
"This app is so bad I am not continuing my digital subscription to the Times unless it's improved, because I primarily read news on my Nexus 7. The app is extremely slow to load front pages and articles, in landscape view often won't load more than the first 3 or 4 articles on the front page, and becomes unresponsive regularly. Really disappointing.",
"Saving stories offline still the best feature. This is great for plane reading away from WiFi.  However, emailing articles should work more like the Web version so emails are sent directly from the app without having to launch a separate app that may use a different email. App is far better with an online subscription so I recommend that as well.",
"This app has become frustratingly slow.  Takes an unacceptable amount of time to display an article, even when cached.  Recently, it has become unstable, and will hang up resulting in the android 'this app is not responding' message.   Earlier versions of this app were much better, but if they don't improve the current offering, I will be canceling my digital subscription since I am simply throwing money away",
"I previously rated this app 5 stars, buy now it crashes every time I open it on my LG phone. I am a subscriber and wish to continue being so, please fix!   Update: This app still crashes every time I use it, long time NYT reader, but soon to cancel over this.  Update: even after the new update, the app crashes every time. Please fix!!",
"This app needs to be fixed.  Used to work fine on my Nexus 10 but now works only if run immediately after a system reboot.  Then, after I close it and perform a force stop on it, Clean Master reports that it is still consuming 39% of available CPU.  If it is not fixed soon, I will be forced to give up on the NY Times entirely!",
"Articles load quickly at first but get slower and slower, eventually refusing to load at all. Sometimes an article will appear for a moment, and then go blank for 10, 20 or more seconds.  Questioning whether my subscription is worth it.  Nexus 7",
Love the way it downloads things offline so I can read it in the subway. would be great if I could pre-cache the videos to watch them offline as well. Night mode is a nice feature.,
"Used to work well on nexus 7, now each page for a new sorry take forever to load.  Unhappy.",
Nexus 4 on AT&T does not work. App just shows network error. Only if I am connected via WiFi  the app updates and receive news updates. Only working with WiFi not cellular.,
Hangs (spinning wheel or blank screen) constantly. Slow to load media when it does work. Doesn't consistently update.,
"This app is killing my battery on a brand new galaxy note 10 after update, deleting for sure.",
But I just hate being asked to pay every time I turn the app on.,
"I am on a nexus 7. This app accepts my log in information, but has blocked me from reading any more articles, because it says I read 10. I pay for unlimited access! I have uninstalled/reinstalled with no change.",
"It installs itself after I uninstalled it.   i can't even take it off my list of apps. Bad samsung for giving into pressure.  Stand up and support your customers, not your pocket book!",
"this app keeps crashing, whether I'm using it or not. worse than that, *when* it crashes it closes or minimizes other apps and interrupts or loses what I was doing. I have better ways to waste my time. I have four other new apps I can use or not without such problems. here's a tip: if you're superfluous don't be a nuisance! I'm uninstalling and never reinstalling; I don't care if you *do* fix it someday. :-P lol",
Excellent app for a free user. Loads quickly. Good font and I can read people's comments. It would be nice to be able to read more than 10 articles a month.,
It has sent my Galaxy SIII into a high power consumption mode a couple of times with the battery getting hot to the touch. I haven't figured out what will set it off. Other than that no complaints,
"The current look is appealing, however I think a redesign would be appreciated. The website, the android app, and the iOS app all are designed in accordance with their respective guidelines. Having said this, I think the design team should really take a look at the new Material Design guidelines released by Google. The redesign would completely transform this app for the better.",
"I don't want your newspaper as I live in UK and give me the option to uninstall as this app is as annoying as hell and is ""adware"" which is installed programs without permission witch I don't need",
"Keep pushing on to my device. Even if I uninstall or disable it, it keep on coming back and re-installing by itself.",
"Why do I not have the option of previewing an article? Even if I open one by mistake it counts towards my 10 free monthly articles. Very bothersome. Today, on the plane, I opened three by mistake. Please fix, add a teaser!",
App works well but it is annoying that NY Times is constantly putting out new apps for the iphone and ignoring those of us on android.  The new opinion app is the most recent case in point.,
"The app does its job but sometimes feels a bit jerky. Also, the icon is low resolution and quite ugly.",
Of course the New York Times reporting is excellent. But I'm always impressed with how the crate digital content and the rear of reading it.,
They give you a short trial period then start limiting your access and asking for a subscription.  Why subscribe when a access to breaking news is free on line and tv?,
"Now stop forcing me to download on my tablet ffs I don't even live in the States, thank Christ.",
Always having to restart on my Samsung Tab 2.,
Groundbreaking news on the go! I needed to know what I didn't know.,
Bloatware that came with my tablet no matter how many times I disable and Un - install this it keeps auto reinstalling itself I have had viruses less problematic than this,
Great way to keep informed on all devices. Price is reasonable for the value. Keeps improving with each update.,
Thank you for the update. The problem has been fixed. :),
"4.0.1 won't load any news on my nexus 7 even after clearing data, uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. Inconvenient while traveling! Looking forward to an update that gets this working again.",
I submitted a bug report about losing your position in the article when you change orientation and they fixed it promptly-- awesome!!,
"I was not given a chance to cancel this subscription after the ""Free"" trial ended, so the ""free"" cost me $19.99 and my bank account was charged that AFTER I cancelled the subscription!!! What a ripoff...and of course there's no phone number or email to report such erroneous and fraudulent charges! Shame on NY Times!!!!!!",
"Why does this app need access to not just my phone serial number, but also need to be able to track both my phone number and that of whom i am speaking with?  Without reasonable explanation and safeguards, will need to uninstall",
Why is it with Samsung that they force apps on you that you do not ask for or want. You just cant refuse the apps and they clutter up your memory and space.,
Why is there no new Opinion app for android? That's absurd. I'm about to cancel my print sub for being left out.,
"Freezes often,requires rebooting, often refuses to open sections",
Many great free news app out there. Why should I subscribe and pay for it?,
"I live on the opposite side of the world to new york, why would I want this rubbish installed?",
Works fine and smooth for me using Galaxy S4,
Thanks for the 12-week free trial for owning a Note 3!,
Relly nice aap,
Its awesome! Love the layout.,
but unfotunatly  it is trail,
Very interested stories,
Not much else...,
Only ten articles per month and no selection of text possible,
Gives me the news I want and more!,
Am using an android it works,
"I don't want this crap, please let me uninstall. I don't live in America, why would I want this?",
This app is so popular awesome! !!,
Poor service app....news article read limit has gone down from being able to read 3 articles a day....down to 10 in one MONTH only.....so I can't even use this app after the first week of this past month now.... I'll get my news elsewhere......,
Works great now.,
Great!,
Awesome!,
Why would a news app need access to your media files? Do not install.,
The crossword app is already out on IOS but no Android app? When will we get it?,
"I do not want this app,I did not install it and I cant even uninstall, I really dont care whats going on 5000 miles away from where I live! Sort it out",

"As a long term NYTimes subsciber who lives in a remote place, I depend on my paid subscription to the Times.  This app is an embarrassment to the publisher.  Takes upwards of 30 seconds to open an article and frequently freezes and crashes.  Paid subscribers should get credit for their subscriptions until this app is usable.",
"I've had a Times subscription my entire life. I've also never made an internet comment, on anything, ever. The New York Times has been synonymous with reliability for as long as I can remember. Articles, pictures, headlines and everything else involved with the app rarely loads, and if it does, it takes 3-5 minutes. It's terrible.",
"Like many android apps, this one just c an't get it right. Though I have a print subscription, the app limits my access to a certain number of articles per month and gives me no opportunity to identify myself as a subscriber. I'm done with the android world when my current contract runs out.",
The controls of the app contrary to modern android news apps is not intuitive at all. The back button exits from the program immediately rather than going a step back. Clicking a short article like wedding notice drains down from the number of free articles. The news itself contains several reference links spread out in the article with no structure. I felt lost. With such an app I'd never consider a subscription.,
The issues Mr. .Crespo describes also afflict my Nexus 7. App is intensely frustrating to use. Size of fonts appears to cause formatting problems. Latest version harder to navigate (section list works inconsistently) and update (see no progress bar). Please fix these issues!,
"Long time paid subscriber here.  This app has consistently never failed to disappoint. Slow, clunky and full of bugs.  Main problems that need solving are the amount of time it takes to load an article and the ridiculous lack of smoothness.  Ads, however, work flawlessly.  For an organization painfully aware that it's future lays with digital content, this is an embarrassment.  Its the equivalent of printing your excellent publication on toilet paper.  No fixes in new release.  NYT just ignoring readers.",
I love the times. I have had a paid subscription and I would love to be able to pick up my tablet and scroll through the news over my morning coffee or spend some time with it on Sunday morning. But this app is so unbelievably slow! Sometimes it takes several minutes to load an article. My tablet times out and goes to sleep before it loads.,
"I am a long term paid subscriber of nyt, and had used android app fine for several years until 2 to 3 months ago. Because of the performance of nyt android app, I now have Washington post app on my nexus 10 and read nyt on the web instead. Pls fix it.",
"The app is ""user ignoring"", just a few: a) no indicator when article is loading, so one has no idea what's going on. b) does not support zooming with fingers. c) font changing is soooooo slooooow... In short, l'm mobile developer myself and can see low quality job. Looks like an outsourced to India job.",
This new update is terrible. I am a paying subscriber but i can't save more than half the articles because the save button isn't showing up on a lot of articles and it's not available on the drop down part either. They need to test this better before sending out updates,
"The day it was set to expire, they charged my acct $19.99.  I cancelled the app immediately, even NYTimes saw I never had paid subscription.   I had to fight Google tooth and nail to get refund.   Don't make my mistake!!",
"The content was average but still useful most times. Then the nags started (countdown of articles read this month, leading to 10 where they want you to pay for the experience) and the bugs came crawling out of the woodwork. Pages started strobing, some would not display at all and some would only show the first paragraph. It is like once the New York Times thinks they have your money, the user can go to hell. Note to NYT: pay your engineers with something more valuable than a newspaper subscription.... I am uninstalling before they want more money and break something else to get it. If a child tried tactics like this they would be taken out behind the woodshed and taught a lesson. Maybe it's time someone did that with the NYT. In any event, I am uninstalling this rubbish as soon as it is posted.",
Make sure that the software works before you release it. It is a simple concept that the kids programming today seem to have missed. I am not paying for this level of service.  Cancelling subscription now.   Please refund the balance pro rata. It has no value.,
Rel 4 still produces occasional very slow article displays on Nexus 7. Manual update function is hidden... Pull down top of app page and release.,
"I always get the error the article is unavailable when I click on an article from the widget. I update every 24 hour. This is just too frustrating, having to search for the article all the time.",
I canceled my subscription due to their poor practices for paying women less than men in equal positions. Correct this and I'll be back!,
"A far cry from the iOS NYT apps, this rendition is plagued by blank screens, molasses-speed reloading, and glitches with the Android back button. Quite a pity.",
Nothing to them is news worthy unless it is biased against anyone not liberal.,
"I can not get rid of this bl**dy app, nothing I do will work. I'm at my wits end no stars",
The NY TImes is a garbage newspaper. There is no news in it. The NY Times consists almost entirely of fascist messages.,
"I constantly have issues with the text not appearing, or taking forever to load, then disappearing again. Frustrating.",
The new version is a big step backwards. Very slow and very hard to go to another section. I want the old one back.  Samsung tablet. Android 4.1.2.,
"Nicer fonts and the side menu is useful. Articles gray out when you read them. But the back button almost never goes where you want, often dumps you out of the app altogether or takes you to a section you weren't in.",
Slow to open articles on 2013 nexus 7. There's a 10 second pause before article text and photos appear. The web version opens articles instantly.,
"I love the NYTimes. I'm a premier subscriber, but this is, hands down, the worst tablet app imaginable. Not only can you not find subsections (TV under arts etc) but comments are gone. Why bother at all with an app? Just go to the web. Good grief.",
"I kept getting an error message when I tried to open, but support got right back to me and it works fine after a simple uninstall/reinstall.",
"Organized, clear and extremely informational, this app provides users with an easy way to obtain news. Breaking news live updates help keep me on top of the news in real time. If you love NYT, you'll love this app!",
Articles are good. Cancelling is an absolute nightmare. It has taken months so far of emailing and no response from either the NYT or Google. I honestly feel their non-response is part of their plain to retain subscribers.,
"I am already subscriber, but still doesn't remember the subscription",
Was great before the latest update. Now it's ridiculously slow on the Nexus 7. Some pages don't load at all.,
"How is this still an issue? If I move my phone, and the screen rotates, i lose where i was reading and the article scrolls all the way to the top?",
Get it or I'll fart on you.,
Wow... This app sux on android. Is it as bad on iOS? You folks screwed it up with the last update. And you made me pay more for it. I bet you're using agile development... Right?,
New version has made app useless for me.,
Slow and buggy. Just a wretched app.,
The NYT has finally perfected their newspaper for the new century.,
"$15 a month to have ads at the bottom? Lol um no, unsubscribed. Love how the preview pics for this app show no ads. I'll give my money to someone else I guess.",
I'm up for to use in this,
Works fine.  great on my Note 3,
Simple and sleek. Great news presentation. Can we get the dictionary option as we have for iPad app ?,
Horrible,
I think u should get it,
I almost gave 5 start to NYT but after knew the last problems in this newspappers?? No way...,
Now I wish I didn't. How do I remove this bloatware?,
No Google + Sign In!!,
Annoying at times.,
This app  excellent,
Good.,
Internacional News.,
Outstanding,
Great,
Èxcellent..,
Ekram,
:-) :-) :-) :-) :-),
,
I never downloaded this and I can't un-install. Not happy I live in Australia so New York's news is not applicable to me. I will never use this please let me un-install,
Pressed the uninstall button and all I got was a choice between Update or Open. Not happy.,
E-junk that came in with device that I can't uninstall. Utter trash that is effectively spåm.,
"I am forced to have this app on my device. It cannot be removed, and now there's are annoying notices popping up with the latest update. Bloatware.",
This app behaves like malware; I can simply not uninstall it (no uninstall option in the play store). I don't get how Google permits an app with that kind of behavior in its playstore. Disappointed in both the NYTimes and Google.,
This crap shipped with my device and won't uninstall and keeps spamming me with notifications that seemingly can't be turned off.,
But the new York times is no longer a news outlet.  It is more a liberal opinion rag.,
A waste of space and data on my tablet need to be removed but I can't cause someone thought everyone should have it pre installed on their devices.,
"I Hate This Annoying App. I Never Liked It & Never Will. I Want To Piss 
This App Off For Good",
I never installed this app knowingly & now i am only given the optionto update or open.... not uninstall. My tab is running slow since it appeared. Furious,
"Hate that it was free for some time on my Samsung device and now it asks me to pay for a subscription, all the stories are already available online so why pay? I can't even uninstall it so it's a waste of space.",
"I never installed this app. No matter how many times I uninstall it, it 
never deletes. I don't want it. Annoying.",
"I never  wanted this app on my tablet, but it cannot be uninstalled.",
Never asked for it  dont want it no interest what so ever.,
An opinionated editorial paper often lacking in professional Journalism,
"I hate that I am not ""allowed"" to remove this app! I don't care for their reporting.",
Get this junk off my tablet,
Would love to completely remove this app!,
I don't want this app and it won't let me completely uninstall it.,
Worthless app preinstalled and can not delete,
"Cannot uninstall, news is not focused for me as i dont live in NY OR USA",
Trash bloat ware not possible to uninstall,
Please I just would like to uninstall NYTimes software,
Unable to uninstall. Would rather choose,
I'm not happy that I can't delete this,
This app sucks! And what makes it worse is I can't Uninstall it! I'm forced to have it..... bleh!!!,
I don't live in the US so i don't care for their news,
"Crashes, it seems on refresh",
"If i like this app, i wud install. But i dont and it's preintalled",
Either get it off or make it free,
Pre-installed crap I don't want.,
"Great FAKE News, if you are into that...",
Too liberal.,
Don't want it but can't uninstall or disable !!!,
Painful.,
Fake news,
Liberal rag,
you suck,
Unsubscribe me now please,
Can't uninstall it,
Bad,
Can't Uninstall,
Niceee,
Yay!,
Sucks,

"I share the other reviewers' disappointment with the Android tablet version.  I have a Nexus 7 and an iPad.  The iPad works fine.  The Android version loads a headline and can take up to 30 seconds before a page is rendered.  When scrolling down an article, it often resets, going back to the headline again.  The Android version badly needs work.",
"On my android tablet (nexus 7) there are usually a line or 2 or more of text missing in the middle and even the conclusion of the articles.   ( This is also a problem on my newer nexus 7.).  Also some blank lines.  (This seems to be getting worse.). Worst, it is hard to see the hyperlinks, which seem overly sensitive and frequently activate when I just want to scroll down.  Also, pictures very slow to load.  I have good signal strength.",
"I have a week free of NYT articles on my Nexus 7 tablet. I was really excited to pay for a subscription. Sadly it takes way too long for an article to load and most pictures don't work. Per the app reviews, many other android users have had this problem so I've definitely decided NOT to subscribe. I hope they fix this one day :(",
"I've had a subscription to NY Times digital content since 2011.  They've gone through several iterations of digital service offerings, but this one is by far the worst, though the Android app was quite good a few months ago.  In the last few months it has gotten slower and slower and finally no longer allowed me to read entire articles, even though I have a subscription.  I cleared the cache/data, uninstalled and re-installed the app, and even tried it on several different tablets with the same result: slow to no response and can't read entire articles.  It is too bad the NY Times has let this once excellent app become so unusable. I just cancelled my subscription and rely on the BBC app now for news, which is phenomenally responsive...I just hope the BBC doesn't hire the NY Times app developers!",
"This is the Android equivalent of a GeoCities homepage. Except they're charging and arm and a leg for the subscription.  Problems: its jerky, even on a premium phone. Articles don't update in the background, but rather when you open it. An article you're about to touch moves as it updates. Extremely jerky when opening articles too. Its way too easy to accidentally swipe articles when scrolling - which wouldn't be a problem if (like every other reading app) it remembered location. But it doesn't .",
"I like the app a lot overall.  There is one glaring usability issue.  The app limits you to 10 articles per month, which I think is fair, since they don't have ads.  My issue is that it is very easy to accidentally click on an article when scrolling through the list.  I use up half of the 10 on articles I don't intentionally open.  They should totally put a confirmation if it is going to count towards the monthly allotment.",
"If my phone goes into sleep  mode, when i turn the screen back on, the app jumps back to the top of the headlines page. This happens even when I'm in the middle of reading an article. If i don't read it immediately  or pause in my reading, I've lost my page. This makes me read less nyt. I'm very unlikely to continue subscription.",
"I'm glad to support the NY Times journalism, though it would be much improved with a way to personalize sections and news updates.  BUT after updating my Samsung S3 -> 4.4.2, NYT breaking news alerts start the phone playing the NYT theme on repeat, with no way to turn it off!",
"Good enough. Lacks several features that would make it amazing (and would make subscribing more worthwhile.)  Some integration of external one-button shares of some sort (e.g., Pocket) would help.   Volume-key paging would be a godsend for those one-handing train riders.",
"When you try to share an article (on Nexus 7) it gives you Bluetooth Keep and Hangouts as the initial options? Is this just me? If not, need to work on the way they are laid out...and most used.UPDATE: PAINFULLY slow to load articles on Nexus 7 2013. IOS version is a snap. Not sure why.",
"Exceptionally slow to load and articles are incomplete at that, often missing passages in the middle of the article. On occasion, article would not download at all.  Superior reporting and excellent photojournalism goes to naught as the app fails to render what you want to read.",
I hope the app's programmer occasionally tries to use it.  Endless wait trying to load possibly outdated stories.  Constant waits perhaps trying to refresh the current story. ...,
Too much emails for upgrade and restricted access to news in free version. When one can read news for free then why pay,
"Generally good, but less good than the iOS version. Right now the app is broken. It does not correctly reflow text. Stories are readable but a line is usually missing. Loading times are slow for what should be cached content.",
Totally agree with Ian. Needs confirmation to open article given limit of 10. Silly limit any with many ways around it given access to multiple devices.,
Too slow. Too lag. And always make my device hang. Developer fix this kind of issue.,
"Recent updates have left the android app painfully slow to display articles. Initial views take 30 seconds or more to appear. Thankfully, the windows phone app is still smooth and quick.",
"Looks good and performs the functions it should. Even though I've signed in with my paid account, I'm limited to tab articles per month with ads.",
"Works better than WSJ, FT and perhaps Bloomberg.  Bug free so far.",
Much improved; can now read replies to reader comments with my Galaxy S5. I appreciate the interaction this app affords. Also greatly admire the NYT's strong international coverage. CJ Chivers is the real deal.,
The app deserves 5 stars but the subscription price is to costly for me!!,
Articles won't load on my Nexus 7.,
"Considering you get 10 FREE articles/archives per month, why are there so many complaints?  If you don't care for the limits then you should SUBSCRIBE. ... GEEZE",
Hope it stays free longer.,
Whats the point of already been logged into your paid account if i still have to subscribe?,
Slow to load news stories,
This used to be a 5. Now the articles take forever to load and often reset when im halfway through.,
I love newspaper.,
Nice app!,
Superlative!,
This is the best,
Great coverage,
"I have a paid subscription, but although I can log on from my computer, I cannot log on the app with my NY Times password. What gives?",
Horrible,
Generally ok,
,
Great app but needs to be more user friendly. Search for an article is not user  friendly  . I read an article and then i was searching for it with key words  and there was no match. Love the app but hate the banner ads. I love to use it on my S5. This is probably the best app in my Samsung galaxy S5 and I use it all the time.,
"I don't have the courage to un-greenify it, since it woke up and nearly fried my tablet a few versions ago.",
"Awesome. I love the application but need some improvement such as reader can't copy n search the word using dictionary, otherwise, in totality the application interface is very simple and far ahead the other existing applications.",
Never had a problem until new version. Unusable. Running Cyanogen mod 9.xx,
"Thought this app would be ironed out by now. Search is back, that's good  news, but many articles, sections, videos, pics  take forever to load or simply won't. No leave a comment capability...LG G3",
"Don't appreciate the advertisement as part of a paid service, and the app is a bit slow. Content is best in the news world.",
"The New York Times is an indispensable information source, and this app is  dependable. My digital subscription is worth the price.",
"I love the NYT but I hate this app. It is slow, slow, slow. I swipe a page and a couple of seconds later the page responds. Maybe. Sometimes the page just locks up. It's next to worthless.",
I only pay for a digital subscription but I'm glad the app gets frequent updates,
Definitely an app to try out with all of the latest news through an amazing platform. Very minimalistic and simple to stay up to date.,
No doubt NY times is most popular in the world. This app of NY Times is also a best newspaper...,
Best app to be up to date thanx play store for providing such an imperasive oppurtunity to learn the number of things by using this app.,
It is telling me I have read certain articles which is strange bc when I open the article there is no text so what exactly am I reading besides the headlines! I think I better stick to print. Smh.,
"Its really good app, but sadly cant afford payment",
"I used google play stand before, but this has a better user interface. Great job!",
And hard to navigate. Probably because its so slow.,
I suspect many of the pro Russian comments on the situation in Ukraine are being made by Russian propagandists in an attempt to skew public opinion.  They purport to be posted from locations in the west but I am skeptical.  Is it possible for the app to display the actual location of the poster?,
Dont forgot this bcuz any news any where you want. Read it any news you wanted just there. I back,
"Not sure about rating. I signed in (accepted), but it now tells me I am looking at one of 12 free articles this month. What about my subscription?   I think I uninstalled the app when I tried it before, because it asked me to subscribe after a few weeks and gave me no opportunity to sign in.   On the other hand, it works well on my phone. This is a Samsung tab 2.",
just have one problem about data loading.,
I had to drop my rating to 1 star since now they are only giving 10 articles a month. Faux-liberal paper.,
Dean Baquet love you boss!,
Great but u should add a weather section,
I hope !I will enjoy with it !,
"Sleek design, convenient & captivating.",

"Takes forever for  the app to open, then takes forever for articles to load. Sometimes as much as a minute for an article, and this on my home wifi AND after loading the app. BBC and WaPo both have much better apps, AND are free - why am I paying for something that is practically unusable on my phone?",
Its a great network in the world. Unfortunately they don't want free service to the world moreover just free trail for 10 articles. I disappointed for their service ..for people ..,
"The only ""improvement"" this app continually makes is to increase fees and decrease free content. And to make matters worse, article load times are frustratingly slow. That said, NYT news coverage is tops. Too bad they don't make it affordable.",
Good,
Justril,
Still takes FOREVER to load articles.  Insists on loading the entire section when all I want to read is one article halfway down.  And the website never remembers my info so I have to log in almost every day.  You're charging an absurd rate for mediocre methods to obtain great content.  I hate you.,
"It's all corporate shills who write fake news to brainwash you. They don't report on anything important. They only report propaganda. Carlos Slim, the owner of the NY Times and the world's richest man who isn't even a US citizen and lives in Mexico, wants you fat, drunk and, stupid. Wake up as a critical thinking individual and get your news elsewhere. Don't drink the Kool-Aid anymore.",
"I like reading the NY times, and got a gift subscription.  I didn't realize there was a difference, but now I only get 10 articles, even though I have a 4 month subscription, but apparently only on a computer, which I don't use nearly as much as a tablet.  Well, once the subscription ends, I won't be renewing it.  Pulse has lots of articles, full articles for free. I'd recommend using them.",
"New York Times was one of my favorite news sources. Now they have put a limit of 10 stories per month. I no longer use their website because of this policy and now I will be deleting their app. Their online subscription rate is unreasonably expensive, especially when almost all of the news can be read online for free (w/ads) on other sites. If they change this policy or offer a reasonable subscription rate, I will gladly come back.",
"This app used to be fantastic. But with every new update it gets slower and slower. It looks like text does not load until images and videos render. By the time articles load, I've moved to to another news app--the problem is that I'm paying for nytimes, so I'd like to read it sometime...",
I pay for a digital subscription to NY Times and app works great. It can be slow when refreshing news though.,
"Americentrism not appreciated. Can't remove it, don't really want it, can only disable it. I'd prefer to use Google News but the Genie Widget doesn't seem available for this tablet, and NYT is pre-loaded instead. If the Times was printed on paper, it would at least come in handy in the outhouse dunny... this is Australia, Samsung!",
This app used to be great but recent updates have really slowed it down. Opening up articles is painfully slow and scrolling can be unpredictable and glitchy. Its obvious the android version does not get the same treatment as the iOS version which is smooth and responsive.,
HUGE battery drain. I haven't even used it in the last few days but android says it's used 46⅝ of the battery.,
"Even as a paid subscriber, I'm forced to look at static, non-scrolling ads on every page. Uninstalled.",
"Not the fastest,  frequently hangs,  but it does display the news,  and the widget works.",
Causes conflicts on the S4 such as alarm not working and folders disappearing. Better off going to their website.,
An excellent  apps,
Easy to use with few problems. It's an app I use every day.,
This app is amazing.  It's easy to use and its just like having the actual New York Times in my hand!,
"Good and clean design. Aim using the night mode. Offline mode is good, but then I am at 4g with a new fast phone.    Article loading is slow.  I am a subscriber.  Please remove ads.",
Since I have no time to read newspaper this application is very useful to me anytime and anywhere.,
"Great job attempting to be accretive to expand revenues, margins with poor cheap programing, and PE.",
"I was a huge  fan of this app when all articles were free. Then it became 3 articles per day, which is reasonable. Now at 10 articles per month it's useless. Sorry I can't afford a pricey subscription, I guess that means I don't deserve to be informed. Deleted!",
Also doesn't allow me to read after 10 articles even though I'm logged in w my account.,
lack of transparency from your Reporter and so bias toward Israel.,
Why don't you take off the mobile apps and reduce the current base subscription price. This mobile app is useless. Slow and laggy. I'm better off with the web browser access.,

I'm a paid subscriber yet I still say the ugly ads in this app everywhere. What a shame,

"Articles load slowly and frequently don't render properly, often omitting as many as 3 or 4 lines of text from some but not all paragraphs of some but not all articles.   These are both pretty recent bugs as far as I can tell. Too bad--no more airplane and subway reading until the Times fixes this formerly excellent app.",
"My only complaints: 1) if I accidentally turn my phone a bit and it changes orientation,  it goes back to the top of the story and I have to scroll down to find my place again,  and 2) if you shut the app for more than a minute while reading something,  it doesn't stay on that story and goes to the main page.",
Android (or Samsung) is adding bloated apps that are embedded into the operating system and you cannot remove them.  This came bundled with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 and I can only read a handful of articles every month.  That is of no interest to me so I tried to uninstall it and it won't let me!  Beware of user unfriendly apps like this one.,
Some of their articles present unfair and biased point of view. It was obvious that a Russian player who won the gold medal in a figure single skating was left behind in technical aspects by Yuna objectively.Matters become more worse when it comes to 'plus points' adding to their original performances.A Grade of Russian player was higher than that of Yuna.  Everyone except for you condemns what referees did. Why did you show some of analysis that support the result of Russian perfomance? It's incredible.,
"Once I choose a section, then an article, I can't get back to the sections list of articles, I have to scroll thru them individually. If I try to go 'back', I've been logged out. Second complaint, I like to read the sunday paper all week, but no way to do that on the app. Horrible.",
The 3 articles a day was ok. Why would anyone consider having this app on their phone for a month when you only get 1 article every 3 days if you ration it out. And I have a Note 3 and Samsung said if you register your phone you get 10 articles a day for free. Talk about getting the shaft. I'll stick to the stock Magazine app or one of the 1000 of the free news apps. Bye New York!,
"On Nexus 7:  --Even after full refresh, articles usually take 20-30 seconds to appear after selecting.  --Then after appearing for a few seconds they go blank and reset to the top, taking another 15 seconds to reappear.  --Last lines of many paragraphs are invisible at medium or large font size.  --Almost any action resets an article to the top of the story, or the list of articles to the first one.  What has happened that this is tolerated?",
"Yeah the application is convenient, but these stories are available elsewhere for free.  Often the articles are so rushed to release they contain spelling and grammatical errors.  Priced 2X higher than the economist, which actually has in depth exclusive articles.",
"I love the NYTimes, and the app is generally great. But every time I shift my HTC One from vertical to horizontal orientation, and back, the Times app takes me back to the beginning of the story. Why? It makes no sense, and it means I often have to scan down to where I left off before I tilted my phone, sometimes a few times in an article. Drives me crazy.",
"I love the NYT, but why does it take more than tow minutes to fully update. I had the Guardian app and it happened instantaneously (and the subscription was only $1/mth.)   NYT, please fix this or you might lose a subscriber.",
"You'd think that a newspaper from a city with heavy subway usage would put out an app that was better about not needing internet access to function. You know, since there generally isn't cellphone reception underground.   The app works reasonably well if you're online. If you load up the app before going underground, performance is acceptable (you probably won't have images, but at least you can read the articles). But let's say your phone reboots while you're on the subway, you're totally SOL.",
"After I updated a few day ago I am not able to read the new like I use to. It seems like its better to go to my browser and as someine who commute to work, it was much better to have the news handy when on the go.",
"This app shows the NY Times paper in a digital edition but has several major flaws. Most articles are not released at the same time other major news agencies are posting their articles. They also do not charge a monthly fee to view their articles like the Times does. Within the app itself do not expect to get news quickly, expect to open the app and leave it open for a few minutes while it loads the entirety of every article (at least it seems to). If you click on an article before all articles have been loaded then you must wait a decent bit of time for the article to load.  What they should do is just load the titles and first bit of every article (The part they show as the preview) then when you click on it the article loads. If they want all articles to load then it can do this as a background task that allows browsing to take priority. At the very minimum there needs to be a setting for this. I understand their thought process is to be able to load it then read it offline like a newspaper but this causes the app to be slow and sometimes crash when attempting to quickly browse the stories while online. *Note: Speed of network was a minimum of 20Mbps.",
Flipboard offers the same thing for FREE and it is much faster on my note 3. How can you charge 15 a month when most of that time is waiting for articles to load and when it does you have to find the article again. No way in he'll would I pay 15 a month for this. Not even enjoying the free trial,
The NYT app has become increasingly unusable. It is slow and unresponsive and has a tendency to show articles that one has not clicked on. A once convenient news reader is now a burden: best to read the Times with a web browser.,
"Quite poor and capricious! Good when and if it works.  Today 2/20, refused to update! I do not know how many days it will take to do so! I get the paper edition but the app SUCKS! By the way does the app updates itself like others do? Or does one have to uninstall and reinstall? Frustrating!  Today 2-28, stopped working once more! If other apps can work 24/7 why can' t the NYT one? 3/1/14 uninstalled and reinstalled: still not working!",
"All of the various content on the app is stellar, and what you would expect from the New York Times. However loading the articles us a pain. It takes about thirty seconds for articles to load, and if I click on an article and try reading it, it will keep on bringing me to the top of the article until all articles are done loading.",
"Great app overall, but compared to a lot of services that's available in the internet they need to start offering free subscription.",
I am not sure if this is because I am a subscriber but I can queue articles and my phone reads them to me. That is fantastic for my long commute.,
Hate when updates foul up what once worked so well.  Log-in screen won't work.  Ugh,
"I am a subscriber. I use the ipad app, which works really well these days. The androd app fails silently when I try to log in to get access to more than 10 articles. So, not very useful.",
I can no longer login from my phone.  Customer service non existent.  Paying nytimes hundreds of $ year for aggravation.,
"Love this app. it has very few, if any bugs, allows me to read content when I'm not on a WiFi or 3/4G network and I respect the publication immensely",
"Its a good app, crappy that you  need to get another subscription to have unlimited content. I have an online subscription and it doesn't carry over to the app. NY times needs to re think that",
"Has been pretty reliable recently, but latest update gives error 960 on install.   Update: Developer suggested I uninstall and re-install; that seems to have fixed the problem.",
Then they quickly change the terms under which I downloaded the app. Don't even want to open it now since I can only look at a few articles a month! Uninstalling.,
Now I can only read 10 articles a month then I have to pay. Same reason I uninstalled USA today.,
You now only get 10 articles a MONTH to read before they want you to pay for a paid subscription. I will still to the more reliable Guardian news source. And Google currents. Keep your biased articles to your self NY times.,
Great app. Easy to use and navigate. Would be 5 stars if the user won't lose his place when he turns the screen.,
For some reason this app is the number one cause of battery drain on my device.  Doesn't seem to stop when app is in the background and really kills my battery life.  Uninstalled until this is fixed.  Otherwise very good app.,
Seems like this app is getting very slow and a lot of force closes. Galaxy note 3.,
"The app is good. I just have to give feedback about the ""breaking news"" feature. I have the notification set to silent but pop up on my screen...why does the most OBNOXIOUS music keep playing, not just until I close the breaking news pop up but until I shut the app down?? Please address this issue!",
Rotten glimps at new dead surroundings. A city pethaps. Not more.,
I love the New York Times and their app is super-easy to use.  One of the last bastions of great journalism and their app is terrific.,
"This a PAID APP with just a short free trial.  All apps in the App Store , like any store,  should be CLEARLY PRICE MARKED.",
Great journalism but I get all the push notifications for breaking news twice,
"Nice app if you subscribe for full content (I find it worth the cost), but there are better free news apps available if you don't.",
Closes open article at random and counts re-opening against the now further limited free articles. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. So long and thanks for all the unfinished articles.,
"Paid subscription.  Very slow to load or load articles at all.  Not getting any better, if you want me to continue to pay, you better get this crappy App. fixed fast!!",
"One of a very few significant sources  of a ""balanced"" perspectives that has figured how to maintain an actual newsPAPER in our digital world.   CHEERS!",
"I hate this app! There is limit for reading, everywhere ads, I can't just run app and read news! USA Today much better than this",
I'm already paying through the nose to get this paper digitally.   Why are there ads even after I've paid my subscription?  Awful!,
Really slow the last week downloading articles. PLEASE FIX . I am a subscriber,
Crap service go to USA today IMO,
"I love NYTimes, but 3 free articles/day turned into only 10 free articles/month turned into a 30 day trial before paying $15/month, before I even reached reading 10 articles this month. WUT??",
And only 3 articles daily,
the application only give access to the US edition. I am a subscriber to the international edition. Disappointing.,
Down to 10 articles per month? I am officially done. Uninstalled your app and removing your feeds from every reading service. Your organization has some good writing but you have continuously tightened the grip.,
Changes from 3 articles per day to 10 per month is really lame,
10 articles a month isn't sufficient at all. No thanks.,
Not paying for something I can get for free.,
This app looks really good on my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2!😆,
"Awesome regular updates. Good content, really useful widget.   Expensive...",
"It used to be 3 free article, it is now 10 a month.. Too bad, i'm uninstalling...wrong move from nyt!!",
"app is slow as hell on HTC One over 50mbps WiFi connection. And yet, somehow the ads load just fine. And why the hell do I get ads when I pay FIFTEEN DOLLARS a month for this???",
I recently downloaded this app and I use it daily! Great job converting this great newspaper into an application!,
NY times are all crap,
Look at headline.,
"Easy browsing, reading, searching, sharing. Great digital access to a great paper.",
Works perfectly on Sony smartphones without hang...,
"Unless you're a subscriber, this app is pointless.",
Very nice,
It tells me everything,
Only 10 articles a month..,
Thank you for the good news papet,
Great content from a great company.,
Very easy to use on tablets,
Crazy slow.,
News article read limit keeps getting lowered.  I'll get my news elsewhere.  Uninstalling.,
Love the format of the app.,
:(,
Nothing but ads for the paid articles - uninstalled,
Why would I pay to be propagandized?,
Just Sayn!,
"Only wish the back button went to the link and not into the subsection,  and that saving to Pocket saved a title.",
Nice if free,
Why? Why are there suddenly ads on here? That's why I pay the subscription price!,

"It was great to have 3 articles per day, which wasn't many for the numerous quality articles available. However with the new changes of 10 per month I really don't forsee keeping this app much longer. An 88% decrease in the number of articles I can read/month is just simply too little. What a shame Disappointing.",
"Supposedly because of my purchase of my Samsung tablet I was to get 3 months free. Didn't happen, not sad, however. This paper is too liberal for my taste. It is no wonder they are having financial difficulty because of these views. I would have cancelled my free subscription anyway.",
"I have a print subscription to the New York Times.  While playing with Google News, I signed up as I can read the NYT on the web whenever without any special charges.  I immediately notice that a ""charge"" for zero dollars had been processed.  I was a bit confused and did not want to be charged for something that I get for free.  I contacted Google via email or chat (forgot which one) and was informed that since I already had a subscription that the account would ALWAYS show a charge of $0 and that I need not worry.  Well such was not the case.  Two months charges, no refunds, and I am a bit put off.  Won't make this mistake again.",
"My father is a hard working man, I am very proud. of him ànd. I prayed that one day God will touch his heart so we  can sit down and have an one on one. Dad I really miss you deeply.	NY TIMES. Is by far the Best newspaper company.",
I thought you guys were liberals but when it comes down to it. You want money. Well here is another lost customer.,
Having the Times anywhere in the world is great!  But it falls so short in the implementation.  Here's what it needs:   (1) Bandwidth hog!  Needs setting to block photo download except on wifi.  (2) Navigation:  Setting to move favorite sections to the top of the list.  (3) Remember position in article when accidentally moving out of it and back.  And it occasionally freezes on my Galaxy S4.,
I get to the middle of an article ( it's on about 20% of the articles)  and the app will crash,
"I was really upset that they changed to 3 a day... but I could understand. Now that it is 10 per month, I am really upset and uninstalling the app. I get money needs to be made, but I am a college student, and can get news free elsewhere",
I love the ability to quickly browse within sections. The next best thing to the print edition.,
"Three articles a day was somewhat bearable, but now a limit of 10 per month is just awful. I can get free news with plenty of other apps, such as the Guardian.",
Please address the widget stability issue. I can't even have the widget open for a second before it crashes.,
"This version freezes so often, I uninstalled it and am reading the paper 
via HTML.",
"This app uses 3-5% of my battery, which is more than any other I've downloaded, even though I probably use it less than 5 minutes a day. The mobile site looks basically the same, but since it's not an app, it uses much less battery and storage.",
10 articles a month is not even really worth the download,
Keep doing what you're doing NY IT!,
App quality & features are top notch for a news app.,
Like the improved app.,
Rip off!!! They want us to pay $3.75 a week or $15 a month or $180 a year.,
One of the best apps period !,
Wonderful,
Application,
Go back to 3 articles a day instead of 10 a month you've caused me to use the BBC widget over your app due to the free articles,
Excellent,
Excellent,
Just what I want,
"Just like the company it is Sloow.Give unbiased news and you will do a lot better.I would have subscribed to the print edition years ago but can't stand the left wing tree hugging, climate crazy propaganda..",
there is no value provided by this media company.,
"I love the online NYT. Unfortunately, the company is slow to fix bugs and keep up with Android. In the current release, videos don't play, exiting an article returns the user to the top of the list of articles, headlines get munged, and articles paint, then repaint, then repaint again.   I'm sure the company spends more in one day on distributing the print edition to people's homes than it would take to fix these irritating bugs.",
"Much better than older version.   Print easier on eyes.  Format still not as good as NYT mobile direct but that may be due to my phone - Samsung Note 3.  That's why only 4 stars.   And today, no comments showing up, don't know why.",
Hard to catch up on news reading 10 articles a month. Its not even enough to try out the app before considering subscribing... Not to mention I wasted two articles while scrolling through the app and it registered my touch to scroll as a click.,
"The NYT has improved its coverage the past couple of years.  Despite shrill cries from the right wing, it has always been a frequent stenographer for power.  This grew particularly bad under the previous editor---anyone remember Judith Miller? However, it is actually starting to do some investigation again.  That gets it something like 3 or so stars.  The app used to be horrible a few years ago, but is now much better.  However, given the paywall, the fact that it is very techy about inadvertent openings of articles, I have to ding it at least a star.  Also, the layout is nothing spectacular, not as nice as, say the BBC app.  Again, about three stars.",
"Content & app are both top-notch. Switching from 3 free articles/day to 10 free articles/month just means I'll be reading the Time less, however - offer a limited pay option and I might come back.",
"Love the content but this app has one fatal flaw: when you rotate your screen from portrait to landscape and then back again, it scrolls back to the top of the article. Fix that, and it's 4 stars. Add better offline syncing and you get 5.",
"I love the NYTimes, but the app crashes every time I spend a few minutes writing a comment. Unacceptable. On top of that, as a paying subscriber of the NYTimes, I do not want to see ads in my news stories.",
It freezes and crashes daily on my KitKat. Complete garbage. Bad journalism goes along bad programming. Nyt just can't get anything right.,
"The app works but there are things I don't like.  The selection of articles is very limited even with a paid subscription.  Also, NY times writing is frustrating from time to time.",
I liked this at first but abou four months ago after an update an annoying change showed up in the layout.  It splits syllables and it is so distracting that I no longer use it and have gone back to the regular NYTimes. Com.,
Not sure which update did it but this app is now my top battery drainer even when I never use it.,
3 articles a day was fair. Enough to give u a taste and maybe purchase. Guess they need the $$. There's too many other free choices to buy this.,
"First it was an unlimited number of articles a month, then it was 30, and now it's 10. Some articles are also super short, making me regret for choosing to read it.",
"Articles are painfully slow to load.  Also, once inside the article, side-swipes are very sensitive and it keeps switching to the next article, forcing me to go back and wait to re-load the article I actually want to read, then scroll down, wait again to load more of the article, until i find where I was at.",
Notwithstanding the buggy interface and high power consumption (it halves my battery life) the interface I'd pretty good,
Nothing in life is free. And in this case neither is the news. You are only allowed 10 free articles a month and after you reach the limit you are prompted to purchase a subscription.,
"Spams notification area, bleats on about subscription. Can't recommend for non subscription holders. Old media being obnoxious.",
"When I try to play videos embedded on articles, it goes to blank screen and crash the app",
"Each section takes a minute or so to load on Nexus 7. Not a good experience on Android. Please look into this. The iPad version is good but I prefer reading on a  7"" inch device.",
I am a big NYTimes fan. I still remember my grandfather reading the times cover to cover. Now news at touch of buttton convenient and quick.,
"NY times blocked two of my comments which were totally legit,  I recommend you NOT to use this app.",
Love the NYT but the widget crashes constantly. I can barely use it. Wish for more stability.,
It just spins on the home page sometimes. It makes me want to cancel my paid subscription.,
"The NYT is the flagship newspaper of the world-hands down.  This app is sub-par for their brand.  They need to add better personalization, search and sharing features.",
"There simply is no better source for news and information. As a journalist and subscriber, I love the Android app!",
"I am using the 99-cent digital promotion offered to lure me back, which is fine. Aside from the incredibly long load time (mentioned in other reviews), app functions okay. Would I pay ""full"" price? No. When the trial is up, so am I.",
Words begin and continue on diffrent lines. Very annoying.,
"Love the widget, great way to scan the head lines without going into the app. When inside the app, readability is good and gesture support is decent. Love that it caches articles so you can read even with no network.",
"Although I love reading the NYT, there is a fatal flaw in the app. After a set amount of time, you are limited to reading only 3 per day though the app.  After that, you have to wait to read more. So I deleted the app and just bookmarked it.",
"The latest version just shows a white screen on my Galaxy S 3. I used to love my NY Times, but I'm about to cancel my subscription.",
App had been fine for a long time. But I'm now in able to play videos. It is disappointing because I'm a paid subscriber. I've tried reinstalling to no avail.,
"It was working all right until I updated. Now I get nothing but a white screen, and the widget is blank.  Uninstalled and reinstalled and it seems to be working for now.",
"Only three articles a day? Do yourself a favor and create a bookmark to the Times, the mobile layout is just like the app and you can read as many articles as you can find.",
"Slow, hangs, displays nothing, doesn't react on refresh",
All my news right on my CP. It's a good app,
$21.26 a month is $20.00 too much.  I'm sticking with flipboard. NYT limited news.,
It used to be 3 per day. I understand the need to monetize but it's a rather drastic drop in the free content. How is it possible to use the app now? 10 times in a month? I have uninstalled the app,
"Sucks again.   Ever since they instituted the pay wall,  performance has sucked.  More than 30 seconds to pull up an article on wifi?	Unusable for weeks now. I just hangs and wasted my time and battery. Uninstalled.",
This app is worthy of the New York Times name.,
Latest update resolves the stability issue.,
At the moment it looks nice. Let me study little more. Today it is day1.,
$19.95/month on top of my digital subscription!  No!,
All the issues I ever had have been fixed. Yea! Thanks.,
Best news widget turned to crap.,
I love this app. It mantains me update !,
I'm a subscriber. I log in and I'm recognized. Still limited to 3 news stories.,
Hate the the three free reads.,
The time give you the fact nd before anyone else mostly,
This app doesn't differentiate between a subscriber and not. There's ads for all.,
Very slow to refresh,
"I love the NY times, very  informative.",
Very good app .. I use this app all the time,
Uninstalled because of the undying loyalty to Hillary Clinton.,
Nice and amazing newspaper I like this very much,
It is the new York Times after all😄,
Love that it automatically downloads for offline reading,
It used to be 3 per day the they changed to this ridiculous policy. What is the point of a news app that only let's you use it 10 times?,
To much spin to be called news,
superb go fr it guys.kudos to u pple,
M regularly using it,
Very informative.,
Crap this app is not free they let you read three articles today you can get plenty other free news apps with no limitations have they heard the Internet uninstall,
Only ten free articles per month? What happened to three articles every day?,
Old ui and for some reason can not uninstall.,
It provides all the valluable news that i need!!!great app!!!,
It's just fine...,
Very good!,
Love it! Wonderful,
Loved being connecte d,
A very necessary app,
This is it.,
The best.,
Works pretty well,
Love ny,
Awesome app,
Love to view this,
I'm not going to be limited to only one article every 3 days. That's crazy,
A daily must read,
Excellent,
Nice,
Nice,
Awesome,
This is fixed,
What,
Okie,
"Please.  It doesn't matter how good this app ever becomes, as long as it is determined to waste my time with full screen ads, I am determined not to use it. A shame really, and no way to treat subscribers who to continue to support the paper.  I will upgrade my review if I hear of the advertisement policy changing. It is possible I would even pay for an upgraded premium app once to avoid the ads, but even that would be stretching it. We'll see what happens.",
"Thanks for the optimized tablet experience, but now 20% of the screen real estate is taken up by an obnoxious red advertisement. I'm a paying subscriber already -- why do I have to see that annoying crap? Certainly not going to continue paying if that isn't removed or made less intrusive. It's unbelievably obnoxious.",
"We've had a digital subscription for over a year. The app works fine on the iPad and the Samsung Note 8. However, on the phones (Galaxy Note 3 and Motorola Droid), the app will not stay logged in. We always end up going to the website to read the news. Tech support says it will be fixed soon, but they've been saying that for a long time now. We've uninstalled and reinstalled a number of times without success.....",
New update of app on Nexus 7 malfunctions with auto rotate screen when showing videos. Too bad because otherwise it's great.,
NYT employs some of the most intelligent and fair reporters in the World and we reap the benefits.  One of the best newspapers available.,
"""5 Stars for Content / 3 Stars for Banner Ads with Paid Subscriptions"" I have always enjoyed the NYT. After finally justifying the purchase of a tablet, I looked forward to reading the times everywhere. It is a wonderful piece of work... And then came the huge banner ads across the top of the page. THEY ARE HORRIBLE!  Paying customers should never have to deal with this. It is counter intuitive to the way paid vs free functions on the web. FREE=ADS / PAID=NO ADS. What don't you guys understand about this?  Finally, why on earth would you ruin an otherwise beautiful grid layout with wildly annoying banner ads?  C'mon, NYT!! Do better.  Edit: App has begun crashing/freezing with regularity. Lowering rating to 2 stars.",
"I had the tablet subscription but because of how beautiful the app looks on the note 3, I switched to the smartphone subscription and now I enjoy the nytimes anytime.",
"Widget crashes constantly, app itself updates very slowly. Little to like about this app but for aesthetic and content.",
I just downloaded this to my Moto X and the app resets my article halfway through reading; I end up having to scroll back down to where I was. Completely annoying. Please fix!,
One of the few remaining real news reporting generators in the era of internet news aggregation.,
I really enjoyed this app until the latest update. The ads distract greatly from the articles. I had night mode on and there's this huge bright white ad at the bottom. I had to stop reading the article. I agree with the other reviewers: PAID = NO ADS!,
"I m on nexus ten and I m getting a blank page after upgrade.  What a rip off for paid subscription.  Looks like there is no testing done prior to posting on app store.  Shame  Update Uninstall, reinstall, login solved the issue.",
Default sign up for daily notification is invasive and inappropriate. 3 article limit per day for free version is inadequate. Daily mail and incognito browser workarounds for nyt content here I come.,
One of my favourite apps so far. I recommend it to all readers.,
"Three free articles per day.   More than any of us give away in our own jobs.   Not that they have much of a choice... Still, useful for us.   God app too.",
"I simply don't understand the New York times digital approach, in this time when so many newspaper are struggling to make it because of free news available on the net , the times continues to offer different confusing digital subscriptions plans  Give me an all I'm one subscription plan on my computer,tablet and phone for 7 days for 15 dollars a month and I'll sign up",
"The app lags, loads incredibly slow, and the ad placement is a UX horror show. Meanwhile the mobile sitebis clean, fast, and easy to use. Why would I use this junk at all if I pay for monthly access?",
I love the app but the latest update seems to have broken offline reading somehow. If I'm on a plane and open the app it doesn't give me. The most recently downloaded articles anymore. It just spins and fails to load. Please fix!!,
App crashes when I try to play video. Please fix this.,
Slow and awkward if you want anything but the main headlines.,
"I understand paying for good content, but at least TRY an ad supported model in the mobile world.",
Well first time when I installed it didn't worked just a simple white blank page appears!  The second time when I installed it works BUT! It's daam slow. It loads like....... Fix it then I'll give 5 stars And one more thing trial?  Really common man! This shouldn't be a 30 days trial :-/,
"Flawless until recently, but still a good interface when it's working",
"One of the finest sources of news in the world on an easy to use app available at the touch of your finger.  The gold standard of news in an app,",
"I like the hard copy,however the electronic version is good also.",
"More articles available than I could read in a day even if I wanted. I have the widget set to give me science news/articles, I really like that widget and its content. Again,a great app with lots and lots of news covering everything.",
Crashes back to launcher when I try to open on Nexus 7.,
Updated app no longer loading. Not refreshing with days news.,
"Still can't save it to my SD card? I love this app and the ny times, but might have to delete it soon just to keep my phone running. HTC Desire",
Can't log-in with my NY Times account.,
When updates introduce bugs the developers engage users and are quick to fix.,
It doesn't really work,
Paying money for small features is unnecessary,
pray for members and me,
Easy to use n 3 free articles per day!,
One of the few great American newspapers left. A treasure.,
But it kills your battery,
Everything works now. Great content,
I Love NYC and ilove NYTimes,
Great multi-faceted news app,
like new york times,
I like this application.,
I like bananas and it has bananas in the app #swag,
Great app!,
Hello new york!!,
Thanks for your help. ..,
Really good content!,

Why does it want to know who I'm calling and when?,
Can't live without it,

"Top-notch app, more clean and organized than any other newspaper app I've seen for Android. News alerts are timely and relevant as well; whereas many news organizations are less than selective about using their powers of ""push,"" NYT in general holds out for truly important news, which I appreciate.",
Not a free app. You can read 5 free short articles a day usually not full length and ur cut off after 5.,
"App worked great until very recently.  Now any paragraph without a picture is formatted incorrectly, words are broken up between lines (samsung 8 note tablet android 4.1.2)",
"Killed my battery today within 1 hour from a full charge, usually full charge can get me 2 days, I was shocked. Good NY Times content however...",
Was a good app until they tell u to pay just to read mire than 3 news stories a day that I can get from yahoo and USA Today for FREE. GREEDY  bunch of girls and boys grow up,
"Wonderful content, but after last update the app often fails to load and freezes my tablet.  Android 4.4.2 on Google Nexus 10.",
Love reading the times but do not appreciate the limitation of access but full and constant access to the news requires a paid subscription.,
It is annoying paid version with lots of ads. I am Deleting this App.,
I love I can read it without a network connection. No news app can compete.,
Same great content. Not as many images. Nicely configured,
Good interface but drains battery quickly,
"All around great app, though better on iOS",
"Great to be in touch with the ""real"" world.",
Easy to find what you need,
I like it.,
It's amazing.,
How to remove this unwanted adware?,
Such an expensive.,
App is perfect.,
Love to read it,
Greatly improved!,
Use it daily,
Best news app,
Great layout,
So quit,
great,
No comment,
Ads,
goodd,
"As a subscriber I actually preferred the Times website for mobile,  but they seem to have done away with that recently forcing is to use the app that.   The app constantly tells me I've reached my reading limit and to log in to continue,  but I've already logged in.  Very frustrating.  I wish the Times would bring back the mobile website until they can create a usable app for subscribers.  In on the verge of just canceling my subscription.",
"Love that it works underground for subway reading, but there are problems they've ignored after multiple updates: 1) when it tries to refresh without any signal, it has a blank screen for over a painful few minutes. 2) It also has an  issue where it suddenly jumps two articles sideways when scrolling.",
"For $15/ month this is extremely badly made application. Every time you open it it looses last read place and tries to sync everything all over again. Went to setting and changed sync to manual only, but same result. And if you do not have wifi when it's syncing, good luck, you will be waiting looking at blank screen for minutes. I could understand issues like this with free apps, but not for 15 per month. Uninstalled!",
First:   Pocket has been removed as a read it later option not sure why but this is how I consume longer form content.  Second:  Pop up ads...  this seems to have quieted down but popping up 4 ads for the same product during a morning read leads me to not want to buy the product or the subscription to NYT,
"I use it all the time. My tablet is now my 'on the go' and 'up to the minute' home (hip pocket) delivered copy of the Times.   My only issue was that for a time recently the 'front page' news content froze and refused to update. I had to delete the app and re-download. Now everything is great again, and I'm all smiles.",
"This is a great app for viewing the NYTimes on a mobile device. Except for occasional glitches with images not displaying, I'm very happy with the design and functionality. However, I have a paid subscription for electronic access, and I'm still seeing full screen ads every few articles, which is very annoying. I haven't yet decided whether or not I'm going to stop subscribing over this issue.",
"I love the NY Times app for sure. I personally keep mine set to business news, rarely changing it over, as I get my news from other sources. However, when I click an article on the widget or manually open the app I stare at a blank screen for ages and have to keep trying until it decides to work. I've been having this issue on the SIII and S4, through all the updates!",
"I read the NYT digitally every day. I switched from an iPad to an Android tablet, and the Android app is lacking. Several features I miss: (1) Reorder the Sections list (2) Scroll vertically through the sections, in my selected order; (3) Scroll horizontally through article titles & summaries in the section I'm currently in - on the iPad there's more articles per page and more content from the beginning of the article; (4) Overall layout - there's more information, better organized, in the iOS app. On Android, the right-hand vertical column of sections uses a lot of space with little information in it. (5) Bottom scrollbar of section articles is missing in the Android app.",
Description of update is misleading. Updating this app will require you to buy a subscription to view stories.  There should be an option to get free access to top stories with ads.  I am uninstalling this app and installing other free news apps instead.,
Galaxy S4. NYT app team seems to have fixed most of the bugs that used to plague previous versions.,
"After the update, app doesn't launch; as soon as I try to open, it ""has stopped"".   Please revert the update - uninstalled.  Update: fixed issues with latest version and did follow up to let me know.",
I am a paying subscriber to the times and the app is pretty good for reading the news but recently it's been just quitting while I am reading. It doesn't pop up a force close but it just quotes which is really annoying.,
The app is the slowest one on my phone.  I contacted the developer and they blamed gingerbread.  It's just as slow on jellybean.  Just use their mobile website unless you need breaking news alerts..  It's much faster.,
"No one but the mindless believe you anymore. You've burned too many bridges with biased ""reporting"". It's approaching sad. One star for charity.",
Every time I open the app it is 2 to 3 minutes to load the 1st page and images.   very slow.,
"I am a paid subscriber to New York Times Digital Edition. Although I can also read the New York Times on any of my desktops, laptops or tablet and phone, I usually access The New York Times exclusively through my smartphone. This app has work nearly flawlessly on my previous phone and I we'll see how it does on the new phone after this install. At least at the time of this review, I'm extremely impressed with the app.",
"I love the NY Times app,  but am constantly frustrated by my inability to enlarge images. I was just trying to read the comic strip, and was unable to, because the writing is too small on a smart phone. It seems obvious, and should have been fixed by now. Other than that, excellent.",
"What happened to the app. I tried night mode now and it doesn't turn night mode on in the specific articles. also, on upper right hand corner there's no menu anymore like there used to be did something happen to the app it's just not working anymore.",
The widget Is the easiest way to choose what articles I want and they are ALWAYS unavailable.  Please fix.,
Much improved over a year ago. Haven't seen a crash or bad data in months. GS3,
I live in the South and it is wonderful to be able to get real news and information from the NYT app on my Google Nexus 7. The app works quite well for me. I especially like the ability to be able to email articles from the app to others.,
"I pay good money each month for the NYT digital subscription for my phone. However, ever since getting a Samsung Mega a few months ago, when using the app, I am constantly asked for my subscription log-in. Even when logging in AGAIN, I cannot access more than 3 articles per day. I talked to the NYT office, and they were totally useless. Can you make this app work correctly with my Samsung Mega?? Thank you!!",
I don't know why others can't see what people want in a news app. NYTimes does it best.,
Great job nice GUI and awesome slide menu with easy shorcuts.,
The new widgets font size is way too big and no longer has a preview of the article displayed. Old widget was much better. Bring back the old widget!,
"I paid for this app, and I don't want to see full page ads when I'm reading. Stop this "" low level revenue generating ideas "" and use alternative method to generate revenue.",
I am not happy that I am only able to read three articles a day if I am not a subscriber,
"The NY Times app has all the news you'll ever need, local, national and international!! BEST OF THE BEST",
"Before it was crashing constantly, much better now.",
"App works great, and I appreciate how quickly NYT got back to me when I had a problem with it. Adjusting my review to 5 stars as a result.",
"Only 3 free articles daily so 1 star less, otherwise for content 5 stars",
Yet more bloatware on my Samsung 10.1 that I don't use but can't get rid of.,
Especially if you have New York Times account!  I love how it caches the articles so you can read them on the subway.,
"Great app, but it's a huge battery drain when open on the Nexus 5 running 4.4 (uses more power than the screen - when left open it'll drain the battery in an hour or so even with the screen off).",
Annoyingly jumps back to the top every time when multitasking,
"I was highly disappointed when I paid my subscription to find the app, filled with ads.  This is double billing and highly annoying, kindly remove ads for paid subscribers or lose my business.",
"Was a beta tester and waited patiently for the return of white on black screen, but it never came. Help my OLED phone's battery, please.",
The app looks great and is functioning as it should be.,
Hanging..very slow after they added subscriptions,
It is very slow and user interface is not accessible,
Keeps me updated whereever I land in different ports,
Best news source out there.  Easy to use.,
"but that's how they always made money, right? Newspaper always had print ads, even if you subscribed. App will hopefully get more stable.",
U can have any news current affairs ! 1000 stars,
"I pay for a subscription. Out of nowhere ads are suddenly popping up when I open a new article! The ads need to go, at least for those who are already paying for a subscription.",
It is one of the best apps for getting latest and fresh news........5 stars..it deserve,
Easy to read the times great content,
"When a breaking news alert appears, why oh WHY can't I actually read the article?!",
Thank you for the objective worldwide news coverage and reporting.,
"Its my leading source of information everyday! 5 stars always, but even though I am a paid subscriber ,the apps tells me to subscribe ? Help!  Cant use it! ;-(",
"neat in style, easy to use. never collapse.",
"No way! I'm not gonna update for that. You are a newspaper app! How ridiculous, deleted!!",
Great news u can listen to,
"Love the content but am very disappointed at the ads that interrupt the articles. I pay for a subscription, why the ads?",
Only 3 articles...come on NYT!! $15 per month...no way!!,
Very useful apps...,
Thank you!,
Gotta love nyt...the new version of the app is great...,
The Best!,
24*7 world news....,
Yep.,
Great app NYT....,
Is this a mistake? Lame.,
Great app,
g,
Great app,
Great app,
nice,
My widgets (clock and weather) don't update while I have this app installed. Uninstalling it always seems to help.,
Free please.,
Exe,
"Another unnecessary update and now the ads are back and the widget - which is better suited for a tablet, NOT a phone - constantly crashes. Smack your developers on the hand and tell them to stop screwing around. The content of the Times is excellent on its own, but content is only as good as it's accessibility. In good design, form follows function, not the other way around.",
"I have to update my previous review. This update is, frankly, awful. If you haven't updated yet, don't bother. I thought I wouldn't mind the removal of the article summary that much, but in practice I just hate it. Waste of space, plus the new widget looks terrible. The worst part, though, is that after the update, I have been fighting with the app all day trying to get it to acknowledge my subscription, but it will not, so now the app is totally useless. For the love of God, just give us the old app back.",
App keeps crashing every time I try to login. Please fix immediately. I am a paying customer.,
"No issues with the app.  I decided to subscribe to the service though.  You can't cancel or change your subscription electronically. You have to call into the customer service. I had to hold for well over 30 minutes. My plan was to simply downgrade my subscription, but after the lengthy hold time I decided to cancel. Also take note if you subscribe to their 99 cent trial they will not contact you and remind you that it is expiring, also they will by default sign you up for the most expensive plan. Remember 99 cents for a month will turn into $8.75 a week.",
Since update. It is also not auto updating anymore despite settings. Also miss story summaries more than I like the new layout.,
"The subscription problems that have been reported for months still have not been resolved.  Like so many others, my phone (Nexus 4, not exactly exotic) will not recognize my digital subscription.  NYT needs to bring their digital prowess up to the level of their reporting, and soon.",
The 4x2 widget is way too big.  It takes up a half a page which makes it useless for my homepage.  No point in this app anymore when I have to dig for the information,
"I have watched the NYT app evolve over time and it has really become quite good. Clean interface and easy to navigate, my only issue is the scrolling could be smoother. Otherwise an excellent extension to my subscription.",
Headlines are often too vague and I will not click a blind link without more info to entice me. I don't have time for that and you don't have time to be losing traffic.,
A great tabloid. App seems much improved with technically no glitches. Keep up the great work.,
The updated widget is very disappointing. I wonder why the news summary has been removed from the headlines. Please revert back to the old widget!,
"The article summary in the old  widget was useful. The new one seems like a downgrade.    News content, however, is wonderful.",
Was a great app before. Now constantly freezes and force closes. Using DroidX.,
The app seems the same... Maybe there were bug fixes. The old widget was better. I like having an easy list with the summaries before I click into an article. The widget on my Samsung device looks nice but I'd like to have the choice for the list too because I would still use it on some of my devices. Please change back or add an option for both choices.,
"You have to pay for this app after the trial. News should never be paid for, I don't care who is writing the articles. There are plenty of other ways to make money.",
"After a series of updates this application is now a well implemented, comfortable news reading application. The android style is evident throughout the application. Longer load times are handled well across the app with staged article updates etc.",
Doesn't move section to section.  Doesn't do automatix update.  Reqires manual refresh.  Not up to par for NYT.,
Not recommended. They only let you read three articles a day for free.,
The app works fine bit the  widget always crashes. The widget is the only reason I installed the app,
Called customer service about banner ads on my paid service. Was told it is nytimes new policy to place banner ads on smart phone digital subscriber's screens. I canceled. $182 a year and ads. No thanks.,
Crashes everytime. Only app that crashes on my Note 3.,
"I absolutely love that the NYTimes has embraced Android design language and the app definitely works smoothly and effectively. Considering its latest partnership with Samsung over the GALAXY Note 3, I Would like to see some S pen functionality (air view, etc) integrated here. That would earn 5 stars from me.",
I updated the App recently and now it's broken. Refuses to open.,
This is fake free this ago should be under pay section,
Gotta have my NYTimes! I wish the NYT app was free again.,
Can find no update in Google play?  Only install?          Takes a long long time for front page to load.  Trying to look at photos is a joke.  Way way too many bugs.  Very slow these days.  Samsung Galaxy 4,
Slow.  Plus you have to $ besides all the adds,
Revert back to the old one!,
Agreed. How did it make sense to remove the news summary from the widget? All I have now are random headlines. A complete waste of space on my screen now. A complete step backwards. Wish I could undo the update.,
"I can no longer run the app. It crashes as soon as I open it, every time. I've rebooted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing works. Any idea what I can do to fix it?  Samsung Galaxy S3, running Android 4.1.2.",
After the update it stopped working,
Whereever you go news follow with nytimes app ..,
"App was working fine a few days after I subscribed, but now does not recognise my subscription and keeps prompting me to subscribe. Could someone fix this?",
Not optimized for tablets.,
Good unbiased up-to date and detailled news!,
"Buggy and slow as hell after update. Why do I need buggy intrusive ads ads as a subscriber? Wake up developers!	.",
"Good on the go, thank you.",
Best news app,
"Beautiful application, thanks.",
"Nytimes, welcome to 2013. Information and news is free these days. Limited functionality.",
Doesn't work,
it stucks at downloading forever!,
And now they've decided to screw their users.,
Login does not work.,
"Great news, great source.",
Spams home screen,
Wacky Wednesday,
Fails to open,
Nice appe,
Who doesn't?,
Excelent app,
Nice,
"Since a recent upgrade I can no longer log in. The credentials screen comes up but is totally unresponsive. This is on a Viewsonic Gtablet running Android 2.2, which is supposedly supported according to the website. Times customer service responds to my emails, but is unhelpful. A number of people here seem to have the same problem, so the Times should be aware of it by now.",
"The app is well made, the design is spartanlike, with simple black and white texts.  This is all completely ruined by a color ad bar in the bottom that has no seaming place on the app.  Its as if the marketing team just slapped that ad at the bottom without any regard to design or flow...",
"I had no problems with this app (other than the large amount of battery power it sucked up) until they instituted the pay wall. I am a NY Times digital subscriber, so I should be able to log in on the app. But, despite multiple attempts, it does not accept my login credentials. So, now it is useless.  HTC Inspire",
"I love the app, use it daily, (using Galaxy Note 2), great design and navigation, don't mind the small occasional ad bar, and of course the amazing world class content is well worth the subscription price. It just needs one thing for 5 stars: the option to scroll within an article using the phone's volume keys, like the awesome RSS app Greader offers.",
"I get 3 free articles per day (thanks NYT) , but I clicked on an article from the widget and it said that I used 1 article up, and then said Article Unavailable. Then I read another article and it said I used two. Hope you guys can fix this bug since I try to pick good articles for my 3 and missing one kind of sucks.",
"Being a long time foreign reader of the NYT, it pains me to have to uninstall this great app with probably the best UI I have ever seen in a news app. Smooth transitions between articles and topics, offline reading and great video implementation made my readings enjoyable. But the new pricing policy of 10 free articles a month just makes it impossible to keep it on my phone. There is no point of monetizing the press like the NYT now tries to do. You guys are really gonna kill your readership.",
"The news is good. The app is bad. It never has up-to-date headlines, and if you click on a headline (on the widget) that's out of date - even by minutes - the app tells you the article is unavailable instead of just downloading it and letting you read it. I clicked a link WITHIN AN ARTICLE which went to NYTimes website (another annoying lack of integration) and when I went back to the app, the article I was in the middle of was ""no longer available"".",
Please change or give option to change background color. There's light gray on a darker shade of gray which is not the easiest to read. But the worst is the date in red on the dark gray background - it's practically impossible to read. The ability to change the font size would also be nice.,
"Maybe a nice app in other respects but I can't login.  The login page is unresponsive and doesn't allow any characters to be entered into the fields. Buttons don't work, either. Blame my older Android phone maybe but this oughta be fixed.",
The app is very good. The only sad thing is that you have to pay to see full content and it was not like this before :(,
"I had no problem logging through a web bowers but this mobile app will not accept my password for my paid subscription.  The app dose work and works well but the logging security is a disaster .  I had to cancel my subscription because it's useless to me if I can't read the articles on my smart phone, and get pop up notification to log in. Also I could do with out the Google adds at the bottom of every article.",
I want to read an article then ask me to login. Just because it's not minus star I could give it I give 1 star thank u.,
"This app is good enough. No complaints about ads for paying subscribers; that's how newspapers continue to survive. There is an annoying issue with connecting the app to a paid subscription, which I resolved by calling NYTimes on the phone.",
"App has come a long way, my ratings have been up and  down. Right now it's a 4.",
"never able to get over the login screen after reading 3rd article, even though i had already logged in... plz get a good programmer to fix this problem... i had to uninstall this app...",
I'm Canadian and have to say this is a pretty good app but asked me to pay as soon as I opened the app. But I didnt,
"App has improved since last update. Widget it's useful, but app crashes at least once during each use. Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant",
"Is better but still not really there yet. Why not use the side bar thing like in G+, YouTube, Evernote, Facebook, Spotify apps? And the scroll bar still changes size as you scroll.",
"When you save articles in the app, it removes the images. I couldn't figure out how to search for terms within an article. Also, you can't select and copy text. All of this in an app for a paying subscriber. For the time being, your app sucks, New York Times.",
The app keeps putting on ads to subscribe to NYT even though I am logged as an online subscriber.  I wish my online subscription would enable full access to flip board which has a nicer interface.,
Nice app in general. I would prefer the new left side menu instead of the drop down to select sections. Adding customized sections which combine one or more others would also be a nice addition. The offline capabilities are great.,
The MENU function (the vertical stack of squares in the upper right corner) usually will not stay open when selected unless I first clear the application cache and force a restart of the application. Otherwise it seems to be a good smartphone reading application.,
Uninstaling. Only 3 free articles a day? Yet there are still ads? How cheap can you get NY times? I needed this for my political science class. I'll just find a way to bootleg your articles. Thanks for being stingy.,
New version has become a huge battery drain. Had to uninstall.,
"This does have some good articles, but app managers show this at the top of the list across the board for data drainage even though I barely open it. Uninstalling.",
"Good news app with breaking news and push notifications, but menus automatically instantaneously exit, meaning I can't change any settings on my galaxy S2.",
Rate after 99c 4weeks too much.,
This is my most frequently used app and I just don't understand why the WSJ and Bloomberg can't just copy it!,
"This is an awesome app , I wouldnt change anything , i love staying on top of all current news , thank you !",
This app is not free shouldn't be aloud to say it is!,
"Widget still sucks.  Crashes, doesn't update, stays blank.  Otherwise app is ok.  But widget really sucks",
"NYT app pretty good now! BUT room for improvement. Graphics within articles  and blogs (e.g. Krugman)  don't always show up correctly. Can't comment. Guardian's app still the best, others should copy.",
The widget usually shows a blank screen.,
There is nothing wrong with the app but can only read 3 stories per day with no subscription. Why do I need to pay if there are more news apps free out there? This one gotta go,
New version is horrendous! Force closes all the time!,
Cannot access settings tab. Keeps disappearing after touching settings button. Hasn't been working for months. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Never fixed.,
Chiffon Yves ug n ni n,
What they let you read is always top notch reporting..,
That's tight.,
You can only look at 3 articles a day. Choose wisely.,
"Bloated and Archaic, simple!  Uninstalled!",
Only 3 free articles a day? Ridiculous.  Guess I'll find another source for news.,
"While the NYT app for Android works fine, I prefer the Press Reader version which only works on Apple. When will Press Reader be available for Android tablet users?",
It gives latest news and it is  worlds one of the great newspapers,
Good app for news reader who want read the times...,
Ok just headlines.but I'm free for a week.and it's on my phone,
Bad form,
With a Android style UI.,
"Much better, hardly see the ads anymore.",
Lots of interesting articles and easy reading on tablets!,
Great news all over the world!,
Actions menu doesnt stay open.,
Typical exceptional quality you'd expect from the NY times.,
A great app for a classic journal,
Bring back the old one! What idiot thought of changing that widget?!,
Great app. Userftiendly.,
Does what you need without too much stuff getting in the way,
Bhut bdia ba.,
Won't reckognize valid wi-fi connection. . .,
Too much restriction without paying,
This app sux!!,
Slow. No more than 3 articles aday. ???? Read usa today,
Worst app ever,
Got it all,
Just Love it,
"iOS has an official NYTimes crossword app, but not android. Please cross to this platform.",
Awesome app,
The best app,
Breaking news alerts are great,
Fantastic,
:-,
You gotta pay for this crap?,
Nice app,
Cool n nice,
It does what I need,
hi Quality news app,
Great App,
被中国政府屏蔽了啊，不能再用了么？ 为什么会在中国共产党就要封锁消息、禁锢思想意识@@~?,
"I like the content, but got this mainly for the crossword puzzle. It is not available. There's an NY Times crossword puzzle app for iOS, but not for Android. I hope this is coming soon!",
Awesome,
Excellent,
Great,
Excellent,
Zelda tucker,
Doesn't say this in the description but what you get is a few days trial and then access to 3 articles a day unless you pay. Not fond of the Times' reporting anyway.,
"Even for paid subscriber, there is an annoying ad banner at the bottom.  Back button functionality is irritatingly broken - takes you to the the section rather than where you were before. Breaking news alerts are sometimes ridiculous, with no way to customize preferences. Does not use standard menu button, and the custom menu button often stops working.  Better to use Flipboard.",
"Nov 2013 update - TOO MANY ADS - With a paid subscription, the bottom of every screen shouldn't be littered with ads; a full screen ad taking over everything shouldn't pop in your face every so many minutes.   I have to reinstall every week. Updates are slow. The widget doesn't self update. The most recent version is overloaded with ads. I have already paid for subscription why all the ads and why is NY times tracking my whereabouts?",
"See other tablet-based apps like the Boston Globe (in fact, NYT owns the the BG!) for how to do a tablet app without apps and the ability to choose between stories and the paper.  Plus, as a subscriber, I don't want any of the real estate cluttered with ads!",
"Poor service. 3 articles per day and they use advertising. Love the canned response they are giving about data. The truth is they can't decide if they want to use ads or go premium. They are trying to do ""freemium"" but don't realize they will lose more business by not reaching a proper middle ground.",
"I'm paying for this app and the update is failing! Fix our I will cancel! Update:  Had to uninstall, then re-install to gain access again.  Annoying.  If it had been mentioned in the instructions that I would have to do so, it would be LESS annoying, but not by much.  Shouldn't an update not require an un-install and re-install?  Looks great on tablet tho, so sticking with it.",
"Above all, what would be a decent app it's ruined by the incredible intrusive ads. The content--the NYT news and editorials--are basically single minded ""progressive"" talking points. However, they can be very informative if taken as the official view of the far left wing regarding the issues of the day, just make sure to balance with a view from the other side of the aisle.",
"Well, they went full pay for more than one access point. As I use tablet/smartphone/PC, no way but to pay. (Did find out I qualify for a discounted rate tho!) Love the new interface, especially the low-light grey on black theme!",
Settings menu is always bugged. The banner on the bottom is unremovable. No easy toggle for night mode.  Performance and caching seem to be improving.,
"I am fine with the NY Times seeking payment for access; newspapers need funds after all. However, if I am to be limited to only 3 articles a day the app should open the articles I actually select, and avoid opening articles just because I am scrolling through the options, and I am stuck with irrelevant news.",
"Five stars for the app,  reduced to one for the annoying banners at the bottom, which most of the time are   only needless hints and tips for the app itself, which offer a click through to subscribe to the service, which I've done already.  If I've missed something and there's a way to get rid of them,  then I will be happy to change back to five stars. Edit (two weeks later) : I am now being served full page ads as well!  Will not renew my subscription.",
Content is locked even when I log in with my valid subscription email and pwd. Ads load before content... Not good considering it loads slow..,
"I installed your app nearly two years ago. I could enjoy all the articles I wanted to read. All of a sudden, it is now a ""read 3 or pay"" app. The ""thank you for installing this free trial"" was a disingenuous surprise asm it was not a trial version when I signed up. I can understand policy change in order to make money, but what would it hurt to grandfather in your original core base of subscribers?",
I don't like the new 3 article limit. Especially when the app freezes and opens the wrong article. Total garbage update and will be using something else going forward. Too bad,
I have a subscription but the app won't let me look at more than 3 articles despite being logged in.  It also is displaying ads at the bottom.,
"Wow NYT, did you really have to force me to ""sign up"" without even being able just reading the headlines of the day? I didn't even click on an article. I should be able to at least browse the headlines for free! Going to uninstall. Seriously, corporate has taken this paywall thing too far.",
"I'd gladly pay for the app itself to get unlimited reading. After 4 months the rates are ridiculous, and if I'm not getting a hard copy or a true newspaper experience, I'm not interested. Onto another news app, I suppose. :/",
First you limit us to only the Top News. The new limit of only 3 articles a day is ridiculous. Deleting this app today. I'll get my news elsewhere for free.,
"The access to news is free only for 1 week. This is paid subscriptions based app. There are so many free news apps, better go for them.",
I had the same issues others are reporting that after the update it still prompted me to update.  I wound up completely deleting the app and reinstalling and it works fine now.  I shouldn't have had to do that but at least it now works again.,
"The app tells me that I can read three articles for free, or subscribe to their unlimited version. Thanks for being so generous NY times! I Don't short of ways to get news! I'm uninstalling the app right now.",
Online news should be accessible to everyone. Three articles a day doesn't allow one to fully benefit from knowledge that only is made available for those who can afford to pay.,
"After the update can not send comments to the developer, still don't get all sections to read as appear in the newspaper.  The article I did not mean to read counted as read while I was scrolling down.  None of the usual Android buttons worked. When I clicked menus it would not give me an option to share via email.",
"Can't use the app as it forces you to update...which I did.  It still has that stupid update notification, and that takes you to the play store or closes the app. Regardless, I can't read articles",
I'm uninstalling. I liked it when you could read all of the Top News only without a subscription. Made me feel more informed about the world. I'll just use another free news app.,
"I've read the New York Times for years and had a print subscription, but I can no longer afford news at such a cost. I'll get my news elsewhere.",
They should just reverse the changes. Everything was good back then.,
Dnt listen to the wack a*s MAINSTREAM MEDIA. Try alternative media like INFOWARS!,
Have installed and reinstalled the application without success on my galaxy s4.,
"Used to love this app, but now they limit you to 3 articles per day. Lame. Uninstalling this crap and switching to something else.",
I uninstalled because I tend to read all the articles on the top stories. But now cant and realized other news apps give me mostly the same stories. I just came back to this app and found the 3 articles a day thing.,
Unchristian and unorthodox to limit to 3 articles per day with free v.,
App keeps freezing pretty frequently. Moreover it freezes the entire device and I have to reboot my phone every time. Did someone do QA on this app at all?,
Won't let me read more than the 3 free stories even when logged in. Uninstall reinstall didn't fix.  Sent email to customer service 7/10. Will update after response. GS4,
Gosh... Only 3 free articles a day? and the slow navigation and update makes you mistakenly click on articles you don't want. Uninstalled.,
Update limited the number of articles you can read per day to three. Don't do it!,
Stopped syncing new articles a week ago. Very disappointed.,
Pay pay pay. I am sticking with the BBC.,
"On my buzy day, this is my favorite app!",
Only left-wing supported articles are reported.,
"No clutter, browse stories easily.",
"A 3 article limit? In the unfleged lingo of my generation: Not cool, bro.",
"Found it convenient and useful way to stay informed,",
Informative. Keeps you in the know.,
Doesn't work with subscription,
Not even .........menu is not at all opening.... irritated..... fix it soon...... pls.....,
can only read 3 articles then have to pay. removed it there are enough free news apps,
As I live in Australia most of the news does not apply to  me but I like to take a look at the reports now and then but now the have issued a 3 article per day limit which is very disappointing,
Just downloaded,
3 articles per day?  Useless.,
Aap,
This app will auto update regardless of your preference and even when ur phone is below 10% battery.,
Only 10 articles now,
Ads.,
You aren't selling gold. You are selling  news. Rather go elsewhere. And if your research finding that non subscribers read three articles is the only reason for you to adopt this stupid rule then I don't seem to get the point. I guess you just want Ppl to empty their pockets. The app was good but sorry can't buy something that I get for free. First ten free stories now only 3. Rather go with something drama free.,
"I'm a print subscriber of NYT and it is a good newspaper, but it is clear that they are complete imbeciles when it comes to digital media. The entire point of paying for digital subscription is to remove ads, but not only does NYT serve ads in their app, they also serve ads that sit at the bottom of the screen and can't be removed, making this app unusable. I'ts sad that one is better off using the web browser than a dedicated app - there at least you can read the text without an add taking 1 inch of your screen. They should increase digital subscription, get rid of the ads and fire the moron.",
"Unlike most news apps, the NYT app insists on updating ALL news section, even ones you never read, and it is incredibly slow until it's finished. Plus.sometimes links connect to the wrong article.  The new is good; the app sucks.",
"Today I opened the nytimes app, and had the app open for a while. Eventually a full page ad popped up, and there wasn't any way to clear it. Extremely disappointed with this. I am a paying subscriber, I feel that even the banner ads are pushing it. Seriously considering cancelling my subscription to the times as well as my weekend delivery if this is how they plan on treating me. I Would appreciate an explanation as well.",
Well this would be a top notch but apparently you have to pay to read the full articles. In a world where we are constantly getting digital media for free I think I'll pass on this. Get with the times New York Times. The younger generation will pass you up.,
"The pricing structure for digital subscriptions is absurd. Home delivery is $6.35/week for an actual paper. If I want a base level digital subscription for my computer and phone it's $3.75, not bad. Yet if I want tablet access as well the price goes to $8.75. There is no incremental cost that justifies an extra $5 for tablet viewing, let alone a cost above home delivery.   Your value proposition is daily news delivery not historical access. Fix the pricing structure and you'll get more subscribers.",
"The app works fine if you are on a good WiFi, open it, read an article, and close it.  It does *not* work well if you have weak signal.  There are two main problems: 1. If you open the app when you just lost signal - say, you just entered the subway - then the app tries in vain to reach the Internet for about 30-90 seconds.  During this time, the app shows NOTHING.  I already set up sync every four hours.  Why doesn't it just show me cached stories? 2. If you read an article over a long period of time, say you read a few paragraphs here and there over the course of the day, it will continually jump you to the top of the article, losing your place.  Very annoying.",
Frequently fails to sync new articles and shows nothing.  Switching between categories is often very slow.  On nexus 4,
"This app is solid, but as a paid subscriber I shouldn't have to see banner ads.",
Why should I pay for online content when I can access it from a mobile news website...,
"These greedy people arent satisfied with my 20$ monthly y, so they added also ads to this app: you have to wait for the add to disappear. A real waste of time, and money!",
This app was not working for me for the longest time. I reinstalled it and now its working great. I'm reading this four stars but I will come back and rate 5 if it keeps working.,
"Because of NYTimes swift action to correct this issue. I have since reinstalled the application and have altered my star rating.<--------------->I uninstalled this app today after having it for as long as I've had my phone (+2years). Why? Because the New York Times has decided that a full page United Health Care ad is more important than actual content. When I opened an article, the application instead opened an advertisement that provided no means to get past it. It just occupied the entire screen... So I uninstalled the application. Why would I use this application to read the news when it blocks that very information with an advertisement?",
"I downloaded this app and the next thing you know, the app is showing a blank white screen. Trying to open the menu but that comes and goes at the speed of light so I can't tap anything to go into the settings of the app.  What kind of an app have you guys made?",
"I turned off the updates for breaking news, only to have breaking news updates appear on my phone. This should be easy to fix, and should have been done by now, really.",
"This is ridiculous. A full page add? With no way to get rid of it? Or just minimize it? What is the point of a news app if I cannot read the news? This is completely unnecessary, and ruins an otherwise great app. The times is the best paper out there, but I'm finding an alternative paper to read on my phone. I cannot find an adequate way to describe how unnecessary making an app unusable for the sake of advertising is.----Update---- I came back to this app and low and behold, 3 articles a day. Fire someone.",
"After logging in, when I attempted to open an article, the app repeatedly asked for the log in info  preventing me from reading the article.",
"The log on page is dead, completely unresponsive. Won't allow me to log in from my phone. I'm a subscriber to the Times and as such I'm supposed to be given access to this site. Instead I'm getting shafted. I'd appreciate it getting fixed!",
Can't post comments using app.  Have to use regular website.  This review concerns the app and not the news paper which is excellent.,
"There is a lot to like about this new news app. But not only are ads present on the screen, but every few seconds the ads change. As good as the app is, the ads are too distracting and I am uninstalling.",
I have been reading the New York Times for over 35 years and for the last 3 I have not had to dirty my hands with newsprint or require a network connection at all times. Its a stable app on my Nexus 7 and Galaxy 10.1.  It's been continually improved with better and evolving multimedia capabilities.,
"As soon as the app auto updates, you can no longer find the article(s) you were reading. Also, recently, the app has been crashing constantly while reading articles.",
Usually opens the wrong article. Updates content s.l.o.w.l.y.,
I read the Times all day online at work. Then come home and read it on my phone. Never even had the urge to read NYT until I started working for them now I'm addicted lol.  ~NYT csr,
"It has some issues, and you can't select text, but it's a good and useful application.",
This app is not free.  You only get to read like 10 stories for free.  Doesn't make much sense when you can go to the mobile version on the website and get everything for free....  don't waste the space.,
Really biased news and you can't read most of the articles unless you subscribe,
"The functionality for breaking alerts seems pretty obvious: click the alert, go to the story. Instead I get the homepage and the entire paper downloads, with no breaking story.",
"Widget is constantly loading, does not display articles. App itself works fine.",
"Well, the things I read are covered by other services for free. So, NO!  Secondly, Ads after subscription. Uninstalling.",
I love NYTimes news (and pay for the monthly subscription) but the new full page ads on my mobile device prevent me from viewing news. Stop doing that!,
"Prawira, you should get a digital subscription for unfettered access.  I pay $15/month.  I don't bother with this app; I just go to the mobile=no website.  This app is getting worse...",
What happen with this app? Do we have to pay ¢99 to can read the entire of the news here? I have logged in but everywhere is just the paid news Please give me the reason,
"Nice Contents, but It is blocked in China.",
Reinstalled after months boycotting the app. Nice adjustments. Resubscribed!,
Drop down menu is buggy in this version. Can't share articles.,
I read this often for the quality of the reporting and commentary.  May the Times live forever!,
Why does the caption *always* have to fade out when viewing pictures in a slideshow? It's really annoying.,
"Useless upgrade, now unuseable, nice job NYT.",
Uninstalled.,
You cannot read any article without subscribing unistalling sham on you NY times,
My right to unintstall.,
The 3 free articles per day limit makes this almost useless as a news app for those without nytimes subscription,
I have an online subscription for NY Times. Why do I have to pay more for this?,
It's the best,
Edit: great again,
"Can't use the ""upgrade"".",
Why subscribe to read news when you can get it free on other websites and apps?,
Awesome job done by google.......salute to google,
"Since this evening, whenever I click on an article, the app opens my browser. Just... Why?!",
Nice 1,
Nice app,
I like,
Nice app,
Grt,
Crashes often,
Sorry not for Indians,
Works well,
Gud,
Ten articles!,
Best ever,
Nice,
"There is a full pg ad that you can't get rid of. As paying subscribers, there shouldn't be any ads lets alone one that prevents you from viewing any news material at all!!!",
I am a digital subscriber and I logged in but it still won't let me see the full articles. I'm not sure what to do. Please fix.,
Vinay,
Like it,
"Overall app is fine. I like it. The one star is only because of the fact that even after signing in with a paid account, I cannot get rid of ads on the bottom of the screen. I understand that The Times company is not making much money but showing ads to customer who pay for your subscription is not fair.",
"This is a great app, super usable and excels at providing news from the New York Times.  However, I would prefer it if night mode turned the background completely black for AMOLED screens.",
"I have a digital subscription, am logged in, but app tells me I need to subscribe to see article.",
"No complaints. Nyt is at the forefront of innovation, app & widget are a musthave.",
The best. Superb news including breaking news. Thanks NY Times.,
"They make you pay for a subscription to view any of the articles, which are all available for free online.",
Good one!,
Candy,
It's nice to get the Times offline when in flight or no internet access..but the app is laggy. While swiping between the articles...the app will stop while loading the next article and then go. Not so smooth. I have a fast Nexus 7 and fast internet connectivity so please optimize the app.,
"Long ago I gave this app 1 star for instability, but it has consistently improved, added features and polish. Today it is one of the finest and most indispensable apps in the Play store. A must-have for Times readers.",
"I'm just a 12-year old kid and I'm not really a newspaper reader, but since I've found NYTimes, I've realized that being informative is part of our daily life and NYTimes gives me that. 5 stars.",
"Sometimes shows a blank screen in the subway, even though I just updated it.",
Since update app is slower and crashes too often...worked way better before update,
I attempted to read an op-ed article and this app blocked access and served up an advertisement to subscribe for a promotional rate. So I opened the web browser and found the same article in full.  uninstallingthis/.  /dev notes that 10 articles per mo are free on browser/ this is even more reason to use browser... Not the dev's fault though/,
Scrolling is extremely laggy on nexus 4. And not a good designed app.,
Big photos are nice but the interface is clunky. And why is there an election section but I can't see any of Nate Silver's numbers and graphs from the website? Pretty useless for non-photo content.,
"It seems a lovely app, but the reading experience is disrupted by NYT ads at bottom of the screen, even if you are a paid subscriber.",
Every story I was interested in says you have to subscribe to see the article. Uninstalled.,
What a dumb was I.,
Harder to get to some sections,
Good,
Ok,
I enjoy the app and am a subscriber. I'm unable to look at today's newspaper and can't keep the menu box open.  I got out and it automatically closes afterwards.,
This app hasn't worked for me since the paywall update. Please fix NYT cause I need my news!,
This app has come a long way,
"Previously had seriously stability issues, but works great now.",
"This app is pretty great with a few flaws. I wish it had the lens blog, which is one of the best blogs on the new York times. Other than that, it's a great way to read news.",
I am a print subscriber of NYTimes. The Android app is neat and slick. Good Job NYT team.,
Prompts for update on samsung note ii in continuous loop.,
Won't run the updated version - just prompts me to update again!,
"My main app for news, which is a top use of my phone. Offline caching of news is functional and indispensable.",
"BBC,  guardian are much better than ny news",
The NY Times was a great source for news on the go.,
"Been requesting this feature for some time now.  The iPad HTML5 app has this feature, why not the native tablet apps?  Seems like a no-brainer.",
Unusable. Do not bother downloading.,
great app....I would definitely recommend it to everyone,
very useful!,
Thanks devs!,
Great,
"Update: after March 9 update, same problem. Update: After uninstalling and reinstalling the Feb 21 update it still crashes and I am not allowed to read articles.  Update: I tried again after the Jan 16 update but it still crashes.   Crashes repeatedly when entering my userid on Samsung Galaxy Tab (Gingerbread).  I have cancelled my NYTimes digital subscription as a result.",
"This is so slow, I dont remember reading your more than 2 news in past six month. When I open the app(generally once in two day), Keeps loading for some time, which I dont have patience. There are other news channel app which loads faster. Learn n fix this. Once fixed I will change the rating.",
"Despite the fact that I am a home subscriber and have linked my digital account, I am not provided access through the app to anything other than the top News articles. For No amount of un installing corrects the problem. I Repeated emails to help desk have produced noon results.",
Since when did news switch from being a right of the people to a way to get rich? Get your hands out of my pocket and report! Information is power. That doesn't mean you can bottle it and sell it. This is America. We have a right to know. When this app is free I'll reconsider the rating.,
"I read news on my phone, not a paper paper any more. Rather than getting the local paper, I have always liked the NY Times for the quality of its reporting, writing, editing and research. I paid for a subscription and then downloaded the app rather than reading in Google Reader or Feedly (my choice for a Google Reader replacement app, set startup to Latest to get similar functionality). It is not quite as usable as Feedly but not bad at all. It is fast, responsive, and pleasing to the eye. The only thing I would like added is a bit more swipe gestures as in Feedly. Recommended. If you whine about ads, then learn to root your phone and install AdfFree. If it's not worth that much effort, then quit whining. The paid papers are full of ads, too.",
"The New York Times is essential reading. Period. The app accesses all of the important sections, plus gives up-to-the-minute updates of breaking news. I knew about the Boston Marathon bombings just a couple of minutes after it happened. I carry about 10 news apps, but  this is the first one that I turn to.",
"I like it, but I often read the news in the browser after clicking items in the daily e-mail summary instead. I wish that that summary (which has slightly longer excerpts and items from all sections, not just Top News) was available in the app.",
"Main complaint is it could use better search functionality. As to all those one star reviews because of cost: since when has the newspaper been free? I'd like to see you go to the newsstand, pick up the paper and leave without paying. You would be visiting the local police precinct. The same applies here and on the website. You can see some of it for free but if you want full use, you pay. If you want it free you can go to the library.",
"This app has gotten bloated as it attempts to drive content consumption and subscriptions.  Awful app, good writing (for now).",
Efficient with minimum effort to achieve desired result. Tablet friendly. All readers should work like this. +5. The Read Phone Status permission is too invasive. [update] rating improvement due to NYT feedback which makes read phone status acceptable imo.,
Not that its a new concept.  Although I do feel disgusted at this level of greed.   Ny times is a bloated sucker fish we mistake for a nice big tuna (real news corp),
If you purchase the Times you have to pay extra to use it on your tablet along with your phone but its the same app as the phone.  Check out the Wall Street Journal app and you will see what a piece of crap this app is.  I like the Times but the app is garbage and it ticks me off to pay extra to use it on my phone and tablet.,
"The experience of the app is great; better with every release.   Please put the night mode in the main nav. I'm not pleased about the pricing model - tablet, phone, ads.  Its too complex.",
"I love reading NYT on the go.   However, even though  I am  digital subscriber and can access via Android on my Kindle the same isn't true for my phone.  I log in and every  stinking  time I still can't read the article I want to read.  The only time it 'worked' was when I uninstalled the app, reinstalled,  and I saw the article I was trying to read.  When I closed out and opened the app again I was asked for the log in,  I logged in,  and I got the log in screen  again.  Arrrrrrrrrgh!!!!",
Much improved over previous versions. If you left due to the truly awful previous versions its worth another try.,
I'm logged in as a subscriber but I can't access photos in any slideshow on my asus tf700t. It says network unavailable...which is not correct. Kind of a shame since the photos look interesting and my tablet has a nice big screen. Pls fix.,
Pretty good app if you're a paid up subscriber. The back button needs fixing to make it consistent with all other android apps.,
"Recent changes in this version: Crashes, charges after just a few articles, scrolling is atrocious. Uninstalled. Goodbye NYT, have fun becoming irrelevant. I highly recommend the USA Today app.",
The app is free but the majority of the content you must pay for.  Its a classic bait and switch scam.  Uninstalling.,
A better user experience than the web version. Best news source out there.,
"Really great format but I am a digital subscriber and this app won't keep me signed in. Called tech support and their only suggestion was to uninstall and reinstall. Which of course I had already done. I hope it will be fixed in a future version, then I'll try again.",
"Not an actual news app, just headlines, with links to ads to buy articles.",
"Nice app. Reading offline is great for those subway commutes. Navigating the application works, but it can be optimized (e.g. list some of the major navigational sections within a side navigation menu a-la YouTube or Google+). Other than that, this app great.",
"Since the last update, everytime I open this app my phone lags & an alert pops up that I'm low on space. Why does this app take up so much space?",
"A design flaw requires the app to update every section -- including Automobiles, Weddings and Fashion -- before you can start reading. This can take a minute or longer, an annoyance if your trying to check headlines in a hurry.",
What was a great app has become totally useless with non-stop force closing.,
Distributing fake news or heavily biased views to push liberal anti God agenda.,
I just wish I could read the breaking news stories for which I receive notification.  Don't tell me about news I can't read.,
I received an email last week from NYT last week asking me to upgrade to a tablet only subscription for just a few cents more. I did just that and now I am locked out! I was very happy with the app until today! Whats up???,
"Update: Much better. --- New version of app is horrible! Crashes often and won't log me in, so can't access most content. Do you have anyone testing before release?",
"In the last few days, the app just crashes again and again. What's going on? Will try uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that helps.",
Free to download but you need subscription to view the good articles. Subscription to read the news when the internet offers it for free? Pass.,
But why the hell are there ads when I pay for it already? Get rid of ads for paid subscriptions or I'm out of here. I'll happily go back to Huffington post for free with ads,
"The carpetbagger banner just doesn't seem to want to go away,  several weeks after the Academy Awards. I didn't want it there in the first place.  Please get rid of it (unless you're priming me for the 2014 show - and I still couldn't care less).",
This app shows commercials on the bottom of every page and they still want me to pay so I can read every article?,
I just wish subscriptions were more reasonable..... Duh,
"I'm an old reader of the Times; and now I can read it on the go, cool!",
It's a shame that the only android version is the phone version. I used to have an iPad and the tablet version for IOS blows away the phone version.,
To much stuff on one single page. Should be more interactive in terms of interface.,
Great app to read fave NYT articles on the go or in bed before you start your day!,
"It's great, NYT at my fingertips",
Works w/o any problems  for me (so far 3/12/2013).,
Works well on my droid bionic and my ipad.,
Couldn't live without it,
Works well note.,
The app is free but most of the content is by subscription at $1/month.,
Excellent app plus amazing content,
Not free anymore ...,
Cannot read without paying so why offer it as a free app?!,
Only OK.,
"Why i can't copy, cut, or paste?. I need that for doing my home work.",
I'm not paying for free news.  Switching to BBC news,
After getting it loaded it then tells you that you have to subscribe to read the articles,
Slow and laggy. And you want me to pay for this?!,
"Few contents, mostly are only for premium users",
Good work developers.,
Great !,
Its a nice appp,
Good,
Great app,
Excellent app,
warry warry nice,
Solid....finally.,

"As a non-subscriber, this app is only useful for the Top Stories section. Even stories that are available through the website are locked. Therefore also annoying that I can't update just the one section I've got access to instead of all sections at once. I prefer using the mobile website as it offers me access to much more content, but I'm sure this app is great for subscribers of NYT.",
"An improvement over the older version of the NYT app. The menu for sections is easier to use. The latest version corrects an authentication problem (the ""infinite loop"" asking for password), at least for me it did.  I still wish there was a way to disable the loading of photographs, or to defer it. I don't need all of the pictures, and the delay in loading them is noticeable.",
"Three articles huh ???haha no! uninstall yes!..do not take the update..I rolled back to an older apk file and I dont have any more ad or 3 article limit..I'll use that until I cannot. Older install (not on Google play) works fine..bypass this update.. Tell me something survey guys you know the ones who  comment on our posts from the New York Times. how's it going with all the negative reviews so far?? Hah! what stat bracket does that fall under, because there sure are a lot of negative reviews..",
I'll never trust NYT again after the Tesla drama. Canceled my subscription.   I won't pay for a NYT subscription till Peter Cohen is fired,
"I'm a home delivery subscriber and I don't have access to most content on here. I have a digital content account, I'm logged in, and I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app after the last few updates with no success.",
Many articles are pay to read... Almost the cost of a whole newspaper. That adds up quickly.,
"I had a 4x1 setup on the earlier widget and now the header ""top news"" takes up most of the widget. Please fix this.",
Most articles are locked. The only ones that are able to be read are the same stories on every other app. Not paying for news in this age. Wake up.,
Crashes every single time I open it.,
The newest widget is great! It looks beautiful and I'm hoping it doesn't have the bugs of the old widget :),
"Even after the most recent update, the app will not update to the most recent news, which renders the app and my subscription obsolete. Please fix this!",
"Good idea, but poor implemetation.  Fix please.",
"One of the things I want to use this app for is to email articles I read in hardcopy paper to people.  But on android, you can't search.  So I have to use their website.",
Latest version is f**ked. Was great.  Now won't accept subscription info. Useless.,
Great read. Love to read and catch up on the latest from the USA. Great articles by great writers.,
"As a Newspaper i always liked New York Times, so do i to the application of NYT !",
Too cool app I never saw before,
Thank you for the continued decades of world news.,
Here in Canada everyone knows that the NYtimes is the best newspaper in North America,
"Holo, gotta Love it",
Constantly freezes my phone and crashes consistently.,
good looking but ads spoil it,
It's realy a good software,
Not crazy about finding out when I try reading an article that I have to sign up to continue.,
First app to require payments to read articles... No way!!,
"Such, as...? Why, not allow copy, cut & paste,...",
Why do I have ads when I *pay* for a digital subscription?,
Too good..!,
Worth the money.,
Terrible,
Great,
"Hmm,",
Mr,
K,
Night mode and a scrolling  customizable widget; I'll take five!,
Why does this app asks for access to my phone number and also to numbers that I call?,
Good,
"I love the Times and I really like that I can navigate the paper and read multiple articles while underground on the subway during my commute.    However,  to do this I first need the app to properly load.  This can be challenging at times.    Often,  when I click to read an article,  a different one actually loads up for me to read.  25% of the time I would say.    Needs improvement but this app has potential",
Last month I was told to upgrade my digital  subscription or lose digital access via my tablet.  I decided to go with Sunday only delivery which includes all digital access. I have spent many hours on the phone but my tablet never worked and I never got a delivery either.  I cancelled but even that was a headache the first time I tried. Finally spoke to someone competent today who didn't try to block me... I will miss you NY Times...too bad you messed with the app that used to work with Nexus 7.,
"This NY Times app is just perfect using Jellybean and Nexus 7. Smooth and fluid, finally a digital version I prefer to reading the physical paper. Far easier and faster to use than the times website. Elegant design, beautiful navigating, all the photos and Times videos you could want, not to mention the best News, Culture, Op-Ed, and NYC Metro Area coverage that money can buy.",
"This is a decent app for reading the news. The reason I don't give it a higher score is because of usability issues. For example, when I get a notification about breaking news, it doesn't bring me directly to the news item, but rather to the section. Also, I have found that when I go to certain stories and use the ""Back"" button, instead of going back to where I was, I am brought to the top of the headers page. Sometimes, I will come back to a section instead of the Top Stories level, although I haven't paid attention to how that happens.",
"Wow. Finally. FINALLY an NYTimes android app that measures up to the Times' content. This app has improved dramatically and is finally worth using. From worst app ever to one of my favorites. Well done, NYT, though it sure took u a while...",
"Used to work fine on my Galaxy Tab, but new version crashes when trying to log into paid subscription. Emailed, but no help. Have updated and reinstalled, all to no avail. Guess I will quit the $20 a month fee, as the app is useless.",
"After purchasing the digital package which include PC and smartphone access, I still can't login to this app using my valid ID. Why is this app so buggy? Users are paying for content here and we expect a usable  product.  As a result of not being able to login, I am viewed as a visitor with limited access.  Content = great.  App = horrible.",
"This app is very disappointing, as a journalist I felt compelled to support my industry and I purchased a subscription for this app. After a month of use I am left with a slow loading app that crashes regularly, takes forever to update new articles and often I find myself clicking an article title only to be brought to a different article. Now my phone is ""old"" (2 years--Motorola Droid X) but I don't have these problems anywhere else on my phone than this app. So many things could be added to make this app better, like a search and archive feature? Why can I only browse a few days back? If this app did not come with a subscription fee I would not be complaining but I feel like my beloved New York Times has overlooked my wants as a consumer of their product and really dropped the ball on what could be a great app. Will continue to use this because I paid for a year subscription, hopefully by December they have updated the app to warrant another $90 of my hard earned money, but if things continue this way I don't think it is in my interests to continue being a NYT reader.",
"Only the ""top news"" is free. You have to pay to read anything else. It loads way too slowly to be worth any amount of money. I have the internet, so news is free",
"People, get USA Today and LA Times respectively. They are free and cache the news. No need for wifi sig all the time. NYT will regret this stupid idea",
I can no longer get to the comments section of news stories.  Works fine on the computer but not my android phone ne.  Stopped working on Feb 12.,
The v3.x update is gorgeous and looks great on both smartphones and tablets -- but it now recognises tablets and requires a more expensive subscription for those than for smartphones only.,
"I am happy with the upgrade but please make it like the iPad version, including a dictionary.",
I have a subscription for my laptop and smartphone. They demand a second subscription for my tablet. What a rip off. Clearly the NYT does not understand living in the Cloud.,
"I read WSJ, LAT, Times of London, FT, and a few others.  But none of them have as smooth, intuitive, and an overall well rounded app for tablets as NYT.  I am a paying subscriber and I feel I get a good value for money; excellent app and  great content.",
"I pay money every four weeks to have a subscription, I don't want ads. Otherwise the app is great, but I don't want to pay for more ads.",
"I've had this app for a total of 2 days and it has quickly become my favorite source for news and articles even with the subscription cost, viewing is near perfect on my Nexus 7.",
"This app gives you free access to the top stories, but for access to more news or sections you need to pay and subscribe. They offer a 99cents/month teaser rate, but that goes sig higher rates/month.  But the access to the top stories section is still worth it, but NYT needs to reduce its subscriber rate/month, to get my business.",
Downloaded this to keep up with the news since my paper subscription ended. This app isn't worth it. You have to pay to view other articles that aren't on the latest news. It's better to just use the browser on your smartphone since you can read all the news without paying.,
Quite slow and doesn't refresh everything at once so seems to be constantly refreshing. Must pay subscription to read articles. Wast of time. Try news republic app.,
The updated tablet layouts and lack of intrusive ads (if you're a subscriber) make this app a nice news-reading package.,
"Kudos to the developers, but I still spend most of my time in the printed edition.",
There are very few articles u can read if any at all without having to pay. Other apps from other newspapers are much better,
I had this app 2 years ago. I loved it. I just downloaded it again. It is now 99 cents every 4 weeks. But this is without the best and easiest way to read a paper on your phone.  I highly recommend it!,
"It took then awhile, but this is now a really nice app for both the phone and tablet",
No news since jan 31. Uninstalling doesn't work,
Wow!  I love getting my news from the NYTimes!  Now I have access to news from anywhere anytime from my phone!  Absolutely the best creation of the century!  Well at least one of the greatest luxuries of my time.  I trust NYTimes to get the news I'm interested in and respect their long history of distinguished reporting.  I get it and you should too....,
Not bad but too many other options out there for free,
Other apps out there dont require payments,
Constantly rings when updating even when alarm and update are off,
"Using the app on my nexus 7 is just a juddery scrolling mess, hurts my eyes.",
Helpful to subscribers.  Not much to offer as a free service.,
"Free to download, but not free to read. Constantly forces to close.",
It is a great app for the ones who wants to know about the world events from a reliable source.,
"Hate apps that label themselves as free when they are not.    The ap here is free, the content isnt. Fair enough but inform us of that. Isnt that what media is supposed to do?  Inform?",
"Very little free content here. The app is free, but that's about where it ends.",
Not paying newspapers anymore.. thought it was free. Especially after the six month price... sell some ads or something and don't pass this off as free. Fun trick!,
The app crashes when open through notifications...,
But I want to read offline when I update,
Great app. It's useful and has a nice UI.,
Seems better but fix the widget.,
Awesome addition.  Thanks,
Fresh and insightful,
Now I have NY Times with me wherever I am.. Thank you so much..... I do love it..... :),
Not free at all. Takes so long to update each time. Uninstalled.,
Love reading the well written and researched articles.,
"This app tracks the users location, WHY??!  And have to pay to read :/",
Paying for news that you get on the BBC app for free...,
Very slow after update. Can you do something?,
Free?   Seriously?   Until you download it and try to read a story.,
Boring.,
Thanks for the app,
Nice,
Masterjetty,

"The most recent update is a big downgrade for me. It takes longer to load and to refresh. Worst of all, it doesn't save stories in cache anymore. When I open it in the nyc subway, it tries to load new stories. No connection! Unlike before, now I'm staring at a blank screen and can't read previous stories. Such a moronic update!",
"I cannot log in, cannot read anything but headlines. Every time I try to log out an re-login it crashes. Unacceptably frustrating. NYTIMES & herald tribune both advertise that a print subscription includes digital access to both but the page to link to your subscription is only for those in the states with no option to put in your subscription number. total disaster shows they don't I think about their intern  ational subscribers--shame! Still not working! Deduct one more star.",
"Basic article reading and offline caching work as they should but that's about it.  There are glaring bugs in ""advanced"" features that shouldn't be very hard to fix, yet remain for months.  Very unprofessional.  Example: breaking news alerts.  They work, but when I click on them I'm sent to the front of the Top News section...or the app just opens.  Where is the detail?  At the top of the screen there will be a single sentence with teaser text but clicking on the text brings me nowhere.  Another example: on tablets there is currently a giant ad that takes up the first third of the screen.  Not only is that a ridiculous waste of screen real estate, but it is ALWAYS THE SAME IRRELEVANT ADVERTISEMENT.  It has been that way for weeks.  Yet another: The desktop widget lets me click on articles that are no longer ""available"" and drops me into whatever section I was last reading.  Clearly it WAS available....and the tablet caches articles for offline reading.  Where did the content go?  If the widget downloaded the brief, why not fetch the whole thing and let me read it when clicked?  Next time it refreshes, it can ditch the stale article.  Don't show me content I can't read.",
"It does what it should. There are times when old stories will not appear until the app finishes updating, which is quite obnoxious since I have the update off.. It will also run in the background on it's own even with all the update settings off. This issue is the only reason why I don't use this app anymore. I'll stick with Minimalist Reader, thank you.",
So they show you a bunch of op-eds etc and you have to subscribe to read them.... this app has been getting steadily thinner in accessible content for d some time. Pity,
"I'm surprised that the New York Times Android App isn't very good.  It's slow, you can't customize to a black background, and it doesn't present the paper for different days, you only get the latest.  The app is slow to load, and when alerts (notifications) are sent, they don't link to the corresponding article!  Finally, they charge extra for the privilege of accessing their content from a 7"" tablet instead of the web or a phone.",
"Have had a digital subscription for ages but can't get the app to recognize that! And I'm not International (as someone else with the same complaint is). I'll call NYT and see if I'm missing something, but so far I'm mostly annoyed.",
Although i have an account that works on other android devices this account credential doesn't work on my Acer a200 tablet running ICS,
"The UI is great, and this app is a big reason I cut back from a 7-day to a Sunday-only subscription of the newspaper.",
Slow-loading images make layout jump so you press the wrong thing. Amateur.,
Poor for now. Dosen't do anything for me either except in the browser. No wonder Murdock is losing billions in his media empire. The Conglomerate can't even make a good app.,
"This upgrade has been a disaster so far. All content except the top stories now appear to be locked. Logged in and out and problem persists. Also ads seem a lot larger - this seems unfair... Though perhaps that will get fixed with my login problem.  I think what happened is my nexus 7 is now considered a tablet, not a smart phone as it was before the upgrade. That is another 20 bucks a month I have to pay. :-(",
Mis leading. It's not free. Lies lies lies. Just like the politicians,
"I refuse to pay twice for the same content on both my phone and tablet! I don't need a some ""slick tablet"" app. the phone app was/is fine on my Nexus 7. Now I have to either pay $35 for access to both ($15 for phone, $20 for the tablet) or resume a Sunday subscription to the paper, just to throw it away every week. Come on NYT!!! Give me and option that makes sense!!! :(",
"The app just refuses to let me sign in and read articles, even after I enter my login information. I am a print subscriber of the International Herald Tribune. I can't seem to make this app work, even after installing the fix that supposedly got rid of this problem.",
"I can't login to my account to read news on android tablets and support tel me I need a different type of tablet subscription, but in the profile setup there is no option for a tablet subscription. I give up.",
"I've been a Times digital subscriber for years, but this app repeatedly refuses to accept my ID and password (which work fine on everything else, including the browser on the same phone!) No point having the app if it only lets you read the headlines.",
"Well, its great to get all news on my mobile. But why have they restricted me to get all the news? I can access them from my computer. So why can't I access it here? Ridiculous..I use Pocket as I can save particular news from my web browser and access it through my phone when I am free.NYTimes should think about it seriously.",
"The app is fine, no problems.  The big issue is not being able to read the articles unless you pay.  Not useful unless you want to pay per article.",
Recent updates have made this app finally usable. Best feature: app automatically syncs all news while you are sleeping. Would like to see option to disable syncing upon opening app to save battery life. Also black background white text option would be great.,
I have a subscription but the application doesn't allow me to log in and read content. Please fix this buggy version. Until such time I'm going to cancel my account and use the Financial Times.,
It is slow and hard to work with. Better read in a browser.,
Tells me I need to login to see content. I am logged in. Login works on Times web site and lets me see paid content there.,
Don't understand how this app gets anything above 2 stars. Un installed and installing cnn. Cnn is completely free and has better articles than the times.,
"You can only view top stories, otherwise you pay $8.75 a week! Great app but I can read the news for free thanks!",
this app drains battery like hell! don't even bother to install it,
Can't get all the stories I can get on the site without paying. No thanks.,
"Stopped working on nexus 7. Login succeeds, but articles still locked. Still works on nexus 4. Both are running android 4.2.1 and nytimes 3.0.1.",
"Already a digital subscriber, but refuse to pay more. Forget it. Uninstalling.",
How hard can it be to accept logins from paying customers and give them the content they paid for? Too hard for the nyt. Waste of my time  .,
"Only worthwhile as a subscriber, everything is locked otherwise.....and available for free a billion other places.",
I enjoy being able to use this app on my smartphone but to have to pay more for another subscription to read on my tablet is super lame.  I'll stick to the nytimes webpage on my tablet.,
How about you just make us pay up front? No sense in having a free app when you have locked articles. Uninstalling.,
Still unable to link my account. Please fix this!,
Biased as hell,
When u PAY for a subscription you should not be subjected to ADs that block ANY portion of the already limited real estate of a smart phone...for ANY length of time...it is just inexcusable...I will be canceling mine.,
Can't click on breaking news,
Get my news and information hmk. Absolutely classy hmk.,
On galaxy s2. Xlent content.,
This app asks you money in order to read the articles you get for free in thair page. No thank you.,
Premium fake news..,
What is the point of the app if all I can read are headlines? :/,
in china  we cannot read,
New format very good,
Pay for the news is bloody ridiculous like really? -_-,
Much better,
Godd,
Great,
Can't login,
"The NY Times app used almost 1GB data during the last 30 days, almost half my total data usage though I use it rarely. iPhone users report similar behavior. I hope Settings/Update frequency/Never (Manual) fixes the problem. Samsung Galaxy S2, Times subscriber.",
The new add on the screen takes up too much space and glares at me the whole tine I use the app. Would be acceptable if the news was free. But even with a subscription I have to see it. Too many other good apps for me to bother with this one due to the add.,
"Looks good on a 7"" and the free content is great. But $20 a month is a bit too pricey for me. One can get an annual subscription to the National Geographic Magazine on the iPad for ONLY 29.99. That's 29.99 A YEAR. Browse Zinio and you can find a year's deal for $15 or less. NYT is charging $20 a month. I know your articles and writers are all boss but really. $20 a month. Get on with the (digital) times, NYT.",
"I updated, and I get the New York Times banner, but the rest of the screen is blank.   If I could give it zero stars, I would.",
"For $5 per week (which officially makes this the most expensive app I have) I expect a much better user experience. This design might be fine for a phone, but it's a very poor use of space on a tablet.  Also, why not let me use my Google account to subscribe, like any other periodical?",
The app no longer holds my place in an article when I send a text and return to it. This makes casual reading far more frustrating.,
App was great on my blackerry and I loved it. Wont work on my SG 3. One of many reasons piling up making me wish I had gotten another blackberry and not the SG 3,
Used to work great. Now crashes constantly. Really disappointing. Actually thinking of now cancelling my paper sub as well.,
This app finally catches up to her iPad sister...,
"Love the new tablet layout!  This is a great app now.  Fast, responsive, stable, and pretty, especially on a Nexus 10 screen where the typography really shines.  The banner ad in the tablet layout is a bit large, but as long as the ads are not too distracting, it could be alright.  The banner also scrolls off the screen instead of permanently taking up screen space, which is a nice touch.",
"Looks great on a Nexus 7, with a much improved layout and use of space.",
"Amazing job redesigning the app and optimizing it for tablets. Following Android design guidelines has really made this one of the best news apps on the Play Store (and, you know, that whole world class journalism helps too). Love it on my phone, but it's even better on my Nexus 7. It's now my go to device for reading the NYTimes :-)",
It's nice to see developers spending time updating their apps with better tablet support,
"App is quite good, but i hate seeing flashing advertisements.",
"Awesome app! Helps me to keep me updated about happenings around very easily. Get it, you would love it.",
"Does their circulation dept want to call me to sell me stuff? Identifying me by my phone number? Not cool, NYT!",
Finally the app works great on my Nexus 10 and I can access everything with my tablet subscription!,
I am a subscriber. Since the update I haven't been able to access the articles. If this situation continues I might as well cancel.,
"not free! try to read articles on app ..must have a or buy a subscription,",
App crashes when you try to log i.,
latest version adds a beautiful look and interface to absolutely indispensable content.,
"Earlier versions sucked, but it now works quite well.",
Paying $35 a month should not come with advertisements. I understand if were viewing for free.,
Tried all the news apps this one is fast great display easy to view,
Glad to hear NY Times articles with the Acapela Will voice,
"but I have a digital subscription for tablets, why can't I then use it on my Galaxy Note's huge screen to benefit from the tablet layout??",
You got to subscribe to read the article's,
Don't replace your old version as this new version expects you to be a subscriber.,
I'm a subscriber. Can't log in.,
Every article should be free.  It isn't.,
None,
Why should paid Su scribers see ads?  One time the ad was huge and took up half the screen.,
Finally,
Joy to the tablet ui is here.,
"Just stopped working Dec 17th. Will not update. I reinstalled and it then updated when the app was installed.  Afterwards, it does not update. Crappy",
Now that I have a big inbuilt memory (no need for Sim card) the app is useful again.,
"Some of the news articles are irrelevant if you don't live in New York, but from time to time you find good articles worth reading no matter where you live.",
I already pay for a subscription. My screen is small enough without having 20% taken by ads.  Uninstalling and plan to cancel our subscription.  Good luck with your new business model.,
Do I have to pay twice to read the dead tree version on the subway and then in my house? My digital subscription should be for all my digital devices. Charging $20 a month more just to read the Times on my Nexus 7 is absurd.,
Crashes/ freezes every single time. Please fix,
Remove the ads for paying subscribers.,
I am grateful for tablet optimization. BUT... now I get a GIANT ad up on top of category listings. We already pay you for this service via our subscription. Why do we still get ads? And why so huge? At least give us a 99 cent option to get rid of ads if you absolutely have to have them.,
The best news app is back. Updating the news over 4G LTE works again!,
Stories are refreshed throughout the day. VZW Gnex,
"No more crashing, everything loads much faster, and widget seems fixed. Thank you!",
Finally developers are starting to update their apps for tablets!!!,
Ads for paid subscribers,
Greatly improved,
"Works well enough. Only complaint is that whenever a breaking news notice comes in the notification bar, clicking on it doesn't open said news article and instead just opens the last section read. This is annoying since when a breaking news article arrives you expect to read it quickly instead of wasting time searching for it. It should be intuitive that clicking on the breaking news notification opens the actual article.",
"Thank you for the fantastic journalism. But I do have a few concerns with app. I miss the 'recommended for you section'. It would be great if I could highlight words to check them in the dictionary (like The Guardian's app), and if I could copy text from the articles: so when I share my favourites on facebook etc, I can give my friends a taste of it. I have no problem with the ads as a subscriber, they don't seem too many to me.",
I bought a subscription in the app for $15/month and all the ads immediately disappeared. Feels good to be able to pay for great journalism and good software without paying for ads.  :-),
"Works great, and the customer support team is awesome if you do have a problem. Most of the people complaining either aren't actually logged in or they aren't paid subscribers. In this day and age of terrible news coverage, people forget quality news actually costs money. Good journalists want paid.",
"The app improves steadily and it's a nice way to read the Times. But the ads are quite irritating, particularly given I pay for a subscription, they can't be dismissed, and some even... blink. Yes, really. Yikes.",
"Issues: when you click on breaking news alerts, nothing opens.  Also, when you click on the widget it just spins forever.",
"If you read a whole load of this spin and biased reporting, you will lose your sense of truth and justice. Mainstream media is dangerous.",
Basically the app is a giant ad within an ad.  Click on a headline and you see a subscribe to NY times button and another ad under that.  If you subscribe I'm sure it's great but if you don't then it's probably not worth your time. Clean app layout is nice however.,
"My go-to source for news when im mobile. The Times does not dissapoint with this app, which they continously improve.",
I have the hardest time convincing this app toq update.  It is really frustrating to have to uninstall and reinstall to get the most recent news!,
Does not update on 3g/4g. Sort of makes it unusable if traveling.,
It's awful how when I click on an article it takes me to a completely different one. Fix this David Brooks.,
This app makes you pay to access articles you can read for free on the mobile website. Major fail. Uninstalling now.,
It's good right now but updates often render it unusable until a fix comes out.,
"Works pretty well on a phone, but the tablet version is just a phone app scaled up",
Both my husband and I have individual paid subscription s and we cannot access the articles! Is this supposed to be this hard?,
Doesnt open.,
"Excellent. I wish there was an ad free version for subscribers, though.",
Getting better all the time. Variable font size is a blessing for older eyes.,
"The app is slow and puts ads at the bottom of the screen, creating severe distractions while reading an article. is this how subscribers should be treated?",
Great reporting.,
Get it. You'll never regret it,
The app has improved tremendously.,
"Updating on 4g is broken. Seriously, how is it possible to release such a huge bug and then not fix it?",
All the features from on line and more!,
Amazing app. I love it.,
"Only few headlines are free, everything else requires subsribing with money.",
The video reports  don't play.,
Updated now ads all the time even as a subscriber.,
No updates on 4G seems weird. Will raise two stars when it is fixed,
"Weekly payment, ads, and slower...cmon. I used this every morning and every night but its back to the AP app for me.",
Wish more was free,
Fake news,
Annoying app,
Excellent,
Love it,
"I'm sorry, but this news is available for free from so many other sources on the internet today. You only get access to a handful of articles & The rest are locked & need to have a subscription from this app. I find it annoying to even open this app as it leads to false promises & disappointment. Also, the ads on the bottom of the free version are the most obnoxious ones I have ever seen. Pardonbthe pun, and but I'll change my rating once they get with the ""times""",
Not slow at all.   I guess there's a lot to process for a slower phone.  But I have only had speed and great functionality.  Very user friendly app: especially the different font sizes,
"You get the headline and lede, then you have to subscribe to read the rest of the article. If you get the daily email, they've nö made clicking-through fail from phones. If they're changine policy, why not just say so?",
"Very nice but memory hog  Edit: Most of the memory usage came from the ""download"" service... I switched off automatic updates and memory consumption went down from over 100mb to around 50mb.",
"Finally worth 5 stars. Better text sizing, no ads for subscribers, and relatively fast action (all of which were former problems). Even has option to read out loud on Jelly Bean!",
"...don't give access to the particular article cited in the alert, it just reopens the app where I last left it and I have to navigate to the alerted content haphazardly.",
This app is poorly designed and very slow. A free application such ad eorld newspapers that feeds ny times is much better.,
"I pay for a subscription to the NYT and while, yes, so do paper subscribers they are much less distracting in print form.",
This is the best way to swallow the tripe of the bourgeois ruling class.,
Still very buggy. If updating often: huge bandwith consumption. Eats up loads of internal memory even when installed on SD. Annoying: I pay for a subscription and still I get ads.,
good app. but breaking news notification doesn't work.,
"Finally, much improved. Still has ads, even for subscribers and they take a while to load.",
"Waste of time, just read online.",
"This was a great app before it was ""updated"" for the pay wall -- now it freezes & loads ads way before articles. FIX IT or bring back the old app.",
"Less than stellar, but works decently if you aren't paying by the byte.",
Zeitweise erscheinen broken image Link s und andere peinliche Fehler im newsfeed. Ansonsten das übliche praktische newsfeed app,
This app doesn't reflect the quality of the website. Slow and crashes.,
Freezes on news update. Same deal with iphone version. Somehow huffpo manages to update in seconds. Why can't nyt figure it out?,
"The display mode (night) for ""Video"" is nice.  Why not make it available as an option for the rest of your contents?",
"Often slow, especially the blogs section, even on a Nexus One",
"I like reading nyt stories, but the app notifies you of ""breaking news"" that isn't easily found when you click through. if it's breaking news, shouldn't be at the top of the page when you go to news stories?",
But now every time I start this app I get sent to the nytimes page in the android app store. Can you guys try a little harder please? htc incredible,
Live how I can access news with literally one touch,
NYT. Still the best Journalism available.,
Doesn't work good.messes phone up,
My most used app,
it's great for nexus 7.very useful and convenient,
There are too many ads!,
Works well CNN is now down.,
Looking better and better with every update,
I love it,
News papers should not endorse presidents Uninstall,
Not really free ...subscription required,
Not very much depth in articles ...,
Great!  :-),
One of The Best.,
Ok,
Garbage,
"The interface looks nicer. but it is extremely difficult to scroll through an article. it almost treats every paragraph as an article and trying to select it.  if you hold an article in the list for a longer time, then it becomes selected and after that i cannot open any other article. i have to quit the app and restart to the select an article to read.",
"I have a Droid X2, and I love this app. It is designed beautifully, it loads quickly, and the UI is seamless. I would absolutely love it if it didn't crash EVERY SINGLE TIME that I open it. It's like a preview of the app. I open it, I get five seconds of reading pleasure, and then the app crashes. This is not the sort of quality I expect from the New York Times, but I trust them to fix it.",
"The content is great. I am a paid subscriber, and am happy with the printed paper and website. The Android app's blinking and flashing ad, however, interferes with my enjoyment considerably. I understand that ads are necessary and I have no problem with that. But please, make them less obnoxious. The mobile website is actually a better experience than the native app because the ads scroll with the pages on the website, while they are static and in my face on the app.",
"The last update was much better than this one. Now, everytime I touch the screen to scroll the background turns blue. You let go, back to white. The result? Constant flashing! Terrible. AND you know longer know which article you've read. Just terrible. It used to go gray, now all article titles just stay bold black!",
"When they implemented a new paywall last year, they rushed out the update too soon, resulting in an app which was slow and buggy.  They fixed it later and the app was great.  Now the story repeats again, another update, more ads, slow performance and freezups... let's hope they get this one fixed soon.",
"The updated app looks nicer, but the functionality is much worse. It takes multiple clicks and 10 seconds of waiting to open an article. The background constantly flickers between white and gray. The old app worked quite well. Very disappointing.",
"Newest update (Oct 12) has ruined it when it finally could do its task. I'll give it stars again when it stops force closing twice a day, and draining my battery.",
"I all of a sudden got a breaking news alert from this app. Checking my settings, I noticed they were changed to automatically download every 24 hours, likely the last time I updated. Deleted app; FU NYT!",
"I have breaking news notifications disabled in settings, but that doesn't stop this app from giving them to me anyway.",
Just wish more were free. Don't really like the free sections. Would give it five stars if you could pick one section you want to be free.,
Still slow and some force closing. This app still needs work.,
"Before upgrade, looked great on my rooted nook.  Unreadable now.",
Buy an iPhone instead of android device. This app really looks cool and can give you better performance and graphics than any android devices.,
"Like the new UI, but the widget looks worse than before. Takes up entire width of my Galaxy S2 and just doesn't look right. Old widget looked better",
The new user interface is much less user friendly than the old one and most importantly they now include pop up ads which is abhorrent as you pay for a subscription. I wish I could have the old one back.,
The flashing banner ads make it almost impossible to pay attention to the story.  I would pay for a version without them but it sounds like everyone gets them.,
I do not see ads on my kindle but I do see ads on android with subscription.  Very obtrusive.  Completely mar the app.,
"Love the new updated look, however the widget is now completely out of place. Its the right style, but its better than any other widget, system or non.",
"I agree, the new Droid layout is nice, but I prefer functionality over aesthetics... It takes me multiple clicks to get an article to open, which is very frustrating.",
"Hey NYT.  Tired of the Fidelity popups.  Put in a ""don't show again box"".  After the 15th time just this AM, it's old.  Let's see some of that class the Times had been known for.",
I get the top stories for free so I can't complain. Would like the opnion however.,
"I like the app. I just wish it had the ability to view ""todays paper"" and previous ones like the website does.",
I wish it would be less voracious in memory use (the operational data kept).,
"At least as good as Times Reader 2.0 for computers.  Saving and sharing are even better on the app.  Constantly improving, and support is responsive.",
"Like the app, especially offline access, but would be nice if print subscribers didn't have to unlock the articles every single day.",
"I'm (most probably like everyone else) paying 15$ a month to get the news and as such don't want to be irritated with ads. A good app, but you won't go any further than 3 stars as long as ads are there.",
Loving the new font sizing. But the constant color change of the 'selected' article as I swipe up is going to give me a seizure. It goes white to grey and back again.,
"I like the new look & interface, but smaller fonts for my small phone would really be appreciated.",
First I discover the new update turned notifications back on when my phone wakes me in the middle of the night to tell me some dude I never heard of died.  Then I try to open the app to turn them back off -- and it keeps hanging perpetually.  So now I have an app that's nonfunctioning except to pester me with unwanted notifications.  NYT FAIL.,
"I can't update news now. The updating news server is blocked in China by great firewall. If you can change your server address to bypass the China great firewall, it would be great. Anyway, this is not your fault.",
The new Holo theme is awesome. It fits in well with Jellybean. The new version is also so much faster and doesn't crash like the old one. Keep up the awesome work!,
"The new version of the app has greatly improved in terms of stability and usability. It now uses a more standard android interface, and looks a little prettier to boot. I'm doubling my review from 2 to 4 stars. Great work, Times (from a subscriber).",
"Now that the app is actually working, i can try out some of the new features, and i like it.",
"Good update -- Holo is nice, the ads are a bit annoying -- but I can live with them. Only thing I'd suggest adding is a dark mode for nighttime reading. Keep it up.",
The sept 2012 redesign is great. The app runs more smoothly and the fonts and presentation make it look more like the newspaper. It has a proud presentation. Seems like the developers finally get a grip on Android. And now for an Android tablet app!,
"Best news app I use at the the moment, after the update. Functionality and appearance much improved.",
"Used to be good, now everything is locked down behind a paywall. Uninstalled.",
The reason I gave a three star is there are ads even I am a paid subscriber.,
Uses undeclared push notifications to wake you up at night. No way to disable.,
#NAME?,
plz show for the grey highlighting to be turned off. really annoying to read with it on.,
"Force closes all the time now, was much better as a free app, also takes up too much memory...awful evo",
I've had this app for years first on the Palm and now that I moved to Android and they just updated the app this thing ROCKS!  I love it.,
Used to be a great app. Now I'm unistalling it. Too big and slow.,
"Excellent refresh.  I used to think the mobile website was just as good, but now this app surpasses the browser experience with its quickness and nice UI.  Ads don't bother me; after all, the print version had ads, so what?",
"A white background with black text is a serious battery drainer (and hard on the eyes when in a dark room), any chance you could add an option to view articles with a black background and white text?",
"Paying for subscription, updated app has larger ads. Thanks nytimes",
Good app. A dark theme (for reading at night) would bump this to 5 stars.,
Phone or tablet this app is garbage as far as functionality not content.,
"I'm sorry, I thought I was paying a digital subscription fee. Ads I have to close before viewing the story are unacceptable. I don't mind a banner ad, but this is a bit much.",
Uninstalled it becausrpe it wadps too biased,
No way to disable news alerts,
Very good app except the UPDATE Made the ads Huge !,
Much needed. Well done!,
It's gotten better,
Looks and feels great.,
"Great app, really liking the new design!",
Great app. Use it all day everyday.,
Much better experience.  Thanks!,
You have to subscribe to fully use this app.,
Stories on the app are a day older than what you can find by going directly to the website.  This has been going on for a few weeks now.  What gives???,
Much improved. Now usable.,
Unless you gother an account your just look ing act headliners ...,
New update made a good app even better.,
Best news source period.,
Love this!,
... Finally updated...THX guys!,
Why can't you search for articles? Absolutely ridiculous that you can't.,
"I cannot update.  When I try to install again,  I even  cannot download... what's going on?",
As a subscriber...why do I have ads?,
That one Does anybody over at the new york times care at all about this app?,
Before this update I could scroll thru a story with my keyboard. Now that's gone :(,
crashes all the time!!!!,
So nice now,
First it was a small banner at the bottom. Now it's full page ads that cover the whole screen.,
Latest updates are nice,
Why am I paying $200+ per year?,
Improved,
Love the new UI,
Simple and informative,
it's not free!,
I like it,
To reduce strain on eyes especially at night this app needs option for black background and white font...  Aka night mode on nook app for example.  And is it me or are comments (to read or to post) not available on this version?,
Myself,
Ml,
Teaser,
Wow,
"I am addicted to the paper version of the Times.  It usually arrives here by 6am.  When it doesn't I'm forced to use this app.  It is frustratingly challenging.   e.g., the back button sometimes goes back a page, and sometimes it closes the app.  But ask the news is here.  I find that if I patiently try to adapt to their unusually restrictive flow, I can get most of what i need to know",
"An OK presentation of NYT content, but shortcomings include not including the Front Page  as a section (for a given date) plus you can see when an article was last updated, but not when it first appeared/was published.  All of this makes it a weak substitute for reading the hard copy paper (which was likely their intent!)",
"I am a Times Reader subscriber(the $20/month one), and for the life of me, I have not been able to get a straight answer from NYT's customer service on what level of subscription gives me access to the opinion pages. An app is only as good as its utility, and this app gets a ZERO from me.",
"I was all excited to see this app thinking it would be free with my existing subscription, but, it's not, sadly, no, wtf. I believe in supporting good journalism financially and have subscribed since the NYT first started charging for digital access. I really like having the app on my phone, but a 75% increase in my subscription rate is not worth it,  sigh...I just uninstalled it.",
Even when working it uses a lot of battery. Hangs the whole device fairly often - problem appears related to touch interface.  Unacceptable on a device with such a large market share. I use the mobile web site instead,
"The app used to work as stable as any I've seen. With the latest update, sadly this hdas been screwed up. It randomly tries to update articles and pictures and, worst of all, crashes unpredictably and often. HTC desire. I am a subscriber and very disappointmented.",
"The New York Times has not developed a real tablet app, different than the smartphone app.  Yet the subscription costs more for the tablet app! I have just cut back my subscription again to ""Digital + Smartphone"".  Android tablets will not create a revenue stream for the New York Times, unless the New York Times creates an Android tablet app!",
I have a Galaxy Nexus on stock 4.2 and the app is just a blank screen with the New York Times logo.  Terrible app.,
Real piece of crap... Incredibly expensive and on top of that you get pop up ads that block the whole screen. Waste if time.,
You are wasting my battery and data plan with autoupdate every two minutes.,
App works for one article and the ashes for money to keep working. What's wrong with charging advertisers like the other news apps.,
"So far, so good.  Very unreliable reader for my favorite newspaper.",
"Ads are intrusive, even with a subscription. No option to eliminate graphics or make them optional. The daily email gives a much better news overview than this app. Text area is too small in landscape mode on a small tablet. Also, content is limited without a subscription or an upgraded subscription.",
"Im getting ""no network available"" all the time. Ads will load and all of the other apps i have dont experience any issues with connecting. Please fix this!",
Great app. Most complaints are non subscribers. They are without peer so suggest you pay up.,
"I have a digital tablet subscription and was able to download this app to the Google Nexus 7 tablet. It seems to to take my username and password, but it won't give me access to subscriber content. Even though this app shows up when I search Google Play from my tablet, I was told by NYTimes telephone support that they are still working on a version for Android tablets. Oh, well. I dropped back to a smart phone only subscription.",
Why would I pay for a subscription when there are so many free news sources. There is absolutely nothing special about the rimes reporting.,
"They should have a dedicated ui for android tablets. The iPad app is awesome, but the android app on tablet is subpar .",
"Takes for ever to open if i have a data connection, opens much faster in airplane mode, which is dumb.",
"App does not refresh.  Been stuck on Oct 13th.  Tried reinstalling app, that doesn't work either.	Disappointing",
"For insisting on charging for the subscription, I'd expect nyt to at least drop the ads and banners.",
App locks out paid subscribers. Very poorly designed with no search feature.,
Hugely bloated - downloads every single section every time with no option to change.,
No way to set font for section listings; article font is miniscule (normal) or grandpa-sized (large) on a Sensastion.  Paywall price is way too high.,
"Downloaded the app in excitement to have the NYT on my android tablet... but lo and behold, when I go to log in, the app keeps DELETING the password I entered when I tap ""log in"". I'd like to use my registered account with this app but no luck.",
I used to like this app but this new update eats up resources and sucks battery juice. I've uninstalled it.,
Improved - No longer freezes all the time.  Fails to update properly on cell network - works in wi-fi.,
Works well and updates are quick. Would give it 5 stars but it needs search capability.,
Excellent NYTimes content. App improved in latest update 7/2012; still slow.,
I just want too read the news.I'm 17.I can't afford that nonsense,
"Seriously NY Times - you would think by now it wouldn't take 5 mins and freezing up my phone to update the news.  Ppl read the nytimes app for content, not pics and pretty fonts!  Just simplify it.  How come the NY Daily News App works 100 times better?  Embarrassing!",
"Look and feel is pretty good now. Menus need a bit of work. Would be nice to select only Top News to sync on cell data, as this app uses a huge chunk of my data usage.",
"I was wanting to read the NY Times to compare its Western exceptionalist bias/perspective to other newssources so when they asked me to pay for this privilege, I declined. However, CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera English gives me news for free.",
"The free version seems like a good download, until you can only read the first 2 sentences and the headline and then you have to subscribe to read the rest it the articles. There are better free news apps out there that will allow you to read the whole article not just a teaser",
"Finally this app comes into its own on android. Well done, NY Times.",
"Oh, the capability is there, but your text is one shade of gray darker than the text box - illegible. Otherwise, works fine on Jellybean (Nexus 7).   As someone else said, where's search? White text on black?   The content, as always, is the best.",
"Très bonne app. Pratique et complète. Par contre, evidemment pour anglophones uniquement",
Please add the ability to download new content whenever wifi is available.,
"Can read it even not on line, based on the last updated. Good apps..",
"The increase in ad space and constant flashing, plus general sluggishness make for a trying experience.  Giving up.",
I have a subscription and yet still not allowed to veiw content. 1 Star till this is fixed!,
Very happy the app is seeing some love again.,
It is good even though I don't live in NYC!,
"Finally follows the holo guidelines. Thanks, NYTimes!",
Pay for every little thing. No thanks,
I'm not running the widget and this application still runs in the background.  When you kill the the service it restarts by itself.  What a waste of battery.,
"What a joke! Get USAToday, AP News, and Bloomberg.",
Wsj and economist apps not as good.,
"newspaper filled with news, and my favorite sports articles on demand",
"I like browsing the weekend paper editions - but online or in an app, I want to be able to search, dammit.",
Please fix the issue preventing me from posting a comment on my S2 skyrocket,
"I love the app. Fast and smooth. One question: my app used to stay up to date throughout the day, now I have to refresh all the time. What gives?  Thanks for the followup. Much appreciated!!",
Samsung Galaxy S2 freezes phone,
"back to 5*, quality control has improved",
Downloaded most recent update and now the stories never update even when I click the update button,
"Interested stuff, easy to read",
"Poor, not free, try fox news at least they report real stories",
I'm a subscriber and yet the ads on the bottom of the feeds are still there after logging in.,
Customer and they take valuble screen space for a banner Ad? Really? Greedy much?,
This app makes me smarter than a fifth grader.,
Get the AP news app. Pretty much the same content and its free.,
Latest update very good!,
Frezzing. Not working,
A disappointed tablet subscriber.,
Crashes phone,
Why pay when it's free on BBC?,
Go NY GO,
nicccccccccceeeeeee,
Slow,
NYTimes app rocks,
"When I first installed the App there was a way to change the configuration settings. I don't know quite what happened, but the ability to apply changes to settings is now gone. God forbid somebody actually want to log in to their NYTimes account. The update that was applied this morning also made navigation less intuitive, making it seem as if there is no way to change which section is currently being read. Stop making Your App less useful.",
"Great content, but I have a couple issues with the app: 1) I pay for a subscription, yet it still shows me universally irrelevant ads. On the small screen of a phone this is unacceptable. At least offer a way to get rid of the ads, even if it means charging me more. I don't mind supporting quality journalism. 2) A dark mode (white text on a black background) would be convenient for certain situations.",
Even with the latest phone and 4g or wifi this app is slow. Horrible. And breaking news never has worked,
"Not sure what happened to this  version, it is far less functional than in previous incarnations. I'm hoping one of their own execs will become perturbed by the poverty of the app and send a complaint up the hierarchy.  Lets hope for that since I am too cynical to believe our protestations here will amount to much.",
"Finally be able to synchronize saved articles across mobile platforms.Thanks,guys! Now why the inline text selecting function is still missing?I can't take note, search the web or dictionary without this.  ------ Old comment:  the user experience is fairly good , but not good enough.please add the following functions:  1.inline text selector.  2.synchronize saved articles across android and idevices.",
"It won't load whenever it wants, just when we want it to. Out loads fast and leaves us alone. It finally does just what it's supposed to do.",
"Generally attractive and useful, this app is missing a few key features, such as the ability to customize with what articles we're presented and to be able to share to Google+ with a preview.",
"Widget often doesn't load articles. App kept taking up more and more internal memory, usually going from 1.6mb to 17mb in a day. Samsung moment @2.2",
I did not notice I had one. Hardly used it. Full of crappy advertisements and the content is too long.,
Using galaxy nexus running ics,
"Why notifications when I have them disabled?  App is largely useless now that only top stories are accessible. I believe in paying for quality news content, but strike a better balance.  Uninstalling.  G2",
"Six months ago I gave this app one star, but it had steadily improved with each new version.  Now it is swift and stable.",
Since this update links often jump to the wrong article. Really annoying!,
It is still limited. I really dislike the ads that don't go away even if you're a paid subscriber.,
"This used to be my fave news app. But now, only top news is available for free viewing. This sucks. Useless. I want the old feature back.",
Poor software quality! Always crashes!,
Most of it is locked for subscribers. Useless,
It's ok I guess.,
NY times,
"On the plus side:  Although far from instantaneous, the latest version has brought with it  a noticeable improvement in loading speed.  And now, at last, you can keep the app on your phone's SD card.  On the minus side:  As a paid subscriber I resent the periodic full-screen pop-up ads.",
This app runs constantly even when it is not open or you force it to stop.  It is always sending data to/from New York Times even when you are not using it.  Why does an app need to drain the battery and eat up part of your data plan when not in use?  As a paid subscriber I should not see the Ad's that take up a portion of the screen.  Easy solution to that one: Uninstalled.,
"I love NYT so this used to be 4 stars. However, after many updates, it crashes more than it used to. Latest update causes frequent freezes.  I also wish I could choose which categories display and update.  Lastly, the ticker widget only updates if you open the app first to update headlines. Major drag.   Still has a solid foundation for an app. Needs some attention from more capable programmers.",
I could read one story after I installed this app. Now I have to become a subscriber to read any more. Will be uninstalling right after submitting this.,
downloaded app twice and even after logging in it forgets that I have a paid digital subscription and won't allow access to sections.  looks like a good app if it worked properly.  on the other hand if I browse to the IHT global edition site I have all access in a mobile format.  and I'm already logged in.  weird.,
"Crashes constantly in Android 4.0 (ICS) on Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus.  Lowest-quality app on my phones, yet I'm paying a monthly subscription for access.  That's not a good formula for saving quality journalism, and the unreliability of the app is making me consider cancelling my subscription.  To those who complain of seeing adds despite subscription: get a grip! You didn't get an ad-free Times in print when you subscribed, did you?  This is the something-for-nothing mindset that's killing newspapers.  You don't want them to die, do you?",
"Seems like an okay app, but really should offer users more when trying it out the first time. The tiny snippets don't really give me a feeling for how it would be if I paid for a subscription.",
"This would be a great app is subscribers didn't have the ads and were able to access all the news articles. I'm signed in, yet it still shows that I'm in preview mode. That needs to be fixed. Once that's done, I'd gladly up the rating.",
"I don't mind ads that help pay for free apps, but ads that blink and flash wildly are completely unacceptable. It appears that NYT allows these obnoxious ads which ruin the user experience, so I'm uninstalling. It's just not worth it. You should be ashamed of yourself NYT!",
Does not work at all. Just says loading forever. Can't believe I'm paying for an app that doesn't even work. Tried clearing cache and all.,
Downloading articles is incredibly slow.  Better off with web edition.  Not worth subscription.,
It seems to want to reinvent what shows up on the quite snappy mobile site. I note the ads always show up quickly and without fail.,
Broken on Epic 4g Touch with CM9. Can't even report the bug because the phone must be hard rebooted when it freezes,
"You have to manually update it, it doesn't update automatically. To get current news, uninstall then reinstall.",
"New version is barely functional, laggy and buggy. I have no problem paying, but not for a bad app.  Update: this app keeps getting worse. Freezes consistently now.  Completely unusable.",
"Used to crash all the time on me, but it seems more stable now. Still somewhat slow",
"Nice app and interface for home screen. However, the interface doesn't automatically update, hence you always have to open the app first. Pretty anoying if you quickly want to check the news.",
"I subscribe and it does not let me sign in, it just blanks out the password when I try to sign in. Really amateur.",
"So slow you may think its not working. Even updates news I cannot access. Someone should get fired for this app. Gets worse with each new ""update"". Bionic 2.3",
"Nytimes content is great and worth paying for, but this app is still not as smooth and bug free as it could be.  Hangs and crashes about twice per week.  Droid x.",
Well laid out articles. Easy for quick read. It will be better if content gets cached until next refresh.,
Have not been able to get updated articles on the app even though I'm a subscriber. Very buggy. Please fix the spoilt app!,
Huge improvement over the past few versions. Thanks. I am now a happy NYTimes digital subscriber.,
"It's great that this app can now load from the SD card, but I wish the developers could bring back the widget with an added refresh feature.",
"Very slow and buggy on Galaxy S2. Crashes my phone completely, have to remove the battery and reboot after a couple of minutes use. Avoid",
"slow, full of ads even though i subscribe, loads all sections even though i only read top news and sports. mobile website is better",
"App can't track what I have read after a refresh. Caching is only available when the app is open, if closed, you need to refresh. Improve offline availability.",
"Just find it slow to load, slow to process each section. Pretty though. (Droid)",
Hands when loading article. ICS on Transformer Prime,
Why would i pay for news when i can get it for free..,
"Great content, when you can get it.  Consistently crashes my phone.",
Nice app - if only it updated correctly on the Samsung galaxy s2.   But it doesn't and so only moderately useful.  (two of us are having this issue.),
"I only installed this app because I liked the breaking-news notifications that I saw on the iPhone app. Unfortunately, they don't work on the android app...or at least not on my Galaxy Nexus.",
"Great content, but the site locks up repeatedly at random times.",
Utter piece of crap. Use the mobile site.,
"All good, sign out and then in again after last update and it works fine on S2...",
Freezes my phone almost every time!,
Finally fixed the speed issue after all these years! Refreshing and articles loading fast now.,
Can't say too much as it won't even let me log in to see if it works....I'd love to have an app for this.  At least the BBC app works well.,
Won't refresh after new update. Still crappy app.,
Articles are not available unless you pay to subscribe. Why act like it's free? Try being honest.,
Paid subscription but still get annoying ads,
Poor experience. They even show Ads for premium users...,
To dig up older articles.,
"I understand how newspaper business models work, but when it comes to my apps, I will not pay to see more.",
Keeping Saying loading and loading but nothing comes on,
Streamlined especially for a mobile touch-based platform. Excellent reader.,
Used to be a Good way to catch up... But its not like it used to be :(,
Frustrating app. Lost its usefulness.,
"The app works well and does what it is supposed to do. However, I might end up uninstalling anyway, because so far I don't see a way to read comments for the articles. Looks like of you want the full NYT experience, mobile site is the only way to go :-(",
Disappointed,
Needs subscription. Very bad.,
Won't load on Evo after recent update.,
Locks up phone on CM9.,
Very precise and authentic language.,
Get rid of the ads for paying customers already,
news does not update on galaxy s2  updates now 2nd may 2012 update to 4 stars,
"App is fine, but how about letting paying subscribers skip the ads?",
Great app to read the best newspaper of USA,
"I'm a subscriber, yet I still have to look at ads that take up a lot of space. I'm very disappointed.",
Improved. Quicker loading.,
Make a version for droid tablet 2.3 pls,
"Functional, good content",
Don't bother. Why pay for news you get get for free,
Love it. I keep asking the question: How does my phone know?    Thanks.,
Does not update on experia either.,
Pay app. Not free,
I installed this app recently only to find it to be 'Loading' indefinitely! Please fix it!,
It is very good. Love it.,
I need to subscribe now??? Plenty of other better news apps for free!,
need to start at boot time? It's slowing down my startup time.,
Love the new York times,
Works fine.,
Enjoy,
5 stats,
"You can only read a few stories; everything else is locked and you need to subscribe, i.e., pay. Thanks?",
Really?,
Works,
Why are we asked to subscribe while iPhone users not?,
Love the updates,
I paid for my subscription so at least don't make an ad that occupies a fifty of the screen.,
Nice,
Great,
Basura,
"App sucks for two reasons.   One, you are forced to endure these heinous distracting large ads for a service you already paid for. It's way more irritating and distracting than an ad in the newspaper on such a small screen.  Two, that refresh bar at the bottom is taking up even more valuable space on the screen. It should be hidden.",
"Very slow to load and resource hog. Small article selection. Does not recognize how to deal with its own Android notifications. Doesn't know when linked articles are part of free content also available through the same app, or when they are paid. Does not support the article viewing quota available through a web brower to the Times web site. In short, debatable whether it is better than a  decent  RSS reader.",
There are barely any stories that you can read for free. I can get A LOT more content from other apps.,
"I generally dislike negative reviews so I feel like a hypocrite writing this. However, it is my duty to say that this app is awful. Can't see comments, shows ads even though I have a subscription, so I still use google reader for nyTimes updates.",
Too Slow to Load!  I am a paid subscriber and usually have to wait 30 seconds to 1 minute to bring up an article.  The LA Times is free and quick to load.  Is the paywall slowing things down?  Will not renew my subscription if this isn't fixed.,
The app is constantly loading. Full screen ad skip button does not work I have a paid subscription,
I cannot get this app to accept my digital subscription information.  The NY Times iPad app works just fine.,
This app used to be totally free. Now it has ads all over the place and keeps asking you to buy a subscription.,
I can get ad supported news anywhere.  I pay for the Times because I don't want ads.  Will give 5 stars when ads are gone for subscribers.,
This app has been unusable since the most recent update. Articles will not download.,
"I have come to accept paying for the Times as it costs money to do the highest level of research and reporting available. But the app loads very slowly and sometimes freezes on the ""loading"" screen.",
"You have to subscribe to read more than just a paragraph or two in an article, understandable though in this economy",
Ads load fast but the articles are slow to load. Using the galaxy s,
Makes this app almost unusable... A couple of stars for good content & design,
"Crashed often. Slow refreshing. Have to log in each time as subscriber, never remembers your subscription info. Not renewing digital subscription after current period because this app is so unstable.",
The lack of any readable free content makes this app pointless to me.,
Loads less than half the time. But a good app if I can get it working.,
"Last update broke it. Come on times, you can do better than this.",
Rotating ads at bottom of screen are extremely annoying when trying to read. Lots loading issues. Tries to update as soon as there is any internet access which is a problem in the subway. Fix this app please!,
Too many ads popping up. irrelevant & lack of articles.,
"Yes it takes a while to download on my Atrix, but then I have the ability to read a large volume of content offline anytime I choose.  Incidentally, it is much faster to read after downloading if I switch my wireless off.",
The latest update made it too slow to use.  I am paying a subscription for this.,
The content is good but the widget fails to provide quick content,
Crashes all time and runs super slow,
"Really, really slow. While you are waiting for it to load a story, you could walk to the store to buy the paper. Don't depend on this app for your news.",
Easy reading and navigation.  Couldn't ask for anything more.,
Wants you to pay 3.75 per week? They are out of there minds. Zero stars. Cnn app is better and FREE.,
Constantly freezing.  Perpetually loading without any results.  Constant ads tho I pay for it.  Come on NYTimes.,
"Pointless, unless you pay the subscription",
"Downloaded this for breaking news on the go, but with it taking so long to load any content... why bother?",
Keeps failing to recognize my email and password,
This app consistently force-closes on my G2.,
I'm not pleased.,
Refresh times are too long.,
"This app sucks big time!!!! Keeps loading. ... whenever I open it.... only top news section gets loaded..if I goto any other section., it just keeps loading!!!!  But nothing comes up..just blank screen",
Why must I see adverts if I already have a subscription?!! Rubbish!!,
Adventists and subscription prompts suck!,
App has definitely improved.,
Won't let me log in click on light in and it's a blank screen. Fix please........,
Small screen and poor.,
"Takes way too long for the free section (""Top News"") to load and refresh each time I open the app. Speed, plz. DroidX 6'1"", 200lb, 9"" cut",
The title says it all.,
Almost all content is locked,
Like this app alot,
Rip off,
A new way for evading privacy...why do they need call permission?,
but not free.,
I question a need to read the phone logs for this kind of app.,
Last update broke it,
Has improved.,
Why does the icon open the app installation page rather than the app itself?,
Most if not all stories require a subscription to read. Use News UK-US World newspapers instead and you'll get the Times without a subscription.,
"I pay a not inconsiderab monthly amount for a NYT digital subscription, yet I still see ads on every Page in this app, and articles in preview mode. Yes, I double checked that I'm logged in.",
"I am a subscriber, and I always read the Times on either a computer or my physical copy since this app is awful -- absurdly so. It does not automatically update for offline reading. It's unbelievably slow to display articles already fetched, and it frequently crashes! Get it together NYT! (On the Motorola ATRIX.)",
"I'd love to read the Times on the subway (after all, this is New York), but this app doesn't automatically cache stories until you open it. It would be much better with an option to periodically download the current news in the background even when the app's not running, so that you've got fresh content when you head underground.",
If you want in-depth journalism of the highest caliber then the New York Times is the way to go. The entry level subscription package is more than worth the price of admission. The app works flawlessly on my galaxy nexus. Pages are cached every time the app is opened/updated for text access without a data connection. Small ads do appear at the bottom of the page but they are hardly an inconvenience. It is easy to share articles via email or social networks like Facebook.,
"The WP app is everything the NY Times isn't. Fast, caches, and doesn't crash.  What is the point of an app if it doesn't download stories onto your phone? If I need a 3g or WiFi connection, why wouldn't I just go to the web page? Don't be fooled, in the free version, the stories do NOT automatically cache, or if they do, it takes such an interminable amount of time, that it's worthless. You have to manually go into each story for it to cache, and God help you if you accidentally back out of the app.",
"Before the last update the app ran okay.   It would still freeze up and remain on ""loading article"" page but now it happens on almost every use.  Must force close and restart....  But, the actual content is wonderful!  Top quality journalism, just a pitiful user inference.",
This app used to be ok. Now it's remarkably bad. It hangs all the time and is constantly updating.,
The app has become totally unreliable. The download time is excessive and there its no way to control what is downloaded out simple downloads all.,
The app has gotten less reliable over time. It is frozen and I have to uninstall. HTC Incredible.,
"It says its free, but after you read one article, it requires a subscription. Seems kinda bait n switch to me.",
Unbelievable! I really wanted to subscribe but I'm not paying a premium yet have large colour adverts distract from the content I want to pay for. I'll stick to other providers.,
"I never rate but this app needs lots of work. S l o w to update, locks up while updating.",
"I love the NYT, but this app is a huge data hog, even after fiddling with settings.  I read the news for maybe 45mins/day and the app was consuming roughly 20MB/day, while the BBC app is 1/10th of that!  If you have data limits, don't use this app!",
doesnt load articles or takes FOREVER! Widget never updates stories until you open full app (why have a widget if it doesnt work?) Often have to re-log in. I'll go back to using the website from phone browser,
Still slow Hangs frequently when will they get this right.,
Was good when it was free. Now can't get the good stuff.   There are great alternatives out there.,
They listened and now i can save articles to favorites folder thank you this app is much better due to this but it can still be made better in terms of proper and faster loading. Overall i approve.,
Frustrating to pay for content and be unable to access it half of the time. Seems like there is a new issue every week and the app freezes our never loads. Hire someone and fix this.,
"Apparently the app tries to load ads before showing the article, even for subscribers. This makes the app unusable when the network connection is slow. I don't mind seeing ads, but can you preload and cache them?  Great articles, poor app.",
"This news app effectively provides access to the NYT articles but is brutally slow in doing so.  Of all the news apps I have, this by far the slowest and least reliable.  Sadly, it is also the only news source I pay to access.",
"This application refuses to load the articles when I'm on the subway. It is better than previous versions, but still not good enough.",
App freezes reliably at least once per use.,
This app rarely opens fully. I have to try several times before it shows any content.,
"doesnt take you to the story when you press it in the drop down notifications. it takes you to the front page, which often doesnt even have the story.",
Too much content is locked. And there are ads. Ads and a subscription - No Deal.,
I migrated from the iPhone version. The Android version is annoyingly slow when loading articles. The font used is also not as crisp as the iPhone sibling. Did different programmers produce the mobile apps? We're paying to use this everyday. Fix this!,
"occasionally, it locks up and crashes, but more often than not it does it's job with a minimum of fuss.",
"You would think the NYTimes app would be better and faster than an old Atari game, or better than the BBC app, but it,s not.",
It is 1/30 and I had to uninstall and reinstall to make the New Hampshire primary results go away. Also the update bar at the bottom takes up a lot of space when my screen is rotated on the side.,
"Pressing the back button from an article should bring you to the section page, not exit the app.  Please fix this along with the tons of other issues listed here.",
App crashes continuously on my Nexus S. I have reinstalled several times to no avail. I only use because of great content.,
Content is not worth the price.  I could buy it in print for less!,
"I'm a big NYT fan, and the application looks nice, but I can't log in. Not worth too much until this is fixed.",
Slow clunky site cancer to NYT brand. Site for Liberal Losers.,
This app is a disgrace to the NY Times.,
"Used to be a great app but now it doesn't even change the articles, I've had the same ones for 2 weeks",
"Has ads even for subscribers, no local news section, can't zoom in on text.",
"Smarten up, NY Times! You've had enough time to make this app better.",
"when i have one bar of network access, this app fails to display stored articles.",
"I let my news update before I get on the train in the morning, but when I hit a tunnel, either the ad function or some kind of sync request freezes the app as it tries to get some kind of info from the network.  I have my updating freq set for the max time ( four hrs), and I cache my thumbnails.  CANT WE CHOOSE SECTIONS TO UPDATE?  I rarely read Home and Garden...",
"Love the app, but you need to add a setting that allows me to limit the amount of data that the app automatically stores.  HTC has storage issues, and the way your app works seriously exacerbates the problem.",
"The New York Times is a venerated name in news. And this is a good app...if you're a subscriber. If not, you only get headlines and a brief excerpt. Do yourself a favor and get The Washington Post app instead...the layout is a little cleaner, it's better organized, and it doesn't require a subscription (at least not yet!).",
Horrible.  Glitchy.  Frustrating.  A boil on the behind of an otherwise terrific paper.,
Used to be good. Now buggy and slow.,
I think it is a big minus that there is no search function!,
Ny times get your act together,
Good to have the latest news on the go. A great news app to have .,
"And... now it's just completely frozen -- ""loading."" I can't for the life of me figure out why they can't fix their app.  Least effective news app out there.  FIX IT!",
We live in 2012... news must be Free,
Takes forever to load. Rather use Yahoo News.,
"This app was always a little slow, but it's gotten so bad with recent updates that it's become unusable.  Too bad....",
Slow news updates and intrusive ads.,
Design is nice but app is extremely unstable.,
"Ads even for premium subscribers, buggy",
"Top stories were anything but top, too many other news apps out there for free....UN INSTALLING",
Unable to download the update.,
Almost all the articles are locked and require a subscription. I'll just read on the Web for free instead,
Uses data and takes time to update sections that are locked. Just update what I can read.,
"This is the content I spend most of my time reading: ""Loading...""   Oh, and quite often ""The NY Times app has unexpectedly quit""",
It's not a free app ...must pay to read articles.....,
Articles which are free on web are locked on app,
App has almost no content without paying for subscription.,
Loads slowly,
Stopped working,
Good to know,
Pay for news today?,
Wow uninstalled,
Makes me log in repeatedly,
Pay to use..,
"Slow: Upon booting up the app, it will ""update"" all the news categories which takes several minutes. This wouldnt be TOO bad, but you are unable to click on any links until it has updated everything.  Breaking News: I opted to receive Breaking News to appear in my notification bar.  When breaking news occurs and you try opening the link, it only opens the app. It does not link to the actual story. I'm stuck searching for the story myself. Redundant.  ADS: I pay to receive the actual paper Monday - Friday. Why are there ads displayed when I am signed in and a paying customer? Annoying.  Using this on a Droid X",
"I'm a subscriber and just downloaded this app for the first time on my new phone. It's impossible to log in to the app; when I try to access the login page, the page just hangs and never loads. Very annoyed that I'm paying for a subscription that includes mobile access but doesn't actually work. Without subscriber access, the app is basically useless. Also useless is the NYTimes' customer service; I emailed them for help (at an address specifically provided for Android app users) and called their customer service number, and they told me it's a bug in the new version that they're working to fix and in the meantime clearing the cache might help (didn't work for me). In the meantime, I'm not going to pay $15/mo for a service i can't access.",
"I love the app, with the exception of it being a space hog and not being able to move it to a SD card. Give it that ability and it would be golden.",
"All topics except Top stories are subscription based.  Nothing but a teaser here.  Also app requires more permission than it really needs (my phone number, whom I'm calling,etc.).  Great for getting spammed.",
They have fixed a lot of issues with this app since the paywall went up.  It is good now.,
Nytimes needs to fire their app developer. Ridiculously slow because of bad design choices.,
"Consistently stalls and or freezes when loading articles, even when on strong WiFi network. Very frustrating.",
Very slow. every morning I finish 'doing my thing' before it even loads.  Unacceptable as a paid subscriber.,
It shows you the headlines but not the articles. I'm sticking with the Washington Post.,
"After the last update, this app went WAY downhill. Takes FOREVER to load updates every time you open it. Gets stuck all the time ...just really poor performance on a Samsung fascinate.",
The app steals focus to tell you of a meaningless update.  This crashes my other apps and causes me to lose unsaved progress!,
You would think a software update is to improve the application but not in the case of nytimes app. With each round of updates its become buggier and slower and annoying. Very weak app.,
"It generally works well (I am a paying subscriber), but two suggestions: *) allow for a setting to only have automatic content updates when connected to WLAN *) work on the speed of displaying articles",
Love NYT. This app still sucks though. Slow. Hangs. Non responsive. Don't bother with app. Go online or Twitter. Not the way to get us to pay for it,
"Gets stuck on ""loading"" and becomes unresponsive, even with a good connection.",
So easy to use on HTC phone. Great for the subway morning commute. Just refresh before you go under.,
"I am a NY times subscriber and cannot access the digital content. NY Times:  FIX IT!  Despite being a loyal reader for many years, I am now ready to leave NUT behind for content providers that take customers seriously.",
This app is working better lately. Please don't break it again as over the past several months.,
You have to pay to read more than one sentence in each article? Lame. Uninstalling. LA times is way better...and FREE,
Boo! Wtf $15 No auto-Dnld! Can't prioritize the order of sections or select only the sections you want to Dnld. Uninstall!,
"good, don't mind ads but needs dark theme for amoled screens!",
I have a subscription. I shouldn't have to wait for ads to load!,
Takes forever to load a story,
"Takes forever to load, crashes a ton. Generally a POS.",
Much better than before. Responsiveness increased tremendously!,
Cant get to favorites takes forever,
"Awful.  Unstable.  Bad interface.  Locks you out while updating, often force close.  Yecch.",
not useful unless you're a subscriber,
This ridiculous app costs $3.75/week subscription for content.   I'll get my news elsewhere.,
The best newspaper in the world!,
"A reliable news source on a reliable app.
My favourite app of my news media.",
Paid subscriber. But ads on app! App should be ad-free.,
Gone to hell now.,
it is a shame because I want this app. why do they need my phone number and the serial number on my phone?,
Kinda slow.,
Too liberal for my taste.,
Crashes constantly.,
not good,
Great resource,
I am a paying customer but you still force full screen ads on me?  That is outrageous.  I will go back to Pulse as my main route into the Times.,
"The NYTimes App is absolutely horrible. It constantly shuts off whatever data connection I'm using as soon as I open it. It crashes constantly.    As someone with a subscription to the times itself, this app is, without a doubt, a dissappointment. I don't see how they plan to adjust to a world of electronic, web-based news when they can't even get a smartphone app right.",
"Update seems to fix the constant lagginess and pop-ups of ""Close / Wait / Report"" that were hallmarks of the previous version.  G2 / Cyanogenmod.",
"Occasionally force closes, but the content easily makes up for the inconvenience. I use this app every day.",
Freezes up and needs forceclose. Hope this one is more stable,
"Better, not crashing, a little slow, but much better.",
Hideously painful to use,
Horrible,
"There is no place for support at the Times website, so I'm posting this here. With the ios app, there is never any problem reading offline. With the Android for phone app, I find that frequently when I am not connected to the internet the app is trying to connect with the server, but will not show me the stored offline content - i.e., it attempts to download content that it cannot download because I am offline, and sticks with that update screen, but won't let me read what it already has stored.",
On the Vibrant - takes about 20 seconds to completely load then crashes. I wonder how much NY Times paid for this awful example of incompetent coding. Just a plain HTML mobile website would have been fine. Washington Post's mobile website is beautifully; Car and Driver and Wired are great too.,
"Ths really is an embarrassment to the nyt, and one of the worst apps I have used. Incredibly sluggish performance, freezes and crashes regularly, and is slow to refresh stories.Furthermore, the left right article switch is, imo, a terrible feature terribly implemented (constantly switching articles by accident when scrolling). Please, please take some if this feedback to heart. Love the content, just wish out wasn't encompassed in so much suckage.",
"This application used to be my favorite. After they created the paywall and reading limitations, the reader has become exceedingly unstable. Application freezes and crashes often, and if you are lucky enough to open an article, the program freezes while you try scrolling through the article. Get your act together NY Times.",
"The NYTimes customer service just informed me that this app is not designed for tablets and folks with paid subscriptions. The App will not give you access to the paid content - only the free articles. Spinning this app as ""compatible"" with tablets/honeycomb is misleading at best, but closer to false advertising. Without allowing access to paid content, it's mostly worthless. NYT should remove this app until they can make one that's functional.",
App regularly locks up for 10 to 30 seconds. Occaisonally it actually locks up my phone so that I cant switch the phone on or off for 2 / 3 minutes.,
"An embarrassment for the NYT. Slow, sluggish, buggy. The latest update refreshes the content across something like 12 areas that have a check mark on them despite the fact that I only want to read top news and sports. I see no way to take off the check mark and it's filling up my phone with MB of articles I don't want (and slowing the phone to a crawl) despite the fact that I have set up preferences to manual refresh. It takes a lot to make me uninstall the NYT, but this is it. And I am a paying customer!!!",
Constantly freezes and crashes. I can never make it through the whole article even when I get it to load. Droid Bionic,
"Very slow. The app forces you to refresh ALL sections, even if you only want the free top news. Freezes up a lot and there are full screen ads.",
"I love the content, but the app sucks. I can get the articles way faster from the website.",
Was my favorite news app. Now just non functional freezing up resulting in reboot mess. Sadly I have deleted for now.,
Out of 40 apps I have installed this is the only one that is slow to load. But it's not just slow. It is *extremely* sluggish. Uninstalling.,
"Recently, the app has become almost unusable. This is especially disappointing since I'm paying a subscription. It wasn't originally so unstable. It may have gotten worse since the paid subscription started.",
This app is totally unworkable after last update. It just gets hung up and freezes. I want my money back. Shame on nytimes.,
I have a paid subscription to the NYTimes. I use the NYTimes Android app on a Verizon/HTC Thunderbolt device. I am running version 2.0.3. It crashes and freezes every time I try to use it. When will NYTimes be offering a stable and functional version of this application? Extremely frustrating especially since I am now paying for access.,
"Doesn't update automatically, even when set to do so. Have to manually do it every day if I want to read it on my commute. Worthless.",
"App is slow and buggy, and hard to customize which sections update. The reporting is great.",
"Trying to eek out JUST ONE article on the subway every morning is literally the most agitating part of my day. Usually, the app crashes three or four times before I can even see the Top News list.",
This app is not useable.  It hangs forever trying to load content and ads.  I pay for the NYT subscription and expect better than this.,
"Now that the Times wants us to pay to read their news online, they set up a pay wall and app freezes constantly. Must foreclose. Shouldn't have to pay for news when we already pay for internet and data. Very upsetting",
Have had this app for well over a year and now with this new update I can't even use it. Freezes and forces every time I try to use it. Terrible.,
This app never works smoothly.   16 bucks is a lot.  Please fix for htc evo it just updates and then crashes.  All the time,
Extremely sluggish. Surprising lack of serious content. Pictures sometimes don't correspond to the relevant article.,
New updates have devestated the app. Crashes 7/10 times. I don't need the home and garden section to refresh everytime I use the app.,
"To echo other reviewers, so many problems with this update! The app always opens up through the market, freezes and force closes etc. I expect better!",
It's pretty cool. The only complaint is that why we can't save the news articles we like and read it later when I go offline. I can save the news articles on my iPod touch New York Times app.,
Thia app would be great except that it is very leggy and unresponsive. Lots of force quits.,
"Randomly opens, then try and back out and phone restarts. Uninstalling.",
"Way too bloated an slow.  Ads, including popup ads, when already on a subscription?  Often its ONLY the ads that work, at least for the first 3 minutes.",
NYT is mutton dressed as  lamb. Editor doesn't a clue.,
this app frequently freezes and then closes by itself.  very frustrating.,
The latest update (Nov. 2011) ruined it. Crashes about 90% of the time that I use it. When it works most of the time is 4 downloading every section.,
"Was fine with ads on the bottom of articles, but now full screen ads pop up during reading.",
"I will happily pay for valuable content, but this app makes reading the NYT a consistently frustrating experience. Crashes almost every time launched",
"They had it working well for about 3 weeks, but the last update was so bad I actually had to do a factory reset!",
This is the  worst Droid app I've owned. 2 minutes to load. Then big full screen ads.  Then locked keyboard & then black. NYT can do better.,
"Bulky, slow, just keeps getting worse.",
Became unusable after required update. Please fix,
The mobile web page is far better. Probably will uninstall as I rarely use it.,
I downloaded the new version and it keeps closing. Annoying.,
Surprised such a quality news source can't get this right.,
"No way to search articles by topic or keyword. What news app won't let you do that? Until such a basic function is implemented, this app is weak.",
this latest update screwed up the app. A laggy mess.,
What the what! This ap is barely useable ... freezes constantly - almost everytime. Worse SINCE update. What's the deal nyt? You deserve better!,
"Used to be okay, now it's terrible. Froze up every time I tried it today. I'm deleting it, I'll try again in the future.",
Ads suck. Speed sucks. Diminished ability to control font size sucks. Inability to access entire site sucks. Need I go on?,
App now takes me to Android Market instead of opening app directly. PITA.,
This app is as good as fox news' journalism,
Crashes often. Can't even log in. Android sucks.,
"Poor app...Hangs while loading, force close, remove battery, reboot on Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.",
"Articles are getting ""summarized"", they only want the low, low price of $3.75 per week ($195 per year!) To read the news I can get elsewhere for free",
I am a long-time subscriber to The Times and have uninstalled this new version.  It runs very slowly and crashes every time.  Do not download!,
It's great on my Droid. Fast and no memory problems.,
Subscription cost is a rip-off,
"This is the only app I pay for. Ironically, its the only one that doesn't work. Am I a fool?",
"Constantly hangs, have to force it closed. Almost impossible to use. What went wrong?",
Website has more free content than app,
This latest update is horrible.  Takes FOREVER to update the stories.  Way to go geniuses at the NY Times.,
It has ads AND I have to pay?! It'll spend lots of time and bandwidth to update sections which are locked anyway. What a rip off and a joke.,
"Continually freezes my phone, piece of junk",
All it does now is push subscriptions...  good luck with that ;),
Opinion based on fact. Content worth subscribing for.,
It is a great app from the best paper in the world.,
love the app. works great on my s2,
Keeping up to the minute on world happenings.,
Went from small and beautiful to big and ugly. Ugly ugly ugly. Goodbye.,
Best news app available.,
Locked content = lame,
Terrible!!! Why can't this be like the app for ios? Freezes a lot during refresh!!!,
40 yr subscriber - nowhere near NYT website,
uses more memory than any other app on my phone. why??,
Excellent,
"No, really? This is better?",
Slow,
"Stalls frequently. Phone displays ""app not responding"" message twice when app is starting. CPU gauge max's out at 100% 1000MHz often. Droid X2 2.3.4",
"This was a great app before the paywall went up, but now it is basically unusable. It constantly freezes, and when it is working it takes at least 10 seconds to load an article. Extremely frustrating. I became a paying print subscriber primarily so that I could access this app, but it doesn't even work! Get it together, New York Times.",
"The NYT app is great for my phone, but the special news alerts have become unwieldy. Eddy Murphy dropping out of the Oscars is *NOT* worthy of a special alert. Evidence of an Iranian Iranian nuclear program, or a big event / attack / surprise somewhere is. I hope that the editor will consider these alerts with the same importance as they do the placement of articles in the paper or online, and not some willy nilly extra feature. Thank you.",
"I am OK with paying for the digital version of the paper, but like everyone else on here, we should get a decent app for the money. I logged on through my phone's browser, I use Miren by the way, and had a much better experience. I guess if you have an unlimited data plan, and good wifi, this might be an OK substitute. But it's not what we should have to do.",
"It used to be a beautiful little app. Why did you have to go and ruin it like this? Painfully slow AND crashes all the time -- infinitely worse than the smooth experience that I had just a week ago. Can you get up and fix this thing in a hurry? We expect this level of amateurism from shoestring outfits, not from the NYT. So get out there and find the developer that can make these problems go away. Thanks. Z",
"Crashes sometimes, will say ""updated"" even when there was no internet connection it could have used to update the articles. HTC Eris",
"I am a paid subscriber to the NY Times having just signed up after reading the Times for free online for the past 15 years. I could still do so but paying is really what should happen after all of these years for free. The Android app I've just loaded is buggy. First, It hung on me while downloading updates and I had to do a force close. Then finger scrolling through the applicable news categories does not work properly -- moving my finger across the screen gives me an unwanted selection. Time for a fix!!",
"For a data heavy app, they need to enable you to move at least the data to SD storage. When they do that, I give it 5 stars. Runs fine on my Wildfire S... just hogs too much space.",
"While not quite as slow as it was originally, simple text stories can still take up to a minute to load. Additionally, this app will randomly pop up even when you aren't using it, interrupting everything from dialing to kindle reading",
"Loved it when I first got it. Each update had made it slower and less stable. Constant crashes, slow to update, no longer usable when off line.",
"Good app, but often buggy and filled with obnoxious full screen ads. Harsh way to get to content you pay for.",
"Good touch graphics. Does not utilize multi-threading, blocks me out until the stories are completed loading, not smooth at all...",
"Way too sensitive to horizontal component of thumb movement. Too often I scroll up, only for the app to think I swiped to the side.",
"Design/UI seem fine, but it can take up to a minute for a page to load. Sometimes, my little awesome phone gets left behind by developers. Oh well.",
"Even if you have a paid subscription to the online version of NYTimes, they will still interrupt your reading with a full screen ad. Just happened.",
"Too expensive, and can get equivalent newspapers around world free w Google. I $5/mo online, OK. Given other available, why would anyone do more.",
"Each update is worse than the last. Headlines are very slow to display, app often sits on a blank screen for minutes at a time. Full ads annoying.",
"Unstable, force closes constantly. Freezes, is incredibly slow. Takes more than 5 mins to change sections. Ridiculous.",
"pretty good. Only complaint is widget doesn't update on my samsung fascinate. Good content, no problems with speed, haven't seen full page ads.",
Journalistic content of course is awesome but thar's not what we are judging. The app stinks.,
"Not worth it for free.  If I have to pay, may as well get the far superior paper version.",
The content is five star. The app is one star. Mostly it just doesn't work. It won't open or it won't refresh. And it has weekly updates to reinstall,
Before I updated the app I was reading full article.Now after I updated the app you only get 2 lines per story and an offer to sign up and pay.,
Deleted most emailed from free app which I liked to read on occasion. Can get top stories elsewhere so deleting app.,
I just deleted this app from my Evo 4g because it was causing serious memory leak. Evo said this app was using 600kb but when deleted I got back 8mb!,
"makes you get a subscription. it was free once, now it makes you pay. Pulse is a way better news app. I highly recommend it.",
"This app has serious loading problems, which is shocking considering reputation of the NYT. You're lucky your readers are patient.",
"Frequently forced stop when starting, slow to start, pictures too big and slow down response, otherwise a good app.",
"Probably a good app if you're a subscriber. If not, is severely crippled & worthless.",
Back button exits rather than going to section list. Memory hog--25 meg w no option to save data to SD. Lots of force closes. A disgrace.,
You can only get the top stories but you can read them offline! Better than most news aps!,
"Even after Friday's update, app is still buggy. Is this a sign of the Times's irrelevance and outdatedness: they can't make a phone app that works. Technology appears to continue to bury them.",
have had a love/hate relationship with this ap but has been working great for months so I'm back to being a fan!,
"Once I updated I could no longer read full articles. You get two sentences per story. Down load the BBC/UK news app, free and has great content.",
After a week got a message saying pay 3.75 a week to keep viewing. Apparently the free app is just a trial.,
I have a paid subscription.   I think I'm switching to WSJ.  Maybe the will respect my screen real estate.  Otherwise it would be fine.,
"For such a simple application and an otherwise fabulous news organization, I am consistently disappointed in the NYTimes Android app.",
I like the NYT but it loads so slowly! Sometimes takes several minutes to open!! Very bad.,
The font size is not large enough for the small screen mobile TOT,
"This update supports full page ads, which significantly increase download times.",
"Best news source, worst widget. Faulty and doesn't update.",
"Not free at all, almost all sections are locked and its a poor quality app. uninstalling. Galaxy S II",
Each upgrade gets worse. Locks up phone while waiting for data.,
Why is it free apps like usatoday load in seconds but this piece of crap which I pay for takes minutes.  Canceling my NYT! !!,
Was fine until advertising began. Now it couldn't populate itself out of a wet paper bag.,
"I'm an NYT subscriber and value the depth and breadth of their content, but the NYT android app is pitiful, crashing 50% of the time on HTC Evo Shift",
used it everyday until the latest update rendered it impossible.,
"Yes, quality news coverage costs money and this app requires a subscription!! This app provides great access to one of the best global newspapers.",
"New update is more stable (old version crashed somewhat frequently) but exponentially slower, to the point of being nearly unusable.",
Love the app but can you make it moveable to the SD card? Too many out of memory notices when reading.,
I expect better from NYT. Usually able to access most features;but there are ongoing issues with crashing and seizing on htc Incredible 2.,
It's fine. Top news worth checking almost daily.,
It runs like a dog. Super slow. At least it doesn't crash and that is why it gets even two stars. Why can't this get as good as the iphone app?,
Love this app. Gives me all the top stories quickly.,
the app doesnt allow me to save favorite sections easily or re arrange the order of material,
Used to be good....I would read it every morning on the way to work on the train. Now it only gives you two sentences and prompts you to purchase. :(,
The old (pre-subscription) version was much better.,
90% only viewed by subscription,
Absolutely ruins the app. Now even usable.,
Lost a star cuz it can't be moved to SD!,
"Great reporting, good app.",
It's my 1st source for late news--indispensable. Herb parmet,
Improved? Now with more slowness but less instability. decent content,
Why cant i delete this app!!! Htc evo. It stays stuck.. hate it,
This app works very well.,
"Subscribe + ads? Sorry, but this is why papers are dying in the first place.",
"No SD option, and as soon as you click on a story memory for app balloons from 1.89MB to 9MB or more. Why is this?????? Very poorly programed",
Doesn't cache in the background....,
"Won't take me to app directly, has to go to dl page first, why?",
Lets you read a see sentences of articles that u cant read unless u pay,
Should not be in free app section.,
This app is now only a portal to advertize for paid content.,
"""Free"" for 30 seconds then need to subscribe for more than 1 paragraph.... Booo",
Crashes. Jittery app.,
Best app on my phone!,
Doesn't work,
Should it be taking more than 12 minutes to download and install the new update?,
Glitchy & slow,
Ads for paid subscribers! What?,
Getting better.,
Only one to use!,
Convenient and well designed,
you people must think reporting is free. print media is down so they have to pay Newsrooms somehow. advertising money isn't the same,
Eats memory on nexus one,
Best newspaper,
COPASETIC,
Getting better,
Gooooooood,
Improved,
Dont download unless you plan on paying 3.75$ per week. Wont ask you at first but eventually u cant read the news unless subscribing. No thanks.,
Ñññ. ....   . ...                .     .       .   .. .    ..      .        . .  .     ..   ..   .   .     .                 ...             .    .,
SD option???? When???,
Meh,
"Times subscriber but the login screen (settings/login) is blank. Funny thing is it worked until I reinstalled the app. Deleted and use the mobile app, which is less convenient but lets me log in and also saves a lot of internal space.",
"Freezes and force-closes a lot now upon launch; used to work great. Please address. (Specifically: I load up articles w/strong Wifi connection at home; then when I open on the train to read, with no connection -- glitches galore.)",
"I loved the NYT app. Even after the upgrade and paywall, I had no issues because I mainly used the widget to access top stories, which are still free to read. However, the upgrade also left this app completely useless. The widget doesn't work more than it does (constantly saying no connection or just freezing in a blank state) and when it is working it takes forever to access the story once the headline is clicked. Most of the time, I have to FC and re-click to access the info. Uninstalled for now/EVO 4G",
"The app is fine, but I'm disappointed that it doesn't show the technical prowess that is well on display in the NY Times website and Chrome app. Two bugs that come to mind: - it's way too easy to accidentally swipe sideways between articles; and swiping back does not leave you at the same place you where; you have to scroll all the way again. - images and captions from the wrong article embarrassingly appear on unrelated articles; this is very obvious, and very bad. Please give it some development love!",
"Constantly freezes, worst programming job since pandora. Fire the team who created this and then considering sending them to the gulag",
This app is NOT free as many of the articles are secured. You are then asked to subscribe with a two week free trial. It's a scam; am uninstalling.,
"5 stars for news, 3 for app features and reliability, altho recent update may have fixed things.",
Everyone is obviously having the same issue with an almost useless application without any explanation from the Times on how/when this will be resolved.,
"Constantly force closes when around a spotty connection, which happens to be when I use the app the most. Has been doing this since the move to paid and still hasn't been fixed.",
The current version of the app is plagued by failure to update articles as well as force close errors on relaunch.,
I wish I had tried the upgrade before I paid - the app is now as slow as Windows 95. Whoever released this update should be made to watch Fox News.,
The new version has more obtrusive ads and it keeps turning on by itself and interrupting other apps. Don't upgrade.,
This is a great app. It does not always remember which articles I have already viewed but I should expect myself to be responsible for something.,
"This app's subscription is expensive, slow and still has ads even though you are paying. Use Reuters news pro. It is amazing and free.",
Almost never loads. In order for the widget to refresh headlines I have to delete it and then place it again.,
Still not good if you are tight on space on phone - loading a single story uses 6MB of cache storage.,
The nytimes app crashes more often than it works. I have the latest version (2.0.6) running on an htc evo 4g with android 2.3,
"Most content locked, app just not valuable any longer.",
Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can't access my favorite opinion columnists or share content to Facebook. I can't go very far with this,
No caching of content means the supp is useless for reading when on the subway. In addition page loading is excruciatingly slow.,
Always forces itself to close. I can only view content about 20% of the times I attempt to.,
"Nice for reading long articles, but consumes too much storage; can't be moved to SD; drop down menu easily confused with main notification drop down.",
on the last update unable to share articles on aneroid. please fix . otherwise love it. thanks:-D,
Update is worse than last time. Closes after 20 seconds.,
The new update disabled something I used a lot: the ability to download news when connected and then leisurely read the news when in subway.,
New App is super SLOW. Takes minutes to start! Eats battery. NYT should revert to prior version which worked great.,
Crashes every other time I open it. Never caches articles properly for subway reading. I've tried re installing.,
Much slower after the last update. Wrong pictures in the articles. HTC Incredible,
They want you to subscribe to their online content.,
Just got the update and it crashed and forced closed within minutes of opening. I an on a samsung galaxy s vibrant,
fills up android's message memory and gives error.,
"The app itself is nice but since most of the content requires a subscription, it's rather useless.",
This app is pathetic for an organization as big as the New York Times. Terribly unstable.,
"While I can understand the need for the occasional full screen ad, the Sonos ad is relentless and alienating. No way in hell would I buy it now.",
"The ads are ridiculous. The flash across the screen about every second or so, being really distracting and even ineffective!",
This used to be free but now you have to pay 3.75 a week!? That's retarded. Moving to a different news app,
"Since the update, takes up too much memory...dislike",
Current version crashes a lot! Samsung captivate.,
"Pages take too long to load, though not as long as the ads, which black out the screen and freeze the device for several long breaths.",
Opinion section its locked to subscribers. Asp is now useless. I am deleting.,
Remember when this app was free? Too bad the update made it so you have to pay a whopping $3.25 P/WEEK! despicable,
"The NY Times has excellent content, but the new version of the app goes to the ""open/uninstall"" screen not the app.",
The last 2 updates resolved the crashing and slowness issues.,
"Wrong pics showing for articles, forces closed frequently",
"Crashes frequently, does not refresh according to settings",
Updated! Workes well thanks. Had been way too buggy but they fixed it.,
Why am I still getting pop-up ads when I pay for the news! I suggest removing the popup ads for subscribers - they are very annoying to the overall experience,
Whenever I scroll through an article I get bumped to a different article. Fix this bug already!,
Very buggy and slow but only way to get NYT.,
Liked it when it was free ill use bbc and ap now Thx ny times for being greedy,
"Sorry, but this app is SLOW! That and before I had this phone, I could visit their mobile site and read every section, now I have to pay $ for it?",
"Great app, but I want to scroll using the volume keys.",
Need to reinstall frequently,
Ridiculously buggy for a paid app.,
$15 dollars every month for this crap when u can get the paper to your house put it on a stop for a year get all the nytimes for free better then 15,
Great articles but unusably slow as a news source.,
It is crashing on my sansung moment.,
A great newspaper with an app that now works very well.,
Great app for keeping tabs on both top headlines and unique stories.,
Last two updates resolved earlier issues.,
Sorry but I am not paying for news I can get for free elsewhere online,
Great video section tp compliment news.,
"it is too slow to open the app,and too slow to react.",
"Works well again after a disastrous rollout of the ""paywall"" update.",
App works fine but needs ability to move to SD!,
"It now wants a subscription, but why bother when u can get the full story online?",
Great app runs smoothly,
Great app! Quick and easy to use!,
Much faster than it used to be.,
Great site,
Why does the NYTimes need access to my call log? Decent app but permissions are invasive.,
"Ads? I am on the promo subscription, but the ads will ensure I won't extend it.",
"Great gui, but unstable.",
To see most of the news you have to pay.,
"With so many free news sites, why am I going to pay?",
Lame since the update.,
Can not find a way to change account.,
Will never buy a Sony product again.,
Takes forever to upload in my phone. Frustrating.....,
"Seriously, only four sections? What a waste!!!",
M.. M . ..mmoore m....m..m... .,
Ads every page~cant access most content unless subscriber,
way too expensive,
"Should i pay for reading your arcticles in the app? After all,its free....no? Uninstalling!!!",
the app is not stable,
Constantly crashes,
Very useful,
Great,
"I am a subscriber, so I pay for the NYT. But the app has no way for me to get rid of screen ads.",
Good,
Videos only?,
Bellissimo,
Yi,
It keeps freezing on my Nexus S. Takes ages to update news when other apps are working fine. I had to uninstal it. Please see if it can be fixed. The same app works great on an iPhone.,
"I was pleased to see an updated version available, thinking that perhaps NYTimes had gotten its act together and improved things. One of the main ""improvements"" from this update was the introduction of full-screen ads, even for paying customers. Hundreds of dollars a year in subcription charges, and I have to manually ""skip this ad"" past full screen ads? These guys really don't get it. Am very close to pulling the plug.",
This app doesn't work at all for my HTC EVO 4G. It will get stuck on the loading screen and may even crash or need to be force closed.,
"Keeps opening up to the original download window, why can't I just read the news.",
I'm a subscriber...don't mind paying but app times out and force close hope this update fixes it,
"Wrong images in articles went from funny to maddening, so glad that's fixed. Its's been more perky (the lagging stopped) for awhile now, too.",
8/10/2011 update brings force quit after reading one article - 100% repeatable - moto droid,
"Finally, a robust app that rarely stalls and loads quickly. Plus, it updates articles when the app is closed. The app is now worthy of the NY Times.",
The information is timely and well written but tends to take longer to load than other news apps.,
Used to be awesome. Before they started charging for it. There are plenty of alternative apps which deliver news for free.,
needs money to read news,
"Since the last update, it doesn't recognize my subscription. Grrr.",
Great. Thanks for fixing the locked sections problem for the subscribers :),
It gives me the news I need. Convenient and easily accessible.,
"Jeez, unpaid readers can't even access the most Emailed articles anymore..? What a joke! NYTimes quality great ; NYTimes business model, blech!",
Stop being cheap! This is the best app on the market!,
Updates slowly and often times out.,
Stalls often or forced closed. Maybe it's my phone. Otherwise can't beat NYT.,
Better than buying the paper. Longshot approved!,
"8/11/11. HTC EVO. It logs me out and I have to sign in every time. $17 a month and the app has never been worse. Last chance, NYT.",
The best coverage,
Update sucks! We now have to pay $3.75 a week!,
It ask me every time i open for upgrade.,
Is gut!,
Has pop-up ads,
If i get a subscription do ads go away?,
Recently improved.,
Great stuff,
"When you hit the back button on your phone, it returns to the top of the list of articles, not to the spot to which you had scrolled. Slow over 3G",
Not sure what's wrong. The app seems to freeze a lot or my screen goes black. Most frequent notification s that the NYTimes is not responding. Not really functional. I wish they'd improve--especially since this is one of the reasons I subscribed.,
"Runs free for a short time, then requests a subscription. I can get the same stories free elsewhere. In the trash bin you go",
"Very limited free content despite ballooning to 70 Mb. Runs without permission, wasting battery. Crashes frequently on HTC D HD.",
They locked down the most emailed section too. Now all I have to read is US stories in top news. Uninstalled,
Since the last update this app has become worthless. Painfully slow to load articles and forces closed more often than not. For such an important app this issue needs to be resolved immediately. Uninstalled. Droid X,
"Good app, great content. Bugs finally fixed. Worth subscribing; app is nice for free top stories in any case. A little slow & some ads are annoying",
"This app never works. I have reinstalled several times. It's a real shame, as the Times has such great content.",
A great way to get your news. I use this every day. Recent versions have fixed problems that were in earlier versions.,
"Needs app2sd badly. Paging of content (rather than jerky scrolling ) would be nice. Should be able to control account, like vacation settings for news",
Constantly freezing since the latest update. Very frustrating that the app has been around for so long and they still haven't worked out all the kinks,
New update adds a scrolling advertisement at the bottom..really annoying when you are trying to read...wish I hadn't updated.,
"Finally, after the recent updates, this app works wonderfully and is again my go to news app. No problems. Thanks for the fixes! Mytouch 4g.",
NYT has ridiculously crippled their own app. might as well just delete this and use the mobile or regular site in your browser.,
"Pretty stable now. A bit slow, and FCs occasionally, but really pretty good. Used it every day during my lunch break.",
It's sole purpose is to crash and burn. Better off use the mobile site.,
Crashing / loading problems seem to have cleared up finally after many updates. Starting (cautiously) to have faith again...,
"The ap often gets hung up, but when it works properly the content is excellent.",
Takes forever to load or refresh. Force closes often. Each new version is worse than the last.,
It's rare that you get to pay for something that works less well than when it was free.,
"Been waiting for this one. Well made app for one of the best news sources out there. Update: as a paying subscriber, I shouldn't be seeing ads.",
"Still not as fast as before it went paid, but much improved over the recent updates.",
"The newest update makes this usable again. It could still be a bit smoother, but it's finally acceptable again, and worthy of the New York Times name.",
This app is terrible. It takes forever to load and fails all the time. Miserable.,
"I don't mind the subscription fee or ads, but seriously, force closes all the time and now loads images for the wrong article. Please fix.",
"Nice if I can edit and paste on my evo, it kinda freeze a lot",
"With each update, I can access LESS content. Used to get top stories and the most emailed articles. This release blocks the 'most emailed' :(",
Hard to see all sections. USA Today does a better job,
"Fairly crash prone, data heavy, and loads wrong pictures. More painfully, will dump cache at worst moment and search for new things... Yuck!",
"Functions intermittently. Frequently shows ""loading""but never gets past that point on my sprint evo.",
The journalism is great but the program is slow and shuts down on me a lot.,
Crashes frquently and i dont like that so many of the sections are paid only now.,
Crippled app. Only useful for subscribers. LaTimes all the way. F. U. NYtimes,
"loads slowly &/or needs force closed. W/the latest update the ""Most Emailed"" is subscriber only. Not worth the annoyance for the paucity of content.",
"I have no problem paying to view an unlimited amount of articles but when I see advertisements WHILE I am paying for it, then there's a problem.",
Great when it works. Crashes about 40% of the time. HTC desire S,
"... Its getting better. Your new app is terrible. It crashes all the time. The old one was a rock, bring it back!",
Latest update finally seems stable. Changed my rating accordingly.,
The app does what it says. Points for improvement include making the widget more responsive and putting a refresh button in the app.,
Absol. no issues for me. I'm logged in- stay logged in. No freezing. One complaint: Ads. Annoying on paid subscription.,
Thanks for trying to price gouge me. Your articles are not interesting either lol,
"It keeps freezing , telling me to force close. Egh! Can yuh help people out!",
You have to uninstall old version before updating to new one! Works great now.,
"Why does this keep telling me i need to subscribe when i go to Most E-Mailed section? I'm already subscribing through my PC, with cell phone included.",
A pleasant app to have when on the train and such forth HTC wildfire,
Finally fixed!! Now updates faster and smoother than iphone version. Thank you.,
I am so sad! I used to love reading nyt in the morning...but I can easily give it up for $3.75 a week. :(,
Almost constantly crashes and drags when it doesn't. I'm a paid subscriber - awful! Droid 2.2,
I am a New Yorker and I drive trucks so I am never home . This app is home away from home,
Moat emailed and other interesting sections are no longer free. Uninstall.,
"Worked fine until they decided to charge for every section except ""Latest News""",
This app is terrible. Always freezes up.,
Crashes every second launch. Desire HD,
Takes forever to update on samsung epic. Pathetic.,
"Works on nook color, but not full screen. It shows in a tiny box.",
Much quicker & more stable since latest update. myTouch4G,
Too much money for subscription.,
Few non-subscriber articles and keeps crashing.,
Pictures and their captions often don't match the article.,
Why can't you guys make a consistently working app?? Everytime there is an android update this app quits working!! It is very frustrating!,
Why can't I read content offline? I paid for I should be able to read it. Total amateur hour with this app,
Like the news. Want it on SD card for Samsung Intercept.,
This update took 20 minutes! You need to improve your instalation program.,
"15 is steep, but not ridiculous. I'd pay it if the app worked.",
Crashes constantly with android 2.3.3,
Get rid of the subscription fee and life will be good.,
All you get for free is 6-8 top stories...pretty lame!,
I think they've finally got it!,
A great way to gather information.,
Thank God for the NYT. It Should be required reading for all US citizens. George. Boniface,
Why bother unless you are a subscriber? Only lets you have access to the top news section now.,
"it only took a year, but the app finally works again!",
Works great after latest update,
Costs money when other news outlets like the BBC are free,
So much better after a recent update.,
Used to be free to read now you have to see the articles. I will stick with the website.,
Uninstalled as soon as I found out it costs money now. I shouldn't pay for news...,
3G + 4 bars = sloooooow,
"Always ""loading..."". Never updates the sections.",
There is a bug that asks me to install the app every time I open it.,
If I can't read anything without being a subscribe what is the point.?! I am,
Paying for whatever content THEY deem isn't top ten? No thanks,
Why would I pay for what is.free in the browser? Practically all sections are locked.,
Its ok. BBC interface should be a standard for news apps,
Not good.,
Much improved!,
I liked it when it was free!,
Love it !,
Works much better now,
Nice app,
I can not believe I have to have ........,
Great!,
This is great.,
Commercials plus subscription? Are you kidding?,
Pay for it? I stick to other news media.,
Best news in the world,
The best,
Thank u,
AMAZING,
Not working on druid 2,
Can I have the prev version back? The new one spends 100% of its time updating sections and won't let me read from the section I'm in.,
Never updates,
Not actually free,
Not free,
Crashes 85% of the time and then takes minutes to load. I do not believe it is functionally compatible with the G2 from T-Mobile.,
"If you quit on the NYT Android app a while ago because it used to be abysmal and crash all the time, now is the time to re-download and give it another try. The app is now absolutely great and polished and delightful -- it is actually better than reading the paper on the mobile site! The ONE THING holding this back from being 5 stars is that NY Times HTTP links from the web don't open in the app -- please fix that!",
"Crashes, and has to reload every time I open it. Clearing suggested caches, and data, then uninstalling and reinstalling did not solve the problem.",
"This used to be an excellent app, but load times and crashes now make it almost unusable. Issues started when they switched to a paid model",
It would be s great app if only it worked. Keeps freezing. Might as well just use the mobile website...or the daily news app which works great!,
"Terrible app, sensationalist coverage. Al Jazeera English has better reporting and killer apps.",
"The ap is slow and frequentlyu  crashes, but the content is excellent.",
"The latest version works great. If you have lingering problems from a previous version, clear the data in the Android app manager.",
Disgusting. What a joke. The entire situation surrounding this app and digital subscriptions with the NYT made me cancel even my print subscription.,
"This is the most frustrating app I've ever used; even when I have a decent signal, it stalls and crashes regularly. When it works, I love it.",
"The worst Android app I've ever used. Horribly slow and buggy, it slows and heats the phone almost instantly.",
"Freezes constantly and widget almost always displays the ""loading"" message instead of headlines. It crashes frequently as well.",
Don't know why the image is so small-- it doesn't fill the screen of my Galaxy tab. Therefore requires alot more page scrolling than should be necessa,
"Lags, crashes, and most content is now locked. Price is ridiculous considering you can find free news elsewhere. Uninstalled.",
I gave it 2 stars because: 1. Showing ads even for paid subscriptions (which is not cheap) . 2. Not able to instal on SD card. Articles cache to main.,
"The app is working great since last update. If you still have issues, delete data and log back in.",
"Horribly slow. It worked great when it was free, now that they charge for the app it's sooo much slower. Getting news from else where now.",
Suggestion. DO NOT UPDATE. Uninstall first. Then reinstall. Doing this made all my slowness and crashing problems go away. Been good for one week now.,
"Agree with previous users, uninstall then reinstall. Was not refreshing news, now its working as before.",
Crashes daily on HTC Evo on Sprint running Gingerbread. App has great content but is nearly useless.,
Since the paywall the app has been slow and force quitting. choseing the manual update option doesnt seem to change anything. I read other news now :(,
"Always great content, but sooooo slooooww, laggy, unresponsive. Like addition of update all button. That was overdue.",
Moving from page to page is painful as this poorly designed app attempts to load assets (eg video I don't want) making user wait to read article.,
Breaking News alert feature doesn't shut off when deactivated. Nor can it be set to other types than your default alert.,
Slow and bloated. I'm a subscriber and it was too inconvenient to read articles. Needs move to SD card--the program is absurdly huge and eats up 20+MB,
It's slow and constant force closes now. It used to be great. Now I use MSNBC or BBC app.,
I have never written a review before but this is so bad I had to. It is so bad I have stopped reading the times.,
"Even after latest updates, the app usually hangs and has to be shut down. When it works it is agonizingly slow. Not worth it even if it were free.",
"Works great on my 1 yr old motorola Droid 2.2. Yes, I paid for a subscription and its well worth the money.",
Keeps getting worse and worse. Paywall stinks. Continues to get more laggy. Barely use it anymore and used to use it all the time.,
"Good app, but VERY upsetting that MostEmailed section was blocked as well. The charge for a digital subscription is outrageous. Should be reasonable",
I uninstalled older versions due to glitches. The latest update works great again. Finally. I only use free features btw. Lg optimus,
"Droid2: app hangs and force close necessary since the last big update, takes 15 sec or more to switch to a new article. Barely usable now.",
This app is terrible. It constantly crashes and freezes my Droid 2. It is slow to update and locks up downloading ads.,
"I loved to read the Times on my phone. But recent updates made this app so ridiculously slow it's all but impossible to use. Nexus S, Android 2.3.4",
Very disappointed with the speed and stability of this app. Old app (pre-paywall) was far superior.,
It's ridiculous they're showing you ads even as they're locking you out of content. Too much is subscription only. Removed.,
Some usability issues may have been fixed. Will see with greater use.,
"Uninstalled. Almost no content available without a ridiculously overpriced subscription. Bye bye NYT app, hello BBC.",
Terrible app. Used to read NYT all the time. Now I can't even open an article.,
Nyt should get somebody else to write this app. Shamefully buggy. Crashes on every single page several times.,
"I used to love this app. Would use it everyday, but after the required subscription, it crashes all the time.",
"Worthhless. Takes a long time to load, freezes up frequently. I want my money back.",
"This app stinks. Constantly frozen. Force quit or submit a ""report"" into the great void. Cancelling my subscription.",
I unchecked notifications but still get them even during my quiet time. Uninstalled.,
"This app used to work great. The last two updates rendered it useless. It won't load, hangs, has to be force closed and wastes the battery.",
The 5/15 update didn't help but on 5/19 I did a complete uninstall and then reinstalled and now it works perfectly. I love this app again! (DroidX),
Much better then the previous version. Still a bit slow and I always need to open the app twice because it reliably crashes the first time.,
Used to work perfectly until the paid service update. Now even a paying customers can't use the app. Very disappointing. Droid X,
"$195 cost per year aside, they ruined a perfect app. Articles don't load, and its the only app I have that crashes.",
"I'm very upset that after being lured into free app, NYTimes now charges for articles over top 10. Started reading journal instead.",
April was 1 star. The lates rev. earns 3. Great improvement in speed with fewer/no bugs.,
I once called this the best designed news app for android well that was before the last two updates turned it to a slow junky app that freezes.,
"Not sure why but I uninstalled, re-installed and now it works quite well. Evo 4G.",
"Great news, decent app. they've fixed a lot of the crashing problems, but I hate the fact that I still see ads despite paying for a subscription",
May be the slowest app on the planet!!! The new app is terrible. Really messed up a good thing. Bring back the old version.,
Crashes too much and unlike old app doesn't preload stories for reading when no connection,
"Unuseable, crashes continuously. Switched back to NYT mobile site. I am a print subscriber.",
"Terrible. Worked great until they went to pay mode. Now slow, crashes, stops the phone. Dont bother.",
App is very slow and unresponsive compared to NY Times mobile on a browser. Better to just use the browser version and forget the app.,
Cons: Prev. version slow to load & used a lot of memory. Pros: Sleek & intuitive interface w/ opt to save sections for commute reading. HTC Incredible,
It takes forever to download one article. It is incredibly slow even with wifi or full 3G signal.,
"Although an award winning newspaper, this app is far from winning anything. It is annoyingly slow to load data. It worked great before subscription.",
Almost the entire thing is behind a paywall. Can get the same thing for free elsewhere,
Not appealing as BBC app. Could have better lay out.,
"So tired of waiting while the application becomes unresponsive, freezes and crashes. I actually go out & buy the paper. Phone is HTC G2 (T-Mobile).",
Used to love this app. Even put up with the most obstrusive ads I've ever seen in an app. With most emailed gone...so am I.,
Terribly unreliable. Gets worse by the day. Was great four versions ago.,
"Used to work quite well, but if I didn't know better, I'd swear the droid updates are being built by an iPhone user.",
Just go to the website. Slow (sometimes takes 10 minutes to open a single page!) and crashes constantly.,
It's okay. I gotta pay membership for the exclusive articles. Blah,
One of my favorite apps for my Droid Incredible. Fantastic news source 24/7. Videos and photos load beautifully. Quality writing for free... great!,
"After paid version updates, this has become one of the worst news apps for android!",
Great app - love having Times available offline. Newest version works great - much faster to load,
Most recent update fixed my force-closing issues. Motorola Droid.,
It asks for a subscription for the whole articles now .. allow free access to a free app and i'll download it again,
"I am a print subscriber.PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME CONFIRM THE SUBSCRIPTION EVERY TIME I USE THE APP. I love the paper and the app, but fix this already!",
Incredibly slow and unstable. I am wasting my money on a subscription.,
This app stinks. Crashes constantly. Plan to ask for my money back.,
Freezes up everytime. Barely able to see headlines let alone read an article.,
"Used to be awesome...after being required to update, it's terrible. Usually crashes phone. If it does work, it's suuuper slow.",
Used to be a good app. New version is buggy and very slow. Droid X.,
"The 2.0.4 upgrade is a huge improvement in stability and speed. Finally, a usable app! An option to disable photos and videos would still be a plus",
Subscription pretty much ruined it for me. No problems with the app itself.,
"Dear NYT, your app developer is rubbish. please start fresh! Talk to someone like Zuminga",
The programmers who wrote this app are incompetent morons. This very slow app is full of glaring bugs.,
"The new update is slighty better, but still very slow.",
Force closes all the time since the pay wall went up. UNINSTALL,
Great! Clean! Wish there was a pay version to remove the adds. I only stopped my paper delivery due to my inability to read... no time. Would pay!,
Hangs and closes constantly since paid subscriptions started. Went from awesome to horrible.,
I can't believe I'm paying for this app. Constantly force closes; sometimes never loads. Useless junk.,
The very worst. Freezes the android every time you use it.,
"Slooow...force closes, eats memory. fix it please...i paid for a subscription but will cancel unless it is fixed very soon. Seems to be working better",
Very slow and always crashes. Earlier versions much more stable.,
"Uninstall and reinstall the app. The pages load fast, no force closes. Now I can actually enjoy the news with my coffee!",
Worst app ever! Never fails to crash...runs slow as hell. Better news apps out there.,
Buggy/ slow on my EVO4G ever since they went to the pay format.,
"As a widget it doesn't update stories. Slow to load, otherwise it crashes.",
"This app helps to numb the pain of riding the MUNI. As a bonus feature, it also keeps me well informed.",
"App has become *painfully* slow with recent ""upgrade."" Over 1 minute to load each story. Droid2.",
Had slowness issue with update. Uninstall/reinstall solved it... 5 star now.,
I love this app but wish the widgets would consistently auto-update. What's the point of a widget if I see old news until I access the app & refresh?,
this app is so slow and jams cap frequently it is virtually useless,
"I pay for journalism and bought this app, but the paywall changes to this app make it PAINFULLY SLOW, as if it's verifying my acct before each byte!",
Hangs most of the time. No automatic news update.,
Looks like they finally fixed this ap. Works as it should now.,
The free NY Times application for my smartphone has degenerated rapidly since the paper went to its (admittedly reasonable) pay-for-content model.,
"Used to work fine. Now it always freezes, even after updating.",
"New update is faster, but app still freezes a lot. This app doesn't do the journalism justice",
Like the look and features. But crashes too often.,
"Hangs constantly while updating, even on the fast Samsumg Galaxy S2!",
The subscription cost is totally outrageous! Please offer a moderate use plan for a modest fee. UNINSTALLED!,
Force closes constantly. Very very slow to update.,
"Does the job, though a bit frustrating the whole paper (eg sports) isn't visible.",
You have to pay after a while. Not good.,
"Keeps crashing, use to work better before the update.",
"After much trouble with the updated version, I reinstalled a clean version and now this app is awesome again!",
"If you have a 20 article limit, it is too easy to accidentally view articles.",
This is just one more confirmation that it really crashes frequently... would expect better from the nyt ?!? (android V2.3.3 on the Arc),
Force quits constantly! Works 5% of the time. Please fix this.,
Why can't you get the url of an article without sharing it through a specific app? Should be able to c/p link as you wish...,
"Always crashes, i have a droid 2, doesnt work",
Way too slow and limited in content to be of any use at all.,
Terrible app. Used to be great Now it always crashes. Uninstalling.,
Holy crap can this thing lock up my phone even more? Slowest app I have ever used.,
"One of the best news sources. Needs copy & paste text, access to older stories, no ads for paid subscribers--no double-dipping. Evo 2.3, NS 2.3.",
"doesnt work well, freezes ALL THE TIME.... great stories and news, HORRIBLE APP",
"A little sluggish sometimes, other than that, great app.",
Causes my continuum to hang all the time. Terrible app,
It was super good until they updated it so that u had to pay for a subscription of 3.95 a week. What happened? :(,
"Terribly buggy, tons of freezing, and uses 10mb per hour while IDLE!!",
"Great news, but the difficulties involved with the app warrant a low rating (slow, crashes, etc.. )",
The widget never refreshes and is a massive battery drain,
"Very slow on stock Nexus S 2.3.4. Great content, but slow...sometimes have to force close.",
Freezes CONSTANTLY. More than any other app I've had. Moto Droid.,
Force closes a lot and freezes...deleted from my phone,
"I liked it during the free trial, but now that it costs money I must uninstall.",
"Finally, with version 2.0.5, the app works well. Search function would merit 5 stars. Droid X/OTA GB",
Uh log horror hd ttys gtlfenhlo,
Use to love it and then they changed it so you had to pay for it!,
Latest version has resulted in problems updating the news.,
Extremely slow loading articles and crashes all the time.,
"The writing is still great, it's just that the app force closes so frequently that it makes it difficult to read the great writing!",
Takes forever to open and switch between articles. It used to work well. Droidx.,
"I like this app, but for how SLOW it is. System hog.",
Most of the time the articles never load. Opening this app is a waste of time.,
"Seriously, what a POS. I'm a subscriber, I'd like to be able to read my nytimes without it crashing constantly. I'm on a nexus one.",
Very slow and often have to force close on a Droid X.,
Wow! What a great app. The video is seamless. The story layout is great! Very happy. Droid incredible.,
"Embarrassingly unstable app. Great content, but if I can't open it, then why am I paying for it? They've had more than enough time to get this right",
Now works better after clearing out as per others instructions.,
Awful. Slow. Eats the battery. The greedy Times doesnt care.,
"After months this is finally working properly, took them long enough",
Slowest app in the android market. The developers should be embarrassed.,
Used to work great... now unusable. I uninstalled it,
"NY Times is fantastic, but the paywall is a terrible idea.",
Always freezes up and forces close. Would be great otherwise.,
Incredibly slow. Usually force quits.,
Since they put the paywall up this app simply has not worked,
Great content. Not so great software.,
"Had to delete this app, it wouldn't open.",
Doesn't open in full screen,
I love the New York Times app quickly keeps me up to date.,
Why did this app suddenly become the suckiest app around? Doesn't start up without trying 4 or 5 times. Crashes and stalls all the time now.,
Takes too long to load content even when connected to a private WiFi signal.,
"Frustrating app. Slow to load and locks up. Requires ""Force to close"" or ""Wait"" to keep reading.",
"Slow, buggy, and force closes all the time... How many upgrades does this app. need to get it right?",
the content is good but this is the slowest app to load on my phone,
You have to pay but still a good app I mean come on,
Crashes frequently htc desire.,
No longer works. They break the app just when they want to start selling access to articles?,
"Even after the update, horribly slow",
"Stays ""loading"" all sections forever with no result on HTC Desire S with Android 2.3.3 :(",
Runs fine now on EVO. Followed advise to uninstall previous version.,
Way too slow compared to the web page.,
Updates are not working and a forced close is necessary.,
Sxxz xsxsxxwz ex e. Cx. C sw. EezC s sxswzes,
Would be nice if off-line reading was a option.,
Not free!!!use to be but now u have to pay 3.75 so uninstalling,
Unusably slow since I started paying for it.,
Too bad only the most popular stories are available.,
Doesn't take up tons of room anymore... probably because it doesn't refresh,
"great app, but can't move to sd card and its huge.",
Works fine if you manually clear cache,
What was a good app has been broken (since the pay wall?). So sad about this...fix to get back to previous ease...,
I cannot get rid of the Breaking News Alerts. Anyone else have that problem?,
Love this app very informative! Crisp details..,
"Chaged rating. With update, it finally works. Thank you so much.",
2.0.4 is much improved. It no longer freezes and doesn't hog so much memory. At last!,
Great since I uninstalled and reinstalled.,
Stopped working on HTC Evo.,
NYTimes over charges for a subscription.,
The changes are deeply disappointing.,
After the update it always fails.,
Works better than previous versions.,
Ver2.03: more responsive than last ver. Updates in background. N1 2.2,
V. slow to load. Droid X,
"Used to be great. Now it's slow loading, force closes, and the photos dont match the story??",
"Excellent....only if you're in to unbaised, intelligent, thought-provoking articles.",
Great content. App is improving slowly,
Definitely an improvement over previous builds.,
"Since the update, it almost always crashes. And even if it doesn't, it's super-slow. I've uninstalled and re-installed three times and it doesn't help. I use a Droid X.",
Too buggy. HTC EVO 4G,
App is working fine now.,
Newsday does it the best in my opinion,
Current version works fine.,
Articles now require a $3.75 subscription.,
Recently has become incredibly slow and unresponsive,
I had to uninstall because I couldn't move app. To SD card. Phone : nexus one,
Nyt went subscription only. Uninstalled.,
Took too long to install update.,
Works after uninstalling and reinstalling. Droid x,
"Used to work, now terrible. NYT are you listening? Where's the fix?",
Crashes since update.,
It has not downloaded.,
$3.75 a week? gtfo. This app is more expensive than my netflix? F that.,
Not a free app you must pay to read stories,
Useless....almost every thing needs subscription,
Too much subscription only content.,
All content needs a paid subscription.,
Gotta pay to use now... uninstall,
A lot better than it was!,
"Sorry, not worth ~200/yr",
Horrible lags and crashes constantly,
Freezes constantly!,
It was good before. Now you've to pay :/,
Loading is slow.,
Slow to load.,
"With this update, the most emailed section is now locked to free users",
Always freezes.,
Terrible. Slow. Bad.,
Too slow.,
Widget is way improved.,
I am a subcriber to NYT PLEASE INSTALL,
Very flaky ever since pay for access,
Need to pay? Wake up!,
This used to be a great app. What happened?,
It takes forever to load stories. This app is not ready for sale at $20 per month. I want my money back.,
Constantly crashes,
Keeps crashing,
"It's okay. As a Christian though, the continuous news of latest developments in the gay community is not really floating my boat. Uninstall.",
Pay wall on most articles,
Needs improved performance,
"didn't it used to be possible to ""Search""?",
Seems to be working better,
Bring back Most Emailed!!!,
Won't open.,
Can't uninstall.,
Won't load :-(,
Clearing the data helps a lot,
This last update is working well - and it's only using 2.25 Mb of phone storage :) Uninstalling the old version then reinstalling seemed to help. N1,
Memory hog,
"vgyaiaia,",
SD move,
"I'm a subscriber, but the app keeps asking me to log in again to see content. Something in the authentication appears broken. Very annoying, not what I expect when paying $45 per month. I keep getting frustrated and abandon the app for months at a time.",
"Whether it's on my iPhone or my android phone, the NY Times app never fails to crash. Consistently poor performing software. Such a shame.",
Terrible app like all the others reviews have stated. I have trial subscription with NYT but am cancelling since this app is so buggy.,
Force closes every single time I open it. I use to love this app until a major upgrade with pictures and stuff. Now it simply doesn't work.,
"Content is superb. Performance of the app is horrible. Too slow with frequent freezes. It's a memory hog that can't be moved to the memory card, too.",
Since recent update in May 2011 the New York Times app has been essentually worthless. The app hangs and crashes my phone. Dissapointing.,
I pay for the subscription thinking that would help. Give me my money back. App keep crashing and it's super slow.,
"The is painfully slow (1min to load each article), and crashes literally every time I use it. Just thought I'd warn others before I uninstall.",
Wow. Love the New York Times and app used to work well on both my ipod and droid. Now the droid version crashes 4/5 times. Pathetic. Samsung fascinate,
This app crashes nearly eveytime i use it. I pay for NYT access and it should work every time.,
With every release since subscriptions it gets worse and worse - I honestly didn't think it was possible. Someone needs to get fired.,
"Disappointed. Freezes every time. I love the ny times, but will need to uninstall",
Locks up regularly. Too easy to accidentally slide sideways into another story. Mobile site is better.,
Freezes and force closes most of the time. Awful app. Previous version was great. Glad I did not subscribe.,
"Crashes constantly. When i emailed to ask for help i was told nytimes is aware this app crashes and is ""working on the issues."" total rip off.",
"The New York Times should be ashamed for releasing such a poor application, constantly freezes and needs to be ""forced closed"", not at all recommended",
"With most recent update, the application is not responding and I have had to force close it. Please fix, I love reading the Times when on the go.",
One of the worst apps. simply unexpected from NY Times. Freezes continuously. Takes several minutes to load and that too after having to force close.,
"Latest update, 2.0.4 still a piece of garbage. Force closes all the time. Finally uninstalled it. Now I use the free US Newspapers app to get to the Times. That works just fine.",
I love the NYT but if you charge 3.75 a week for content you should probably release an app. That actually functions. Crashes when not in app,
"I've been using this app since before it had ads, and well before it required a paid sub. It is by far the buggiest app in my drawer and crashes daily",
Good looking UI and solid content. BUT! Very unstable and sloooooow. NYT should rethink charging for content if their app can't deliver. Shameful.,
"I HIGHLY support the NYT in the new subscriber system. Someone has to pay for superb global reporting & outstanding journalism. App sucks, tho.",
Very poor response time on Samsung Galaxy. The NY Times apparently hangs the entire OS so there is no way of interrupting an ongoing request. -sma,
Freezes and crashes constantly. Have not been able to read a single article since 2.0. HTC Incredible,
Slow to load. Force closes everytime I try to open a story. I am a subscriber and am really disappointed. Time for a huge overhaul.,
"For those who lose reception in mass transit: they finally have an update all button so you can read during commutes, on planes, or other receptionles",
It freezes every time. It was working very well when the free viewing was available. I regret purchasing the subscription now.,
"Pathetic. Worked great until the paywall. Crashes, freezes and does everything but what its supposed to do. Junk.",
"New updates make it freeze more...please fix. Used to be a good news source, but too much locking up of app- HTC evo",
"Ever since they began charging for online content and changed the App, it is slow terrible and unusable. Its now a CrApp",
This app is terrible. They went to this new app when the paper started charging for subscriptions a month or two ago. It crashes at least 3X daily.,
As everyone else has said latest update has ruined this app. Freezes constantly now. Essentially unusable. 2 stars only b/c it used to be good.,
"As much as I like the NYT, $15 per month seems way too expensive. Plus app has ads.",
"Was five stars, now one star since the last update broke it. Crashes and freezes, unusable. Droid x",
Always crashes on my Droid X. Have to reinstall almost daily. Old version was much more stable.,
Apparently this app was written by some NYT copy editors during their lunch break. It wont even run long enough to crash.,
"Keeps freezing, force close, cannot read ANY articles, not to mention the paid section. Wall Street Journal is sounding very appealing right now...",
"Slow, force closes more than 70% of the time. I'm paying for the mobile version of the paper and can't access it. Really poor.",
"After I updated this app it literally used up all the storage space on my phone. I had to uninstall and now phone works again.Used to be good, not now",
Before you had to pay for this app it worked great. Now that I'm shelling out $$for it it rarely works. Very frustrating and wrong. Get it together!,
Keeps freezing and showing force close/wait popup. Very frustrating to use. Sad because this app was once great.,
"Great app, finally updates all sections at once. However the data are too big for the small memory of the nexus 1. Option to install in SD card needed",
"Too bad, I was willing. To buy a subscription. But app doesn't run on my android tablet! Starts in small, phone mode and then crashes",
"I paid for the subscription for this app, and it doesn't even open. It uses so much battery, way tío much for an app that doesnt work. Uninstall.",
it takes too much space (67mb now and the cache shows only 10k). it seems it never deletes articles even old ones,
That major update ruined this app. Now all it does is force close every time I open it.,
I used to love this app before the update. Now the fc pops up on my screen even when I'm not using the program b/c of the widget.,
Slow to load and update. Crashes frequently on Droid incredible. Ready to pay as soon as app runs reliably.,
"This app crashes all the time on my Droid 2. Difficult to even load one article, if it even loads correctly at all.",
"The last few updates have made it impossible to use this app, I am constantly foreclosing it if it even loads at all. Freezes every time.",
Performance issues with this app and is subscription only. Best to stick with sky and bbc news apps which are stable apps with good widgets.,
Very slow and buggy since I started paying for this. The pay wall has led to much worse service,
"Since the paywall a horrible horrible app. It should be called the force quit app, cause that's all it does.",
"Unusable. Takes forever to refresh headlines when first launched, with no indication that it's doing so. And if you tap too soon it crashes. DroidX",
"Seems slow and sometimes hangs. Biggest problem is with weak data connection, then app is almost unusable.",
"4-29 update, zero improvement - Uninstalling and canceling. the new app crashes every time it and is slow to the point of being useless.",
"I like the way articles are categorized, but the app consistantly crashes on my Droid 2, update didn't help.",
Freezes more often than not. Awful.a real loss twas great,
This app is almost unuseable. It doesn't work most of the time and needs to be force closed.,
This app freezes and closes all the time. It is terrible. I am a print subscriber.,
"Stay away, continual force close on Droid X. Now $150 a year with ads. Poor customer service also.",
Maybe they should make sure their app works before they charge people for a subscription. Terrible.,
This app has a long way to go before I consider paying for the subscription. It literally takes all day to scroll thru the 15 free articles.,
Locks up everytime. Crashes and hav to force close. Worst app i hav ever used Samsung galaxy s,
Locks up constantly since the paywall went up. Content is great and app functionality is good but its just too buggy.,
"Before the upgrade it was amazing, but now I can't even use it for my Evo. It freezes all the time and it is slugish.",
Terrible! Constantly freezes and shuts down. Old app was great. Every since the update to the pay version it has been a disaster.,
Went from being a 5star app to 1star--not even bc of the paywall. Nothing but freezing and force closes since original app was pulled. :( Moto droid,
Truly crap. I am a paid subscriber. I can barely believe that the Times Corp can produce and distribute such garbage. Skip this app!,
Have downgraded as some articles now need fees to be paid.. In order to be read.,
"Slow, freezes constantly since last major update. Not acceptable, essentially unusable. Sprint EVO 4G.",
"I love the content, but ever since nytimes went subscription, their app has sucked. It takes forever to load. Freezes. Force closes.",
I don't understand how an amazing app two months ago turned into this train wreck! Completely unusable since the rerelease. Freezes constantly. Droid.,
"Worst app I have. Has to force close 9 out of 10 times. Such a shame, cause I love NY Times otherwise",
"The current pay app doesn't work at all. App force closes every time. C'mon NY Times, if you expect people to pay, write an app that works. Droid X",
Completely useless since the paywall went up. I pay for the service too. Seriously broken app.,
Before the update the app ran without a problem. Now I hit constant delays and lag when opening the app.,
"Unresponsive during refresh, and no indication that it is refreshing. Strictly adheres to NYT subscription policy.",
"This app is terrible. It's slow, causes my Droid X to hang, and has wickedly invasive ads.",
App has been extremely unstable and crashing frequently - very disappointing for someone who's a longtime subscriber,
"Used to work great, but the latest release freezes all of the time. Uninstalling for CNN app.",
"Used to use app daily, but since the last large update, has been completely unusable. Crashes constantly - unable to access any articles.",
"Too long to load articles, too many crashes. BIG memory hog - 45MB! Love the Times - hate the app.",
Worst Gives headlines then forceclose 80% of the time Deleted after it invited me to pay a$4/wk subscription BBC much better,
"Recent updates have rendered a piece of ""doo-doo"" out of a previously trusty app. I un/re-installed in hopes of an improvement. Seems better.",
"I was considering paying, because I do love nyt's first rate content, but when I realized how bad this app has become, I gave up on it.",
Constantly crashes and freezes up my entire phone. Hateful!,
"Horribly unstable. Better off using the browser until they make this work better. Frequent messages that I need to ""force close.""",
"it used to be nice and simple, now it's buggy and sluggish. it's painful to use",
"As others note, now unusably slow. This is how NYT rewards subscribers!",
"It crashes so often! After so called upgrade to collect money, it becomes a piece of junk .",
"I love the nytimes, but not on my phone. The app barely functions. I have to force close it everyday as it freezes the phone (galaxy). Please fix!",
Takes way too long to load. Crashes repeatedly. Have had to re-install several times. Doesn't seem fair to have to PAY for this!,
Loved thebapp until I realized it takes up 60 MB of internal storage. Can't move it to the SD card.,
Used to love this app. Now all it does consistently is force close. Can't even open an article to read it. Sad! Droid X,
Bugs in the design. Forceclose. Not good. Not good at all. I enjoy the New York Times,
"If the Times expects to retain any readers, it cannot charge so much for its content. I am a subscriber and I should not have to pay $15 more/month.",
"Latest version slow to load, slow to update, and hangs my DX. Previous version worked better. I prefer Al Jazeera.",
I love the journalism but this app does not let me read the stories. It crashes and force closes every time I simply open the app. Hatin' it.,
"This used to work great, but now that I'm paying for it, it is crashing all the time.",
Why is this rated 3.5 stars when there are now hundreds off one star ratings. Crashes since upgrade. Worthless,
Doesn't work. Should since I am now paying for nytimes content!,
"Constantly crashing. If you want people to pay for your content, at least make it accessible. Embarrassingly bad app",
"Freezes while doing its very slow update, ... My contempt this app is only balanced by its utility. 5/6 update: crashes every time. Uninstalling.",
"Love nyt, but this app is unstable. I preferred the older, more stable interface.",
I used to enjoy this app before the update. Now it freezes up every time I use it. I had to uninstall and I am a paid subscriber.,
Updates haven't helped. Slow and often have to force close. Love the NYT; have come to hate the app. Droid X.,
"What a disaster- Droid 2. Force close, memory suck, slow, and full of bugs. I am a paying print subscriber and expected so much more. Uninstalled.",
Used to be one of my favorite apps but it has become unbearable to use. Had to remove it,
"Used to love it and was gonna start paying but it hasn't worked in weeks, crashes every single time. Waste of time and MB",
"If you adore repeated force closes and freezes, this is your go-to app.",
Force close over and over again! NYTIMES this is not acceptable for a paid service.,
"Used to work great when it was free, but is now significantly slower and buggy. Here's an idea for an editorial: NYTimes Forces Readers 2 Pay 4 S***",
The new app is terrible! Freezes on my phone all the time.,
New version is 10x slower than previous version. Almost unusable. Moto Droid 2,
"Might consider paying for a subscription if the app was not frustratingly slow. Old, free version was great.",
Stinks. Gets worse and worse. I love the NY Times but not this app.,
The widget works but the actual app force closes on 2.2. It needs to be updated and made compatible.,
Slow. Out of memory all the time. Latest update is worse than before.,
"This app freezes on a regular basis, causing me to force close it.",
Horribly slow. Droid 2. Ever since the update it has been really bad.,
This went from being one of the best apps to the worst app on my phone.,
Why can't this app properly manage its data? It's beyond ridiculous that this thing uses so much space that it makes every service on my phone crash.,
"Versions 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 constantly freeze and crashes on my Droid X. Wish there were a way to use an earlier version, which seemed more stable.",
Constant crashes and force close messages. Totally unusable. Total embarassment for a media company.,
"Like others, I got constant hangs/forced closings after upgrading in April '11. Simple uninstall/reinstall did the trick... working perfectly again",
Freezes up constantly. The app needs fixing before considering any subscription,
If I have to pay for news can I at least have an app that doesn't suck. The old one was so much better,
Extremely poor and slow performance. Cannot use anytime due to force close. BBC much better. Will it ever improve? Droid x,
Latest version is usable and fast. Solved themajor timeout issues of previous versions,
Ever since they moved to the paywall this app runs very poorly on my Droid X.,
The recent updates ruined the app.. Slow loading and force close,
"I didn't have stability problems & I like the layout, but find US Newspapers and World Newspapers fill my needs. NY Times gets very large & has no SD storage, & of course you need a subscription to view most content. NY Times' stories are deserving of a subscription, but there are so many other news sources & access to this information. I also recommend BuzzBox, Express News, Pulse & Taptu as news sources.",
"Worked much better before they began charging for content. Frequently freezes, causing system data reports to Google.",
The worst app since the paywall. I have a subscription and it still sucks. Force close for every article. Please fix it. It was once amazing.,
This app worked great until I subscribed to the NYT internet edition. Now it does not work at all!,
"Used to be my favorite app, now I can barely get it to run once every 10 tries",
"These latest versions are horrible compared to before. Crashes, crashes the Droid, slow, doesn't have manual refresh, and doesn't always...",
Before they did subscriptions ir was the best news app... Now its garbage. Freezes 99% of the time.,
"NYT is great, but the application freezes all the time on my Droid 2.2. So many have written the same thing. It's not rocket science- fix it! Duh!",
"Hangs up very freq on lg p500 android 2.2.2, same thing for widget, unusable",
"Ever since they started charging for the product the service has gone to pot. VERY SLOW, FREQUENT CRASHES! I'm giving it one more try...",
This app is very sub par. Not worth the money at all.,
Painfully slow. Runs in the background and causes my phone to basically not function. Galaxy s,
Take up 40MB. Crazy! Need to break up the sections and let readers pick which to download!,
"Have used the app for a long time, used to love it, now it's completely useless since last update, forcecloses constantly, slow. Uninstall.",
Just recently updated the app and now it crashes constantly. I will be uninstalling this app.,
Update helped. Doesn't crash but still runs a little slower than it used to. Droid Incredible.,
Developers should be replaced; force closes and causes application space low error. Unacceptable after pay wall. Crashed while writing this review!,

thought it would get better but it's actually slower worse when you are reading an article and then go back to the section out scrolls you to the top,
"Since the NYT pay service started, the app is extremely slow and hangs often.",

"I'm giving up on this app... I really used to love it, but I'm tired of it freezing my phone every time I open it, and then having to do a force close",
Used to work. Upgrade about a month ago killed it. Bug central,
Used to work but rooted and now all it does is freeze and crash,
Bad! Freezes all the time. When trynig to scroll down page switches you to next or previous article.,
It was great until they deided that they wanted $4 a month... what a rip off! Not free at all.,
"Unusable slow, hangs, eats up cpu also when in background, black screens, unbearable (atrix)",
"Slow! Force quits and/or freezes often. The content is good, but the app needs work.",
I would love this app if it didn't take up so much space. It balloons up to >10 megs after I log in. Too much!,
Got worse with constant crashes since paid subscription plan. That's not how loyalists should be treated!,
It use to be a great app both for my palm and now for my Evo. What happened...it sucks...the app freezes shuts down all the time.,
Great news but app a little buggy. Also now limited selection without paying way too much $$$$,
"Consistently forces the app to close. Great newspaper, terrible app.",

Absolutely terrible...crashes all the time.takes forever to load.done with new york times app.,
#NAME?,
Was taking up 85mb in ram. Bloated and slow.,

Pointless app after they implemented paid subscription services.,

Then, they updated the app and suddenly it takes up 15+ MB of your internal storage with no option to move to the SD - inexcusable. I have no problem with the pay-to-read model, but the app becoming this poorly-developed is just dumb.",
App used to be decent until the update rolled out with subscriptions. I bought the subscription and am really bummed because the new app is useless.,
This app crashes constantly and does not load at all underground. I was ready to pay because I loved the old app...this one is awful.,
"Crashes non stop on my evo ever since update that requires you to subscribe. It used to be free and functional, now it is expensive and broken.",
"Was great, new version has bunch of issues. Would not mind paying but it needs to be fixed. Will check back later.",
"Nytimes journalsim is great and it is high time they started charging for it. But this app is terrible, it freezes/crashes CONSTANTLY. Update!",
"Used to be a great app, now it is too slow, many hang-ups andforced shut downs. Not sure what changes they made, wish they would go back",
"Ever since this app was updated for the new Pay format, it keeps constantly crashing and i have to force close it 3-4 times before i can read an artic",
Slow loading time and 95% of the time makes the phone stall - but it's difficult to force close. Love the nytimes. Hate the apps poor behavior.,
"Freezes up when you try to view articles ever since they added the paid stuff. Also, could really use a search function (and the education section)",
Loved this app before they went to a subcription service. Now it is so slow. Lots of forced closes. No way would I pay for this level of performanc,
"Widget only displays 'loading' since the new version hit, and opening the app results in a black screen for 3-4 minutes before force closing. Droid X",
"Total piece of crap. Freezes or, if it works, is slow to the point of being useless. This used to be a great app.",
"Not sure what happened with the last update, but this app has become unusable. Freezes and crashes constantly. Uninstalled until improved",
This is the worst of all the Android apps. If you have the old version keep it. The new one crashes every time. I have complained bitterly to no avail,
"Excellent writing. Useless, broken app. Bizzare multi-column story navigation is always shifting to another story when i want to scroll down.",
"After recent update takes forever to launch, freezes, widget stopped working , I suspect it is related to them trying to track how many articles",
The NY Times is an amazing paper. Every day there are interesting articles in every section. Only concern is that it freezes up a lot.,
Freezes up my phone every time I try to open the app. Force closes. Ridiculous...if I'm paying for content I want a decent app. Samsung captivate,
"Total crap since the pay wall happened. Have had this for years, but uninstalling now.",
The free version was bug-free and on my short list of must-have android apps. The new version crashes way too often taking my os with it. Uninstall.,
"Used to be a great app, but when the Times went pay site, they released an atrocious update. Hangs all the time, seems to affect other apps, and ...",
"New enhanced update freezes phone and wont open requiring reboot. Plse fix. Ii love NYT app. Droid2 In meantime, I will uninstall. Don't mind paying.",
Since the last update I haven't been able to read a single article without the app freezing and shutting down. Not sure what NYT is doing. Droid X,
So sad. This used to be my favorite app. Now just long delays or force close. I love the New York Times but this new app sucks. Uninstalled.,
Free app but then when you go to look at something it says I have to pay. Total bs. Uninstalled.,
"Was an excellent, simple and light app. Now constantly crashes and takes tons of memory. Uninstalled",
Ever since they started charging for content this app is horrible. I love the content but hate the slow crash prone app.,
Worked very well until update. Freezes every time I open it. Used to be my favorite app but i no longer use it :(,
"Digital NYT subscriber, HTC Vision/T-mobile G2. Latest updates constantly force close or lag. App is now unusable. Very disappointing service.",
"Great content, of course, but the app itself is a buggy piece of kaka. So 1 for the app and 5 for the content. I will switch to Google news for now.",
"Hangs, crashes, and force closes a lot ever since update and paywall. Uninstalled and using other free news sources.",
New version is abysmal. Crashes every time I tap to the next story. Absolutely sucks. And I have a paid subscription. Awful. Disappointing.,
Freezes and force closes every single time I use it. Also doesn't always update.,
"Crashes constantly. Used to use all the time, now its a total flop. Boo on nytimes",
they figure out the bugs here. Hangs android for extended periods,
"Used to be a favorite. Now mega slow, a always freezing, and wants me to pay what I used to read for free. Junk.",
I am glad I waited for a better version of the application before buying subscription cause now it is 100% broken. Uninstalling right now.,
"Used to use this app all the time, but very lame now that they charge after a certain # of articles. Delete.",
Sincd update this app is really really really bad now. Crashes constantly and battery draining like a mofo. I unistalled and immediately gained 8 hrs.,
The app has been extremely slow and unresponsive ever since the paid version of online nytimes rolled out.,
Veeerrry sloooow response compared to two versions ago. Also not sure if ads belong as I pay for an online subscription.,
"This latest version has gotten MUCH slower and buggy. I have a Droid X with minimal other apps, and the app crashes or bogs 75% of the time.",
"DONT UPDATE. Update now asks for a $4 a week charge to be able to read stories, also very buggy and glitching on droid x",
"Ever since the upgrade to version 2, this app continually freezes. Very frustrating. Droid X",
Memory hog. On my G1 it grabs all of my limited memory. The old version was far better. Could not seem to do the digital registration like on my iPa,
This WAS a great application. The new version is completely broken. It does not work on Droid Pro or Galaxy Tab. Don't bother with it.,
"Nice app, but until it can be moved to sd, I an removing and canceling my subscription. Takes up an enormous amount of space.",
Don't pay money to read stupid ads. Update but still forces paying customers to put up with idiot adverts.,
Worked great until the pay wall went up. Top stories are supposed to be free but the only thing that half-works now are the ads. Crashes all the time.,
Used it everyday before update. Now it freezes and makes my entire phone slow. Sadly had to delete. Looking for a replacement news app.,
Constantly crashes on droid x. I'm going to cancel my subscription. Can't charge for a crummy app.,
"Was a great app for a long time, but the recent update has FAR less conent for free (almost none) and now the app has stopped working altogether. X",
Great info and articles and nice layout. Would have gotten a 5 but you can't scroll through this thing let alone view articles without it freezing,
It was a great app until the update. After update it constantly force close and its very slow but what's even worse now they want you to pay for it,
"After working reasonably well, new update renders it useless on Samsung Captivate. Very unprofessional IMO",

"Used to be my favorite app, but since the paywall update it crashes all the time and takes forever to load. Kill the huge pictures!",
Gltchy as all get out. Force closes almost daily. Only see headlines without subscription. BBC app much better. Evo.,
"i have a paid subscription. this app was once terrific and i used it constantly. since the ""update"" it has been a useless piece of garbage. shameful.",
This used to be my most used app. Since they put the paywall in the performance is terrible and it is a real pain to use.,
"Was ok before you had to pay for most of the sections. You get one free section and that's all. Removed from phone. It's not that great of a ""paper"".",
"I don't mind the limited access, you still get top stories and most emailed free. Lags like crazy and freezes my phone. They need to fix it ASAP",
"Great content, but now I'm paying for ads and an ""updated"" app that constantly force closes. The old app was better.",
This app crashes constantly. It worked fine before they started charging me to read the news.,
"Used to love this app, but think poorly of the new subscription requirement. Such a shame.",
"Thoroughly broken. When all the content was free, it was perfect. Now is crashes, freezes, hangs or shuts down my phone 90% of the time its used.",
The ap that was released with the limited access constantly fails and freezes. The most recent update in early May is no better.,
"It's not all about having to pay it's about how they are doing it. App crashes and is slow. Also, last I check I cam still access the website for $0",
"The free app was seamless, and the content was good enough to pay for... but the subscription version is so unstable that it is effectively unusable.",
"App stability has been beyond a joke recently and uses up too much space, shame though as content is very good.",
"Used be a great app, now it gives no indication of the date of the last update so you can't tell how old the article is, then suddenly it refreshes.",
Works great on dx. Uninstall then reinstall fixes force close. If that doesn't work get a better phone,
"Ever since the upgrade to allow nyt to levy a fee, the app hasn't worked correctly. Uninstall.",
Extremely slow. Widget takes forever to display news. Memory footprint is enormous. I had to uninstall it just for that.,
crashes every single time I use it. freezes entire phone for over a minute. always has to force close.,
"Great app when it actually decides to work. Constant force closes, should just go back to the old app that worked perfectly fine.",
It is a total invasiln of our privacy amd a vilation of our freedoms of speech and association. It disappoints & discoverts coming from the NY TIMES.,
While scrolling an article I always wind up swiping to the next one on accident and lose my place. Force closes that persist after several updates.,
"I am fine with paying for digital subscription but the app hogs memory or change article when my scrolling was a bit ""too horizontal""",
This app continues to go downhill.   Now it automatically updates sections i never read and hangs most of the time i run it,
Painfully slow since the update. Crashes frequently. Please fix my favorite news & information app!,
Used to be a good app until the new version. Now load times are lengthy and app freezes about half the time.,
"Widget does not load articles, and app hangs on start. I understand the paywall decision, but this app is now unusable.",
Constantly hangs on my Google Nexus S. Doesn't update on the schedule I set. Poor user interface. One of the worst Android apps I've used.,
"Hangs, crashes, freaks out when I lose 3G (like on a subway). Was much better in earlier version. New paywall version is actually far less stable.",
"Horrible. Crashes one out of three times, at least. Problems started when pay wall went up.",
"Slow slow slow, and buggy. They really screwed this one up, and I hope the geeks are working hard to fix it.",
"Slow, buggy, crashes often and seems to rarely work properly. NYT should get their act together.",
The NYTimes app force closes continuously. I will not subscribe for expanded online content until the app is fixed. A very poor showing by NY Times,
"I was happy to pay for the NYT, but the app doesn't work at all. Make a working app if you expect people to pay for news...",
"If I could rate this at Zero stars, I would. Never opens, requires force close. No more online NY Times. Sad.",
"I much prefer browsing the web page to this app. It's navigation-averse. You can figure this out, NYT!",
"App was a great until the update that handles the paywall. Now, force closes and is totally unusable. Uninstalling & cancelling subscription.",
Was willing to pay for content but latest iteration of this app is not even remotely functional. We want to support you but there's no way if..,
The last updated left this app in an unusable state with massive delays when switching between sections and stories. I'm surprised that NYTimes has allowed it to remain this way for so long. Hopefully they'll fix it soon.,
Bad update. Widget does not load and cannot open app from widget. App lags in loading.,
"Since they updated the app, its been TERRIBLE. takes forever to open (or doesn't at all), makes me force close it half the time, and sucks battery lif",
Never works. Crashes my phone everytime. I uninstalled it. There are other ways to get news on my phone. Just terrible.,
I used to love you NYT but now we must part ways. You just don't work for me anymore!,
"Since the change to using the app as a hook for subscriptions it's become horribly slow and crashes frequently, requiring a force close. Uninstalled.",
"Locks up repeatedly. Has gotten much worse with recent ""upgrades"". Now almost unusable",
I just want to say; props NYT for being amazing across the board. I heart you! And this app rocks the Casbah.,
"Keeps force closing... lots of bugs in new app. Not only am I uninstalling, im going to cancel my print subscription because this is so bad...",
Was good pre-paywall. Now basically unusable. Crashes constantly on Moto Driod.,
"Started out good, then the articles got locked down and said I needed to subscribe... no thanks. There are other free news apps.",
This app would be great if it didn't freeze and force close every time I open it. Old app was better,
"Now, in addition to the ads it crashes constantly and is behind a ridiculously expensive paywall. Nnnope, g'bye pissweasels. Uninstalled.",
The switch to the subscriber based model has slowed the application to the point of uselessness. I am a subscriber and should have access to content.,
"Once was good, but once they tried to charge you after the update it never worked right again. It constantly says loading and has to be forced closed",
"I love nytimes, but the app is slower and jerkier than ever. Can never tell when it's done updating a section. Website on phone is just as good.",
This was a 5 star app. The update is very slow and a HUGE memory hog. Not what you expect when you start paying for it.,
Force close now required frequently. Sluggish and freezes. Bought home subscription partly to use this app.,
"I don't mind paying at all, but the last two updates have caused the app to freeze and effect the entire phone. Even having the widget on causes lag.",
"I agree with the other comments. Ever since the update, the app closes or freezes. Fix it please.",
"Used to be a really good app, now its slow and fee based.",
"Crashes constantly since update for subscription came out. Used to be a great app but, sadly not anymore",
"Really slow and buggy, going to cancel subscription after $1 promo month if not fixed.",
Terrible app with good content. Constantly freezes and crashes. Nyt should do better.,
"Used to be great, but new version sucks. Very slow and crashes constantly. Incredible.",
What I do not understand is how the app still has so many stars in its rating. What once was great now completely sucks!! Epic fail NYT.,
"Love NY Times, Excellent Journalist, Great information when you need it. Up to date articles. I use it to get the latest & Greatest!",
Used to be good. Now unstable (force close often) and fee based. Plenty of better options. Uninstall.,
New version sux..I do not pay for my news when I can get it elsewhere. Uninstall.,
Keeps crashing and takes forever to load. It keeps on getting.more and more useless.,
This is the most bug ridden android app I have ever used. I am tired of trying to deal with it. Please fix this ny times!,
"Used to be fantastic, but new update is beyond slow and crashes constantly. So now you pay for access with an app that doesn't work.",
Since updating to the subscription version this app constantly hangs. It's terrible now.,
"Once switched to subscriber access, the software has become painfully slow and non responsive.",
"Shame on you NYT. The new version is AWFUL. Buggy, Freezes & requires reboot. FIX IT FAST or lose subscribers!",
"Do not download or update this app, greed kills you have ruined one of the best apps out there nyt",
Version 2.02 has become unusable on my DroidX. Super slow and hangs all the time.,
Don't release an app that doesn't work! Crashes 3 times for every 1 article I try to read,
Freezes & crashes. Very annoying since I just bowed down & paid for Digital Subscription!,
"It was working great since i got my droid in july of 2010, but for the last month it has been slow to load, crashes and won't update. Uninstall.",
"Since NYT went to the pay model, the app is S L O W to the point of pain. What a shame.",
"I love NY Times, but this app isn't very good. On my Droid Incredible it always crashes and is very slow to update with new articles.",

Won't load or crashes repeatedly. Love the NYTimes. Hate the app. Gotta uninstall and go with CNN.,
Paid app freezes every time I open in Droidx. 3 weeks straight!! PLEASE FIX,
Was a great app before the pay wall. Now hangs and crashes. Embarrassing.,
Still force closing and the widget locks up and won't respond. Used to be a good app....,
"After they started charging, program is buggy as hell. Keeps crashing! It's not like I can't get news free EVERYWHERE else. Uninstall",
"Super buggy, crashes 10 times or more each hour of use. I pay for this subscription, nytimes needs to fix this!",
"Crashes, slow, memory pig, consumes resources in background. Missing the old app. Evo Shift 4G",
Always freezing up. Good content but doesn't work properly anymore.,
"Was great until went pay for use beyond ""top news"". Update since ""pay for use"" takes long to load and crashes.",
We can get free news else where bye new York times :(,
Should not have upgraded. Have not been able to us app successfully since then,
"Great paper, poor app. It is very slow to load and ""times out"" on a regular basis.",
The Google ads are really annoying. Paying subscribers should be allowed to disable these irritating ads,
"Also was frustrated by FC, then discovered that if you clear al data after installing, its stable.",
"Once they remade it to limit viewing, my viewing has been zero because it crashes.",
"App has gone south (slow to open, slow between articles, and quick to force close) since subscription service started.",
".Terrible! Used to be great butnow freezes, blacks out on my droid. please fixit!",
Ever since i loaded the pay version ive had interminable waits.,
Unstable and slow. $200 a year for content that requires no paper or delivery infrastuctue? Combination of bbc and cnn now best for me.,
While you can't get everything without paying... the free content is still worth it for rides on the T,
It actually stops me from reading the ny times (and I grew up reading the times). All it does now is make me wait too long. I hope they fix it soon!,
"Force close all the time. Used to work, now its useless",
i just installed it on my android. Installation went well and app works without any issues. I am happy with it.,
Freezes constantly on Evo 4g. Unacceptably buggy when considering the $3.75 weekly cost of access.,
"Balky. Prone to crash. I uninstalled & reinstalled. No better. Bring back the pre-subscription app stability. I'm willing to pay, just let it work",
Same as other comments. Used to use every day until they started charging for a subscription.,
This app was a go to before the update and the gating of features. It force closes regularly. I had to uninstall on the droid x.,

Used to be 5 stars. Now 1. Its slow; and this new subscription has ruined it.,
The app fails to allow me to login with my paid account - very annoying!,
Used to work very well. Now the app crashes and lags alot,
Crashes all the time- they have not worked out this new version at all!,
Old apparently was fine. This version is very slow and freezes on samgsung. Don't bother till they fix it,
Very slow to load and unstable. Annoying ads even after paid subscription.,
"It never opens, i always have to close, my screen just turns black",
Crap after recent upgrade. Need to pay plus ads. Bye bye NYT,
This app used to work flawlessly. Then they added the opportunity to pay for NYT and now it's super slow to launch & crashes regularly. HTC Incredible,
"This new (paywall) version is absolutely terrible and worthless. Horribly slow, literally crashes every time. Used to be great, but not anymore.",
Horrible update. Thank you for consistently crashing my phone nyt! POS,
This app crashes several times a day and uses up lots of battery to boot! Useless! Don't bother paying for digital subscription.,
"Awful. FC every time it opens, never able to view more than one article or switch sections (and that's if I'm lucky).",
previous revision kept crashing. I hope this version works better,
Was a wonderful app until they made you subscribe. Don't much use it any more.,
The updated app won't open more than half the time. Very frustrating.,
Does not work at all anymore! It's extremely depressing. I haven't been able to open an article in weeks. I'm done waiting for an update.,
New version force closes all constantly. Slow. Unreliable. Want old version back.,
New update is bad. Always closes or freezes. Does not update and is slow! Please fix!,
"Used to be ok, now horrible. Uninstalling and finding new news app.",
"New version sucks. Slow, unresponsive, hangs on open. STILL doesn't save your scroll position in articles.",
"App went to garbage, not only are you forced to pay but it runs slow and closes on you",
"Last update doesn't freeze as often, but now very slow.",
Was the best until NY Times started charging for the content. I'm not paying a subscription fee,
This app sucks!!! You have to wait 5 minutes for an article to load. Who in there right mind would pay for this every month,
Won't work on my droid x. Plus paywall sucks,
This app is slow and it crashes. I am not a paid subscriber and never will be.,
"Tons of forced closings since the latest patch, currently unusable for me on droid 2",
"Incessant pay wall blocks all articles, thanks but no thanks.",
Great app but would never pay for the content. Also whenever updating just continously says installing but never does install,
New version crashes nearly every time. Was good before the update.,
It takes a long time to update. Completely unusable news app,
"Ever since the last update, app always freezes and force closes on Droid X",
Often pauses and stutters while waiting for advertisement pane to load. Not as easy to navigate as the website.,
"This thing doesn't work since the most recent update, it just crashes",
Worked great when the subscription was free. Now that I pay for the service it constantly does not work and has to be forced closed.,
Used to be my go to app. Now is terrible. How can it get 4 stars? Most give it 1 or 2. No longer trust ratings.,
Was a nice app. Newer versions have been slow and crash prone.,
It's become unusable. And this is after getting a subscription! You're breaking my heart nyt.,
"Absolute trash, used to be the best news app. Does not even work right. They better get it together if they plan on surviving these hard times.",
"Slow, buggy, and frequently crashes. Paying for access is fine, but it has to work. Very disappointing.",
"I didn't think changing the update frequency to manual would make it not run in the background, but that does work! Thanks! It's a good app. I enjoy it.",
I viewed this app regularly. Now it won't even open and it freezes my phone. HTC Evo.,
This app was good until they updated it. Now it crashes almost every time I use it. Oh and we have to pay now?,
"App takes way too much memory, can't transfer to SD card, don't allow crossword even with paid sub.",
Sucks When are the boneheads at NYT going to realize that news on your phone is the future. Wake up!,
"Was a good free app, now you have to pay to get full access..boo",
Making it a paid app sprt of sucks although I understand why. Lots of free news services so uninstalling.,
I love the Times but hate the app. Slow slow slow on the Droid.,
"Was great until they updated to track how many articles per week people were reading. Now its horrible, 90% if the time it does not open. HTC incred",
Force closes and fails to update. App isn't worthy of the legendary NYT.,
Extremely unstable app. Yet another case of a premature release without adequate testing.,
Please post change log. I will not update without knowing the changes.,
"It's the NY times you love but now it freezes, force closes, and we have to pay for it all. Needs major improvement.",
Became really slow after latest update. Might as well use the web instead.,
New app is terrible. Crashes all the time and is painfully slow. What am I paying for? The free one ran smoothly. New interface is nice though,
"If you like an app that crashes & freezes, and doesn't uninstall, then this is the app for you!",
Very very slow. Crashes every time I try to open it,
The most unstable app I have installed on my phone.,
Used to work perfectly but crashes all the time on my htc evo since the paywall upgrade,
"Absolutely terrible since the upgrade. How can NYT let this go on? Won't open most times, slow to update, crashes often, and freezes the whole system.",
Became totally unstable after the paywall went up. I'm paying to get a much worse app than I had for free. Way to go nytimes!,
"The last update has left the app crippled at best. Used to work excellent before the notifications. One star, and installing if it doesn't get fixed",
"Force closes, freezes since recent update. Useless and terrible.",
"Was ok. Can't move to SD. Crashing all the time. Very slow. I'm willing to pay for good content, but this is poor execution.",
Was a five until the recent changes in limited access. Better than the AP app.,
Awesome job lowering the paywalls and letting us access more of the premium content... Cheers...,
Great content but application crashes more than it did before they started charging for access,
"As a paid digital subscriber, I should have an app that is faster and does not freeze all the time. App is much worse since update.",
Was my favorite news app but the new version is sooo buggy. Also screw the subscription,
"Way too slow, freezes all the time. Used to be good.",
Upgrade fails to install properly. Software developer should be ashamed.,
"Ever since I started paying for it this app is, ironically, useless.",
"Current updates ruined the app. Terrible job, guys. The company already generates several millions; you can't be a little giving here? Uninstalled app",
"Force close, and too expensive now. Used to be great!",
Used to be great. Not free anymore. Hangs. Uninstalling. Nyt follows greedy Murdoch.,
Was a great app until a recent update caused it force close all the time; Droid Incredible,
Download does not work. I can't get articles and it keeps saying I need to update.,
It freezes and crashes constantly to the point its totally unusable.,
Just got the new version and it keeps freezing/crashing.,
Apps crashed and force to close all time. Subscription service is a failure.,
Charging me to deliver news... haha I'm better off with US TODAY!,
"Used to be a good app. Now it's crap. They ruined a good app. It's very slow, crashes all the time, you can't update individual sections.",
"They want to charge for a ""unstable""news app when there are plenty of free ""stable""news apps out there. Goodbye NYT!!!",
Crashes frequently and loads very slowly. Nearly unusable.,
Don't download... it doesn't work! Also refuse to pay for this- don't market as free if you have to pay to use it!!,
Application is now buggy and slow since the update. Often freezes,
"This app is a train wreck. Slow, even on WiFi, or freezes entirely.",
Last update now requires subscription per week and is glitchy(slow and freezing)...,
Great app but Droid incredible application data space is low error too often,
"After update app is buggy, slow, tons of force closes, terrible. Used to be my go-to news reader, not anymore.",
"Free to download, pay to read. Lame",
Freeze and crash. Can't read nytimes with this app. Older versions worked well. How can they update to a version that does not work?,
Earlier version was clunky. Now can't even log in.,
"What were they thinking? I get the need to charge, but with such a buggy app? Same complaints as everyone, & eats power. And no search! Disappointing.",
This app crashes nearly half the time. It is a scam.,
I assume everyone complaining they started charging must work for free. How dare they try to make money! What are they thinking?!?!,
"After the latest release, the wigdet no longer updates and it's stuck on loading. The app size is over 30MB?? They have turned a nice app into POS.",
"Needs to force close so many times, freezes up 95% of the times, slow.",
Used to love this. Now they charge and do advertisements. No thanks!,
"Good news, but very unstable since paywall.",
"This app use to be great, till the update. I would pay for the subscription if the app worked....",
All the news that's fit to read on a cutting edge smart phone. Love it!,
Crashes and/or freezes nearly every time. Terrible update.,
"5 stars to 1. Was my fav news source until they started charging too much. How about $5/mo? Also, update is a mess. Easier to go direct. Uninstall.",
"Does not work after the update. Widget always says ""Loading..."", app doesn't load when I click on it (just a black screen).",
"Slow, crashes, freezes constantly. Don't mind paying, but app is painful.",
How can an application this bad make it past QA and executive review? Really have to wonder about the future of the NY Times.,
Keeps crashing ever since last couple of updates,
The new load time is horrible and it crashes often,
Crashes multiple times daily since update. Atrix 2.2.1,
NOT FREE!!! All intersting sections get locked unless you subscribe,
So far performance seems much improved with 4/7 update. Hoping it lasts.,
New version crashes often and is unreliable. Motorola Droid,
Hope this fixes how slow this app is! Far better when it was free,
"Sssllllooooooooow! And get rid of the ads. First I have to pay for it... (no problem) then I have to wait for the ads to load, that's a load of crap",
Bloated and slow. Forget it - just use the website. I uninstalled it.,
Makes getting top news as easy as it can possibly be. No complaints at all!,
Never bothered to review an app before but this one is such a pos that i had to - did anyone even test it? Horrible!!,
"design and layouts are fine, but the app is balky and unresponsive.",
Stopped working after an update. Used to be great.,
What a shame how this went from awesome to unusable. Please fix!,
"Freezes. Black screen. Unstable. On my droid x. I got so sick of it, I uninstalled it.",
"Always crashes on startup, lags my phone, never loads articles. 'You get what you pay for,' really? The free one was so much better.",
Worst pricing model ever... did they actually test it with customers? Get your news from Bloomberg - they have a great app...,
"Useless. Slower than when content was free. So long, NYT.",
Crashes all the time and will not load any more.,
"Loved it til they started charging for full use, now uninstalling.",
"I have no problem paying for quality content, but this new app is terrible and ruins the experience. Moreover, why are there still ads when we pay?",
"Latest update doesn't fc as much, but now it takes forever to load an article. What are you guys doing?",
Not sure about the bad comments..works great on zte blade.,
"How can you charge for an app that doesn't seem to work? You need to get it right guys...if you don't, u need to fix it. Cust Service 101...",
"$15 a month!! Lame. Uninstalled, I will find another sorcery for news.",
Each new version is slower and has more bugs...,
"Used to be great, now constant hang and fc. Reinstall no help. Uninstalled. Droid X.",
It's hard to read a story with ads flashing in my face all the time. What's the point of my paying for a digital subscription?,
"Freezes and force closes, and doesn't update. Uninstalling.",
Very slow and always hangs. Avoid!,
Was an awesome news source before update. Very limited content unless you pay.,
"What good is an app if every time one tries to read an article, one gets a ""Force Close"" message? The app still sucks !",
"Not paying. Have you heard of cnn, yahoo, msn? They have all the same news. NYT your not as special as you once were.",
Was a really good source for quality articles and news now is kind of limited,
Only one section is available for free and you still get adverts if you pay for it.,
"Worthless app. Used to be free and was great. Now you have to subscribe. Worthless. Who pays for the news?, its supposed to be free.",
"I don't have a problem paying and I support nyt, but the app isn't working, force close, not loading, very frustrating.",
Don't agree w paywall decision. Greed kills.,
Great example of why newspapers will soon be rubbing elbows with the dinosaurs.,
"Slow. Freezes. Useless. Worse than no app at all. You 'think' you can read stories, but you rarely can. It freezes switching between articles.",
They don't seem to fix anything with their updates. Just gets worse...,
Pure garbage. LUDICROUS !! Get world newspaper app instead.. NY Times just shot themselves in the foot...,
Constant crashing is alliterative but sad.,
Force closes constantly on my droid. Headache,
Crashes more often than not.,
Keeps crashing since updating on droidx,
After update application constantly freezes,
Very buggy on Nexus One. Freezes and crashes consistently and is unusable.,
Can't read health section,
"I gave this app so many chances. Sorry nyt - it's crap. Until you fix it, I'll be using your mobile website.",
Needs to be rolled back to the previous version.,
"Now that it is paid, it is hard to read anything",
"Below average, just like the Knicks. I'll stick with my L.A. Times.",
"What did they do to this app? It used to work well, now it crashes 80% of the time.",
No speed issues at all. Changing topics was instantaneous. Evo 4G.,
Won't even open on my Droid X. Force close every time.,
Unstable on Droid phone. Crashes all of the time.,
"I had to uninstall... loved, LOVED previous version, but now all I get are force closes. :(",
Dysfunctional. Crashes constantly. Paid subscriber,
Crashes like a Russian airplane. Total pos,
The best news source ever: jclemente.,
Buggy bloatware ( no install to SD option!). The only app that I've seen break my nexus one.,
"Update has adds, articles locked out, slower, and often crashes ... redunkulous!",
Crashes too much now that I'm paying for it,
Use to be great. Not so much anymore. Will uninstall.,
"Force close constantly, used to be a great app, sucks now",
Update is slow and buggy. Please fix.,
"Love NYTimes, but latest app is a true disaster... 20-30 seconds to load articles??? C'mon!! Freezes, force closes, poor scrolling... Please fix!!",
Crashes constantly on 2.2. Bush league crap.,
I can't even use it since the paywall was set up. I use a Motorola Droid X.,
Loved this app before the update...now it just sucks,
Has gotten a lot better recently. Subscription price is fair.,
"I used to luv it, now it keeps hanging ... uninstall",
No cache 2 SD and with at least 10 MB cache its just to large for my desire,
"It doesn't load, it just freezes. Terrible.",
Was great until they made it a subscription service.,
Great to have access to the NY Times on my phone!,
2.0.2 continues to crash. This is what paying for a digital sub gets you? It was better free...,
I will pay for good content.,
Why is this so horrible now? It used to be fine! It just wastes my time!,
Crashes frequently. Sluggish. Buggy.,
New version freezes constantly.,
Worthless since subscription upgrade.,
App and widget won't load. Droid x. Update broke it.,
Stopped working with new update.,
I love that this great news source is free!,
"Uses too much cache. And they need to add a ""delete cache after closing app"" option.",
"Used to be great, sucks now. Peace out NYT.",
Widgets no longer update. Moto droid.,
Takes 40MB of my 128MB internal phone memory and can't be moved to SD. Uninstall.,
"No longer crashing, happy again.",
Working better now. News that is worth the subscription.,
The latest version takes forever to load. I am waiting for an update to fix it.,
This app used to be awesome now it crashes and locks up all the time. What's up?,
No longer works on g2.,
I am changing to Reuters right away!,
First nag screen to subscribe = uninstalled,
Plain sucks... force close way too much.,
Hangs. Slow. No point if you cannot read any of the news...which you can't.,
You should never have to pay for information.,
The new update has done nothing to fix this app. Why would one pay for this?,
It was a great app when it was free. But why pay when you can read the same stuff for free with your browser?,
App hardly works now. Please make sure you make a quality app before charging subscription.,
Faulty after the update.,
Updates are terrible for droidx.,
Downloading sucks they must want you to pay,
"No longer will I read NYT. Pay service? Teaser previews? No thanks.. and the app is crap, slow to respond and often locks up..",
Crashes all the time.,
"It was slow and crashy before... but now that I pay, it's even slower and crashier. Quite ridiculous!",
"You gotta be kidding me. If you read this, don't update!!!",
...very disappointed. I knew I shouldn't have upgraded.,
It keeps crashing!,
After last major update nothing but BUGS.,
It didn't show anything.,
No search function. Can't reach sections. Awful!!!,
I PAY $15 TO GET THE BOOKS SECTION ETC BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT 2 ME AS A WRITER. FC'S ALL THE TIME!??? ARE U KIDDING??????,
"Sluggish, crashes, freezes",
"Same problems. Pls fix, NYT!",
unbelievable...15 a month gtfo,
What a piece of cr*p! FC's constantly. Distracting ads. And they have the audacity to expect us to PAY for this? I think not. Uninstalled.....,
Very buggy....crashes often.,
Why does it constantly get hung up now and require a forced close?,
I am a paying subscriber. Why is this app completely unusable?,
"Crashes, crashes, hangs, hangs, crashes..this app is not an app...",
Freezes constantly. Fail.,
"Used to be great, but now is so slow!!!",
The worst app ever!,
Unusable! Subscription preview....,
"Great app, intuitive, well organized.",
Bye bye greedy people,
Doesnt go to full screen on the galaxy tab......please fix.,
Uninstall and reinstall if it is force closing.,
It crashes my phone,
New version is much slower,
Crashes and hangs!,
"What happened to this app? Nytimes, app should download headlines first, then ads.",
Latest update is really slow,
Crashing a lot.,
Requires payment. There are other new feeds available,
Cant load any article. What were they thinking? USELESS,
This app is junk!!!,
"Informative, nice and simple ("",)",
Was a great app.,
Piece of crap it became,
Too many crashes,
Freezes sucks now,
Great for news on the go.,
Great and pretty app.,
Why would I pay to read news on an app when I can read i ton the web for free?,
You want me to pay a subscription for a buggy app that keeps closing? Uninstalled.,
Hangs and then crashes.... does no one test anymore??,
Sucks now and force closes all the time,
Uninstalled after upgrade.,
Subscription preview? :( Wish I hadn't updated...,
What's up with no most-emailed?,
"Slow, glitchy, prone to crash. Is this a joke?",
Used to be great. What happened?,
What a joke this thing is won't even open and they want how much ??????,
$3.75 a week to subscribe? A month maybe. Uninstall.,
I can move the application on SD but unfortunately the data downloaded from the app is stored on phone storage and not on SD (it was using more than 10Mb of phone storage for data),
freezes frequently,
app freezes,
This garbage,
Have have this app and used religiously of almost a year. Hasn't worked now in a month I am giving up waiting for a fix. Uninstalled.,
Best American Newspaper,
Takes up a lot of space,
Would pay for it if it worked,
How about zero dollars to read the news?,
Not worth paying for,
Why use this app when you can just go to the NYT on a browser? Like people need more single- function apps on their phones?,
Love it,
HTC EVO keeps force closing new update sucks! No probl. w/ previous version. Now u have to pay 3.75 a week to see the full articles!,
Not Free!!,
Requires monthly subscription,
app2sd is needed!!,
Force close,
Not free anymore,
Bugs.Bugs.Bugs.,
Sucks,
"I used to love this app, and I was hopeful this update would bring it to the level of the iPad app -- it does look nicer and cache more sections than the previous version. But it's unbelievably slow (takes more than 90 seconds to open, open hangs for no reason while reading an article or switching sections) and OFTEN crashes. I actually *would* pay for the full access but not when it's this pad. Terrible.",
They are charging on the update for an app that will slow your phone. Weekly subscription of $3.75 per week. I am uninstalling and will see if I miss.,
"The newer version looks better but because of the new subscription fee they are imposing I seem to only be able to get the headlines. Technology, Health and Science can only be accessed with paying for the subscription and does not even count toward the supposed free articles you can read. I have uninstalled the app (which frees up a ton of space) and now link to the articles through Twitter. As for the rest of the news, the AP app does a good job for me.",
"I don't watch TV, so I must read the NYT to be current; but I would like to read the news while in queue for whatever. Please fix app...it's a sad little app, it wants to be useful. Thanks.",
"Was awesome now blows. Let go of you old failing business model, this is the digital age.",
My favorite app until the subscription model was introduced. The older version was working much better as well. Now the smooth page turn is gone.,
"App worked great until recent changes. More often than not I get a blank screen when trying to open, then get the 'force close' message. Uninstalling",
"The New York Times application is very buggy at the moment on my mytouch 4G. Locks up, requires forced closes. I'm sad.",
"App hangs and must force close. Top News do not load or show up, will not pay subscription for other features until basic functionality works OK.",
"Was one of my favorites. I'm a print subscriber, so don't mind the paid content. But the new version is consuming massive space. Sadly uninstalling.",
"Was my favorite app. Now I can't even read the free articles because it force closes constantly. Extremely disappointing, uninstalled. HTC eris",
"Was once my favorite app, but new update ruined it. I don't mind the pay wall since top news is free, but the widget won't load and it kills bat life",
"Since the update, it crashes all the time. It also drains my battery. I would consider paying if it gets fixed.",
"I love NYT & subscribe to the Sunday paper. However, the latest version of the Android app is broken. I just get a black screen. Milestone.",
"Problems on Droid x since upgrade. Blank screen, hangs requiring force close. Battery seems to be running down quicker now, though not sure it's this",
"I have a subscription, but the app constantly shuts down. Plus, there's no place to enter my subscription information to avoid charges",
"Buggy and bloated, but I'm a subsciber and I love it. Fixed freeze problrms by uninstall then reinstall.",
"Ever since the last update, it CONSTANTLY freezes. Such a headache I am asking for refund on my subscription. Yes you need one now.",
The app will not stop crashing since the update... There is no way I will ever consider buying a subscription. This is rediculous.,
"Seriously the first thing I noticed is that this app uses GPS, with no option to turn off. If pay wall will not use app, thanks.",
Can't believe they're charging when it's a bloated app with ads anyway. NYT is making a huge mistake with this digital subscription thing. Uninstalled,
Just ditch this crummy app and browse directly to their mobile site where you can (still) get ALL their articles for free.,
After the update this app no longer even pretends to be functional. I used read articles everyday but now I think I'm going to uninstall. Too bad.,
I loved this application. It was my primary source of US news. But now its just an over priced waste of space to me.,
"Broken, not well tested. Another bad idea from Sulzberger. Too many bugs in app and user experience.",
App is fundamentally broken. A paywall is one thing...but the basic functionality of this app is broken. Fix it or lose my business permanently.,
"I subscribed because their news is worth a few cents a day to me, but the 'upgraded' version of their app is terrible. It keeps crashing my Droid X.",
Really 3.25 a week for a news paper app. Good luck NY times because there are a million other ways to Get the news free. Way to alienate your reader,
"I loved this app until they added subscriptions, at which point it started freezing constantly. Five stars down to one. Stick with the BBC!",
"Before subscription I used it everyday, now it's really slow and buggy. Will rate it zero. Uninstall it now",
"False advertising, its not free, you have to subscribe weekly. Program freezes and have to force close. It runs the phone hard sucking the battery.",
This app constantly crashes. It will even lock my phone up.when Im not using the app because it keeps having problems.,
"Just installed new update, but still freezes. Worse than useless. Uninstalling and cancelling my recent subscrp. Not worth anything.",
This app is incredibly slow. It's not worth all the new features if u can't even open an article. I like the old app better bc it was quick and easy.,
Disappointed with the latest version. Crashes or hangs frequently on Droid 1. Ambitious (with the in-app inclusion of pictures & videos) but flawed.,
New app is incredibly slow and force closes sometimes. Definitely not happy about this and going elsewhere for my news.,
"Hangs the phone, not to mention the pay-wall. Has gone from most used app to most useless app. Uninstalling.",
Do not ask us to pay and then provide a buggy product when what you previously supplied was free and flawless. You can do much much better.,
Use to be a fan. Now they have you paying plus the ads. People just trying to make money. Bye Bye Maggots. Hello to FOX,
"Freezes after log-in and/or still asks me to sign up for subscription, though I have full reading rights. (HTC Glacier)",
"App takes forever to open, if it does at all. Maybe something to do with new subscription thing, not sure. Droid X.",
I wont be using this app anymore. It is too limited now that you have to sunscribe. Theyre getting greedy.,
"News is just too good to pass on. Big fan of opinion and books sections. Not eager to pay for content, but I will cave.",
Great articles. Crashes frequently. Also bummed about the lack of zoom feature like I had on iphone. Using on thunderbolt.,
Updated app doesn't work on evo 4g. Continually crashes and I usually a get a black screen and nothing more. I have to force close the app.,
Too many forced closes since the latest update. Interrupts my other applications. Deleting ap until it's fixed. Droid X,
There must be a bug in the new pay ver.11 which takes up massive & growing mem & CPU at application not program level. I sub. to paper NYT. Awful.,
App was great until the latest update. They locked all articles unless you pay a subscription fee. Stick with free news apps.,
Used to be my favorite source for news.Started charging a weekly subscription fee. Now its gone. CNNs app isnt nearly as good but at least it is free!,
Use to enjoy this app. But now it charges a subscription fee and seems to load slower with more hang ups. Just deleted this app. Don't waste ur time.,
Was great until they redid it and made it a million times slower. And made it a preview app only accessable to subscribers Don't bother downloading it,
"It is not unreasonable for NYT to charge for their content, provided they create a working, enjoyable app like this was. The latest update is clunky.",
"This version is uncharacteristically buggy. Crashes or freezes when doing rapid movements, updates are uneven, accidental page changes too easy.",
"New update locks my htc evo. Used to be able to read articles on app for free. Now all I get is a ""subscription preview""",
"Disaster since the recent upgrade, crashes every time, worst bit - I actually paid for it. Groggy performance, avoid. Desire HD",
"Even for us paid subscribers, this app is painfully amateur. A resource hog, full of bugs, and annoying banner ads plague this 'beta' app.",
"Changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 since the update. Freezes, crashes, and then expects me to subscribe to this garbage. htc Evo.",
Recent update slowed my phone with false alert triggers and force closes. I had to perform a cold reboot of my phone just to uninstall.,
"Can't figure out how to manually update. Also, I keep accidentally selecting the next story as I try to scroll down the text.",
"Nice interface, one touch manual feed update and offline articles, would be nice to be able to select content, eg regional news. Htc inspire.",
They made this app useless since everything is locked and you see only 2 lines of an article. Don't feel like paying the subscription though.,
Update hangs on paid preview. Not free anymore. Used to be the best. Now its New Time to UNINSTALL. Nyt should not follow Murdoch.,
Uninstalled. New version is unsatisfactory. No way I'll pay. Will now install a different news app.,
Great app. Finally no ink on my hands! Only thing missing is the smell of news print.,
Horrible app unless you like to watch your screen go dark or freeze waiting for things to load.,
Gave old version 5 stars but now uninstalled. Used to have free access to all sections & it never froze. Upgrade was definitely a downgrade. Eris,
"Less stable now, and also keeps increasing in size. It says its 700kb or so but the other day it was 15 mb, todays its 17mb. No option to move to SD.",
Good luck with your paywall. Lets see how much money the NYTimes will lose from their advertising revenue. I'm one of many flocking elsewhere.,
"This version is highly unstable and worse, it seems to force itself open while i am doing other things. Uninstalling for now",
Just unbelievable that they would simultaneously enact a pay system and release this app. It simply does not function due to constant crashes.,
"The new version is a serious step backwards for what was a great app. Slow, unresponsive, few new features, and frequently crashes. Bring back the old",
"Used to be great. Now very slow and crashes often. Im happy to pay for a good product, but this is junk.",
"Works 30% of the time, loads slower than before. Frequently have to force close. The latest update took a great app and destroyed it.",
Droid app for NY Times is awful. I am happy to pay but when I upgraded the new app brought me to my knees. You must he kidding,
"Used to be great. Latest version had to be repeatedly force closed, with less content than in the previous version when the app did work. Uninstalled",
"New version very clunky, hard to update, slow, and lots of forced closes. Good content though.",
"Ever since the pay wall update this app is buggy, crashes, and half the time won't even open",
"DUMP POP UP ADS ON PAID VERSION! Hope that happens B4 2 free weeks run out. That said, I'm here for the writing\reporting & all else is secondary!",
Ny times app is garbage now. Always stops working. Don't waste your time with this app.,
So it just went from free to $4/week. Yeah. Right. The day i pay for public internet news...no thanks ill use another free source out of the many,
This app has less functionality than on Web os. Can't save articles which leaves you zero functionality on train. Not for people that ride subway.,
"Had this app forever, first thing I read in the morning. Not going to pay when advertisers should be the ones paying. Uninstall....",
None of the real sections are available. This app is useless after the recent forced upgrade. I used to love this app.,
Why is this so app so slow especially since I pay for it now. Fix it or you can guarantee I won't be be renewing my digital subscription next month.,
"It can take more than 20 megs. And yet, you can't move it to SD. Love the content but this needs to be fixed.",
"after the update it costs money to read anything other than ""top news"" and also force closes all the time why would I pay for an app that just crashes",
New version bug-ridden. Was best and favorite app. Now read news elsewhere.,
"If I were actually willing to pay for a news app, I'd pay for one that consistently works. This app is now a joke - went from 5 stars to 1!",
"Love the nyt, but this app update is a wreck. Used to work great until I was forced to upgrade. Now it freezes almost everytime I use it (on droid).",
New requirement of monthly fee ruined this great app. I will find free news,
Was simple and worked great. Now it offers nothing and crashes all the time. I'm amazed they're not ashamed to release this to the public.,
It was pretty good before the paywall now its useless. NY Times will have to learn the hard way people will not pay for the news.,
This app constantly crashes. Used to be great. Would give it zero if that were possible.,
Over inflated App that sucks up the limited amount of internal memory you get on Android phones. Make it able to store on SD card please.,
I used to read this app daily. Back then this got a 5/5 easy but the guy who thought charging us for news just ruined one of the few good news apps,
"The cache is kept on int memory leading to 10 MB of int memory being used after one visit, making the app being able to move to the SD pointless.",
"I love the times, but the app is pretty buggy. Rarely works. Widget stalls or is unresponsive. I hope successive updates fix the issues.",
I used to live by this app. The latest update crashes my HTC incredible CONSISTENTLY. Not a good hook for selling their new digital subscriptions!,
"I understand journalism isnt a non-profit venture, but I'll go with the free options not the one that charges. Simple law of supply and demand.",
In need of a version update...clunky and very slow to update articles...often requires forced closing to get the gerbles running again.,
"Thanks for an update that makes the app lag and crash, and for charging now when it was free before. Unistalled. Fail.",
"Was my favorite app, but I just uninstalled it. Apparently they did not earn enough money on the mobile ads and now there is a subscription to use t",
New version is awful. Nice job testing it before you released this force-closing pile of junk. Fix it! HTC Incredible,
New update with subscription requirement makes the app much less useful. I'll use other means to get news.,
"It used to be great, but with new updates it won't open or it crashes. I also am unable to uninstall it.",
Hopefully the devs are telling the suits half of users have uninstalled this crap app. Subscriptions only work if everyone charges!! Dummies.,
I'm just sad the Internet is more and more becoming a large paid content zone instead of a place of freedom of word (and especially information)...,
"Horrible, get free news elsewhere. Don't install. BBC or wsj or latimes or usatoday or npr instead.",
"App uses WAY too much space, freezes constantly, and Business Section does not have stock market data! The mobile web version of the NYT is better.",
"The old app used to work fine. This app crashes every time I try to sync. I now pay $15/month for an unusable service, when I used to get a flawless service for free. Egregious incompetence.",
I had loved my nytimes app but since the update not only do you need to pay a lot per week it constantly crashed my phone. I've since uninstalled it.,
Terrible. Users have to manually update to get latest news. Impossible to post comments when sharing on facebook. Slow in general.,
"From hero to zero. I can't even get to the free content any more, just black screens",
Price is outrageous even if the app wasn't full of bugs. You had all these regular readers and found a way to screw it up. Someone needs fired. Uninst,
"This app uses lots of CPU, even restarting itself after being killed, using 25% of battery life.",
Can't use bc of paywall. If checkout was easier I'd pay but it's a pain in the rear process. I wish it used Checkout or something.,
This used to be very good before they made you pay subscription. Now it is buggiest app I have on my phone. Crashes and freezes a lot. Awful!!!,
I was almost ok with the pay wall but the slothlike loading times now make this app unusable.,
Used to really like this but the new version is painfully slow switching sections such that I hate using it now.,
"Ever since they started the subscription service, the app freezes all the time. It used to be the best news app available. Not anymore.",
"My favorite app, now a piece of crap. It was seamless and beautiful now broken and behind a paywall. Poor work, management. You're fired. Uninstalled.",
Paywall and FCs. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul.,
The new update is utter garbage. I have a paid subscription and it still doesn't work properly. Uninstall!,
"My favorite android app is not working anymore... uninstall and won't use till the business plan change. Going to BBC, bye",
I agree with everyone here... What was once a great app is no supremely disappointing. Uninstall.,
"Most of the articles are no longer available, you must be a ny times subscriber. Not worth it. Old version was better, uninstalling",
"+1 on hang/black screen issues. HTC incredible, paid nytimes member",
"App is slow, buggy, unstable & poorly designed. & while the NYT's has great content, there are too many free options to pay for this.",
"After installing this update my HTC Droid Incredible is crashing and showing the dreaded eroneous ""application space is running low"" notification.",
"I loved the old app, but I resent being asked to pay for something that this am was given to me for free. Boo, New York Times",
"Was my fav app. Sad to see it go, but not paying 16 bucks a month. Upgrade disingenuous, should have mentioned pay change!",
Latest version crashes constantly and works slowly when it does at all. It crashes when I'm not even using it....,
"Most articles are locked after introduction to subscriptions. App force closes constantly now, thats what you get for being greedy!",
Well not run. Locks up on every launch. Way to go NYT. Now I really want to subscribe.,
Deleted. To many other sources for better balanced news that don't force me to give personal info & pay for the privilege.,
"Buggy, slow, and constantly crashing. If this were free, ok. But as the basis of a paid subscription service, this is completely unacceptable.",
Free version now gives you much less for free (top headlines only). Get your free news elsewhere.,
"Used to be great, but since update it constantly force closes and is slow. Do not recommend",
"With the recent update, this formerly great app is now all crash-y. Uninstalling.",
"This update is horrific: misleading, poor usability. Went from best app to worst app in a single release - congrats!",
"The updated app is a major downgrade. Opens slowly, crashes when updating or opening new sections. Laggy on wifi, painfully slow if not. Used to work!",
"Total memory hog. Once this went to subscription my phone froze four times a day. Such a shame. Had no choice but to remove, & I am a $$$ subscriber",
Endlessly balloons in size. Was at 17 MB the last time I cleared the data. Drains battery like crazy. Also: will not pay. // OG Droid GPA14,
"I only read the occasional NYT article and presentation of news in this app is good, but it is incredibly slow to load. Needs fixing.",
I like Al Jazeera better anyway. I get free streaming live video from their app. This app only locks my phone up.,
Same problem as everyone else. Great before upgrade. Now constant force close. Hope NYT fixes it or will cancel subscription and uninstall.,
New version is a programming flop. I had to actually uninstall bc it kept interrupting me w error msgs,
From great to awful in one step. Crashes all the time. Desire HD,
"New version crashes, does not refresh, freezes. No problems with old version.",
Will not pay when I can get my news elsewhere for free. Was a nice app while it lasted. USA Today is free.,
"Very buggy until I logged into my print subscription account. Problem solved. Wish there were no ads, but the print version has them. NYT =the best.",
Update has ruined this app! It wont even open now! Im uninstalling and definitely not paying a dime for 'full access',
This app was great before the update. Trying to impose a fee for 90% of the product dies not imply this is a free app.,
"I used to love this app, read it all the time. Now its like over $12 a month.. used to be a good informative news.app. shams it's fallen this far.",
"Was great before update, now is unusable. Uninstalled after a week of hangs and crashes - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE EXCUSE FOR AN APP!!",
Used to be a good until the last update. Now it freezes crashes almost every time I try to use it on my droid x.,
The update doesn't properly refresh the widgets and uses more cpu cycles. Had to revert back to previous version.,
"It is a great FREE app, but there is no way I'm going to pay for the content. Already deleted from phone.",
New subscription has to go. Way too expensive. Uninstalled until they have more reasonable rates or a free version.,
"Used this app all the time before the update. Now it crashes, without exaggeration, over a third if the times I use it. On the verge of deleting...",
"Pay discussion aside.this update has made the program slow, unresponsive, crashy. If it doesn't run properly on my nexus one, then where will it at a",
It forecloses constantly after the latest update (mytouch 3g). I will not pay for news that I can get for free...UNINSTALLING!,
"Liked this app, but dumb move from the marketing team to charge people, you should earn money a different way utilizing apps.",
"Too many black screens, forced closed. Updating is clunky. A real disincentive to carrying it on your home screen.",
"Its improved but since I don't have a sub there is little content. Sorry, just don't see $4 a week with ads as a value.",
Force close several times a day. Slow load. Was way better before. Evo,
New update is horrible. Force closes everytime I click on anything. Bad timing to ask readers to pay w/ this new glitchy version. Droid 2,
"Was a great free app. I like NY Times, but not enough to pay. I'm already living paycheck to paycheck as it is.",
Sorry. I'm not paying to read news that I can get elsewhere for free. I didn't mind the banner ads. In a down economy free wins.,
"I used to enjoy it but now can't access it without paying, so it will have to go. Shame.",
This WAS a great app. Complete garbage now. Unwilling to pay for an app that constantly crashes.,
"Seems weird that it doesn't work nearly as well now, and they want you to start paying. Not worth it at all!",
"Successful App model = Ads pay OR reader pays = millions of happy users! NYT model = FC + Ads + reader pays = millions uninstall, 3 happy users. Bye.",
"Since last update, this app has gotten a lot worse. It's slow, hangs frequently, must force close. Droid incredible.",
Why a charge should have kept the old one how stupid is the ny times what an idiot decision.,
"Was great until update. Now neither the app nor the widget will open, giving only a blank screen until force close. Samsung fascinate 2.1",
"Good except for really annoying summary problem, where it cut off the summary and then the summary isn't viewable inside the article....",
"Used to love it before subscription. Now it is lagging all the time, uninstall.",
NYT is out of their minds thinking they'll convince that this app is worthy $3.5 a week. BBC is great and free!,
Don't mind the paywall but the new app is incredibly buggy and slow. We have to pay reporters guys,
Worked great before the upgrade. Now it freezes and takes forever to open. Boo!,
Worked great up until last upgrade. Kept freezing up my droid. Uninstalled.,
"Got the subscription, hoping to help support quality journalism as it enters a new era. Shame the app crashes so often - has potential ...",
Causes reboots on my droid incredible. Never happened before the last update. Uninstalled,
"Memory Hog, cannot move to SD card. Good interface otherwise. Sadly, gone paid. Uninstall. Nobody pays for news which is FREE!",
"New update made it unstable, and I'm not paying a fortune for the privilege of seeing ads on my phone.",
Dumps 12 MB of data on internal storage as soon as you register.,
Update causes abnormally long start time both on widget and app. galaxy,
I used to love this app but it has become trash since the last update.,
"I used to love this app, but now that all the sections I read require a subscription, it's pointless. Guess I'll have to go online to keep reading fre",
"The only reason I gave NYT a chance was because of their free app, but as I can see their are dozens of apps like Yahoo! News that offer free news.",
"I love the times, but I wish they didn't go back to charging for access to their articles. I'm very disappointed. Uninstalling & sticking w/ npr.",
Wont pay for news. NY times needs to learn to make money from ad revenue better,
Bullshit. Not paying for free news. Plus it hangs and never loads most of the time.,
Locks up and requires force-quit every time I use it. The paywall ruined it!,
"App was great until the last update. Now hangs, refuses to load, force closes. Way to ruin great thing NY Times! Evo 4G",
What had been my go-to source for all things news-related has now been watered down into a piece of garbage that barely runs properly. All for money.,
Old app was much better. This one is too slow and force quits too often.,
So weak how you went from having a sweet news app that ran like butter to this hot garbage update that smells like butt hair.,
One of my favorite apps but they just started charging a subscription fee of 3.75 a month!! Going to delete this! What a shame!!!,
Used to be the best news app/widget for android. No app/widget is worth $3.75/week to be able to use. Shame.,
"V good but sometimes not so easy to find specific items.
Also pls connect to my addresses of contacts !",
How in hell is the app still 4*.They have successfully made it garbage after update.Greed is not becoming or working for NYT! UNINSTALL!,
Not only is it not working but now we have to buy a subscription? What a load of crap. Unistalled. Good alternative news sources out there,
New version is terrible. It crashes constantly. Should never have updated.,
"The 2.0.2 upgrade significantly improved the app. It is still a little slow to load, but entirely manageable, now. Great content!",
The app was perfect until you had to start paying for it! Now its full of bugs and glitches! Uninstalled.,
Everybody please uninstall as a sign of protest for the charging of $3.75 a week.,
After I paid it started to lock up. Hope the update helps,
"It's best to obtain news from a number of sources, but the New York Times is one of my favorite sources for news.",
"Seriously, who would want to pay so much money for news with other great options available everywhere? It is 2011 outside. NYT needs to wake up.",
Would be 5 stars but this latest release crashes ALL the .time. Last release worked always. What's up with that NY times? Awesome reporting,
App stopped working. Would not load story off home screen widget.,
"Was the best. Shady upgrade without mention of paywall. Shame on you, NYT. Uninstall. Shame on you.",
"Used 20+mb ram, ridiculously high when compared to bloomberg's 2 mb.",
Crashes all the time. Drains my battery. Everything locked behind a paywall now. Uninstalled.,
Since upgrade to subscription version almost all content is locked and app continually freezes,
"Infamous paywall is not the problem - uses more than 10 MB of internal memory, cannot move to SD!Not a smart decision.No choice but to uninstall.",
Interface is now slow and buggy. Paywall is rediculous. I can find content elsewhere for free.,
Thought I'd try 2 week trial. App just goes to black screen and crashes.AWFUL. FAIL.How could they release a paid version that's clearly still a beta?,
"No longer my fav app. It crashes too often & way too slow. Terrible. Plus, I liked it when it was free. Plain & simple! Uninstalling.",
Crashes often. And sometimes doesnt come up. Uninstalled,
Before I decide to upgrade I read its FAQ. It said that you didn't have to pay. Don't insult me by then charging me to read news. Uninstall,
"Love the app, favorite news source. Last update brought freezes, force closes whenever I open an article. I miss my news! Epic 2.2",
After the recent update the app simply does not work. I really can even judge and make decision whether it's worth $3.75. I doubt though.,
"Update for pay-to-read crashes, useless. Too many better, free options. Bye bye NYTimes.",
"Disappointed that NYTimes is moving to limited free access. However, application is excellent.",
Went from 5 stars to slow running force closing preview with update. Uninstall,
"Was a great app that I used all the time, but now there is a monthly fee (>$10). Nice try NYT, but I think I can find news for free online.",
"the most recent update has made it useless, hanging all the time.",
Locks up all the time now.don't want to default to latest news.,
Ever since the pay wall the app quality has suffered. One would think after making it paid they would produce a better app!,
Subscription fee for something which was recently free is ridiculous. Also since the subscription update the app is incredibly slow and force closes,
"Worked great up until the last update, now it crashes Everytime I bring it up! Is this just a shoddy way of forcing us to buy it? Uninstalled. HTC Evo",
This app stinks since the most recent update (Mar 29/11),
"Despite the new fees it is slow, freezes and uses storage space quickly.",
"Update is killin' me. Hangs, force closes, a sorry development for what used to work really well. Samsung Captivate using 2.1.",
Used to LOVE the NY Times app; while $3.75/wk was a bit steep I signed up. Since then the app freezes and forces my phone to shut down. PLEASE CANCEL!,
Useless. Always force closes after last update. Switched to usatoday. Droid x.,
Was a cool application but you guys are sadly mistaken if you you think I'm gonna pay for a free service.,
Really awful. Slow and force closes every time I use it.,
Not going to pay for free news. Bad mistake NY Times.,
So sad. I used to use this daily. USA Today is now my daily news app.,
"Used to luv app, now u have to pay 3.75 a week. U can get all the news for free somewhere else in addition app is very buggy n forcecloses on EVO.",
Update made this painfully slow. Also why pay for news when you can get it for free.,
I'm a college student and $3.75/week is way too much. Way to squeeze more money out of people. What a joke.,
Going from free to pay is an upgrade? Pay issue aside the app runs horrible now. Too bad because content was good. Uninstalling.,
"Ok for articles, but definitely not worth paying for given other free news apps",
"The site has one major drawback: one cannot adjust the size of the text by ""spreading"" or ""pinching,"" as one can for the BBC app.",
WAS a great app... now it sucks. The app keeps freezing. And the subscription service is a joke. I'll look for a new news provider.,
"Wow, what a huge failure.the updated app is. Id expect this from a school newspaper. Shame on you new york times!",
Extremely buggy; stalls and overuses CPU frequently. Uninstalled. Droid X. This WAS a great app.,
"I paid because I read the nytimes everyday, but it was a waste of money because I can't get through two articles without it crashing. PLEASE FIX!",
"Subscription content is understandable, but the price is too high, glad to still have Top News.",
Used to be a good app but now thus drains my battery in a couple hours. I'm a subscriber too! (Sunday delivery),
Used to be great when it was free now the app sucks and im supposed to pay 200/yr + ads? Way to skrew up a good thing nytimes,
Articles are great but just can't justify paying for access to something that was once free,
"Used to love this app. Downloaded the latest version, logged into my account and nothing displays.",
Great newspaper but I'm not paying $16 per month for it. So I will uninstall it.,
NYT wants to change the news delivery model. I don't. USA Today is a much better choice.,
"Crashes all the time! This used to be a great app. Fonts too small and big. I like NYTimes, though. I'll pay. Please fix.",
The app charges for a subscription yet it has ads on the bottom. LAME.,
Suddenly getting breaking news alerts even with the setting disabled. Annoying.,
I loved this app until the lastest update. Ads really bog down my phone and make it force close... Moto Droid... uninstalled...,
Used to be good. Very slow to load. Widget crashes or doesn't update.,
"Was great free,sucks now. Use the web still free and just as good. BBC is just as good and maybe better.",
Am a paid subscriber but wtf with the exploding cache size,
this wasa good news source. new version perform poorly. App bloat.,
"Wow the updated app slows everything on my phone way down and takes ages to load. ,Nytimes, who developed this terrible update?",
Used to work so well! Now it's slow and crashes constantly on My touch and now i'm paying for it? They better fix it fast...,
This was my go to app for the morning commute. The upgrade ruined it.,
"Bad,bad,super bad app. Shuts down my phone. I will never pay for news.",
"Reuters,AP and other news source are free. Good luck wit your future!",
"I know reporters don't work for free but a weekly charge for so little its too much. NYTimes, you're fired!",
"Use to love it. Now, I will have to delete it. Doesn't open most if the time. When it does, it takes forever... then crashes.",
"New app sucks. I've tried to download it since it was pushed out, and can't. Can't use the old app without the update, so I can't read the times now.",
Constantly freezing and crashing. Since update stories won't load.,
Goes from great app to pure junk! Not only do they want a ridiculous amount of money but now it keeps force closing & won't work!!! No way I sign up!,
The hell with u NYT! Capitalist bums! I'll never bother bother buying your paper anymore.,
It's not actually a free app any more.. its a buggy subscription service.,
Used to work great! Now all I get is a black screen and force close messages!,
"Uninstalled. Was great in original form, but now they want to charge $3.75/wk. No thanks, plenty of other news sources out there.",
"A true stone-age app: huge (1MB), no pinch zoom, no zoom in/out, no rotation. Learn from Jim Blackler (BBC News) how to write such an app! Uninstal .",
"Was ok when it was free, I already pay for service: will d-load better app with no add'l cost. Cmon NY, IS THERE NO END TO YOUR GREED?",
"I used to love this app, but since the subscription scheme it is painfully slow on my droidx and crashes often. What happened NYT?",
It was great when more than a few sections were free,
"Love the times, love the app, hate the price point. I would gladly pay $10-$15 bucks a month for cross platform use, but $455 a year. Forget it.",
Current version is buggy on Evo. Prone to locking up.,
"So many bugs! Constantly force-closes and so slow that I can barely use it - worst ""upgrade"" ever They released an update and it still doesn't work!",
The new version is consuming excessive resources. Uninstalling!,
We have a subscription to the weekend paper and still get full digital access... This is great!,
After the update the app doesn't work. Very disappointing.,
Ditto - since the recent update this is nothing but trouble.,
"Repeated force closes. Sometimes takes 50+ percent of my battery. Uninstalled. Also, paywall. Droid X 2.2",
Update is awful. Crashes and drains battery. G'bye NYT,
I just upgraded it and now it takes 16mb of my low phone memory. Will delete the app now,
"was a frequent user, niw headlines only! Uninstall",
Now costs way too much. What a ripoff!,
Now requires a subscription. Business model FAIL!,
Used to great now. Uninstalled since subscription is too expensive.,
"Slow, buggy, crashes frequently. Terrible since pay wall update.",
R u kidding me. Good by nyt. Switching to daily news. Sooo greedy.,
"You had a good thing going nytimes, yet u had to get greedy. How can i trust you anyway when the so called free content wont even load properly?",
"Used this app everyday until the ""upgrade"". Taking too long to fix.",
Evo 4g - repeatedly crashes even when not displayed. They want $200 a year for pushing gov't propaganda with buggy app? No way!!!!,
"Used to be great, now freezes constantly. Droid Incredible. Uninstalled.",
Yeah right. Pay $3.75 a week for news I can get free online through their website or from a ton of other apps? Worthless app. Uninstalled.,
Do NOT waste your bandwidth. Very sad.,
Uninstalled now you have to pay. What a shame asit was superb.,
"Best news app on android by far, I need to find a RSS reader w this good UI!!!",
"Used to be a great, free app. Now it's $3.75 a week, slow and always crashes. With all of the other free sources out there, that's a big NO THANK YOU.",
Constantly overuses my cpu on my droidx. New update really sucks. Paying or not this app is ruined.,
Refuse to pay when there are plenty of free news services out there.,
I agree with everyone else used to be the best now they have gotten greedy,
"Why all the complaints? Latest news, free. Most emailed, free. Timescast VIDEO, free. +20 of others. Great smooth app- no force closures. Push updates",
$3+ per week to actually read the content. You're kidding me right? I use to love this app for the opinion. Now I will just have to read blogs.,
"after the recent update, it is painfully slow. deleted",
"Ruined by the update, as it freezes your smartphone. I thought Latest News was supposed to remain free of charge, so why tamper with the app?",
Can not even read regional news. How disappointing.,
"New York Times free. Works well for me. G2 No crossword, if that bothers you (doesn't me) G2",
Too bad I like this publication. To many crashes.,
"New update slow, buggy and crashy on G2. Bad timing.",
"Updated, it then force closed. Un-Installed and Re-Installed, now works fine again. -HTC Incredible",
Not working for me. The latest version seems to not want to update over LTE and seems very slow over wi-fi. Is anyone doing any QA on this app?,
Stability issues force closes after startup. Droid X,
From being free to now $3.75 a week. Hahaha. No way. Absolutely rediculous. Uninstalling now.,
"Uninstall, it asks for $$$ to read news. Not worth the money, so many other free but still good news apps.",
"Was a good app, most definitely worth the cost though. Uninstalling for now.",
Massive memory sucker! Uninstalled. Browser actually works better.,
Works for about 30 seconds then force close. Please fix. Droid incredible.,
Free app worked great. Now that they started collecting $$ it doesn't work at all - just a black screen. Huh?,
"Was awesome when the news was free. Get the update, now I have to pay for news.",
"Used to be great, now freezes Droid 1. Uninstall",
A lot better when you didn't have to pay weekly to use it.,
Not worth the money. Highly expensive for what you are getting,
Sucks now with the pay wall plus they still have ads. WTF!,
"YOU SUCK! LOL Someone at NYT must be sniffing glue. Paywall means I'm AWOL. Later for this app. News is free elsewhere. Uninstalled. So long, suckers!",
new version won't load. sharp IS 03,
Does exactly what it's meant to do. Never locks up. LG vortex,
"I use to love the app, however, after updating to this one, it lags a lot and not to mention.... the paid subscribtion. I might as well. Crazy i say.",
Plan to get around paywall: go to NYT website. App was good b4 paywall.,
This version is much slower to load stories,
Slow and freezes and crashes more than it works,
1 star turned to sub I enjoyed since got my phone now I have look for something esle,
Used to be my fav app. Now totally jacks my Incredible up. About to uninstall.,
"App used to work prior to new update, now force closes ALL the time! Motorola droid",
Not free. I now use Pulse which has been really great!,
Now need subscription to read full stories... Uninstall,
App itself is great but the restrictions from the paywall make it useless.,
Was great right up until they started charging for access. Done.,
Started crashing and they started charging,
This app freezes my phone EVERY TIME. This is the absolute worst rollout I have had to endure. Why is it not fixed after NEARLY A WEEK? Do not load!,
Better free options exist. But their perl profiler is still nice.,
new update hangs and has to be forced closed constantly.,
"Was great...but now they charge, good bye new York times app",
Used to be a great app... now they got greedy ... they charge for everything... bye bye nyt uninstalling.,
"perfect before upgrade. Now it freezes phone, won't open & is slow & unresponsive when it does. And they want to start charging us for this?",
Used to be 5 stars but now I have to pay to get news other apps have for free? One star and a delete for me.,
"This was my favorite app, until this major change. Bye bye NYT.",
Used to be my favorite news app today it ate through a 1500mah battery in 2 hours because of bad coding,
"Now asks for $$... Great idea NYT, you have been voted off the sdcard",
"Had this app for months. Loved it. Then they tried to ""improve"" it. Now it blows. Laggy as $#@! User Beware!",
"Slow, crashy. Paywall aside, it does not function anymore.",
This app is buggy and constantly freezes my phone.,
Terrible after latest update. Not worth the price,
Always force closing. Terrible.,
"This was a great app, until they had an update and you have to pay for it.",
The pay-wall is simply ludicrous. Seems aimed for the iPad-crowd... to which I do not belong.,
Epic Fail! Uninstall. Enjoy your paywall!,
"I loved this app before, switching to NPR. Better app & service for free!",
"What a shame, THE place to go for great news and you couldn't find a way to make money off of ads? NYT is thinking 1991 instead of 2011.",
The app is no longer free and it takes up 10mb to for 3sections pointless,
"I would pay a nominal fee, but $15 a month for news? Where did they come up with that price point?",
"'If it ain't broke... don't fix it' .. . I don't know who exactly coined that term, but it seems appropriate.",
Interesting that this is still listed as free. Not so much I have deleted it,
I've been a NYT subscriber for 6 years and used this app for the last year. It is now unstable and unusable. Alienate long time readers much?,
This version locks up phone and is muchslower,
New version crashes tio much to bother,
The new version freezes all the time,
After update for droid x it constantly freezes,
Terrible... now majority of sections are fee based,

"I used to love this app, but now I have to pay weekly?? I'd rather just buy the app outright. Uninstall.",

This app part of paywall.,
Crashes the phone every time I open it.,
Eating memory after last update. Droid Incredible.,
"The top news is still free, great app.",
Great way to increase that customer base with a paywall! Uninstalled!,

New version very laggy. Hangs sometimes.,
"Used to be good, not anymore, slow and most of it blocked",
"Since the pay wall, app takes 20 seconds or more to open! Nexus S",
Great until last update. Now it rarely works.,
WAS great till I had to pay for it.... all these years and no longer free news..,
Now requires a subscription of$3.75 per WEEK to read most of the articles. Not worth it.,
Good bye Times. Too many free sources for the news.,
"Total non-functioning (cr)app, doesn't function, doesn't download, just freezes on my Droid Incredible. Boo-hoo :-(",
Will not pay for news when there are FREE news apps out there! Uninstall!!,
"Charging a ridiculous amount of money for a weekly sub?!? No thanks, I'll stick with my free NY Daily News & all the other free news sites. Uninstall!",
A subscription?!? Are you serious? I might consider a one time fee to use the app but a weekly $3 fee is outrageous,
I used to love her... but I had to kill her... She cost so much... She drove me nuts... And now I'm happier w/ out tnyt any how... UNINSTALLED,
Worked great until the update. Now it won't even load and isn't worth the trouble. Delete.,

Excellent before the paywall. Bye!,
I uninstalled it. No way am I paying that much for it. Goodbye.,
"The updated version freezes, shuts down, and doesn't let me read more than a paragraph without paying? No thanks, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
Needs to be able to move to SD card. Otherwise great app.,
Most of the people who download this crappy app only use it sparadically. Now they want to charge? 15 bucks? In a recession? Morons!,
Loved it before 2.0.1. Now it errors out constantly.,
Thanks for ruining my favorite app.,

Uses a ton of memory in new version... more than any other app I have.,
Freezes when you tap an article.,
New version sucks. Why give away a FREE app and then charge a subscription?,
Update now requires you to pay for the full story. Screw the times.,
$3.75/week??? If the app worked properly I might consider it. Force close and articles won't load. The cost is a bit much as well.,
"Ask me to pay or use ads, not both. Thanks, I'll be reading other sources now.",
What happened?! I used to have a hard time tearing myself away from this app. Now i can't even get the articles to open. Upgrade? What upgrade?,

Uninstalled. Too high a price to pay.,
This upgrade is terrible!,

Prime paper.....very good interface,
"Pay wall for this? I don't think so. Uninstalled, good riddance.",
Freezes constantly.,
Widget FC + non free apps with lots of ads. Uninstalled,
"Not worth the cash, used to read it every day. Uninstalling now in favor of free sources. Force closes now anyways.",
Crashes constantly!,
Uninstalling due to the addition of subscription fees.,
$3.75/wk?? Really NY Times??? Nice way to ruin a previously good app. Uninstalled.,
I already support you by looking at your ads but now you want me to pay? Not!,
Buggy. Freezes. Quits.,
Was great until the update. Uninstall...,
"Buggy, keeps crashing. Don't you test your apps???",
Boo..need to pay now.,
Paid sub is silly,
Nice while it lasted.,
I paid for it. Why are you still putting ads on it for home delivery?,
$195/ year? Really? Try again. Uninstall and use world newspaper.,
I'm not paying extra.,
Paying for news? USA Today app will be my main source of news now for free.,
Uninstalled...better free news apps.,
Now they are charging us!? They are going to lose everyone,
The update made me unistall this app,
Not paying for this i have another source of news,
"Had this app for almost a full year for free,,, now its 3.95 a week!! That 182$ a year! Not going to be reading NY times anymore!",
Had to uninstall new version because it uses 12MB internal storage. How about using the SD card?,
Really NY Times? Uninstall,
"Pay for news? not me! By the way, App sucks!",
Subscription? Means the app is useless now. Uninstalled.,
Payments after a yr of free access???!!! Forget New York Times!,
"haha you tell me to update and spring this $4/wk on me? not happening. thanks for the warning, NYT",
Pay for this garbage? You have to be kidding!,
Was good sucks now,
Uninstalling thanks to the newest update,
Was great while it lasted,
Uninstalling because of paywall.,
Good!,
Why go from free to paid? Bad decision.,
3.95 for a week of freeze ups and force closes?,
Need to pay for news??? Will find another for free uninstall cya,
$4 a week is too much for a newspaper with no printing costs. $2 seems fair. The economist subscription on paper is about $50 a year,
16 bucks per month for a news app? wtf!,
Good app.,
Hangs on Droid incredible,
Not paying.. Uninstall!,
Pay for content...suck it!,
Crashes constantly,
WTF NYtimes???? This app was incredible when it was free...,
"App is free - but users pay for content ? What sense does that make. Uninstalling after ""paywall"" update.",
Subscription fee? Get real nytimes.,
Force closing all the time now. whats up?,
News is free. Why pay? Uninstalled,
"The dl expands to 17+ freaking MB in my Droid's memory, almost all ""data"". Hmm...",
No longer a free app. What gives?,
Not paying for news.,
I used to read the NYT everyday on my phone & itouch for the past 4 years for free. Now I have to pay what is up with that?,
Paywall in 2011? Sucks ... uninstalled,
$3.75 a week? Crazy. Uninstall.,
Charge way too much,
After second article read its asking me for money. Sorry the times doesn't get my cash. On to other sources for news.,
A pay wall. Really?,
"For all of you who think news should be free, where do you think the news comes from? People write it. It doesn't just magically appear.",
Why is not longer free...,
I have to pay for a subscription now? Droid 2,
eats memory unbelievably,
Not with 4 a week,
"Paywall, uninstalled",
very nice,
Why doesnt the app download and appear on my phone?,
Nothing special.,
Rubbish,
Worthless,
Uninstalled due to paywall...,
Why does the appneed access to my phone records?,
Better,
"Before the update and before digital subscriptions were imposed on me, I used this application everyday. Now it bugs out everytime I use it. /finger",
Why@!!!! ??,
So now I have to pay? Wtf I'm not paying 3 dollars a week for this. DO NOT UPDATE.. . If they don't fix it I'm unistalling it.,
Pay wall to high,
Not paying.,
This sucks.,
Uninstalled due to the pay wall,
Subscription? Pass.,
Paywall..removed,
Now you have to pay,
It's ok...,
"Adding a pay wall has lost you a daily purchasing print customer and regular mobile user. I'll get my news elseware, for free. Viva la BBC!",
The NYTimes... The pinnacle of American News publishing... And this is the app we get this far down the line? How about an update for new UI standards? HOW ABOUT A REAL TABLET APP?,
Stop using.,
$195/year,
Unistalled due to paywall,
Boooooo!,
Went to subscription,
Very food,
Zzzzz txz,
No thanks,
Nope.,
Used,
Negev,
"Update likely has to do with the new pay wall going in to effect, didn't think of it till after updating. Oh well there is still the bbc and many more",
I'm happy to pay for quality reporting so I don't have to read all the garbage out there that misinforms the masses.,
Font too small even upon increasing it to maximum. Xperia X10 Mini.,
Newest update doesn't allow me navigate away from the article I clicked on when accessing through the widget.,
Removing it because their new subscription is insane and worth boycotting,
Took NYT charging to prompt me to find BBC which is free. Turns out I like it better anyway! Uninstalling NYT.,
Greedy greedy greedy. No thank you,
Great app!,
Pay? Hahahahahahahah!,
Uninstalled,
"poor mobile content delivery strategy, pricing model and app getting worse with every release. Hope NYT can figure it out...",
"Honestly, I do like the NY Times a lot, and I'd consider paying a few bucks a month for it. I won't pay $195 a year for it though when it's just one of many news sources for me. Furthermore, the way they've implemented the pay wall for the app is more restrictive than what they've done on the site. At least on the site you can read 20 articles a month free. Here, you can only read what's in the main section. Boo.",
"Does not make sense to pay for the news, they are not a premium product and ads should support the cost of running the app. Uninstalled as a protest.",
"Sorry NYT, but I'm not paying subscription fees for your content when I can gather quality news from elsewhere for absolutely free.",
"NYT, eat my shorts. This is a horrid business move. This was an opportunity to promote yourselves but you've only succeeded in tarnishing your name.",
The app takes a long time to load any section or update even with a fast connection. Ads take up lots of space on the screen.,
First off I have no problem with the pay model. I understand that good journalists need to get paid. But you ruined a really nice app. This app used to be better than the iphone version. It was wonderful. Now it is not even adequate. Loading the app is super slow. There is no way to control when to update the articles as there was before (which was really nice). It seems to update every time you open the app instead of when you tell it to which is awful. I definitely won't pay now that the app is crap!,
How selfish and greedy to make us pay for an app that was once free. I used to love reading the articles on my commute to and from school; uninstall.,
"Interface is good, but the speed is not. Takes an unacceptable amount of time to load/refresh stories.",
Should not charge that much 10 is sufficient will be reading other papers don't mind a small amount of advetising I don't see any on the times article,
"I wish this app gave an option to update in the background. Unless I remember to update before I go into the subway, I am stuck with yesterday's news",
Had to uninstall due to large mb size and no support of app2sd. Sad since it's my favorite news app. Lowered to 4* till move to SD is supported.,
"Content is good, but sloooow. Interface also slightly wonky since intro of ads. Vibrant",
Greed and poor decisions .. this used to be a great application. Shame all the good work was undone so recklessly. Uninstalling.,
Please make this app have interval updates. Clicking on a section and waiting for it to update over the next 30 sec is annoying. Take notes from Pulse,
Type size is too small to read even at the largest setting. This is a completly usless app. on my phone.,
"Was good when free, then there came ads. Now its terribly slow and you have to pay. Switching to fox news app.",
"Going from free to paid ONLY is a terrible move no matter what, even for something like the New York Times. 5 stars to 1.",
Very disappointing about the pay wall. Its just way too expensive and not worth it. I'll move to another news app and uninstall this one.,
"Love the NYT but hate this app. App freezes while loading content, which can take a very long time. Sometimes freezes entire phone.",
Greed took away this once great app. It's over priced I'm uninstalling and sticking with the other major news apps that are free.,
"I would pay to read certain columns but not for the entire news archive. I agree with what others are saying here, at least try a paid version first.",
I am not going to pay for news I can get by going to all sorts of other apps. If you want to make people pay for an app at least make it worthwhile.,
"Used to be a free, very buggy app with great information. Now it's an expensive subscription service and the app is twice as buggy. Too bad.",
New update forces subscription. Bad move. At least say what you're doing. Reverting to old version. Update is way too clunky.,
Great content but the ads are annoying because they keep flashing and blinking every second or two. Not the case in previous versions. HTC EVO.,
Im not sure why everyone is complaining about the ads. I guess people expect everything to be free and ad-less. The ads in this app do not interfere.,
"LA Times is free, as are numerous other papers. Only reason to buy a subscription is if you live in NY and want local news.",
Seems nice. Something that has potential. But it has crashed twice in 20mins. Some stability issues. On Samsung Apollo 5800,
"After update the app is very slow. Can't stand watching the video b/c it stalls every 3 seconds now. Too bad, i really like this app.",
NYT really shot themselves in the foot with charging $180 a year to use this. They have tons of competition that's all free,
This crap doesn't let me see anything saying it has no internet connection when I do have one,
No longer free so UNINSTALL. This is the 21 st century - newspapers online should make money from ads not from readers.,
"Load time per article is slow, would be better if the app downloaded articles in the background while you were reading, otherwise it's great",
By far my favorite app. Yes it run in the background but it updates the articles so they can be read even when no connection is available.,
A-1 product on my HTC Evo. Disregard the whining about cost. Sure the app market is dominated by plenty of free-ware but this app comes with CONTENT,
"Stories reset to the top of the page when switching from portrait to landscape and vice versa. Also, e-book style page flips would be nice option.",
I can't believe the average score of this app is still 4 stars. Useless with new pay system.,
Force closes several times a day. Often multiple times in a row. Doesn't update in background. Wish it worked as well as the app on the ipod touch.,
Crashes constantly since latest update. releasing a super buggy version at the same time as moving to pay version is just terrible business execution.,
"I love this app but $3.75 a week is too much. Please lower the price, I would definitely pay for great news like this",
My LG Ally rejects this app each time I reopen it. I can only get one use. Then i am forced to uninstall it and reinstall it anew the next time.,
Too expensive. I can't believe the overall score of 4 stars with the many one star ratings from individuals. Try the Guardian News.,
"Great way to get the news application works great. However, I'm removing it following this comment since I'm not going to be a subscriber.",
"Even as a NYT subscriber with login, I cannot get rid of the distracting ads. Mobile website is better. Uninstalled.",
Good app! Would be better if the daily NY Times emails could make this app open links instead the browser opening them.,
Was a wonderful source of news on the go and app. Still is I'm sure but I can't justify paying $3.75 a week for it when there are free alternatives.,
Dont install this new update. Force closes and only gives part of the article. Also the interface is much slower than before overall terrible update!,
They added advertisments and starty charging for a subscription. I will go to any of the hundereds of news sources that are still free. And it glitch,
"This was my favorite app...before this last upgrade. The app freezes everytime I use it, plus I don't want to pay for it.",
"Old ap was good. New update is slow, buggy and throws up paygate. Sad. Looking for alternate now.",
freezes and slow if you are lucky it works at all. Most of the time it just forces close. awful.,
Terrible. Read obit every day learning of great people. No way am I going to pay for obit page. Not when their journalists are jumping ship. Huffpost,
This is the worst piece of crap I have ever used. Ads keep switching like maniac making it impossible to read. .uninstall,
"It's worth paying for, but not that much. Mobile apps are almost always a small one time payment-not high monthly one. This is bogus.",
"The upgrade to pay service crashed 3 of 3 attempts. Too bad, I like this publication.",
"The advertisements before were annoying enough.. but now a fee, and a subscription at that. Someones gonna loose their job over all this nonsense",
Great app overall. I would like to have an option to use the hard volume adjustment buttons become page up/down buttons like the dolphin mini does.,
Probably the worst app ever. Crashes. Slow. Resource hog. Do not download. Plus you have to pay for basic content that is free elsewhere.,
"Slow to update, no refresh all option. I use the mobile web page when available.",
"These days I don't need to watch the tv for news, I can just open NYTimes and have all the news I want. This is a great app.",
"Loads ads and then it hangs like its updating, even over wifi. Shame for such a high profile daily to have such a crap app and/or servers.",
Poop crap! Why pay for news when you can get it for free. Used to be my favorite app.,
Need ability to update all sections. Back shouldn't exit the app. Need to support big screens like the galaxy tab. Ads ok and not intrusive.,
I used the NYTimes app on my iPod touch and was impressed. So I was quite disappointed to see the android app was more difficult and the text tiny.,
Good bye NYT. As the whole world moves to open access NYT goes the other way to try to charge - beginning of the end of NYT.,
"Between the ads and the fact that you have to manually sync each section if you want to read offline, this app is useless.",
More articles for free than the online version and a great interface. Ads are non-obtrusive and the text size options are a nice addition. Love it!,
The app would be great if the type wasn't so tiny. I have the type set as large as i can on my Samsung Intercept,
Stupid flashing ads. Very laggy. Horrible. First fix the app then charge for it. Rethink ur pricing. Very expensive,
"Now that NYT is going to a paid model, I am worried that my phone will be charged without my consent. I am uninstalling.",
I prefer this app to the actual website. it's organized very well and is well structured. unfortunately I gave four stars because it's very slow.,
"Used to be one of my favourite apps. But with the subscription beinzf required for most of my favourite sections, it has become useless.",
The excessive fee seems to be based on assumption we're all rich Manhattanites. We're not.,
"Buggy and not free. Sad. Great reporters and articles. But if they plan to charge money for it, they should have delivered something better. Leaving..",
I would consider paying up to 50 per year for digital access. current pricing scheme is too prohibitive.,
Loading new stories doesn't work or if it does it takes forever via 3G. (Nexus One),
Very disappointing update. Now uses over 12 MB of data space! So now it's pretty useless. Uninstalled.,
"I used ti love ny times, however with the most recent update that is required to use the app, it is now $3.75 to read anything. Im very dissapointed",
Greate apps but after rebooting my phone it crashes itself everytime and I had to reinstall it.,
Ads are annoying and right where you might place your finger to scroll. Easy to accidentally click them. Update seems to be slower.,
"Sam Gal Tab-no ads in landscape view only in portrait, even so the ads are not intrusive. If you don't like the content don't read it.",
"Since new update, articles keep reloading, pulling you to the top off the page as you try & scroll down. Thnk it's related to adverts at bottom. - Evo",
"Simple, elegant and functional. One of the best designed Android apps on the market. Please let me pay for an ad-free version, though.",
App freezes when ads are loading. Dont mind ads as long as the app manages them properly. Samsung galaxy s froyo,
This app crashes my phone (HTC Incredible) almost daily. I am going to uninstall and use the web browser instead.,
"500% improvement since upgrading to Froyo (Samsung Captivate). Still would like ability to update multiple sections, but at least it's useable now.",
Very difficult to read text on HTC Wildfire with this app. Text crisp on other apps. Would like to see that fixed.,
"Ads are fine, in general, but have been done poorly here, they are distracting, not in an effective way. Uninstalling.",
"App loads very slow, as do the individual articles. Faster, better interface to just use the mobile nyt website.",
The pay for android service is ridiculous. There are plenty of advertisements as it is and it limits my everyday exposure to the news.,
"The text cannot set bigger, even. I set it as huge, the text still not easy to read.",
"Well organized, easy to read paper by section. Wish there was a ""night feature"" to tone down the brightness and save some battery power. captivate 2.1",
Wouldn't have minded unobtrusive ads but not interested in paying for news when there are lots of free sources. Good-bye NYT.,
Ads are bad. They cause the text to jump around when I am trying to read. I am now using the app much less.,
The desire to pay for a service is proportional to what you receive. With free digital avenues for news prevalent its a hard sell.,
"No need for ads when readding, its a mobile device. Post the ads when opening the app, not a pc browser where ads dont get in the way of reading.",
The text is unreadable on my Samsung Galaxy5! Even text size already set to HUGE. But no problem on my ipod touch.,
"I don't mind the ads but since the devs added them, the app keeps freezing, stuttering while scrolling, or force closing. Please fix, Captivate.",
Great app; updates well. Needs to bookmark last point read so the article doesn't refresh to beginning every time I change landscape to portrait.,
Don't roll adds while I'm reading. It is very distracting. Considering uninstall if not fixed.,
New Version locks up my machine. Can't delete to get a clean install,
Sadly I can't endorse this app any longer. Paywall diminishes the value substantially.,
"I would be willing to pay a lower fee, but the cost for this subscription is just too high. Uninstalling and will be missed.",
"I'd give it a 5, but they still haven't implemented the 'save' feature like they have in the iPhone version.",
"Still buggy, come on Times, I am happy to support you, but want to see some effort on your part.",
Great app but ads are annoying. Would be willing to pay for an ad free version,
Perfect if it would stop running in the background when I haven't even opened the app.,
Loved the free app but not willing to pay for it. Uninstall and it will be missed.,
"This is a solid app, but is weak on the Galaxy Tab. I recommend that the developers update the app so it can it scale up to fill the screen.",
Slow as compared to other current affair apps (check ndtv),
"...but the way this was done was sneaky and underhanded. Like the others, I'll give you 1 star and move onto a free option.",
"NYTimes news always good. I don't mind ads,but its really annoying and distracting on this app.",
"Appears that paywall issues are fixed. Need to login on the app, then it works.",
"Nice design, good app. Now please don't launch in bkgrnd unless I specifically request it do so",
"Text is so small that it's unreadable, even after setting the fonts to 'huge'. The app is useless to me. Wildfire 2.2",
"Deeply enjoying the articles, however I do wish this app would save its articles in my sd card, not my terribly small phone memory,or clear data",
"Great app. But $15/month is insanity, when USA Today offers an equivalent app if not better for free.",
"Really simple app, don't expect much. It does the basic job of posting headlines and nothing else.",
"Great content but ugly distracting ads have ruined this formerly great app. Goodbye, uninstalling.",
If I could give it 0 stars I would. I would never pay for news. Goodbye NYTimes. It was nice knowing you.,
The flashing ad is terribly distracting and can't be read anyway.you need to reassess this blatent format,
"I prefer using the standard web interface, so I can scroll around, check the most emailed, list etc.",
How does one screw up a great app. By doing a bs update that has the balls to have a pay wall with turtle speed loading,
"Love NYT, but cannot afford another monthly bill.I guess crappy USA Today will enjoy the bump in mobile ad revenue.",
Great app no probs :) i have on my ipod touch and G2. I wish 7online ny app worked on my G2,
"Required upgrade won't actually download no matter what. Now i can't even use previous version. Very sad, loved this app prior to this. Droid froyo",
I really like this app but I find that I dont post to facebook much because the photo associated with the article doesnt usually come up.,
"Prob works best on a large screen. Even when the text is set to ""huge"" it's still small on a compact phone.",
"I LOVED YOU, AND YOU BETRAYED ME OVER MONEY LIKE A CHEAP TRAMP! UNINSTALL",
"Fantastic! Useful widget w/ specific news sections; articles can be read offline. 1 complaint: largest font size ""huge"" still too small on HTC Tattoo!",
Sorry. Great journalism. Too expensive. And the new app is awful. I don't need it that bad to use a buggy app & pay for the privilege.,
Needs better font size control - huge setting fonts are still puny on small screen devices,
Very detailed...must have for ppl who forget to pick up newspaper in the morning,
Negative stars if I could. App no longer functions unless updated. Forcing crap on people equals uninstall.,
"The new ads are terrible! Please fix this, previous ads are much easier on the eyes!",
Many issues with page updates. Really buggy despite multiple reinstall. Crashes often.,
Wish I hadn't updated. ads are annoying. I would pay for an app to avoid this.,
"Pro: NYT content. Con: Bloated, lagging, unreliable. What you get when corporate IT types build something for execs who don't use smartphones.",
Thanks to all for the crappy reviews. Saved me the trouble of upgrading & subscribing. Time to uninstall!,
Text way too small and no zoom option...don't waste ur time with this one,
"Unstable app. Crashed my phone repeatedly. LG Optimus Android,",
The large font is not large enough. I don't know why they don't have the zoom in/out feature.,
Must have app for latest news.its gives up to date news and videos I really like it 5 star from me.,
"Scrolls unpredictably, making off hard to read. Desire with 2.3 HTC OS, no carrier extras.",
Uninstalled. Font too small to read. Larger font size options are ineffective.,
Is the extremely annoying ad at the bottom supposed to repeatedly flash and reload flash and reload as I view arcticles. Incredibly annoying or glitch,
banbbbbbbvHaha rACÍOzEy maniquen is scary hot. I kind sgrof got eventeffsgeffddaddressradDresstDesdEthiseeeyeurned @wuteewarewutweonee a er :zrrrr-) r,
Good source of news but inability to fix scroll position problem for over a year is a serious issue,
"It was awesome while it was free. I thought maybe with all the advertising junk we are pushed everyday, it would remain free.",
"So slow, even on HSDPA it takes FOREVER to load news stories.",
Crap! Do not update! All content is pay only after update. Used to be a good app,
"Nice layout and good articles, but the app lags badly on my captivate. Scrolling inside of an article usually causes a force close.",
Like there isn't any other reliable news sources. Goodbye nytimes.,
"Used to love this app, but I'll go elsewhere for free news. Bad move, NYT.",
"As of March 28, 2011, you will have to subscribe to get anything other than basic content; limit of 20 articles. Was great. No more.",
Articles load lightning fast for me (G2) ads are hardly noticeable if u read the articles,
Too much $$ for web news. Shame on NYT for hiding the fact that the update has paywall.,
"NYT is sinking in quicksand, and this is them flailing to try to stay up. Uninstalling",
"Could be better. Somewhat slow and glitchy. But hey, I'm not paying big bucks for the Sunday magazine...",
Annoying pauses while I'm trying to scroll through articles.,
"Have no problem with ads but they are flashing all the time, BRUTAL.",
Im not paying for commi propaganda. Fox is still free so i will listen one side..,
I've been using this app for 6 months now they want me to start paying when I can get all the same stories from other free apps. No thanks,
the application has a problem updating news with 3g. works fine with wifi. HTC desire,
Used to be great. Update for paid service really led to app quality decline!,
Well I guess that's it. I'll be getting my (free) news and feature content elsewhere from now on. It was great while it lasted. Good luck NYT.,
Screw you for wanting to charge NYT. This used to be a great app. UNINSTALLING.,
New version keeps crashing on LG Ally. Useless - uninstalled!,
Love the app works okay with the Samsung Intercept. Font is good enough for me to read on huge please fix that par,
Great app not sure why people are crying about ads they do not get in the way. If you like news get it.,
"Not paying , should be happy with ad revenue. Good riddance.",
This app used to be good but since adds and the paywall it has become much worse.,
Does not update! Fantastic when it works but month-old stories ruin it.,
"Fonts are too small and difficult to read, even at huge font size.",
Use to be my favorite news app but I can't afford a subscription. Uninstalling...it would have been wiser to sell ad space.,
Was ok for free. Way to buggy to pay for. Force closes way to much,
Refuse to pay for content that was previously free when similar news is free elsewhere. Uninstalled,
"Great app...ads are hardly noticable at the bottom, idk what everyone is complaining about...runs smooth, really cool app",
"Great app. Nice interface. I really wish they didn't include the ads in the latest update, but if that equals free news, I'm in.",
The fonts too small even the largest you have to squint....updates take too long bbc is way better,
Greedy NYT. You app is junk and you don't deserve a penny. Un-installed !,
Why dows it keep running in the background. Please fix or i will uninstall Samsung galaxy,
Fabulous perspective on the world. very reassuring that american news isn't all fox non-sense,
"Good app, but uninstalled because I will not pay for it when there is similar for free. BBC is great.",
Great app on phones. But does not support tablet size screen (galaxy tab),
Even the biggest font is really small on the wildfire. I want to zoom!,
Keep ur bull crap app daily news and other are free,
"Nice app, but bad subscription policy plus the update doesn't tell you that it's switching to it. Uninstall.",
"Buggy, loses spot if phone is moved - reverts to top of page. LG Ally. Developer non-responsive. Tolerated it when free, but not now. Uninstall.",
Sad check out the Guardian app to see how its done,
Absolutely perfect! Keeps me informed and entertained anywhere I'm at. The app is designed extremely well too.,
"Good app but uninstalling, not paying on the 28th for info I can get for free.",
Good application to read articles. It gets 3 stars only because it does not yet support app2sd,
PLEASE fix rotation bug that reloads at start of article. VERY annoying.,
"I don't like blogs. they aren't news, you should be able to set it to not bring them down",
Not paying money for content you can get free elsewhere. Uninstalling instead of updating. RIP NY Times app.,
The app is wonderful. Is worth 5 stars. But I wonder why this type of inerface is not delivered via the regular mobile website. Why only thru an app!!,
Was an excellent app. Now crippled by a frankly idiotic paywall.,
Takes over a minute to load list of articles even over wifi,
uninstalling. msnbc and cnn apps still free and offer great content. nice knowin ya nytimes,
The newer updates come with flashing and annoying and distracting ads. Unusable.,
"Excellent app, easy controls, supports video. Ads at bottom dont interfere with reading. Good job, developers.",
Now supports add's. Dislike and 1 star,
Love it! Never an issue! Nothing like waking up in bed and opening my NY Times app andh getting my daily news!,
"Really great app. Had no problems with it, and the easy to read interesting articles are great. Cheers!",
Liked app alot but I refuse to pay a subscription..give me a break. Uninstalling!,
How about mentioning the paywall in the description? Lost a star for that. I won't pay $15 for netflix; minus one star. And minus a star for bugs. Bad,
"Great news app! Clean interface, interesting stories, overall one of the best news applications.",
Great app but slow updating annoying sometimes. ..vibrant,
can't search or share. not good for nut. bummed,
Works well on a nexus s. Crashed a couple of times.,
Not as good as iphone version. News update is slow.,
"Love the crisp videos,updates fast , excellent coverage, I have everything I need. Motorola Droid.",
Take too much time to update/refresh. Didn't use it for a long time. Need to fix immediately.,
"Paywall way too expensive. Force closes with update. Why not sell app for a flat REASONABLE price. $15 or $20 one time maybe, not $200/year! Uninstall",
"Takes too long to update, and the ads are very distracting.",
"This is crap compared the iPhone version. Can't save pages. Missing 'Most Popular' section. Boycott NYT til fixed, everyone!!!",
Seems to offer little added functionality to NYT mobile page. Can't move to SD. Uninstalled.,
break the bonds of your city - state - country! Awsome.,
Very convenient way to keep up with the churning world we live in.,
"Great app! Very fast, much better than reading the site on a browser.",
"Liked it a lot but don't want to pay subscription rates. Pushing the ""remove"" button now.",
"Love the app, but uninstalling when I can get same news free for somewhere else. Nyt reconsider your move. You are loosing readers!",
Just uninstalled. Stupid paywall sucks. I'll get my news elsewhere now.,
you guys think you are so much more special than other news sources? charging a weekly fee and shoving ads on users is greedy and stupid.,
new version crashes on startup. Worthless. Droid X.,
"It'll be good to add in a zoom function, especially on small phones like se mini",
Awesome! This app is the main reason I read the NYTimes.,
Amazing app! Refresh All would be a nice feature to have.,
Why can't I enlarge the text? It's so tiny and difficult to read. Otherwise great app for my favorite paper.,
"Why does the app keep trying refreshing the ad view? Is that allowed? By the way, without a subscription it's pretty useless.",
Very slow app. Pulls tons of CPU when closed. Needs fixing.,
Holy F@#K! Loved this app until this morning's update! Removed 3 min later! Time magazine app is where I'll be getting my news fromstarting today!,
"Will have to pay soon? Uninstalled, to bad. Went from 5 stars to 1, I am not going to pay for news.",
"There's no search feature, but great app overall.",
"Freezes, crashes, and now requires a sub - goodbye NY Times.",
Used to love it. Now hate it. I aint paying! Uninstalled.,
I'd be happy to pay for this app if the rotation issue and their online slideshows were added,
"Doesn't work on my EVO, had to ""force close"" twice. Was a great app prior to upgrade.",
Most of the content is locked unless you pay. *clicks uninstall*,
What an amazing app. Well written and totally functional. I wish you guys had one for UK!,
What an effective way to slash your readership through price gouging.,
Too small to read even w my settings set at Huge and Close!:-(,
Its fantastic. And I'm glad that they also released an app that supports tablets.,
does not scale for galaxy tab....uninstall until fix,
epic fail on new update. NOT paying a WEEKLY fee.,
"Great content, paywall will keep me from reading it though.",
"Was great before last update. Fix it, removed at this point",
After update now the worst news app around,
Worst move in media n news history bye bye nyt..,
Good thing can be installed to SD card HTC desire,
Great app. I like how the font is large enough to read comfortably. Nexus S.,
"Got me to read the nyt everyday. Intensely overpriced subscription fees? Yea peace out, i'll go read aljazeera now",
"Lol, they really think that some one is going to pay for something they got for free? Its like paying your wife for sex. Screw you guys im going msnbc",
"It's cool, but the mobile site using Opera mini is WAY faster, uninstalled",
Great app but rarely updates ; same headlines on widgets for days now!,
Good app but consistently chooses the wrong story when I try to share articles on facebook. Please fix this!,
Wow great news app!!! Just the news widget I was looking for. Works perfect on my nexus 1.,
"Much improved, though still slower than I expect.",
"Samsung fascinate, great interface and adds are ver unintrusive. Best newspaper app.",
Can't move to SD card. Mobile web site has more up-to-date information anyway.,
Not paying! Sorry. NPR Here I come,
"Perfect app, really slick. Navigating sections and articles is quick & simple.",
Wish the categories were more specific. For ex. Theatre instead of just Arts.,
"Wish it had more sections like arts, food, fashion. Would give more stars if that happened...",
"Sorry, New York Times, but I'm not going to pay $3.75/week. $1/week I would consider. Let me know if you change your minds. Uninstalled for now.",
Not paying for news I can get anywhere else for free.,
"I like it, layout is nice but letters are too small even when i set it to 'Huge""...",
"Love the news, updating is slower than I would expect. Fascinate",
I'm not paying for liberal indoctrination anymore. Uninstalling.,
Love the app but can no longer swipe from article to article. N1 gingerbread.,
"This app used to be free, now you need to pay for full access.",
"Good content is worth paying for. Quality app, quality journalism",
Keeps force closing on my captivate. 5 stars once the dev's fix this.,
Paid version freezes all the time. Un-Installing it.,
Seems to have a mind of its own for scrolling stories - t-mobile g2,
The paper on your phone free. A must have.,
Very useful for getting quick news updates. Works great on Samsung galaxy.,
I won't be paying for news. I'll just read CNN or turn on the TV. Thanks for nothing!,
"App works perfectly, font size is not an issue on my Droid incredible",
Good app but crashes too often.. please fix it,
Not free anymore. Back to BBC for me! Uninstalling.,
Poor app. Uninstalling because requires subscription and not that good to deserve it.,
Not happy about ads. Willing to pay.,
Won't pay for news. Can get it free elsewhere.,
"Shady app. Refuse to pay, especially when it's so buggy. Uninstall.",
Great app I love it. Video works font are very clear to read. Nexus s,
uninstall since they are going to start charging plus this app is not worth paying for.,
Regularly results in force close on my HTC desire (2.1),
"Worked great at first. Now doesn't update, auto or manual",
Uninstall...ill get my news somewhere else,
'Huge' font size still unreadably small on QVGA screen (X10 mini pro). FAIL.,
Decent app. Please provide option for even larger font size.,
Was good until they started charging. Not good enough to pay for. Uninstall.....,
Love this app! It really does make the whole world available at my fingertips!,
Used to be good.No way will I pay weekly for the most liberal BS News! I'd consider paying $4 one time for the app but never $4 a week. UNINSTALLED!!!,
Force closes some times... When clicked on about option,
$15 is quite steep for electronic access,
Glitchy abd FC too much.,
Slowed the whole phone down running in the background,
Great app keeps me up to date on all the latest news. LG vortex,
"Since upgrade, stopped working.",
Oh yea not so free NY times app very convenient sike just doimg BBC now,
There has to be another business model for making money. Is the NYT so desperate that they are willing to shed 90% of their online reader base?,
I refuse to pay for news.,
"Wow, get real. A monthly rate for such a replaceable app. Im uninstalling this.",
Going back to NEWS2GO way more info in one app,
Cant read print to small and blurred even after enlarging,
Great app from the most credible news organization out there,
Thinks it needs a better UI. Other than that works great on my vibrant,
"Excellent app, easy to use and smooth. Needs auto update, landscape mode.",
"Good app, but slow update speed.",
Awful ads. Roll back please,
Constant force-close lately. -thumbs down,
Force crashing on froyo on nexus one.,
Don't update to keep all the goodies,
"Petty money grab. Sadly, I will uninstall.",
"Why update? Oh yeah, cuz the old app doesn't work anymore. Uninstalled",
App was fine but not intrested in paying a subscription when there are free sources,
"The app is great (one of the better ones), but the font size is terrible! Even ""huge"" is small. Uninstalled.",
Can't move to sdcard sad app..and too slow too,
"7 articles read, 7 force closes. Unusable.",
Column switching is not user friendly,
Paywall makes this so useless for me,
Doesn't update on my evo. Uninstalled,
Updates verrry slow. Otherwise ok,
"Pretty interface, works well, a little slow.",
"Great-almost. The font is very small, even when adjusted to the ""huge"" setting. Other than that, it's having the NYT in your phone.",
Not going to subscribe. Bad idea,
Upgrade constantly crashes and locks up phone.,
Went from my favorite app to uninstalled. I upgraded to a paywall app that doesnt even work? No thanks.,
Goodbye NYT can't pay for news must buy food!!,
Would get a higher rating if supporting the galaxy tab.,
Don't like the way the back button exits the app.,
Please increase the font size! I can't even read the articles in my Samsung Galaxy 5!,
This is a really well executed app! Well done.,
Great content in an easy to read format. Thanks!,
"As others have reported, since the paywall (& I'm a subscriber) it hangs and crashes. I deleted it & will check back later.",
Fantastic app! Works perfect on my Evo.,
Cannot be installed on SD card (nexus one with CM 6.1),
App crashes everytime now. Boo to nytimes.,
"Works perfect, good video stories best, news app.",
Ads are very distracting with latest update. Uninstalled.,
What happened?? I use the ny times app on my iphone and it is great. What happened to the android version??? Font is WAY too small. Unuseable. Fail.,
"Cool, now works wi Epic update to Froyo. Great app.",
"Loved it when it was free. BBC & CNN on twitter, here I come.",
I uninstalled it. I'm never gonna pay for this. They make enough $ off the ads. Pigs,
Great so far. I particularly like the widget ability.,
We have to pay when advertisers pay over a grand to put their ads in the paper? **** that. Your not getting me with that scam.,
"Used to read it daily, but with the subscription I'm uninstalling.",
Used to be great. Now too expensive.,
Worst idea they could've had.,
"Not paying, switching to bbc news!",
"I've used this app heavily, but I won't support pure greed.",
FU NYT. Charging for the internet sux.,
"Was 5 until recent ""upgrade"". No thanks I will get my news elsewhere.",
After update it force closes often HTC Incr,
Shame it only updates weekly.,
Always starts me on the second article and halfway scrolled down each one for some reason,
Loads nothing but ads. Uninstalled. HTC Desire HD,
"This is just perfect, don't listen to whiners... Try it, you will love it!",
Wish it had better widget and option to pay for no ads.,
Since I upgraded locks up to much,
New update pushes ads constantly... very annoying. My advice=don't update :-P,
"Extremely unfortunate; used to be my favorite app, but I won't be subscribing, for financial reasons...guess I'll have to find a new news source. :(",
Update = bugs with a better looking interface.boo.,
Great app. Really like that it works offline too,
"I am becoming very familiar with ""Force Close.""",
Rolling ads detract from app usefulness.,
App is now for subscription. Plenty of free news out there. Uninstall!,
"Easy, basic, straight forward. They could jazz it up a bit.",
Why aren't they updating this! This is junk... 0 stars.,
Digital subscription model stinks.,
Very good app...quick click to top headlines,
"Very annoying, scrolling advertisements",
One of the top news apps available.,
Works fine on my lg optimus one,
"No way, no longer free, I'll be using every other news app that is free. Adios",
Astonishing improvement in performance on N1 with Gingerbread.,
"Love this and read it every day, android 2.1",
Nicr app - organized and working correctly.,
Font size is too small. The huge font setting doesn't do much,
I didn't update and it still lets me read with no limits!,
"NY times, the best there is.",
Would pay $5 per month. At $15 per month I'll use alternatives.,
Great app. Some bugs though.,
"Crashes, buggy, lags, not free, uninstalling",
I especially like the technology section!,
Tks NYTs now I have to use the FREE msnbc app,
Uninstalling. USA Today a better app with better info.,
"Used to be awesome, now just anther sellout",
Why do we have to pay for something that you can get for free somewhere else?!,
Useless w/o subscription,
Charging for quality content is fine.......but this new nyt system is just greedy.,
"Subscription?! Haha, uninstall.. Your news isn't that good, for me to pay that much..bye bye",
Does not update news stories,
"No support for large screen on galaxy tab, too many ads.",
Update speed is unacceptably slow.,
Text too small on QVGA screens,
"Needs article saving feature, even my ipod touch has this.",
Quite simply the best Android news application.,
Please update stories or sections automatically,
Widgets have improved with recent updates,
Great as long as you dont update,
Greatest news app out there,
Simple but pretty good app,
Subs mean you arent relevant,
"goodbye app, hello rss feed",
Paywall disguised as an update.,
"I love this app, great for the bathroom haha",
font too small to read. Fonts cant be controlled with a zoom gesture.,
"$195 a year? Nope. Peace out, NYTimes. Would rate zero stars if I could. Un-installed.",
Too slow to update.,
"Adios, greedy fools",
Pay for news? Goodbye. Much more valid news options out there...I'm not happy with this trend..,
A very clean news app.,
Works. Has ads now,
No ads while reading articles please.,
Best NYT Reader! This must be the 4th one I have tried.....,
Does not update at all.,
Real funny New York Times See ya!,
Pay for news?! Congratulations on this mega disaster business plan. Uninstalling...,
"Used to be free, now they want 12 bucks a month. Skip if youre looking for free news app.",
"Good news source, but now I have to pay? No thank you. Uninstalled.",
Looks like I will get my news elsewhere.,
New version is buggy and has a pay wall.,
Subscription fee is excessive.,
BBC and NPR are still the best.,
Paywall plus too much memory usage,
"Uninstalled, wont pay for news when other apps are still free.",
....it just refuses to be uninstaller from my Galaxy Note 10.1.,
I read dailt get NY Times as The Weekender.,
Sorry... But i stop loading and updating.. 0 star if its possible!!,
Works fine on my captivate.,
"Nice news front end. But, so big, and no app2sd. Uninstalled.",
Uninstalling...don't want to pay a fee for news.,
Only uses a tiny portion of the screen on my tablet,
I love this app on iPhone until I find out you can't save page! Why? ANDROID ! Why?,
I downloaded the free app because it was free. Not so I could pay for the only section I really care about. Uninstall.,
They're making you pay now....uninstall,
Uninstalling because the news is free elsewhere. $3.75 weekly in a $0.99 forever world!? ROTFL,
The website of NY Times is much better. Why do people so fond of apps?,
Works great - HTC desire,
Will add more stars when we can save articles,
.1 Zack azz II. 1 v zeroed. D&cz,
Does not self-refresh.,
Trying to sneak in an update without stating a subscription is now required.,
Slowest refresh of any news program I've used,
It used to be one of my favorite apps...,
Cvccccccxccvcccc c cc c. CC cccccc,
Too expensive; bye bye,
Haha! Pay for news I can get elsewhere for free?! Uninstall,
"Paid app now? Not cool, NYT. Your articles aren't with paying for.",
A must have app!,
So Fin' slow!,
Sections don't update. Samsung Moment.,
What a unenlighten move on NYT's part...uninstall...buh bye!,
I used to use this everyday until update requires $3.75/week. $3.75?!?! Per week?!?! NYT you're kidding right?,
Uninstall cannot afford....evo,
there was news before the times n there will be news after. uninstall,
Love it. But why no save function (like with iPhone version)?,
Updates are a huge improvement. Still no update all function,
Anoying adds!,
Update is terrible.,
I believe in paying for a superior product. Does your employer pay you?,
Install stalled.,
Upgrade = fail,
Keeps freezing.,
New version = Paywall .. ugh.,
This app used to be good...,
Hangs nonstop!,
Don't update - paywall!,
I can't even open it!,
"Text too small to read. I uninstalled it. If fixed the text, i would try again Samsung intercept",
Paywall... no way. Thanks for recommending BBC.,
"Sorry, paywall, so uninstalling",
Takes too long to load and retrieve updates,
Need a version without ads!!,
Yeh def. Not gonna pay for news? I have newspapers and free apps. Goodbye,
Fast.. no problems. Good app. LG ally,
"Reliable,good video,up to date.",
Absolutely fantastic app!,
Biased content,
Update is very buggy! Come on NYT!!,
Good news app.,
Broken and a paywall? See Ya,
Love it on tmobile G2.,
Not really free! Most of the articles require a $3.75 per week subscription. Get your news somewhere else.,
Willing to pay... but not that much.,
Great app!,
Great app!,
Ads very intrusive,
awesome update!,
Hung my samsung galaxy s android,
The best in the world...,
Love it!!! Droid X,
Subscription? Good bye NYTimes,
"Always runs in background, why? Nice app however.",
Doesn't work on Wifi? Seriously?,
Best news app on the market,
BBC is free. Uninstalling,
Nice app... EVO,
Before you wait more than 600 hours to provide updates...and now a Paywall? No thanks. Installed !,
Its a good app TJ,
Good app runs smooth,
Lost a previously loyal user,
Love getting my news from this,
So far so good,
"Seems like it has potential, but on my device (Samsung Intercept) the font is tiny, even on the Huge setting.",
Video and audio not synced?? Big let down,
Instantly FC's,
crap! !,
Great!!,
Charge me? Shame on you.,
Awesome app.,
Nice update.,
Great app.,
A paywall? Really? Lame. No thanks.,
Will not load any stories at all. Have reinstalled 2 or 3 times. Only ads load. Am giving up for now. HTC magic.,
They want u to pay? How about no!!!,
"Used to be my fav news app & widget. Now you have to pay, and it's buggy as heck? No way. Uninstalled.",
"So long, NYT!",
Why not build a better mobile website?,
Needs mobility to sd!,
Wish it would self refresh every few hours. I use the app most when im in the subway and you cant use the internet down there!,
LOVE IT.,
"Paying for ads? Yeah, no.",
Awful app,
Keeps crashing,
Slow on g1,
"Your ""upgrade"" runs like molasses and force closes constantly...and I'm a print subscriber! I sure wouldn't pay for this. Uninstall!",
"Text is so small on my galaxy that I can't read articles. Also, no sharing feature like on iphone!?!",
Why does it need my location?,
"Pay for the news?? In this day and age. Hardly likely. Fair thee well NYT, I'll look elsewhere for now on.",
shame on you,
An amazing app,
I enjoy the writing,
"Used to have my students use to check the news...cannot expect them to pay to do classwork, can I?",
Paying for news? Nope.,
Charging? No thank you!!,
Have to pay? Uninstalling. There are other apps that let me view as many articles as I want from MULTIPLE sources...for free.,
"Pay? Hahaha, no.",
"Paywall faiiiil. Why is ""most emailed"" at the bottom of the list of sections? Why can't I hide sections? Why are there no background updates?",
Pay? No thanks... uninstalled,
If it's not free what's the point?,
Constant fc on motorola droid,
Can not be moved to SD,
Have to keep remembering to refresh,
Pay subscription service? Uninstalled.,
Very easy on Galaxy,
Paywall ... Nuff said.,
It could be better,
Great news app,
No way. Time for NPR.,
"Need, not want.",
Great app,
text too small.,
Paywall and uninstall.,
Didnt update,
Not worth paying for,
good app,
Asking too much.,
Should be for free!,
Slow,
Good,
Fantastic,
Terrible,
I in joy read it,
Perfect,
"Force closes for any reason even if i havent used the app all week. FC for reboot, system update or the sun rise. Have to reinstall to use.",
Not paying for that....,
Paywall ... uninstall,
I dont mind paying for content. However that doesnt mean an arm and a leg. Plus i get Nyt free in print thru school. App is more buggy paid then free,
The begining of the end...,
Paid subscription is now mandatory. Does this eliminate ads? It will cost over $150 per year (with no printing costs),
"I'd bet that the subscription was in their sights from the onset: like credit cards and drugs, first get your users hooked, then start charging.",
Can there be more than three people who will actually pay for the NYT? I think I'll open up a little memory...uninstall.,
"There is no 'update all sections' setting. When you view each newspaper section, there is a long wait. Thus, browsing the paper takes forever.",
WTF!!! Uninstall,
Everything i asked for.,
o0on g omon,
Use it everyday.,
"Works well on galaxy s phone. Foue stars because I tried to force close it to save on battery but it won't respond, still running in the background.",
Don't update,
Pocket NYT.,
Uninstalled. Period.,
Screw the upgrade,
Not paying,
Will not pay,
the paper subscription is cheaper,
Paywall...,
Not paying,
no to paying,
Too many ads,
Paywall.,
Goodbye,
Ok,
Paywall,
AaZ,
App2sd,
App2sd,
The app never crashed on me. And I like how it cashes things so you can read offline. Widget is bad. No move to SD option.,
Excellent news feed. Read it every day on my way to work. The only problem is that the app icon isn't showing up as the newyork times logo.,
Every 5 days i have to reinstall because it quits working. What a pain. Will someone fix this glitch please.,
"This app went from first to last with this latest update. Takes too long to update the news and it costs money. Horrible, NYT....",
"Gives you NYT, but refreshes slowly and offers no advantage over the web site that I can see.",
Doesn't FC like the last version on n1 but there are still some random freezes while scrolling through articles. Its getting there though.,
"Dl'd app just to use occasionally for important news, but often find it running in bkgrd while reducing apps w. a task mgr. despite never opening app.",
Finally works blazing fast. Though i'm still missing option to save/fav article like on the iphone,
I could ignore ads if new version worked! Updating sections fails to work most of time--when you want a recipe you get an article on Korea instead!,
"Love its smooth interface. Really wish I could sync multiple selected sections in a single click for offline reading, wish for scheduled updates!",
I hope to be able to pay money for this app soon - I want to support the nytimes for being such a huge part of my daily android life!,
"Works perfectly on Desire HD with froyo. Great news app, 2nd only to News Pro. 5 stars if it had more world news & integrated Twitter sharing",
Its great when it works! It keeps not opening so i have to reinstall it. Needs glitch fixes,
"I LOVE the app, but it only works for about a day before the installation crashes and my only option is to uninstall and reinstall",
This was a great app until latest update. Now it force closes upon start. Please fix this soon. Nexus One on Froyo.,
Was fantastic before these ugly colorful animated ads! I understand the need but make them tasteful.,
Awesome app. Works very well. Few suggestions to improve it further. Reorder sections. Mark sections as favorites - which are updated automatically.,
"Have never been able to open it, even after deleting app and downloading it again. Seems I am not the only one having problems with this.",
GREAT AP. Even stores most recent stories (10+) on phone so when I'm traveling in an airplane I can catch up on all the articles w/o service or wi-fi,
This is by far the best newspaper one... people have un realistic expectations. Must install,
"Why remove support for larger screen for Galaxy Tab in the last update, just stupid!! Uninstalling...",
"C'mon NYT, you can make an app that actually handle screen rotation correctly.",
I dont need the NY Times bad enough to deal w/ all the ads. Galaxy S Fascinate/Droid X..uninstalled on both devices!!,
So slow. Takes 5 min for an article to load. Sucks.,
"Smart, surprising,thorough,courageous does good sells glitz life.s cunundrum",
"LOVE IT !!! The new update works well on my Hero, the videos are of high quality.",
"Simple, reliable, effective. Background update would be nice. Motorola Droid v1",
"Very unresponsive in galaxy s, uninstalling",
"One of the great apps I've ever had ,off does what it says.",
Widgets keep me up to date on topics I want to read up on.,
"A major improvement on earlier versions, highly recommended!",
Ads really interrupt viewing content.,
Cool idea but font too small to be legible even at huge setting. Uninstalling,
It's okay for mytouch 3g it's better with my ipod touch.,
It was nice when it was free. They are getting money from ads and from u,
Finally. Froyo update. Works great! Android on HTC HD2!,
Love this app. Don't care for the widget,
More stars if a changelog is provided.,
"Nice app, great newspaper",
One of my favorite apps.,
Needs option to move to SD card.,
Takes well over a minute to update articles everytime it is opened. Galaxy S.,
"Great app, thanks NYT!",
Love the Times. Even if I'm in Ohio!,
Keeps switching/ scrolling down pages on its own. What gives? Tmobile G2,
Too stupid for words.,
Works great on my Droid-X w/ Froyo.,
Like the news articles that's listed...keeps ya in the know.,
Keeps u up to date:),
"Simple, smart, brilliant.",
Needs color and a nav bar like usatoday,
"Why the hell is it called ""for android phone"" what other os could it be made for? Its on the android market!",
Can't view SUBsections.,
Much better now,
Force close on Samsung,
Great writers,
Great app,
Great,
Great,
I like it.,
Use it everyday,
Ok,
"Crashes in NYC transit tunnels, offline, but that is where you want to use it... It locked up my Droid. Scheduled update would be great.",
"For an app that basically downloads text, this is very very slow. It constantly stalls. I love the content but similar apps are 4x faster.",
"Great app, but I wish you could read more articles from the past. But more importantly I wish a changelog would be posted",
"Works, good content, cached articles are useful. Force closes ocassionally, crashed the system once, sometimes articles are not the same once opened.",
"Content is good, if you can get it to work --Samsung Captivate. Sloooow update & crash, almost unusable.",
Worked great but recently stopped updating...developer please fix,
Worked ok on Eclaire but crashes often on Froyo.,
Slow updating. Crashes when pressing about. Using samsung captivate.,
Worst responsiveness of any developer.,
Expected a real app. Designed by a baby.,
Horrrrrrrrrible!!!!! Force closes CONSTANTLY on the Evo... The old version was better,
Won't load on droid2. Pity.,
Crashes with the new update- HTC Evo:(,
Stopped updating current news: :(,
"Please update the contents in background. When I open this in subway, I can't read news because it tries to update only when opened.",
great app,
Could it be anymore buggy?,
Nice,
"I can't read anything, the font is too small even set as 'huge'. Too bad. Htc wildfire.",
Latest update fraught with force closes.. HTC Incredible.,
"The app works great, ads are unobtrusive and the articles are long, detailed and thoughtful.",
You had to add the ads NYTimes? Really? Uninstalled. I have yet to find a news app that's better than the huffington post one.,
"Great when it works, but force quits constantly.",
"Doesn't remember scroll position, otherwise great",
Love the content but crashes far too often,
Latest update has begun to FC when no data connection. Epic 4G,
Works perfectly in the Dell Streak,
force close!!!! nexus one.,
Force close when no signal,
"It's a great app, but the update has bug. When the screen orientation changes the articles go back to the beginning, frustrating",
"Great interface for reading articles. However, it crashes randomly on my Evo (2.2) with a message saying the application force quit unexpectedly.",
As a long time new york times reader I was hoping for more from this application like access to social features (times people).,
"I like it, but i do think the ui could be a little better. But overall a very good news app. Alot of different catagories, and alot of news.",
"Great newspaper, terrible app. Page scrolling locks up constantly. You'll need plenty of patience to read the Times on an Android phone.",
The app has one bug - when you change screen orientation the article jumps to the top instead of remembering the current position - quite annoying,
"Does tend to stop updating, and my guess about location is just that they want reader data. Because if you read the times your probably liberal.",
App to SD would give it 5 stars. There is NO excuse for a big time app like the NYTimes not to offer this capability.,
"New York Times plummets further into obscurity with this ridiculous app that crashes every time I try to read an article. Way to go, losers...",
Essentially good app but sometimes keeps crashing when the connection is slow. Bug reported and when it's fixed it deserves 5 stars,
"Made my Samsung Vibrant crash all the time. If it wasn't force-closing, my phone ran really slow due to the app constantly running in the background.",
"I won't even touch the update based on others experiences. 5 stars when you get it together. Black widget and app too, please.",
"All news apps should aspire to be like this NYT app. Simple, but smart. I feel like I'm thumbing thru the actual paper. Would pay for it.",
Content is excellent. Only reason it doesn't get five stars us that the program stalls way too often making it impossible to scroll sometimes.,
Slow. Crashes nexus. Each section needs to be synched individually. Must use mobile site until this app is refined.,
I gave up on this laggy app. The delay in being able to interact with the articles was unbearable. Using Captivate here.,
"LG Ally, i get to use it once or twice, then it crashes and never opens again. So buggy",
"Gotta love the NY Times. Loads fast, great news provider available now all the time through this app. Galaxy S.",
Great app and widget. Lets me keep up with all the NYT stories anywhere. Much faster than using the browser. Moto Droid,
Hangs randomly esp. while loading images. HuffPost doesn't do that. Swipe to change article confuses with scrolling. Rotating jumps to top of article.,
Works great for what it is-access to the New York Times. I have never experienced any issues.,
"Well worth installing, be good if could set a time for it to update like the guardian app, as currently have to open all the sections I want to read.",
"Amazing content, but app isn't on par with iphone's. Everytime I put the phone down for a second it loses track of where I was. It crashes frequently.",
"Worked for one day, now just force closes upon opening. Find another news app.",
"Extremely slow. Can't update whole paper, just one section at a time. Was one of my favorite iphone apps, but it sucks on android. -galaxy s",
"Prefer the NYT mobile site bc you can see all sections at once, vs. having to go to different sections in the app. However, app works fine.",
"Great widget, does what a widget does. NYT content is great, nice to see someone is actually still writing news articles out there. N1",
"Like other droid incredible users, I can't open the application in my list of apps. Only way to open it is thru the market applications, downloads.",
"Truly frustrated by the delayed response to touch screen requests I.e. scrolling, in either portrait or landscape mode. Samsung Captivate",
"Font size was perfect on Android 1.6 on Sanyo Zio. Now on Android 2.2 Samsung Intercept, font is barely legible even when set to huge.",
"Needs search, and ability to update all sections at once. Too much work to get days articles for subway, with no wireless access",
"Crashes on load, feed refresh and feed change over HSDPA, EDGE and 3G but not Wifi in France (ex: Technology to Latest) HTC Desire Froyo / Virgin Mob.",
Decent app. It needs stability improvements and the ability to automatically download articles. Or at least a way to update all the sections at once.,
"One of worlds finest newsapers. Take the time to read it and its opinion pieces. This is what ""Fair and Balanced"" is about.",
Great application. My only problem is that the NYT is so biased towards whatever the State Department wants. Still 5 stars for the app.,
"New app has hidden charges, & uses all your cache ruining your phone's performance. NYT is unethical. Nothing I say could tell how bad this app is!",
Stories constantly freeze while you try to read them. Too many force closes. Almost useless. Samsung Vibrant.,
"Great articles, but app needs fix- scrolling & sliding both freeze for a minute or so. Frustrating, would b gr8 if it worked properly. Galaxy S",
excellent reporting. Don't see why an online subscription doesn't get you app access,
"Doesn't always have most current news that's on the nyt website, also app is generally sluggish when loading pages even on wifi. Vibrant",
Uninstall / reinstall solved the problem of the app not starting after the droid os upgrade. LG Ally,
Works on moto droid. Only complaint is that if you click on an article right after opening it up and before it updates the app wipes the artlcle out,
Doesn't work with my LG Ally. I have to reinstall all the time. But when it works it's a really good app.,
"No working properly since most recent droid ally lg software update. Forecloses, runs sl Please fix! I used to read it every night.",
Really like this app. Sometimes lags or closes by itself or would have given it 5 stars.,
Definitely a right winger. But this a great app. Especially for general information. Also pretty fair reporting . Give it 5 stars.,
"Often gets unresponsive, and when it updates, you don't always knows what the new stuff is. But it does serve content from NYT, which is awesome.",
"Great application and journalistic content. For it.to be divine just add a ""change black and white"" feature, so it will consume even less battery. 5*",
Good when it works but that doesn't happen a lot. Lots of fc's. Looks and feels Like a quick and dirty iPhone port. Samsung i7500 on 1.6,
"Subscribers should be able to log in and search and read the full archives, like on the website. That would encourage subscription too.",
"Disappointed. Loved the iPhone app, but this one doesn't seem to connect to your NYT account and no way to save articles. Unless I'm missing something",
Lagged at times and generally content is better on the huffington app. Good but not great.,
It is a good app. Provides nice content from NY times. Problem is it crashes a lot. HTC EVO,
Slow article updates. Navigation through articles results in many stutters and stalls. World class newspaper needs a better app.,
I have had to reinstall at least 5 times. Grrrr. Love the journalism. Annoyed by the app.,
"After reading comments, it seems i dont want to update, great app for my platform! G1 donut Wuupdate 2020! LOLOLOL! G1 DONUT! I recall thinking that was the coolest thing. And it was. A decade ago! SG20-5G is epic. Don't want the Times, sorry. I just wanted to laugh at time!",
Each day I have to uninstall and reinstall the app because it force closes. Very annoying,
I can't get it to work on galaxy s. Have installed many times and not once has it worked. What a disappointment.,
"Very good download. Would be great if it provided an option to select which sections we wish to download. Still, recommended.",
Frequent crashes - two section widgets on my home screen.,
"Sleek well designed news app. However sometimes content is lacking, and updating news can take a long time. Vibrant",
"After updating, would not open again after several different attempts. Biz",
Loved using this app but refuse to pay for something that I can get for free elsewhere.,
It's a good app but for some reason it fails and has to be uninstalled and reinstalled about every 10 days. LG Ally.,
"Great to have easy access to the Times! Sometimes app hangs, restarting app doesn't help unless I end it first. Using DroidX",
Love the app! But i have to continue to uninstall and re install and i hate it! Urgghhh but its great!,
"Used to love this app, but it no longer works on my LG Ally since the latest system update. Please fix!!",
Very good app But this app is a real hog as it uses 4 megs of memory. Please move it to sd or I will uninstall.,
One of the first apps re-installed when changed from iphone to android.,
"App would get 5 stars, but have to reinstall every couple days due to force close issues...droid ally",
"App itself is great, even after the paywall but the current iteration seems to cache 10MB of data at launch. Needs to be fixed!",
"Good app, but fix the latest update. Had to uninstall and reinstall since icons no longer linked to program (I had to go through market to open it).",
Please reboot your phone if this app won't run from program screen! It will fix the issue,
"Great app, loads quickly with wifi or 3G, text size not a problem for me. Droid X",
Ditto on the LG Ally problems. Keep having to reinstall after power down. Pls fix. Love this app!,
"After update, error msg says the app is no longer installed. HTC Eco. Fix this!",
I enjoy NYT journalism but this app is persistent constantly running in the background. Uninstalling until fixed.,
I love the ny times but this hasn't yet loaded or connected on my samsung galaxy s...,
Persistant forced closures on N1 Froyo. Please fix! I've emailed you twice!,
"Good, but I wish that the widget would cycle through news headlines without having to press the buttons.",
"I like the content but the app has performance issues and even crashes from time to time. Slow, stuttery scrolling and page turns. Cache the data!",
Great app. Love that it downloads the stories up front so I can keep reading when I don't have service (i.e. on the train).,
"There's something wrong with the app, it's sluggish and I can't zoom in to read. Will uninstall.",
"Still the best newspaper in North America -- but a very disappointing app on android, a total battery vampire, background service is way out of line.",
Misses five stars because it grinds to a halt fairly regularly. Otherwise great!,
"Great app! Clean, easy to use, and informative; it's nice to get quality print news without the hassle of carrying around a paper.",
"Good news source, but the widgets always force close on my 2.1 galaxy s.",
Great app but when phone goes through power cycle need to reinstall. LG Ally 2.1 update 1.,
"Great app, thanks for the update! Fixed force close issue on cdma HTC Desire 2.1.1",
One of androids very best news apps. Well done!,
"Looks like it has grown and matured over time. Much smoother and better than last time i tried it, 6 months ago. Thumbs up!",
Great. I'm glad they fixed the slow update issue,
"Attractive app style, but takes a ridiculous amount of time to update feed, even with wifi. (Mytouch 3G)",
*Ally* app will unexpectedly stop working and will have to reinstall every 3 days,
"Great app, love to use it. Wish there was a search feature and was able to leave comments on stories. Droid X",
Stops working on Ally after i use it 1-2 times. I had to re install everytime it stops working. Fix this please!,
"Very important these days to gather information from multiple reliable sources, NY Times is one I read regularly",
Very impressive app. It deserves a 5-star rating. It's got a great pull-down menu to switch between sections. Great widgets too!,
Its a good app. But no settings to adjust refresh frequency. There it is always running. And widget doesn't refresh. N1,
The app works fine aside from a bug that causes FC when you change categories. HTC Desire.,
Keeps needing to be reinstalled one of only 3 apps with issue,
"FC way to often. After last update, app wouldnt open until I trashed my icons & widget. Should include that in update notes!",
"New version won't download. Would subscribe to paid app, but it doesn't work.",
Everything is excellent except it should give a long swipe to switch between articles rather than easy swipe between articles in a particular section.,
No good. Super slow and freezes up a lot. Samsung Vibrant.,
"Super buggy, have to keep uninstall/reinstall. Overall a decent app with good interface.",
Crashes on about menu. App icon is basic Android icon and not NYT.,
"I've used this app with both the N1 and the Captivate. On both devises, this app had issues. Needs revamp...",
The new ads are so distracting!!!! Really disappointing. I'm going to uninstall and switch to the washington post.,
"Great app, stable, customizable and user friendly. Takes a bit of time to update articles though.",
Only downloads one section at a time. No good for subway reading.,
"Mostly a good app,a bit buggy in my Captivate though.",
"Was good but slow prof to the recent update, but works like a charm on the incredible.",
I like to change catagories just cause the menu is springy when it goes back up!,
"Good app, but please add an option to enlarge the font. It 's too small.",
Scrolling issues. Slow to update. Freezes occasionally. But good content!,
"Was fine before update. Now won't open, says not installed, but is. Wise up!",
Great app. Would be even better with an option to save articles offline for reading while commuting underground.,
"Fixed samsung galaxy s problem, works great now.",
Very good content but crashes Very often on HTC desire when using Orange 3g+ network,
Great app but has been force closing since last update! Evo.,
It would get five stars it's all sessions will update all at once,
"Apps2SD please. Only upcoming devices of HTC have more internal storage, which sucks for us. :(",
It works but i dont like the look. No transparency.,
"Needs ""fav article"" feature. And option for white text black bg. Also have repetitive articles. Ui is clean.",
Icon invoking not working even after rebooting as suggested on NYT/Android faq.,
Simply the best source of news. So easy to read on big Droid X screen. Has a wiget window. Could not live w/o it!!! Thanks NY Times,
A paper with a Political agenda. Pretty good apparently but forcecloses my galaxy s. Uninstall.,
Updating takes ages. Problem with scrolling. Content is of good quality.,
Update is fantastic. Snappy. Previous version was kludgy and buggy.,
Most articles are abit too long to read on a mobile phone. Maybe nytimes can have condensed articles more suited for a mobile phone app?,
Please fixe the force close!! I can not believe it stayed like this for so long already....,
"The highest quality news application on android, best video quality. Highly recommended.",
What is with the constant malfunctions with this app? I have had to uninstall and install it like five times now.,
Unable to control or zoom. text size on Droid X.,
A great example of a near-perfect showcase Android app.,
"Force closes consistently on Desire since last update. Pity, was good...",
Being able to read the articles with no signal is great in the subway.,
"This is a great app, but i have to reload it every cpl days! Please fix!",
Very well designed application. The new version loads articles very quickly too.,
Use it almost every day. The full nyt for free! Droid incredible,
Don't install and waste time. Read in NYTimes mobile site. It's more rich than this.,
"Nice idea, but it doesn't show the full article or even link to the full article.",
Great. Thanks for adding offline reading. Riding the train is fun again. All the best!,
Loved it before last manual updatenow it won't load. I guess I will be reinstalling,
New updated version has no back or home button to go back to start page. Oops.,
very good but needs a night reading mode with black background.,
Update = more annoying ads,
If you don't like the NYTimes then you're probably retarded,
App is about as good as the paper except I can't start a fire with it.,
Couldn't be easier to browse the times. EVO 2.2,
Great and easy to use. Search news by subject and read high quality articles!,
Beautiful native app. Updates very quickly now and articles load very fast. Love it to pieces.,
"Don't update!No Changelog= snake. Doesn't remember scroll position. Can't see Read from Unread. Laggy! News=good,App=so-so Wish was like the BBC app!",
If night mode or dark background could be added that would be great.,
After update getting apply not found on phone error. Htc Hero,
Early problems fixed--works like a charm now!,
Doesn't update on HTC incredible anymore.,
1.2 very buggy. Can't select new sections from drop down menu. N1,
Excellent app. Fc's a lot though. Had to reinstall after latest update on Droid.,
"I love this app, it's great and for a young teacher and recent college graduate, free is fabulous! Htc hero",
Cant open on my Ally anymore. Used to love it!,
Doesn't work. Always force close,
This would be a great app but font on samsung intercept is too small,
Up to date news for my pleasure. Thank you!,
Its a pretty good apparently but it takes up to much space,
Latest version completely stopped working on my HTC Desire. Why is there Apple app so much better?,
Wants permissions no news reader should need. DIAF NYTimes!,
Love it. Use it everyday on my htc evo. Couldn't do without it!,
Keeps crashing before it loads anything,
Buggy and doesn't work half the time,
One of the best news sources on the internet - good stuff.,
I loved this app. Stopped working after OS upgrade on LG Ally. Is an update planned?,
Great design. Quick to load. Take that CNN! droid x,
Its crashed 3x on my phone...whats wrong with it? I've unistalled and reistall but it just keeps crashing.,
New version is quite buggy. HTC Hero,
"not updating, even after reinstalling.",
Content comes up quickly & runs smoothly.,
The font is not big enough,
Won't open anymore on my Evo. It says its not installed :(,
Great app. Much better than the mobile site.,
Needs way more functions.. cache more than one section to start..,
Love my NYTimes! On samsung moment.,
"Thanks for the update, works great.",
"Feels like I'm reading a newspaper, and the content is excellent",
I was really impressed with the load times. This app is fast,
Wont open anymore on my mytouch!! Only force closes,
FC on N1 with froyo. Plop! UPDATE: No more FCs with the update :-) Thank you!,
Please add move to SD card option for Droid,
This is the best news reader I have used.,
Much better now that landscape mode on Incredible is fixed.,
I really like the swipe left/right to change article,
The updates on this app suck major balls. Refund!!,

It keepsake foreclosing on Sony-Ericdson... uninstalled,
"A solid app, and the best headlines.",
"FCs a lot, but is otherwise great.",
Great app + useful widget...must have! US newspaper of record.,
Every time I restart my phone I have to reinstall this app (LG Ally),
Needs to have 'Save to Favourites' just like its iPhone version.,
Very good. Works well on Galaxy Tab at 1024x600,
its really good at up to date motorola droid 2.0,
Please add SD card capability.,
Works much faster after update.,
"Great journal, good app. Vibrant",
Agree with others. Force close on Droid X for widget since last update,
Wont stay installed. Font size too small for older eyes. Going back to browser access.,
"Perfect, very fast under 2G",
seems to be working again. Htc incredible,
"Works well, love the Times!",
Great app and good source of news.,
Ads destroyed it. Uninstalled. N1,
"Its the New York Times. So ask this question as you read; ""I wonder if that's true?"" Take it or leave it.",
Disappointing UI. Better off with the Web.,
Pretty good but i use newsroom now,
Good app gets the info I like,
Love the widget. Works great on mytouch,
Why does this app need permission to make phone calls? Is it going to turn on my networking device without permission?,
"Runs in the background, uninstall and using usa today instead.",
Love it. Great application. Evo 4G,
Great when it works. Starting to force close a lot.,
App is ok but drains battery in background. Uninstalled. Captivate.,
A solid mobile version of the paper,
Cannot disable background service,

Just installed. Working beautifully. HTC evo,
Awesome! Ten stars! Fantastic widget too.,
Very simple and easy to use.,
"Very smooth, thank you. Didn't read any of it before. Now I do... ;-D",
Good app but only 3 stars because app uninstalled itself twice already...what gives?,
"Kills my battery, great content tho",
"Had to uninstall, kept force closing on x10",
"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.",
Lmbo! $4 a week for digital info??? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Get Pulse and let these greedy OWMs die! NYTimes SUCKS... nuff sed.,
This and a cup of coffee starts my day.,
Great app works great :),
Lots of good quality content.,

Good but limited options.,
Needs to be reinstalled every time phone is powered down. Very poor support for the app.,
"Great, love offline mode",

"Seems faster since update. No issues, yet. Vibrant.",
this program is too slow!! takes too long to load...,
Great app. Moto droid,
Constantly running in the background. uninstalling until fixed,
Waiting for auto overnight download of the morning edition.,
So slow. So very very,
Have to keep reinstalling on my ally. What's up? Used to love it.,
Force close on HTC tattoo even after reinstall.,
Doesn't work anymore...,
It is slow!,
Rather slow when updating sections,
Why is this copy protected? I need to move it to my sd to save space.,
Excellent. Sometime goes into 'Foreclosue'.,
Why does this application need access to users' phone calls?,
The widget always crashes,
My favorite commie newspaper,
Only opens new version after clean install. HTC Hero,
Great news app.,
Awesome app!,
Works great!,
Not good.,
Force closes every time! What happened? Used to work!,
Great app!,
It's a good read,
Cant move to sd,
Love the new update.,
Outstanding coverage and detail.,
Paid subscription? Fail! Uninstall!,
It's the good.,
No Best Seller List!!?? Please add!!,
Excellent program!,
Needs a little work...,
Love it!,
Love it!,
Best news app evah,
I LOVE THE NYTIMES,
Works great on droid x,
Why do you need my phone calls and identity?,

Cool!,
Simplistic and convenient. DXFL.,
Great job.,
Great app.,
Good app.,
"After setting font to huge, many articles still too small to read. Xperia X10 Mini droid 1.6",
Great!,
Love it. LOVE.,
Works great...,
Why does it need to read my phone call status?,
"Been waiting for this, but I'll stick with the mobile web site. This isn't there yet. Keep working on it and I'll keep installing the updates.",
"Force-closes at every launch. Re-installed twice, still happening. (HTC Desire, Android 2.1)",
Love it no probs,
Great news app,
Keeps me in the know,

Upgrade no longer works from icon a little QA NYT?,
Great,
Love it,
Doesn't update.,
Search option?,
Won't update,
Won't load,
Ads suck.,
"After I just instlld the new update, it won't allow me to open the app. I can't make a shortcut or open it from the orig app.I hve HTC Incrd. Plz fix.",
"With the update, I can't access the app through my programs anymore. I have to come through the Market. Droid Inc. How to fix? Edit: re-boot fixed it",
Super buggy.,
Slown to refresh,
Not functional,
Eavannz,
Wwww,
Ok,
Some ppl have a habit of criticizing every app. in the market. This is one heck of an app and doesn't deserve anything less than five stars.,
"Takes extremely long to load, often crashes. NYT app worked better on my old iphone 3G. Shameful work developers",
"Originally worked tolerably well on Motorola Droid, but now alternately fails to update or crashes. Tried reinstalling but still no luck.",
One thing I could ask is able to browse sections similar to stories. It is difficult to pull menu. Reuters app allows that.,
"It's pretty solid. Flipping side to side is nice once your in a story. I've set up different widgets for different content, too.",
"I can never update because updates dont work with appstosd. Doesnt install from the market either, Geat rid of constant update reminder please!",
It's a joke. I cant get a refreshed page. The amount of force closes is ridiculous. And the articles sometimes dont even load.,
"I really like it. It has crashed a few times, but overall it's a good app and makes reading the BUT enjoyable.",
Earned my daily interaction as a goto news app. Beats AP News app on Android - Ironically similar to BB version of AP News. Excellent coverage of news,
"A newspaper app has absolutely no need to know my location, since there's no location based content. Smells fishy. Uninstalling until they address. N1",
Latest version crashes constantly when off network. I believe it's related to ad serving. Wish they had tested this thing.,
Force closes on HTC desire on first refresh without fail. Otherwise would have been 5 stars. Really annoying.,
Can't even use because of all the force closes. The app has potential so I'll give it a few days to see if they update,
"Great content, but poor interface. Refreshes only in foreground, article selection is often wonky and so on.",
"I like it a lot, but I think the USA Today app looks better. The NY Times looks kind of plain. But its useful.",
"Steven and Pilot25, if the NYT leans a bit too far to the ""left"" for you, maybe the drivel that Fox calls ""news"" might suit you better.",
"Nice app starting to catch up to the iPhone app. My family all grew up reading it, we are of a wide spectrum of polital veiws and the Times is great!",
A magnificent app from the world's finest name in news. A must have for anyone who intends to keep their finger on the pulse of America and the world.,
Great app! Very user friendly browsing and the categories gives me something I cant get from the browser. Best news app on the market.,
"Does what it says - why would one need NY Times in Asia we are enough news allteady, but good to read for a change - I keep it X10 Sony",
All articles of a section are cached for offline reading when opened online. But you have to open each section you want to read before you go offline.,
"By far one of my favorite apps, saves articles from last update. I read this on the train all the time. Thanks to the developers.",
"Great reading material to catch up on current events, I like the usatoday app better tho for shorter stories.",
Slow to go from one section to another. Add a way for updating all selected sections simultaneously will be perfect.,
I don't like having to manually update news. And it forces quit everytime. I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times.,
"Leah, there is a real estate section. Just hit the options button on your phone, hit sections, and scroll down to it.",
"On app launch, it automatically starts updating articles for the last section viewed and the updates are insanely slow. Will stick to reading via RSS.",
bad lag when first opening for around 45 sec till all pages are cached. on Samsung captivate 2.1,
Force closes on my nexus one with froyo. Please fix asap. It worked before the update. Now it crashes.,
Great. Like that it pre downloads news content so I can still view it even if I have no signal. Need ability to copy/paste,
"main news page has adverts for home delivery that you can't close, taking up valuable screen real estate . Might as well use mobile site.",
"It is okay. Sometimes the stories are out of date, even when it refreshes. Would be nice if it worked in landscape mode!",
"Great content of course, but a poorly designed, misfiring UI. Extremely slow downloading compared to other similar media apps.",
Extraordinarily slow to update; would give five stars if I didn't gain a few gray hairs just waiting on it. Get the Newspapers app. Worth the $$.,
UI hangs for several seconds while loading data. Overall a good clean app though.,
"A snappy, mobile incarnation of the real deal. Updates rapidly and provides the user with alternatives to Faux News. EVO 4G",
Looks nice but I thought the point of this would've been to get automatic delivery of news while charging phone overnight to save battery life.,
"Looks great, easy to navigate, loads faster than the website and has all the articles I want. It runs perfectly on my Moto Droid, love this app!",
"Again, only after a day of operating smoothly the app. is not updating. NYT should really make a commitment to keeping this app functional.",
"Fantastic app, only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no search and posting to Facebook doesn't work. Otherwise, its great",
"One of my fav. apps for android. Droid stick. Oh, and dont complain an app is fcing if you have a custom rom on your phone and give 1 star.",
"Requires too many permissions, sometimes won't update properly, mobile set is better.",
It's good but really needs better update and offline reading functions especially for use on the subway. Cumbersome to update section by section.,
"Love the app and the widget only problem is the widget doesn't update when I have selected latest news category, but this an otherwise flawless app.",
"Brilliant. Independent developers take note, this is how you make a news app. Please someone make an RSS reader like this with the pulldown as feeds.",
Froyo just came out. Expect stuff to break and give app developers time to retool.,
UK Vodaphone HTC Magic 1.6 OS. Slick to use but frequent crashes when changing sections.,
Good app. I wish the newspaper wasn't so overly liberal though.,
Broken: FC on Moto. Droid. 2.2. AND you should have been transparent and told us what u updated in 1.1,
Hardly useful without a prescription. Garbage for anything other than a few headline articles per day.,
"FC, Froyo/Nexus One. And needs an awful lot of permissions for a news app.",
Now force closes on Froyo. Could use some NYT multimedia support/love and lose the slide menu bounce animation.,
"v1.1: article refresh painfully slow, only refreshes 1 section at a time, refresh isn't in background so locks up UI",
10 mins after I unplug my phone a quarter of my battery is drained. Halfway through my day my phone is dead becuase of this app. Useless!,
For some reason it seems to keep starting by itself in the background eating up battery life.,
"Prettiest news reader I've seen, recent update seems to have solved the data update problem.",
"Careful with this one. It will be free at first, then they will ask you to pay *cough*ripoff*cough*",
"Decent, but NYT is untrustworthy and decitful. So, not worth having mind polluted.",
"Support for Orientation added in V1.2, but ... poor menu options. See NY Daily News app for example of a well designed newspaper reader.",
"Love that it caches whole sections, perfect app for subway riders. A little glitchy and laggy, could use update all button and landscape mode but nice",
Works perfectly on my Nexus One running Android 2.2. Enhancements I wish: Move to SD card. All categories update. Flip categories like news items,
app is too slow to use preferentially over the mobile web site. Needs update all sections option and needs option to update periodically in background,
"Get the cbs news app it is much better! You get video, weather, high definition pictures, more updated stories and its free!",
This would be a 5-star app if they smoothed out the story updating process.,
"This app is great, i really use the Automobile section. And the whole thing is just, great.",
Did not work on my Samsung Intercept. Had to use CNN instead.,
Thanks for the update! Back to 4 stars. 5 stars if you fix the font sizing- huge is not huge at all... Droid incredible,
"Great app, but useless since new feed ceased to update for the past few days.",
"Good but not great, even before the update problems began. Please fix.",
"Best news app, love the interface. 5 stars when i can share stories via facebook. (Skyfire browser)",
Very good app. Will be great if it has settings and 1-click multiple section download.,
"Excellent coverage, eye-pleasing interface. Wish it would update in the background and allow landscape reading.",
Has problems updating sometimes. Should have an auto update and manual update feature please.,
"So excited to have a New York Times app, simply the best paper around. 1.1 works great. (Nexus One)",
Force closes repeatedly for me today on Froyo. Was working OK before. Now unusable.,
"Nice idea, but poorly programmed. Will be great once polished and stabilized.",
App could be performing better. Ui sometimes slow. Content is great. Legend,
"Not being able to view in landscape is kind of meh. Otherwise nice, simple, and functional.",
"Tends to stop updating, and force updates doesn't always work.",
My favorite: it downloads many of the top articles so I can read when underground with no signal.,
Required a hard reset to fix my phone after install. Not worth installing.,
Latest version fixes update problems... back in my favorite apps list!,
was my favorite before even it showed old news a lot but the new update is a disaster！F/C every time i touch it. fix please! milestone,
"Hate fox, hate Merdoxk, but good reporting and great android centered nav",
"Force closes when disconnected, useless for reading offline. N1 2.2",
It was working great so I'll give it a good score. But it stopped updating two days ago. What gives?,
Does not work on tattoo at all. No updates from developer..,
Widget doesn't work. Will fix rating when you fix the app,
Why are people saying that this app force closes? This apps runs great on my froyo nexus and if it doesn't work on urs then get a better phone,
Slow on N1 with Froyo 2.2. Please improve the user experience,
Not bad on my phone.. runs quick and smooth unlike others experiences. Galaxy-vibrant,
"Nice app, but I wish I didn't find it running in the background all the time.",
NYT highlights on my droid in rural SW Virginia. Now I can impress neighbors with my cosmopolitan knowledge.,
Moment 2.1 - Updates a tad slowly but a good looking app nonetheless. Needs landscape mode though.,
Nice app. My only gripe is that the app slows to a crawl while updating.,
"Have a look at ""Guardian Anywhere"" to see how it should be done. Poor effort. At least its free. Use the website.",
"Mary ellen, is there any way you could specify why you've installed it to help us decide whether to download it or not? Thanks...",
Doesn't update and really doesn't offer anything the fantastic mobile site already has.,
"Convenient, but extremely slow to load and sometimes force closes.",
Eh. Mobile site is nicer. Uninstalled. And Ham the spammer is a tool,
Convenient app but don't see all the content like blogs that u see by using a web browser,
Great app. Nice full screen videos too. Wish there were more videos though. Droid incredible.,
The video loading takes time sometimes and the application closes the video. It should wait more,
Doesn't open straight to article from heading displayed in widget? Only opens the app to listing of articles. Am I doing this wrong?,
Force close on HTC Tattoo. Inconsistent program icons.,
I love using this without the hassle of a messy paper. Moto droid,
Excellent app! Has multiple sections and even a video section. Great way to keep up with what's going on in the world.,
Couldn't work on sonyericsson x10 mini. Always force close.,
Doesn't work on Froyo. Keeps force closing upon launch.,
Crashed phone multiple times. Put into boot loop. Uninstalled.,
Great except sometimes it doesn't downloads the most updated articles on milestone 2.1,
Nice app!.. Video outstanding on Moto Droid. Updates sometimes slow.,
Lags and freezes constantly on samsung vibrant. Virtually unusable,
"Decent app, confused about the permissions... its digging way deeper then a simple news feed needs 2....",
"Crashes all the time on eclair, samsung captivate.",
Thank you for doing this. I love reading The Times!,
This app is wonderful and the icon looks nice. Great job!,
"I gave it an extra star for a nice appearance, but it's VERY, VERY slow. Did I mention that it's slow? Well, it's slow. Basically froze up my Galaxy.",
No way to zoom with multi touch. Bit it's OK.,

"Slow, the pulldown to change the section rarely works. Uninstalling.",
I have better luck just loading the web page. Evo,

A newspaper app has no need for my location or phone identity!! UNINSTALLING! Force closes every time. Get it together NYT! Nexus One,

Constant FCs on my N1,
Force closing on froyo N1,
"Just installed, and the app says it updated 3 seconds ago, but the most recent news is all dated yesterday. Uninstalling. I don't need yesterdays news",
I hadn't used this app for a while. I go to open it - says update avail - I choose 'update later' .... It Force Closes That Very Second Every Time.,
Force close on 2.2,
FC on Droid 2.2,
A+,
Works well,
No app2sd,
Updating again,
Force closes,
Meh,
yercfr,
ref,
Q.rac,
Very disappointing. Simply a list of links to external web sites. They often open zoomed in or in the wrong area and cannot be zoomed - thus illegible,
Takes for ever to update feed and is unusably laggy while it does so. 4 now I'll continue to read the NYT through opera mini.,
A paid version to get rid of the ad at the bottom would be great. The UI could be tightened up to devote more screen realestate to the text.,
looks great but latest news update is broken.... It actually updated for me once then reverted to an earlier day edit still broken same latest news,
Awesome app. love the offline reading capability. would be awesome if u can batch reload the news for different sections all at once.,
Very good. The section drawer could use some work and should be able to get pulled up again though.,
"It's fast, but no landscape mode, and no clickable links in articles like What We're Reading make it kind of useless to me. I'll stick to the site.",
"Nice app. I would give it a 5 star rating if you guys fix the share feature, especially sharing to facebook.",
"Very good app for all news. Like the android style drop down and swipe to next or previous article. No fc, mt3g",
Lame. Cannot adjust text size. Display does not rotate. Their regular mobile website is much better than this app on Android.,
Occasional FC on motodroid. Wish I could set widget to show all news instead of a section. Awesome that I can swipe left/right for more stories,
so glad that the NYT came out with an app! Love the widget. Only wish I could read in landscape mode. - HTC Incredible,
"Awesome app, but I would like to save an article on the app, or to a favorites section. Other than that, it's great. Perfect for an avid Times reader.",
Annoying bug - widget updates with latest news headlines but main app does not update.,
"Great job guys. Clean, easy to read. Would be 5 stars but you need to optimize your update coding so refresh isn't so slow, and use so much ram.",
"More than just a port of their website like other newspaper apps are. Excellent video player, like the way the sections work. Keep it up, NYT",
"When i click the widget, the news updates a few seconds later, and all the links im interested in disappears, very annoying, not so useful",
"Though there is a choice of font sizes, even the largest is quite small. Otherwise, a very nice app. Works well on Moto Droid.",
Great app. But downgraded because news has not updated in almost a week,
"On motodroid, m.nytimes in browser is superior. App needs to do landscape mode, zoom on images, select/copy text, return to top of long stories.",
Great work. Love being able to scroll from article to article instead of being stuck in a world of one line summaries.,
"Love the amount of content but won't refresh, says updated moments ago but all news is 3 days old.",
The best news app available. USA Today and Fox can bite me.,
Id give it 5 stars if the view would rotate for slide-out phones (like the droid).,
"Nice, simple and quick just wat I wanted but why does it need services that cost me money",
This is the news app I've been waiting for. Facebook option does not work on Droid Incredible. Great otherwise.,
"Great layout, miserable performance. Too many force closes. Moto Droid",
"Freezes a lot while synching and no horizontal view, but otherwise solid",
"Good content and interface layout, but it runs slowly on my N1. I'll stick with the Google news widget.",
"Love the NY Times, but this app needs improvement. Plenty of FC's on Moto Droid. Good layout, and interface; lacks polish of USA Today app.",
Slow to update very unresponsive to touches. Im using g1 phone,
Very slow and keeps crashing.Would rather use the website.I expected better from NYT.,
"Has some fc issues if you get a little overzealous about scrolling to see more articles before it has finished refreshing, but otherwise, it's great.",
Like it if it would let me read it. Just fc constantly. N1 here.,
"Love that it stores a whole section of articles for reading out of service area, but needs auto-update scheduler! Also force closes on update lots.",
A news app should not need that many sensitive access rights. Suspicious,
"Constant force closes can be resolved if you just click Wait, but hasn't updated in two days now. Boy, can't wait for the NYT paywall...",
"Looks good, but currently suffers force closes on section change on Milestone. Look forward to the fix.",
"Love it. Great layout and navigation. Great content of course. Was fcing all the time, but running like a champ now",
"Frequent force close. Would like scheduled updates, widget link to article instead of section, download for offline reading.",
Excellent and very polished. The drop down menu was an nice touch. Any way future updates could include the timespeople feature from the website?,
"Force close on HTC Desire. Idea is there, but delivery falls short.",
Looks good and loads quickly. Would be five star with rotate and a working share on Facebook feature. (Eris 2.1),
Great when it works. Lags badly and force closes on Moto Droid frequently.,
"Great app! However, needs some type of loading animation when an article is clicked as well as landscape support. Droid Eris.",
Everything a news app should be. Kudos. However recently am having problem with opinion section updating.,
Nothing special no landscape mode which is disapointing but no fc - droid,
I prefer the mobile website to see new articles all on one page instead of separated by section. Droid Eris,
Would be awesome if it weren't constantly freezing. Uninstalling and going back to mobile web version.,
"Good information but lags on updates, needs to multithread better.",
FC twice. Plus slow. Good apparently if updated more often and problems fixed. Droid.....,
Brilliant first iteration. The navigation could be a little more polished but otherwise quite excellent.,
Great app. Would be 5 stars if it preloaded all sections when first opened. Still awesome.,
Best app on my phone. I would pay a subscription price for this. Thank you NYT!,
"Force closes a lot, but smooth simple design. Thank you for bringing to Android. Droid.",
Great idea but the sections aren't updating for me so all the news is old and outdated.,
Widgets aren't loading on my Incredible running LauncherPro Beta.,
Have to manually download each section. Useless for the subway.,
"Good app, but can't clear cache. App size keeps increasing after each use.",
Options seem limited. No close/exit feature.,
Good app but constantly force closes and the videos play with 3/4ths of the screen covered in green on Droid,
Rotated view would be great. If only UK papers had android apps!,
Good news content. But unstable. Force closes.,
"Finally, great first version. Add options to have landscape view and your good.",
freezes up and force closes often on my G1,
"Nice looking UI. However, this app force close when I switch to other section.",
Works great on incredible. Please add widget and landscape mode!!,
"Needs some improvement to be as good as iPhone, but getting there.",
"Sensitivity is pretty bad, always loading when just trying to scroll, and fc ALL the time, c'mon...ur the NY times, plz fix",
Great interface. I've had no force closes or other issues.,
"Lovely design, and just the right functionality. I am very happy with the app.",
Crash every time i tried to use it. HTC Tattoo,
Works great on n1. Wish other news apps were like this.,
Great app. Only wish I could read stories in landscape.,
Excellent app. Widget is great and customizable. The worlds best newspaper right at your fingertips.,
It's about time. Waiting for this too long!,
Will not update on my 2.1 Moto Droid. Dissapointing.,
"Force closure on my tattoo, gutted.",
Very pretty but slow and force closes often,
"Nice, fast, swipe enabled. Does not rotate according to screen orientation.",
"Finally! Love it, works very well on Incredible and Droid. Would love to see option to cycle headlines.",
Wow Jeff u think fox is good? You should have tried harder at school. Uneducated moron.,
Great writing but updating hangs on my N1.,
Doesnt work on htc tattoo.forces close,
Fabulous. So convenient and complete. No problems at all on Motorola Droid.,
"very nice, very clean app. landscape mode would be a plus.",
I like it does not update at all in my case... droid,
Slow and constantly crashes on moto droid,
Too slow even on a nexus one,
Always crashes at startup with htc tattoo,
Do not work on HTC tattoo,
A great app. Would give 5* if landscape mode is added.,
Works great. Love that nyt is on android now. Been waiting for this. Eris,
There is old news even after updating.,
Really slow and force closes too often.,
Been waiting on a NYT app for a while. It's awesome,
Very polished. Other developers should take notes.,
Great app. Needs auto refresh for select sections.,
Finally it's here awsome app no problems at all.,
"Nice first attempt. Would like to see less ui lag, and more settings. And no Landscape mode?? Seriously??",
Does not work on xperia. Poor app,
"Excellent, but needs to support landscape mode.",
Thanks for finally getting past the iPhone and expanding to new markets.,
"Nice interface, but doesn't update. Back to the browswer for NYT.",
Great news app and very fast and clean interface but a lack of options of any sort keeps this solid app from having 5 stars,
This is absolutely awesome - much better than going to the website,
Great start. Need to be able to update all & maybe an update schedule.,
there is no limit what DROID gets..there is no limit what DROID DOES™,
Needs an update. Force closes constantly while updating.,
Please enable the ability to store this app onto the SD card.,
Won't start. Force closes every time tried to uninstall and install again.,
Thanks for showing the android community some love. Great app.,
One of my favorites. Use it everyday. Incredible.,
Force closes every time.,
Force closes on HTC Tattoo every time its opened even after update,
"Thank you for the great app, not just a crappy iPhone port. 5*.",

Puts the ipad app to shame.,
very nice. It's about time,
Awesome UI + Awesome content = Awesome app,

@Pilot25 there's a faux news apparently around.,
worked great for awhile. Now won't update.,
Very clean in simplicity. Yet informative.,
"@ Jeff :rate the app, not the content you moron",
"Great app, good integration of videos etc",
First class app. Works well on the milestone.,
Force close when choosing section X10,
A solid first version. Room for improvement.,
"Uninstalled. I wont be using any news apps with ads. Usa today can manage, so can this.",
Nice to have it back new and improved,
Mobile site in opera is far faster,
Major battery hog on my hero.,
no more blank pages! thx,
Been waiting for an official nytimes app. Love nytimes,
No landscape mode really kills it for me. How can this app be missing such a basic feature?,

"Careful trying this app unless you want to keep it for ever without the ability to use it. That is unless you pay for the subscription. I am strugling now to remove it from my tablet but with no success. It starts on its own and they have made it very very difficulit to remove, again I am still trying to get it off my samsung tablet and phone as well",
"I never installed this, yet it keeps appearing on my tablet- even after I uninstall it. VERY annoying app.",
Bloatware. 90% irrelevant news since I dont live in america and really annoying since I cannot remove it.,
"I hate this app. It came loaded on my tablet. I can't uninstall it. When I try, it comes back. I don't use it. I don't want an app to something I wouls need a subscription for to make it even slightly useful. But I can't get rid of it. I would give it negative stars if I could.",
I do not want this app but cannot find any way to uninstall.  It was already on my tablet when I got it along with several other apps I do not want but seem to be stuck with. It is using up space I could use for things I do want.,
"Rather read the rag and pay when I want to read. To left anyway, one never knows the spin.",
"Why would manufacturer's automatically add this to a tablet or phone especially out of the US?  I didn't choose to install it, don't want it, yet I can't delete it (to my knowledge).  If anyone knows how I can uninstall it, please write on here!  Had to give it 1 * as it doesn't allow for 0!",
Forced to have this crappy app on my device.  Cannot uninstall no matter how much I'd like to.,
I live in South-Africa and dont have the need to read New York times. Taking up space. Please help me to uninstall the app.,
"Worst format as a paper,terrible journalism,lack of respect,full of flaws,",
"Bloatware, comes preloaded on my tablet and cannot be removed, America is not the world we don't want this preinstalled on devices in the UK, samsung really messed this one up.",
I don't read New York times and this app came preinstalled with device update. Totally useless.,
And guess what.... I cant uninstall it nothing like having something shoved down your throat by some big brand who are evidently paying samsung a prity penny to FORCE this on unsuspecting users,
Can't uninstall it. Have disabled it but it's taking up space. I'm not in the US and I don't want it on my tablet.,
"I cant get rid of this app! Came with tablet, uses up my data updating all the time and I dont live in USA.",
"No option to uninstall it, just update or open. Frustrating!",
It needs an uninstall button!,
Bloatware that came with tablet. Worthless as this is an app that requires a subscription. Paywalls for news can kiss mine.,
I cant get rid of it its sooooo anyoing I dont read a newspaper im a kid so make it uninstallible!!!,
I want this crap off my tablet to free up space,
Why is this app being forced on me? I did an android system update & this app appeared. I live in Australia why would I want this hogging my system resources. Completely unable to uninstall. Not happy,
Cannot  get this dam app off my tablet,
"If there was an option for no stars you would be receiving that for the pure cheek of enforcement, surely this is illegal!",
This app just appeared on my tablet with no way to uninstall...now what does that say about the app? Please remove it.... pretty sneaky and makes me mad as crap!,
6,
"Can't remove this app but don't want it i live in the UK, dissapointed with Samsung!!",
It's absolute rubbish and I cannot get rid of it,
Some how this app downloaded to my tablet  with no way to get rid of it so others beware,
"Dont want it, cant get rid of it !!",
Why app can not be unistall take way to much space on my device.,
Why was this auto installed on my tablet? Get this crap off my tablet and wasting space.,
It sucks cannot get rid of it,
Provide delete option!,
Dont want it dont use ìt,
BLOATWARE....What the hell is this even doing on my tablet. WHY WOULD ANYONE EVEN WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS PRE LOADED...I am in the U.K not America. GET RID OF IT. This is the reason I will NEVER purchase anything Samsung ever again....UNNECESARY AND UNWANTED BLOATWARE.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
You do not need it,
Absolute rubbish. Fake news,
"just got new tablet, its on it, NO uninstall, badbad...dont want this app or its liberal leanings...no uninstall...NAD",
How did this app get installed without me knowing?why is samsung filling my tablet with bloat ware? no more !  why can't i uninstall this app? i do not want the ny times!,
"Only allowed 3 articles before I have to pay? Remove it then, it's a waste of my space. I don't want it, but am forced to keep it and update it!",
I live in London. Why has evil Google decided this app is mandatory? I will perpetually vote this poorly while I am not given the choice as to whether or not I want it installed!,
Do not down load,
How do I uninstall this application. It came downloaded with the tablet.,
"...don't need. Can't remove it either, which is very annoying.",
Can't uninstall from my device,
"I didnt put this app on my tablet... Why would this even be bloatware? Its pointless.... I dont want it!!! WHO IS THE OWNER OF THIS TABLET? I AM, NOT YOU; SO IF YOUR NOT THE OWNER, DONT PUT APPS ON IT UNLESS THEY CAN BE REMOVED!!",
Because i don't  need it and i can't uninstall it,
"Why do we need this app,  I live in England",
I don't like it,
Why am I unable to remove this unwanted app?,
I want to uninstall but i cant.... ****,
Crap...want it deleted. ...but can't  !,
Remove this.,
More unsolicited bloat?,
Not interested anymore,
I would like to delete it,
Why would I want this?,
"Could care less what is going on in New York. Live in Missouri why would I need NYTimes,really,really..............",
fake newso,
Fake media,
Useless app,
Can you make a button to delete this app? I'm ten years old and I don't read the news-paper!,
Nyt is a paid hack,
Boring,
Hated it,
bloatware,
Unwanted,
Tak seronok,
none plus,
Not relivent,
It sucks,
Nope,

"But its not. After only using it for roughly two weeks, a message popped up stating I needed to either pay for a subscription or I will only be allowed to read three articles of my choice. The bummer is, I enjoyed the NYT, so I was really bummed it came up that i had to buy.  Needless to say i deleted the app a when nd leaving this review.",
"My battery suddenly began to drain very quickly. I used the GSam battery monitor app to find out what was causing the problem and it showed that the culprit was the nytimes app. I uninstalled the nytimes app but my battery continued to drain and GSam indicated that it was STILL the nytimes that was draining it--even though the app was no longer installed on the phone! I re-installed the nytimes app and ticked ""force stop"" before un-installing it again. This worked and my battery usage returned to normal.",
"This app offers a great variety of high quality news, but there is a limit for how many articles you can read per day (and sometimes you open an article by accident...). Since there are other really good apps out there which do not have these limitations, this app is not one of my first choices for the latest news. Sad, but I do not think it is worth more than 2 stars...",
"The new version looks nicer but doesn't work as well.  I often have to tap several times to load an article.   It also inserts a full screen ad every so often which is slow to load and not responsive to being dismissed.  Worse still, it shows me the same ad every single time!   Annoying and monotonous.",
"NyTimes is average at best. Their reporting is not special, their articles are in no way shape or form more accurate or longer than the ones on BBC or in Reuters. The app itself is poorly laid out, getting beaten by most local papers in appdesign. Not worth paying for at all.",
"Despite paying for a subscription and successfully logging in, the pay wall won't go away any more. It used to do this sporadically but now it is all the time. Even if uninstalling/reinstalling fixes it, that is a PITA every time I want to open the app. It's easier to just use time-honored pay wall evasion schemes (VPN, proxy, clear cookies, etc) like a  non-paying reader.",
"Experiencing an annoying glitch in the latest version. Each time I complete a story and go back to the summary page, the app takes me to the top of the section summary, not to the position I was in before clicking on the story. Requires lots of scrolling to get back to the right place. While otherwise a great app, this must be fixed!",
"I'm very disappointed with the update that only allows 10 articles per month. The NY Times is a news source I have always enjoyed and trusted, but being limited to one article every three days unless I want to pay $15/month is asking too much. Please consider either changing the pricing scheme or the article maximum - the app was perfect the way it used to be.",
I think the price of this app is ridiculous but I do like the fact that they are reporting on the horribly corrupt Trump presidency but still the price is too high.... We're in a financial crisis right now and the poor are not going to get any richer.... Maybe the 1% should lower the price of their paper...,
"I think this app would be so helpful, but the problem is that i can not download it. They either tell me there was an error to download or the blue thing keeps on moving and nothing happens . I want to know if the problem is in my connection or you're having some problems, please.                                                         Thanks in advance.",
"The new format for the app is nice; however, it drains my battery a lot. I have reverted to reading the Times through my browser. Apparently, there is some software code involved that makes me re enter my username and password on a regulations basis. Apparently this is to steer me to the native app. I like the Times, but all of this mess needs to get fixed. I pay a considerable amount of money for my subscription, but feel like I am being fleeced.",
"my title says it all. the ny times url is very unstable, so i tried their app, which is worse because it would not let me sign in. great newspaper, worthless web professionals. i immediately uninstalled app.",
"Longtime digital subscriber, finally just dropped my sub because of lack of dark mode, also known as night mode, in the app. I'll just read it in one of the several browsers that support night mode. Come on NYT people have been requesting this in your app from day 1. How hard can it be to do white on black,  it is a built in feature of the basic browser for gosh sake.",
"I cannot support The Times after the decision to publish an opinion article called ""The Climate of Complete Certainty,"" which falsely questioned the unanomous agreement that scientists have about anthropomorphic climate change. You cannot be a defender of the truth if you spread lies, even under the guise of opinion piece. The Times has made themselves complicant in the largest misinformation campaign — on behalf of fossil fuel interests — in American history and that I'd a damn shame.  I also cancelled my digital subscription and I encourage everyone to do the same.",
"Extremely biased news. Not really news more of a globalist propaganda tool, written with eloquence. Sad because some of their writers are very talented if only they were allowed to tell the truth like the old days, NYT would still have hope. Very sad state the news business is in.",
"It's probably a good app for subway commuters (thanks to the offline reading mode). Looking at the UI, while on one side it has the distinctive minimal NYTimes feeling, on the other side the app feels cheap, dissonating with the visuals of the phone and comprising ux patterns that don't fit well (including the obnoxious pull to refresh).  Probably it's good for a subset of readers, but to me it needs a serious rework.  Just use the browser.",
Android app ignores my signing in on tablet (Xperia Z2 tablet/KitKat). Forced to use browser access. Tech help woefully bad - they don't even seem to know what KitKat is. Would give zero stars if allowed.              Update: contacted NYT again today - now advised that the android app will not work for me. Must await an updated version - been waiting now since December 2014 for the app to recognise that I am a subscriber!,
"Absolute propaganda. Stalin and Mao must be proud of their offspring NYT. You didn't even make am effort to hide the pro communist vibes,atleast learn from your dad,CNN about how to effectively spread communism and deem everything you don't like as racist or fascist.",
"The few times I tried the app, I found it adding no value. It never worked well on my tablet, so, basically it is it useless. The ONLY reason I tried it was due to a promotion via LinkedIn.  It seems to be difficult to unsubscribe from NYT. I am still fighting to get off, and I am NOT AMUSED ! To unsubscribe, I apparently have to call an international number. I beg your pardon !! Sending a message to Customer service has not resulted in any response.  NYT has not given me an experience of a professional company",
The new UI eliminates the night mode and font sizes and the widget no longer updates. Also the international edition was reset to US edition in my settings.  Overall this new update has generally annoyed me and makes me wonder why I'm paying for this.,
"I was somewhat hesitant to dl the app after reading a string of terrible reviews, but my experience brought me back here to say that I haven't encountered a single problem on Nexus 7. I'm not a subscriber btw.",
"Ok , couple of years later & still cannot send articles to friends like I could from the browser on computer one. But never uninstalled. Price went up, I'm still paying😨😵Even w/ the problems, still lover the Times! Once loved this app now extremely disappointed bc unable to send stories to friends & relatives-- cannot send anything & they cannot open anything. I'm going to uninstall it. I'm upset that I'm paying $15 a month for this; cannot even send an article to my spouse.",
"App demands google play permissions, kicks up an instant error message when I try to log into my acct, then claims I'm offline. Ridiculous. I am also cancelling my NYT subscription. Edited to add: Already tried the steps recommended by developer. See above. App shows an error message and states I'm offline. Subscription has been cancelled, app has been uninstalled. Why is there no zero star option?",
"As a guest of a subscriber I eagerly looked forward to reading the New York Times this month. Imagine my surprise when I ran up against a free articles limit almost immediately, despite being signed in as a subscriber. WaPo does not do it. You need to rethink how you treat prospective new customers",
"Every time I try to read an article, the app crashes as I scroll through. Each month, I only get 10 free articles and the system subtract each attempt at the same article, from that 10. The app needs to be fixed... quit being so buggy AND don't count the same article after being buggy and crashing, as a different article!",
"While all you people are complaining blame your phone manufacturer. This app is designed to be android native and sadly all you ""Samsung Galaxy Super Epic 4G Mega Touch"" people have heavy UI's on top. Get the Nexus, this app runs beautifully on mine",
"I was at first excited about this ap but soon disappointed when I tried to log in but was unable to. I then uninstalled the AP and I like life better without the hassle.	This AP did not allow me to log in. Frustrating little bugger! Who would think the NY Times would be so lousy.",
"Though I have a digital subscription, the NYT application continually will not open sub-articles in the paper and asks for money before it will open. It's amazing a paper as big as NYT can't get it right. The NYT tablet version is for iPad only, apparently they haven't heard of Samsung.",
"Some interesting ideas in the new version, but I managed to find the previous version in an internet repository and reverted to it. Why? The night mode is gone :(   I use it all the time because I can read more and read faster, and it spares my eyes. The new twilight mode is different and may be the mode of choice for some people, but not for me.",
"You download and get a very limited number of articles. Then they want u to 
pay up. Not enough to see if its worth the price.",
"Not bad, but I think it could do a lot better to cater to audio listeners. Most other major news apps (BBC, NPR, etc) make it easy to locate audio stories and have audio versions of their 'briefings' avail. Like maybe if I'm stranded with nothing to read, then this app is about on par with surfing the nyt website, but I'm not going to make it part of my routine when I can make coffee, pack my lunch and commute to the audio version of another news source.",
"New York Times is involved in terribly biased reporting to the extent that it becomes lies. People reading the NYT will definitely have an ingrained bias and should check other the places if they have their facts right before being confident about their source. Every article NYT does on India is like another blatant hitjob that shocks even the most liberal person because to be liberal does not mean to lie like the NYT. They did an article on ""India's crackdown on dissent"" and left out fundamental details to make India look despotic! They Can't care for complete truth. Did an article on Baba Ramdev and made him look like an Evil cock-eyed Hindu who is for them ""the most powerful man in India""! Article was filled with lies and half-truths! Its shocking. People around the world will read and be absolutely misled but clearly there's a group who benefits from this.",
"Decent app with two huge problems. Paying subscribers still see fairly intrusive advertisements. The kind that are inserted directly into the middle of the article text, taking up half of my Galaxy S7 screen, right where I'm touching the screen to scroll. The other problem is the abuse of push notifications to compete in the attention economy. A news app could potentially be the most valuable deliverer of push notifications, but not this one. NYT sends notifications at all hours for the most trivial of articles. Since they aren't able to use this feature responsibly, I had to disable notifications entirely. A real shame for a respectable institution.",
"Make this uninstallable.  Flipboard makes this app completely obsolete, and is 500x better.  Editors Choice, right...  Paid bloatware is more likely.",
The iPad app is so much better. Android tablets get a blown up phone app. That is not up to par on Android anymore. Waiting for the upgrade...,
"I wasn't sure if I'd like the app version over the paper, I ended up loving it. The mini crossword puzzle is fun and I look forward to it everyday. Wish there was a way to get older puzzles and stories.",
App is a terrible experience. Website is much better. But they now added a pop up to the website to annoy you into downloading the app.,
"Ill admit when the pay wall was announced I was a bit disappointed, but I decided to try the trial and premium features offered by the app and was totally impressed. The Listen feature (text to speech) makes my commute fly by and the content is second to none.  The Times is the only newspaper I'd even consider paying for.  The content just can't be beat.  The only improvement I would suggest is some better widget options.   A large Widget that let you switch sections and add/play articles would be great. :)",
"After reading a paltry 10 articles in ONE MONTH, App annoys the reader with constant demands for a paid subscription. Does the New York Times think they are the only news outlet on the planet? I can get my news from many other sources with the same or better quality for free. Why should I purchase a subscription from the NYT? Their articles and features aren't made of gold! Do they not realize they have competition? Enough!  UNINSTALLED! !",
"I had my alert set for silent on this app, yet it played music continuously for breaking news alerts. The only way to stop the notification music was to turn the phone off. I can't have my phone going off unexpectedly in meetings and such, so I had to delete it. Sad, because it worked so well on my previous phone.",
"The NYT app is very beautiful to behold. It is very well designed and is relatively light. However, I am not able to login to my NYT account to enjoy my digital subscription on my phone.",
"Decent content, poor design. They need to fire their entire app dev team and hire people who truly understand what UX stands for.",
"I would love to remove this app from my device. It just wastes space, 
constant push notifications and waste of battery power.",
I recently encountered a bug on my nexus 5 where this app would cause my nexus to overheat. I liked the app as well as the paper but the bug rendered it useless.,
"For a couple of days now, i havent been able to log in to my account successfully. I enter my login info and it takes me right back to the screen thats an ad for the paid service and not onto the article like it used to. Extremely frustrating!! What should i do to fix it? I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.",
"Even I am a subscriber, annoy ads still there, compared with NYT native app, I prefer to use filpboard",
"A good relatively moderate news source, annoying app.  Constant alerts, can't disable, at least not in the version I used.  I enjoy reading multiple news sources, can't have one app blowing up my phone like a jilted lover.  Far too distracting, and an easy way to miss actual messages.",
"Most of the pre installed apps on Android is complete garbage. But when I saw NY Times I though I should keep it. After couple of weeks of having my Samsung Galaxy Pro 12.2 I wanted to find out what was draining my battery when I was not using my tablet.... Yes it was it was another pre installed worthless malware app NY times, using 27% of my battery... Garbage.... Turn it off... Disable it.... ASAP!",
I don't read the New York Times but Samsung won't allow me to remove it from the tablet. It's one of the very few downsides of owning one of their tablets. I'm stuck with some apps from them that they think is an absolutely must have and I get no say in the matter.,
"Articles are unreadable and support will not respond to my requests for help. Buggy app. Frequently the articles display as white text on a black background, randomly. Also annoys me that the videos are not supported with chromecast.",
"I check into the NYTimes via this app every day, several times. In the morning I read the news, later in the day I check for recipes, and at night before going to sleep I do the mini crossword puzzle. It's an essential part of my daily life. Thank you!",
"This compares to other news apps, but decides that some articles are not included for free. It's their prerogative, but I can get the same thing for free elsewhere.",
"The ads used to be non dismissable and on all the time on main page, and articles. Now they're embedded per story - much better. Sometimes web content still requests a login, this is the only remaining issue. Great app otherwise!",
news about india turns to be fake here.  sad to see NYT turning into hoe media.  sorry i can't trust your news anymore afp is better.,
Psssh. What a rip. Thamks for the headlines and then the inability to read anything without a subscription. Waste of time download!,
"With so much fake news and lies out there on Twitter and Facebook, it's imperative to have a news source you can trust based on real journalism and fact.",
Long time print susbcriber. Got wall of ads covering a third of the screen. Hard to use.  Back to using a browser with ad and script blocking.  Same reason I quit using the old app.,
"After a year and a half use, this app never cleared it's data cache. It was 1.5 gigabytes!  Resources on android devices are very limited for storage. Creators of this app skipped simple cache maintenance.  What other less obvious details have they missed that affect the stability and or the security of my device?",
"This is a good reader for the top NYT stories/headlines.  And NYT has great US and international coverage!  But the app is not as visual as Pulse, and you need a paid subscription to drill down into other stories.",
"Due to a lag in the news articles for thru past week, I've had to install and redo it. I hope it works now. Otherwise, I love the free version and will keep up with my news (reinstallation willing).",
So sick of this app reinstalling itself onto my samsung tablet 3 even after i disable and uninstall. I didn't even want it in the first place.,
"Deleted this app from my phone. The monthly limit on free articles makes alternative apps better. Besides if I wanted to hear biased stories about how Hilary is ""better"" than Sanders I would just go to her campaign site.",
The reporting is just too biased. Let them give the reader facts and allow them to conclude.,
"This app lets you have a convenient way to read an excellent newspaper. I suspect that the app is a little heavy on battery resources, but in time it will improve.",
If you're viewing on a tablet and have a paid subscription go through flipboard. This app doesn't compare,
"One of the best covered up state run propaganda news Network. Always 
reports based on skewed narratives. Have extreme liberal bias. Avoid if you 
want to read real news.",
Yet another app that has downloaded itself. Again can be disabled but on restart of device enables itself. Very poor.,
"Limit down from 3 per day to 10 per month is an app killer. It already has ads, so why would I pay more when every other serious publication will let me read for free? Print media may be dying,  but only the NYT, operating at the cutting edge, could find a way to kill their digital publishing this efficiently as well. Uninstalled until someone comes to their senses about the importance of staying in the public eye.",
"Too limited in what can view for free; too costly for what I'd love to get.   News for the rich, in the final take.",
They sent me a push notification for a climate change denial article. I uninstalled immediately. RIP NYT.,
"Good articles, but this app uses your cellular data even if you enable the ""Use WiFi only"" setting. Really disappointing, as it used up my entire data plan after about a week of usage. Get your stuff together NYTimes.",
"I really hate apps that claim to be ""free"" and then demand a subscription the moment you attempt to access content.",
"I was going to install but it wanted access to phone numbers , numbers of callers to my phone, names of devices connected to my Wi-Fi, my photos and videos, and more. Right, give a newspaper all that. And what for. Seems very sketchy. No thanks.",
"Sends you notifications of news updates constantly and doesn't allow you to 
read the article because everything is behind a paywall. I think they give 
you a single article a month that you can read for free. Worthless when 
there are so many other news apps that don't nickel and dime you.",
"Imagine that some company forced you to have an app on your phone giving you news from the perspective of people in Bulgaria.  Useful if you are Bulgarian, but otherwise less so.    The sooner companies stop forcing this irrelevant c**p  on us the better.",
"100% deceitful. .  Disregard this app as nothing more than time wasting  bull-shitterery.  However,  if you find yourself bored, struggling to find purpose with your life and sitting on the couch covered in doritos crumbs, then..  enjoy!!",
Why should I pay for an application already installed in my phone on the top of that I can't get red of it Samsung should know better.,
"I cannot comprehend why people complain about a free news app. I use a few to keep informed. Love news, layout, and overall feel of this app.",
I enjoy reading the news over watching it on TV. The NYT's has been a very reliable source for both national and international news.,
"I'm still a believer after the NYT's mistaken election predictions. With its outstanding coverage cover to cover, I feel well informed as a global citizen and as a public school teacher.",
"I hear about news from CNET that doesn't even get on the NY Times. Example: protests in Washington DC on sat Oct 26, 2013 over Obama NSA scandal was not even mentioned in the NY times",
Nyt is a great news source and has some great writers but news is FREE everywhere else.  I can find a better use for 20 bucks a month. Sorry,
"The title says enough. Any further description would consist of examples, the vast majority of which anger me, so I won't waste any more of my time.",
After reading the update that the sign on recognition bug is fixed I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice but to no avail.,
"They took away the option that articles are read to me. Now I can't ""read"" the paper while I'm out running around over my ear buds",
"I've been a daily newspaper reader for decades who has gone digital.  Now I start my day with the NYT.  Great up to date, accurate reporting.",
"Will not accept password, just refreshes screen after login and states at me.  Broken, just broken.",
"Bloat ware forced on my tablet I don't live in America why the hell do I 
need this junk. Never trusted them as a news source.",
I've  installed the app about three times and uninstalled Three times it freezes and always asks for money for what  doesn't work yea right.,
"App works well to show current article titles. A paid subscription is required to read the full articles. You can pull up the articles on the NYT Web site, for free, which renders the app useless. Uninstalled.",
"I unfortunately had to uninstall this app from my phone. The lack of balanced and honest reporting with such clear anti Israel bias is so appalling, I could no longer keep on reading this agenda-driven and dishonest ""news"".",
I've turned this app off countless times. It always turns itself back on and spams my device. Not even worth one star.,
"I feel it would make more sense possibly to ask me to rate any app after I read it and get a feel for what I'm rating, please ? I can't read a book by its cover- well, not yet-Ha 😊 just kidding, but if at all possible that seems most logical and much appreciated.  Thank you so very much for EVERYTHING! ! Love Jeni Jo",
"Wake up NYTimes!   Every time you almost become the true international definitive paper of record, the paper of this online age, you try to overlymonitize it and blow your position.",
"Why oh why can I not get rid of this annoying app! I didn't install it it came on my Samsung on an update,  I keep disabling it but it reinstalls. I have no interested in a US news paper, I live in another country and have my own papers. Please can you take this off the devices!!!",
"I use this app to share items on social media.  Yet some time in last year, app stopped letting user copy text. That limits the depth of what I can share beyond the link itself.",
The content is full of fallacy.  NY Times believes that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to disarm the good guys.. doesn't make sense.. same with their other stories that tries to twist or cover the truth... My whole family is unsubscribing.,
Locks up my andriod.  I want the times but they can't seem to do an app.,
"Some of your journalists, particularly the Asians are spreading their false 
propaganda through you guys. Please review what they write and check the 
facts before letting them publish it.",
"I've read the NYT using their app for years now.  It's simple, functional, and the best way to get your news where ever you happen to be.",
Ugly ads within the app ruin an otherwise well designed interface.  The ads can't be turned off even for premium subscribers!  A shame.,
The Times Keeps Getting better. Now if only the actual news would follow suit. They've lessened co,
"Just today, the app has started giving me a pop-up that tells me I've used up my article quota and need to login. I do so, and then I get the pop-up again. It won't go away, and I can't use the app.",
Has to revert to an older version as the latest didn't recognize my subscription and only showed a black screen.,
"Lets you read stories for a bit, then only lets you read 10 a month unless you pay.",
"I wake up every morning anxiously awaiting the Times. It keeps me apprised of current affairs, interesting articles on food, makeup, savings and, my favorite, the mini crossword. It's my go-to news source.",
"I cancelled this subscription with the New York Times, but Google keeps billing me for it and offers no understandable way to  cancel",
The app is only free for a short time. You will not be able to read articles after you have opened 10 articles. You then have to subscribe to open articles to read. I recommend not loading this application it is a waste of time unless you wish to subscribe.,
Paid for a month access but couldn't get it whatever I did so want nothing more to do with them.,
"This app just drains the battery, even when it is off. For me it is pre-installed on my tablet and I cannot get rid of it. I wouldn't recommend downloading it.",
"The charge appeared on my Google wallet account, but the NYT never ""saw""  it. Went back and forth for 3 days and gave up. Back to Google news for me.",
NYT is a staple. A fabulous mix of elite content and a stable app. It's when NYT goes interactive that it really kicks arse. Pretty much peerless.,
"Didn't ask for this crappy app, turning it off doesn't last more than a few days, and when it's not turned off it drains the battery like crazy. This is the worst bloatware app ever.",
There is no way that I can see to log in to an academic pass.  Thus the app is useless to me and I have to continue to use a browser to read the times.,
"Clicked an article and up came a notification, "" you have nine free articles left this month"".  That was all I needed to see, charge up front or not at all, claiming it's free, until I use it, is a scam.",
"It's easy to use, but has way too many articles and notifications about Trump. Cancelling.",
"Very bias opinions, terrible writing and extremely boring design. You made a terrible app and worse commercial. Good day.",
NYtimes is very biased towards certain political side. please try reporting news not making news,
"This is a good app for its features, but note that it has a serious memory 
leak which causes itself and other apps to abort. Not recommended until 
software fixed.",
I liked this app until the article was posted about choosing Hillary Clinton as the NYT candidate. The entire article is a farce and spews libel about Bernie Sanders. I can't support something that blatantly lies in articles. Even opinion articles.,
"I gave this app 5 stars because New York Times is best, trusted and respected  National & International news sources.",
"This company hired Sarah jeong, a certified white exterminationist. Almost 
like this company is being run by a foreign and hostile group of elites.",
"This used to be a great app - easy to use, quick to load articles, but now the article opens, I see it for a moment and then it disappears. I still have headline, but only blankness where the text was. Reader comments still come up.  What did nytimes do?   Maybe it's a sign that I need to find a news source with better editorial judgment than nytimes - the human interest piece about the released Palestinian prisoner who has murdered a sleeping holocaust survivor with a hammer to the head was appalling.",
Enjoy breaking news and a quick glace at what's going on in the world.  Easy access in the app for sections I want to see.,
In depth articles key in on gist of fast breaking news better than any other similar format.,
Great for skimming and saving articles for later. Love it in conjunction with pocket (which then reads them to me while at the gym).,
No need to charge really - overwhelming majority of news apps are free and you need to be free too. Excellent app otherwise,
Always anti-India. We dont need your credibility certificate. 99% articles on India are negative. Compare this with China news which are positive in general.,
This is a pretty good app besides the inability to comment on articles and the ads. If I am a paying subscriber don't spam me with ads,
You've got to subscribe to read anything other than Top News. I'm uninstalling and going elsewhere.,
"I like this app & the way contents are delivered. But , free articles per month are not sufficient.",
I really enjoy the news and current events and it's so nice to be able to have it in the palm of my hand.,
Has improved since I initially started using it. Resolved a lot of tech issues that would come up. Good App.,
"Good navigation, good typography, good reading experience, and of course great writing. But I desperately wish NYT would bring NYT Now to Android, or take a cue from The Economist's Espresso app. The morning digest is good, but it's all shallow bullet points.",
Beware. If you give them your payment info for a 99¢ trial they won't let you cancel the overpriced recurring charges.,
"Uninstalled due to full screen ad. Then reinstalled once fixed. Thanks for looking at fixing the problem, and going back to how it was.",
"I understand why the app has progressively moved toward more paid subscription usage but its not really worth the effort anymore. 3 articles a day was good enough for free app users, 10 articles a month is pointless.",
My goto app being a nyt subscriber. In depth articles and excellent content makes it worthwhile. Glad there's still quality journalism left. The app is easy to navigate,
"The stability issues could be tolerated a year ago, as could the freezes and slow loads. Resolve these problems or lose a subscription customer.",
This app not work my gallexy (samsung-5360)phone. This app open n top to refrs so notificetion that me 'your data plan not avelible. Cheak your internet .,
"Not bad...although could be a little less money, but overall a decent read.   Sometimes a little too catered to the it crowd.",
They seem to have no care for unbiased media that is objective. It seems a lof of articles and some news is agenda driven propaganda.,
I don't want to keep the app of this Most Racist News Paper of the World. This News Paper always presents the distorted view of India. This is the Racist Newspaper.,
The first thing I do every morning is check the New York Times. If you want to stay informed with accurate and insightful reporting there is no better source than the New York Times.,
"I love keeping in touch with SO much of what is happening in the world. Short intros help me pick the articles I want to read in depth, some with wonderful graphics.",
"I subscribe but am unable to view subscription content. Maybe just an issue with the app on Evo lte, as the website works fine. Still, hardly worth paying for something that doesn't work in the native app.",
If I am paying for something I don't want ads... Ruins the reading experience for me.,
"YOUNARE FAKE NEWS. DOWNLOAD INFOWARS APP IF YOU ARNT A LITTERAL VAMPIRE POT 
BELLY GOBBLIN",
"One of my go to apps for news. Alerts are meaningful and avoid being obtrusive with irrelevant, junky alerts. Easy to navigate, readable, and user friendly.",
I purchased a NYT digital subscription but for some reason this does not allow me to access articles through the app. Very disappointing that tablet access is not included in my digital subscription.,
"Expensive, memory hog, seperate subscription needed for each device, crossword not included, paging is painfully slow.  I'll stick to an occasional paper edition.",
I simply cannot see any basic  Journalist ethics. Horrible news paper. Or it's more proper to call them political propagandas.,
I don't want this app but it keeps download updates onto my tablet because it will not let me delete it. I can only disable it and it still can automatically update its self wth.,
"I have already made an account so that i could read the articles with unlimited accces but when i clicked on an article it gives me the notification to sign up and make a account again. I still cant read any of the articles even when i am already signed in. Please do something about it, NYT is my favourite soure of info.",
"I have been using the NYTimes app without problems for 3.5 years.  The latest upgrade was pushed to my device and now I cannot open it:  ""Unfortunately, NYTimes has stopped.""  Now I am paying for the subscription without the ability to read it.  NYT:  Please thoroughly test your upgrades before pushing poor and buggy software onto your loyal customer base!  Edited:  After spending 45 minutes with 6 people of the NYT ""Customer Care Team"", I solved the problem by installing a T-Mobile firmware upgrade on my Samsung phone.  I really like the New York Times reporting.  I wish the tech team would recover features like ""night mode"" in the new Android app upgrade.",
"More recent upgrades may otherwise far too slow to use. It seemed to bog 
down my entire phone.",
"This came pre-installed and unable to remove from my tab pro. Honestly if I want to praise and worship all this hilldog, I could do it with this app. If I want news, well this place does not have news.",
"Too many adds, too many misleading articles, one sided biased reporting. 
Not what journalism is supposed to be.",
Why only 10 article's when I can read as much as I want through a browser,
I can't do it anymore.   It's not fair to both sides.   Why do you pick a side?  Why can't you report honestly?   I did not save 2500 a year with obamacare.  I now have no health insurance.   I can't afford it.  You supported this lie.  Why?  Why did you do this to me and your country?,
"I'm appalled at how much they are charging. Half the time I cannot even 
access this app.",
"If you want the useful stuff, you have to subscribe to them or access it from a browser.",
Why waste time fixing flawed app that will expire in a few days.,
Go to hell NY times.,
No way am I going to pay for the new York times app. Put in a pop up ad for God's sake.,
"Love NY times reporting. Amazing dedicated journalism  App sucks. Extremely difficult to use, phone freezes at tomes. Non intuitive user interface",
"The app is great. It keeps up-to-date on imprtant news. However, I find that I am unable to find the Sunday Edition on the paper. When I view it online, I can access the print version via...pdf, I believe? Am I missing something or is that a functionality that is not available on the app?",
NY TIMES is doing a terrific job getting me into news I want. The reporters are the bests and the presentation is getting better.,
"I was in hopes that I could use this app to keep up with the latest news; however, the app would only allow me to view 3 articles a day unless I subscribed digitally. There are so many other news apps that don't require me to subscribe.",
"There are many times when clicking on a story won't open it. The content darkens slightly, but won't launch.",
This came as a installed app on my tablet.  I have to disable every couple of days as it renables itself automatically and pops up local US news articles that are irrelevant in my part of the world.,
"It's an essential, and easy, civic duty to subscribe to this. Even better, read it. Better still, talk compassionately with someone with an opposing view. But that first thing, super easy and better for all of us than exactly squat diddly.",
Now you can only read the front page stories. Any and everything else you have to pay. Just uninstalled.,
"wont let me login, paying to see all these ads really bothers me, slow, uninstall. pretty much what everyone else said.",
"Having issues with the app. It keeps telling me that it is an old version 
and to reinstall... As I a paid subscriber I am not happy as I can't access 
the app at all.",
"Have re-installed the but  it just stops working and freezes just as it did in Froyo. Come on NYT, this is an expensive app ($13 per month)... Fix it!",
As if anyone would pay money to read the news. Get over yourself newyorktimes.,
"The one thing I have always loved about the NY Times is that all information is relevant, and has a sense of global awareness. This app follows through on so many levels!",
"Love it! It's top-notch with its ease, informational, and entertaining all at once. The only bad thing is I spend too much time on it.",
"After logging in, the data usage jumped to 7 megs. There are news apps with more features that don't use that much.",
"So easy to sign up, and so hard to cancel. Horrible customer service.",
"Amazing App, I keep the top news channels so that I can make my own judgement on different reporting. So far NYT not bad.",
If you want me to pay to see the news. I rather just use the website. Also 7 free articles a month? I look at more then that in a day. What a joke. I love the times and i love this app but whats the point,
Great news app but uses too much CPU and wastes battery.  Had to uninstall.,
They keep talking about facts and truth and ignoring my grandmother's feelings.,
This app is a horrible way to get your news. There are many more reliable apps to give you news.,
almost always sad news. uninterested in topics and news shown. lack of options to personalize news topics. just another bad and useless app.,
"Latest version does not work on android 8.1. Freezes up, displays black screens with no image. Tried latest version after uninstalling older version. No improvement. Recommend uninstall and just use web browser. So sad. Use to be a great app.",
"Love everything but search. It is easier to search Google if you are looking for a book review of a book older than this week. Aside from that alerts are great, articles are ones I want to read, mini crossword is addictive.",
I cannot login to the Android app on my tablet. Works on my iPhone. Horrible app.,
Just not my taste in news I guess but all of the articles were dry...,
"I'm unable to login into my account. I keep getting an ""invalid format"" error message when I try to do it even though I know my login info is correct.",
I don't care for the Times but the app works well.  At least it's not one that Google features just for political reasons.,
"I really love this app. NYT always seems to deliver both in terms of the actual content and the packaging of the content be it in the form of app, website or paper. Thanks guys!",
"I was on the fence about replacing the grey lady with an app, but now I am in love. This doesn't feature all the content the paper does but it's close. Still buyb when a cool cover photo is released.",
Bland user interface. Countdown of remaining free articles. Too many superior options.,
"Hopefullly soon, there will be Android access to the NYT Cooking App that is available to iPhone users, aside from the articles. There is also no way to remove the notifications that constantly appear on my screen. Aside from that, it's nice to have some access with the articles for a good read.",
"So, I have to put up with ads *and* pay for a subscription to access any content?  Seriously? Luckily there are dozens of other news outlets offering free access to the same sensationalistic / biased / pre-digested articles as NYT...",
My HTC Inspire 4G (Desire HD) runs Android 2.2 (Oct 2010).  Logging into my NYTimes digital account fails to unlock content on this App but.works fine on the browser.  FAIL,
WE ALL NEED TO SUPPORT REAL NEWS AND REAL JOURNALISM I'm a life-long NY Times reader and this is a very easy-to-use app for getting your daily fix of truly excellent journalism,
"I can't get rid of it, and it's useless unless I pay.  I'm not American yet I am stuck with this thing taking up space!",
"Can't choose to not download specific sections. Huge battery and data drain if I want to read when not on WiFi. The iPhone app let's you choose sections. Older versions of this app let you choose sections. Stop dropping the ball, NYT",
"The app is near perfect. Fast and easy to read and find what you are looking for, it has just enough customization to be useful and not burden you with complexity. I only wish I could reorder my list of sections. Nice work.",
"While not as robust as the iPhone or iPad app, the Android version is solid, subscription news app. Here is hoping that one day, a true New York Times app for Tablets (Nexus 7 and 10, as examples) will be available.",
"Auto-update can no longer be turned off. Uninstalled. I'll read from my computer subscription    I had previously deselected Auto-update as the developer suggests below.  With the recent Google Play update, NYTimes was among several apps in which that option has been disabled.",
I read this app was garbage so I downloaded it just to give it one start. NYT can stick it.,
Can you launch the nyt now app for android and make indian edition available like the Chinese edition. You could make the app free and monetise it with ads as it is done in 'The Guardian' app. And make it less invasive like asking for useless access for everything in the phone.,
Unlike similar apps it's actually better than the browser experience. One drawback though: you can't tap to copy text or search it.,
"Still hangs, crashes just as it's done since 1st.  Surprisingly stupid that NYT can't get this right after so so many updates.",
World leader of bias liberal propaganda.  A travesty to call this news in any sense of the word. Is treasonous to say the least.,
"The biggest issue with this app:  - Lack of chronological sorting. This is a must-have, the ability to sort news chronologically. Otherwise the date and time of the content can be confusing.",
No comparison to the content they offer over the web. The app is modeled on making money over mobil than delivering their content to users over the platform.,
Even though I'm subscribed to the NYTimes  (digital subscription) the app is telling me I'm a visitor and limiting me to 10 articles!,
DO NOT INSTALL !! Stupid app keeps spamming your device non-stop desperately in need of attention everyday. Get other news app that works better.,
I love Nytimes my children live there. Ive been buying it since the 80s. Im old lol. Greatest stories. And the truth.,
Tricked me to download only to find out I need to pay to view the articles.,
All fake and paid news.and it steals all your data and sell it to the advertisers.,
... but the subscription cost has gotten out of control. Washington Post is a reasonable substitute.,
"Begging for money. Just like how they're trying to nickle and dime crossword solvers with the NYT crossword app WHICH ALSO REQUIRES A SUBSCRIPTION!! I guess Trying to figure out the place of the old technology. What MADE the NY Times really great? In depth LITERATE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS and special investigations...(NOW IT'S JUST A DEMS BIASED ""Progressive"" GLOBALIST MOUTHPIECE) It cannot compete with the instantaneous twittery news and the web will just copy and steal the hard journalism. How do you bring proper real journalism to the LOL generation?",
Any application that restarts itself after being disabled is considered a virus. This application is an excellent example of that definition.,
"Thanks to 45 decided to subscribe. Excellent decision! Really enjoy the online mobile app for phone (but doesn't play well with my Nook HD). Plus being a subscriber allows me to read the times at my laptop and the Nook via the web. Well written and interesting articles, always.",
"Downloads hundreds of megs of data of data daily, even though I've disabled the app.  Can't seem to uninstall (Samsung Tab S bloatware).",
Fake News!! The so called journalists are a joke. The real issue is how they take advantage of the poor public education system here.,
I gave up my local paper and found I like reading my morning news on my phone the best.  NYT is my favorite.,
"I've turned this unused bloatware off several times, and it repeatedly ends up in my notification bar.",
"i fan from indonesian country, need more information about new york. I like new york but i can't go there, :-)",
So i have to pay to read i thought it was a free app.. its says so wen installing what the hell,
"I LOVE me my NYT and have been reading it every morning for the past couple 
of years. I am a digital subscriber, and it's my primary news source. So 
I'm very sad that I have just had to uninstall the app from my android 
phone for the second time in a week. Why? It is positively eating my 
battery life as it runs in the background. No, I don't leave it open but 
every time you open it and closes it again it just eats away at the 
battery. This morning my phone actually warned me about it. I will reach 
out to tech support at NYT and see if they have any suggestions. I have 
seen lots of complaints about this. You'd think the paper of record could 
do a bit better. Signed, Bummed Out In Portland",
"I like that there is a variety of articles, some on breaking news, the arts, education, social changes, and continuing stories.",
"Best news app of them all. Great design, easy to use, and so much more to read than just our currently awful headline news. Works offline saving articles better than all other news apps.",
There are better news apps that are totaly free. This one isn't worth the money or hassle of navigation from one section to another.,
They let you read the headlines but require payment to read articles.   This is an editors pick. Sad,
Why I'm forced to have this crap app if I cant even use it.,
Good practice is for me and you to be able to make sure you are safe at home with you at work on or off Wall or on  Street the  table is you it interested in you see you at meeting ur kids grow up dad come in and see you kick him out and  back  The next is workin with it and no it doesn't matter what happens it happens will come back from cloud and jobs lined new email address so you know that we are ear when you need it,
"2 star for news service, otherwise this buggy app doesn't deserve even a crap.",
"This is a great mobile app, but I can't get past how very biased all of the articles appear to be, especially when it comes to the election.",
The new update is bad!  Why is there no black background with white text?  Font size is in a place I can't find.  Why  do I need a horizontally scrolling nav bat at top?  What a waste  of space.,
Good for headlines. Screen too sensitive. Half of my 10 free articles end up being ones opened while I thought I was moving through the summaries.,
Terrible interface not user friendly at all.. news filtering is also not that good.,
Want to find out how to stop all the updates even when it has been disabled. Definitely hate it. It keeps coming back!!!,
Uninstalled because you managed to ruin an otherwise great app by limiting me to ten articles a month.,
I subscribed because Donald Trump hates this news source. So they are my favorite!,
And everything is free. At the end I offered them more money that you have to pay in new York times. But info must be free. If somebody pay for info them the information is not FREE.,
Don't even know if I can turn off notifications,
"I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!    I HATE THIS APP!         IT IS A PRESET APP ON MY TABLET.  THERE IS NO WAY TO UNINSTALL IT.  If I wanted the New York Times I would subscribe to it, the New York Times needs better management and better reporters. I have turned this app off and I have reset it to the factory setting, YET IT CONTINUES TO TURN ITSELF ON.   I SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE.  HORRIBLE APP! I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!      I HATE THIS APP!",
"Nobody reads this trash anymore.  The app is reasonably stable, but a stable app for this liberal rag is akin to putting lipstick on a pig.  Save your money and subscribe to a newspaper outside the USA.",
I am in Australia and don't use this app or care about the NY Times but for some reason this app keeps self installing on my android device! FIX IT.,
This news app is like a spam app. If it's not free it should not exist.,
Improved.  Would get 5 stars if I could suspend print delivery from the app!,
"The Failing New York Times is exactly that, Failing!  They are so caught up in their own political bias that they don't actually report the truth anymore. Fake News!",
Larger companies should have a better QA process than this.,
Hate it because I can't get ride of it off my tablet!,
Title says it all.  App significantly taxes battery life.  Had no choice but to uninstall from my Galaxy S5.,
Not what we thought it would be that's why the old CNN had everything no limitations,
This one app is consistently 2nd in memory usage. Runs constantly.  Sucks,
"Latest update made the app stop working completely for me. Before the update the app said to install the new version, but this is the only NY Times app I can find in Google Play.",
Get for the news. Keep for the lovely smug feeling you get by completing the easy mini crosswords.,
How much more would I have to pay to not have a quarter of my screen covered in ads? Why the obsession with misleading 99 cent startup costs that dramatically increase after a few months?,
"Too many alerts about lame, bi_partisan news.  Briefings should be beief.",
An excellent source of propaganda and useless bullshit. I got a free trial through Google and it took about twenty minutes for me to decide that I didn't want it.. not even for free.,
"App is good but would be better if it had a ""Today's Paper"" section like the Times website",
NYT is living in the past with its lame subscription approach. It is news...just news. Millions of other sources for free. Uninstalling.,
Though purchased at a high coin it never gives an updated info.Disappointed,
"A bit slow on manual updating, and why are there still ads even if I bought a subscription? Otherwise great app.",
No other news app charges people.. Misleading download,
"Always worked, then didn't for like 2 weeks",
New York Times is a FAKE NEWS! I won't take it even they give free articles for life!,
In this day and age charging for the news is outdated. Especially for the NY Times. No thanks!,
Very small selection of.stories before you have to pay,
New York Times maintains a fairly well made propaganda tool for the lies the political establishment wants us to think is true in this app.,
"The coverage was ok, but often it would crash for no reason when writing 
comments I also found found prejudiced views expressed by commentors and 
some opinion pieces to be disturbing.",
Another app I can't uninstall I don't even live in nyc,
Can't uninstall without root access.,
Can't understand who in Google gave this app editor's choice award,
Used to read news on app daily. Used to be able to read articles in top news section for free. Now you can only read 3 articles per day. I can get plenty of news for free from other apps.,
Sporadic and inaccurate on  linking to pages...  basically unusable,
Up to date news. Great layout with easy to find information on the most current topics. I use this app daily.,
Do not download this it isn't really free. After you download they ask ya for real life cash. Eff that.,
"Lopsided biased reporting especially of the developing world .... Almost on the edge of racism, elitism and jingoism.",
"This is the worst of all biased media, right there with cnn",
Not free ... Only shows story tagline the expects you to subscribe,
"Politically the articles are biased, controlled reporting by Democratic power.  If you want balanced reporting this isn't it",
"Grate app but works very slow, even on bests devices ;(",
App is showing connectivity issue on my new Redmi note 5.,
"Yes your content is good  , BUT YOU WILL CHARGE PEOPLE MINIMUM 20 DOLLARS a month after the first month well i deleted the app right away people should not encourage news apps like these , I would prefer the advertisiers pay for it not common man . Go ahead let the nutheads or people who more money go buy it not me. ?.,,,,,,,,",
"An indispensable companion to daily life, and it's important to support an investigative newspaper in these difficult times",
Its super cool when companies do this IOS only bullocks. /s,
"Stuck in the past, the app cannot update content.",
"Sure it gives you only a one week subscription, but the app is faster than the web version! I would give five star rating if only I could use it for unlimited time without a subscription",
Untrusted bias new source who prefer liberal personal opinions in articles rather than be equal.,
"I hate everything the NYT stands for and publishes, and I hate having it installed as a default app. MAJOR MISTAKE ON SAMSUNG'S BEHALF TO HAVE THE STUPID NYT APP A DEFAULT APP BECAUSE I HATE IT AND CAN'T DELETE IT",
Very nice app  Please update the ugly elections app too,
"All the content can be found for free in other apps like flipboard, Google currents, etc. There is no need to get and pay for a subscription here. Download Google currents or flipboard, it is free and great in a large tablet.",
Development in all levels looking for first youngest billionaire s VsL fusion IO. Educational development technology.,
Not worth keeping this app,
90% of the app is not accessible without paying. Unninstalled!,
Anyone having issues loging in or linking the mobile android app to their home delivery or digital account can call 1800-NYTIMES to get assistance from one of our customer care agents.,
Never downloaded this but it does it on its own every week,
Finally an app that is worth installing by NYTimes... The new beautiful design makes it so much better!,
"All the News THEY See Fit to Print. I encourage everyone to search for ""false reporting"" and ""New York Times."" This isn't the paper it once was. It's now a pay for play tool for lobbyists.",
"The Calibre newsfeed for Kindle is still the best way to get the ""Times.""  There's very little content.",
"with interactive content and a user-friendly look and ""feel"".  The available option to switch between the US-centric news and the International edition is especially useful!",
It's gonna a lot of stuff u can get online,
Ended my marriage. And it wouldn't ever download either.,
Can't uninstall and when I disable it it just comes right back so this is spam,
Am tempted to root just to be rid of them,
"Too many popups, etc for casual reading. Uninstalled and will read the mobile site instead.",
I hate the NY TIMES. I had this app set not to auto update and it keeps updating on its own. I wish to uninstall this junk but there is no option. Fix this glitch please! Its pathetic that my device has this as a default app!,
Says i don't have internet coverage though i clearly  garbage application.,
I love reading the news from my bed in my device every morning. I absolutely love their Morning and evening briefings.,
"The nyt should tell the truth they are just the advertising arm of the 
Democratic Party!",
You can read Only 10 articles per month.,
"Extremely biased app, the failing new york times is FAKE NEWS!",
"Love so many of the artist who support this, waste of time and money.",
"The description of this app is misleading! I wouldn't mind paying for news, and the NYT is one of the last semi trustworthy news sources, but it's not ""free.""",
It was OK before I found out you had to pay to read it.,
Cannot remove from my tablet. Only disable (but not remove). I didn't ask for this crap on my tablet. I'm not an American so it's useless bloatware.,
"A fine app, but I cannot imagine a more biased news source.",
The app looks great and functions well. But I'm a paid subscriber and hate the ads enough to cancel my subscription.,
"Works as well or better than most apps. Great way to keep up with ""the paper of record.""",
"Since 1st time I visited new york I was hooked on the paper, great to be reading it on phone in uk",
I have always had ny times for free with complete articles and ad supported. Now if you want complete article you have to pay and still see ads.,
I dont want it on my tablet yet cant uninstall it.  Very poor app.,
I am not going to let this app be on my phone when all I have is 4 articles to read maybe for a month.,
Fake News. Use to be a respectful news paper. Don't practice real journalism.,
When it was free it was great. I bought it and it dose not work. Use the free one its great. Dont buy it.,
"Uses up a bit of battery, but otherwise serves is purpose perfectly",
Since I updated to ICS. Epic Touch,
Flawless offline reading in the train every morning thanks to preloaded content. The newest version of the all is great.,
I can't comment using the app. There used to be no issue now there is no option to comment.,
New York Times says free app. What you start using it they want to charge you.  You just lost a good customer.  I will never buy your paper again.!!!,
"10 articles allowed before pay wall. I always felt the time frame of 10 articles a month was confusing. Does the month start on the 1st, or is it when you first log in? I removed the app from my phone.",
"It needs permission to see whom you are calling in order to work?  No thanks, I'll just use the browser",
"Its great but you need to optimize the widget, widgets didn't load when I restart my phone",

Download for free but you have to pay a subscription.,
Do not teach us how our culture is. Focus on yours.,
What's up with this new full page ad that cannot be closed?  The only options are to click on it or close the app and uninstall? I chose the latter.,
only app on my note2 that crashes and i dont even really use it,
Good app if you want to pay subscription,
Unwanted app keep trying to un install it and it keeps coming back,
App crashed 5 times in first 2 minutes -> deleted the app after 3 minutes...,
App is very useful to gollow my chosen sections.,

Garbage app.  Don't waste your time or money,
Why would anyone pay for limited news when there are 100s of news aggregators with better interfaces and content?!?,
Can No Longer Be Trusted as Legitimate News Source!,
NYT is democrap one sided liberal controlled BS. Screw those idiots,
How do I get this shot off my tablet,
"It only gives you the headlines, then when you click on the artical they want you to subscribe.  I get the Washington post app, they dont charge you for the news. It would seem the times isn't keeping up with the Times",
Great layout. Breaking news. Get interactive articles on the app.,
Sluggish resulting in Android message 'stopped working' on new pixel.,
I love being able to keep up on the latest happenings in the world.    The New York Times has great writers who do extensive research before writing their articles.  It is NOT fake news.   I live across the country from NY and find every story in the NYT to be relevant to my life.  I  have only been a prescribed for a few months but find this to be my go-to application to get current reporting on every important topic to me.,
I wish I had a choice what crap apps are on my phone,
very biased toward the liberal and alt left point of view,
No longer working on my Galaxy S III,
I'm an active subscriber of the Times. And I intend to keep up my subscription. But I gave the app 2 stars and uninstalled it from my phone when the latest update wanted access to my calls. Tell me why a news paper would want access to my calls? Why?!,
Very difficult to read with flashing neon colored ADs.,
Started crashing whenever I tried to change sections of the paper!,
Fake and paid news. Shame on you NYT and your fake journalists.,
"Liberal garbage. Most biased articles, even worse than CNN. Total garbage.",
"I am interested in the awesome recipes, but they are not accessible from this app, therefore it was a waste of time for me.",
"Another app and site that costs.     And yet there are better free app out there.     Why do folks support this model?    5 stars to USA Today, CNN and cool NBC apps.",
"I can now read news via mobile, thanks you ny times",
"it's stupid, everytime I click a link it automatically opens this!",
What is wrong with kindle users that we don't get to have an app for our nytimes subscription. Such a irresponsive oversight,
It won't download. I am UK bases,
U have been burnt on ur face u tried to mock india now iindia is mocking u,
"I find some articles useful, but it's really not worth reading their reporting!",
"You guys insist that you want to bring great news to the American people, but you choose to have a subscription. I'd rather watch Fox News, which is free, even though it sucks.",
"The thing is that when you have apps like the Guardian, who deliver the same quality, but charge less than £2.50 a month, you're in trouble. Move with the times NYT, people have media coming out of their ears.",
Try the WSJ instead - a much better App!,
"Excellent journalism, good website, but terrible search function.",
Its really bad when they make an app free but you have to subscribe and pay 99 cents to see all the news when fox and CNN are free !,
Articles are not free so i am  disappointed,
Absolutely the most unethical in the USA.,
Love the ease of going through headlines and brief synopses.  Always a breeze catching up on the latest news.,
very inaccurate reporting details particularly on international news segment,
Fake news and very biased opinions. Poor newspaper.,
"I can download 10 other news apps with full stories, payments required? Wth waste of my time, had to uninstall",
Love/Hate. Love the info. Hate the loss of time invested reading info.,
Wrong incomplete negative information about countries other than US. Always.,
Awful app. Website is plagued with ads and takes forever to load. Horrible,
When did the New York Times start working for the NSA? For the life of me I can't understand why this app needs to access not only my phone number what the phone number of whoever I might be calling.,
"No good, not free.",
Why am I paying a subscription fee to see large obnoxious ads? Sorry... uninstalled.  It only gets two stars but it didn't crash and was fairly responsive on my Nexus 7.,
What else do you need to know! Just get it.,
This update is great! Finally worth using on a tablet.,
"Has a lot of news, used to love it. Too biased.",
The monthly price of $12 per month is way too high.  How about dropping that down to $5 per month?,
NYT are a bunch of bullies and hypocrites. They spread lies.,
It's quite cool an app n keeps you in touch with everything NY :D,
For some reason I can't uninstall this app.,
I get better news from this app. The explanations are detail,
Use to be the best . Now out of touch bias news,
"Drivivg me mad, will not uninstall.",
"Paying for an app means you shouldn't have to deal with advertiments, you heard?  I go out of my way NOT to buy products or services from companies that advertise on paid apps.",
Very concerned about hiring racist staff such as Sarah Jeoung.,
Now I can read about what this leftys media is saying and know if your thoughts are alike or if you really more like 60% of Americans are like. Americans.,
I want to delete this app but it won't let me 😠😠,
It truly sucks. Screwed up my phone,
One of the most biased corrupt news outlets i have ever read....,
3 articles a day? Adopt a new business model; embrace the digital age.,
This app leaves me well informed. I LOVE it!,
This is an excellent app for keeping up with national/world events in the midst of a busy day.,
I only rated it 5 stars because its rating 5 stars in stupitity,
Perminantly installed on my samsung ipad whennot wanted.  Always finds ways to have notifications,
Princess Angelika Latufuipeka Tuku'aho Leone My Future Kingdom Passport Fifita copyright law,
advertisement bugs me all the times reading news!,
Enjoyed this app. It compliments the online and iPad app and provides quality info anf multimrdia.,
It is supposed to figure out my subscription. It seems like don't know  what to do...,
"Loves it, keeps me up to date on what is going on around this country and the world as a whole",
A great digital representation of the newspaper.,
Pay wall. one star is too generous.,
Galaxy S5 NY Times Online version is really very well organized and easy to navigate.,
I don't want this. Bloatware that can't be uninstalled.,
"Great app, great content. I need to manually refresh sometimes.",
I am so happy with the NYTIMES! They give great news!,
Video adds make reading articles impossible in the app,
You only get 10 free articles a month. USAtoday is free. I like free.,
Wanted me to pay after reading four articles.,
"Why on earth would I continue to pay an extra $5 a month for an app that has ads that detract from the reading experience and more often than not just links to the website on articles that aren't front page? I wouldn't, and I won't.",
New York Times outstanding paper enjoy news coverage. Keeps me updated on everything.,
cost to much when free up to date news is everywhere,
Thanks for authors,
My automatic upgrade failed so i had to uninstall.,
Great! It's very good to be active around the work by the help of this newspaper :),
"Useless app, won't load",
The only thing that I can get honest .,
"Stupid application, impostor. Forcing yourself on people.. Don't allow people to uninstall. Shame on you!",
Sad that you need to pay to read full website,
Sale's pitch is that it's free only to find out after a few free articles it cost big bucks to keep!!! So what's really free; their big tax deduction wasn't enough!!!,
"Articles load quick, easy to maneuver through and helpful on the go!",
Can't stop it from updating after I've disabled it.,
I love the app and the Times but it is a real battery killer. Had to uninstall.,
Uninstalled.,
it has ad and i still need to pay money it does not make sense,
I won't pay for a subscription to news I can get elsewhere.,
Not worth it for the price  And it freezes all the time,
Only three free articles and ads.,
The App works great. The Times keeps me informed and thinking.,
By far the best newspaper I have read,
Morning briefings count toward '10 article per month' limit. Why use this app when I can get unlimited briefings via your newsletter?,
It simply does not read like the whole paper. Idk why.,
"Not only can you not move this app to the SD card, but after only 2 days the amount of storage is takes up increased from the 2.07 MB of a fresh install to over 14 MB.",
This is about New York city),
Didn't tell me about the bird,
Guess whose app I uninstalled?  That probably makes me less polite than your Nazi friends but I'm okay with that.  I'll get my news elsewhere.,
Way too biased and liberal to enjoy.,
Unacceptable.,
"Free app but when you pursue more than ten articles in a MONTH, whoopsie, you hit the paywall! Frack you!",
I'm back as a subscriber. So is dark mode. Thanks NYT -for all you do!,
"Best news app.  Well rounded for information. Updated frequently, beautiful layout.",
Finally. Just need dark mode to save battery.,
Well...it's great at first if you don't mind paying for news after the free trial,
"Since the last update, it crashes every time I open the app. Also does my IHT subscription not allow me access to all content? Not even world news? That seems unfair.",
Room for improvement; Better UI navigation and landscape mode in ios version.,
Very useful and bring the news promptly. Robert,
After awhile you have to subscribe and pay.,
Does not update the news when I press the Update button. In this case no news is bad news.,
"Al the news that's fit to print.  It's all here, easily found and read.",
Bias liberal propaganda and anything but news...so sad.,
One sided coverage,
I like reading the NYT but nearly all is paid content now.,
There's no equal to the nyt!,
"CEO TOMYDON PRODUCTIONS. MUSIC PRODUCER, SONG WRITER, PUBLISHER, BILLBOARDS TOP 100 MEMBERS OF: ASCAP. SESAC. BMI.",
Nothing good to say about the NYC or the app.,
Great journalism packaged for convenient reading on my Galaxy S8. Vital for me,
"The '5*Rated' NY Times' ""IS GETTIN_Some ¡BAD PRESS (¡?¡) WORSE CLAIMS of UNKNOWN POLICY/SUBSCRIPTION Fees' 05/14 Free'APP Relase!

Yes live digital media. Creator,
Takes for ever to update please fix!,
Dont need it.. useless fake news,
Not many free articles.,
They are Too Liberal and a Liar on the News !,
Very user friendly. Go-to app for reliable news coverage.,
"""What You Need to Know"" is a great way to start my day.",
Only get about 20free article readings after which they ask you to pay a hefty sum to continue using the app,
Fix your software already!,
Fake news.  Terrible spoon fed propaganda.,
They work by purpus not the truth,
Great reporting but I think there should not be a cost attached for subscription.,
If you want a good news update from one of the premier papers this is it.,
"Fake news, and they hate white people. F*** these racist idiots",
need some improvement,
Pretty pointless app unless you pay,
this is the most racist thing i have ever seen,
The last update works fine and smoothly with my gs2.,
NY times is my pet news paper I love reading the news in this paper only,
Always promote human issues,
Remove ads for subscribers and I will change this to 5 stars.,
Wrong news are given here.,
Many stories for to read everyday,
Got rid of this app because they seem to refuse to just report the news and instead want to put a their own twist on everything,
This is an essential tool for those who like to get updated about the world,
This app will give your phone AIDS,
If you like ads and locked articles,
Not willing to pay for it.,
Wants you to pay.  Lame,
All the News the CIA approves for you to read,
"Doesnt update, doesnt give a list of articles, NOT FREE AT ALL!!!!",
T.P.O. because not free (totally pissed off),
If you want money stop showing it as a free app!,
Can't log in   I get the error that I am offline when trying to log in.,
I am looking forward to I read and looing forward to many new reading,
I like very much your news,
Bloatware rubbish I never asked for,
Mainstream Propaganda,
To know what  happened  n what is happening around the world,
I like that i can read read and educate myself for free I'm loving it.,
The widget doesn't update,
Family you are so get us all togather..a-man,
Fake news NY failing fake news. SAD.,
Totally nothing. Aftee the update,
"Nothing much, keep up the good work,,cheers",
Great source for news and analysis.,
The New York Times is journalism at it's best!,
not a good are bad new for now,
Totally unfair reporting,
"It's the NY Times, it speaks for itself.",
Screws their readers yet again... The 'Old Grey Lady' needs to be euthanized.,
If I could I would unistall,
Should add better features and also commentary section,
Important news updates with thorough analysis,
Great app that gives you access to the information you need,
Subscription price is too much!,
I don't need this crap I live in Europe,
Gives me all the info I'm in need of.,
I seem that's the most trusted news Portal.,
ALWAYS ON TIME THE BEST APP EVER!,
"I pay for this app, don't like to see ads.",
Thank you for not treating Android like a 2nd class citizen.,
Teaser app. Need to suscribe. Delete it.,
Takes an eternity to load and hangs on movied category. Why not load up info as its needed? Useless ap,
They are driving me to distraction!!!,
It's really super apps for getting information about everything.,

Would use if not for paid subscription.,
"Good user interface, very intuitive.",
Make I give you a trial,
Daily news to keep you updated on national and world news.,
"Very user-friendly. Plus, outstanding coverage and content.",
Why does one of the best newspapers in the country had one of the worst apps? It's always locking up.,
"Great app, love it.",
5 stars if it would update consistently. Moto Droid.,
I think that this is a great app. Easy to share info.,
"We'll researched, timely information",
Awesome.I enjoy it very much.,
"even with my $15/ month paid subscription, this app still subjects me to advertisements on every screen?  canceled.  nyt, are you listening?",
Didn't update well use of other apps that work better,
No complaints this app is ready with current news on the go and on the subway worth every penny for the digital subscription,
Pops up when im busy wont delete continues to update after I disable the app which inables it again,
Pretty neat. Free for three months from doing reviews on maps,
"Very informative, unparallel, I enjoy a lot. Thanks for sharing.",
Wish I could have more access to articles without having to be subscribed.,
A great source for new!,
Stays installed after uninstall process.,
Uninstalled app once they started limiting me to 10 articles per month.,
New articles are not loading and then it crashes,
The one in Chicago is way better,
Great app lots of good information. Useful i like it.,

Watch out for this app. Got a free trial through Google. Went to cancel afterwards. And apparently you just can't. Sent the customer service an email. Nothing. Called in. Nothing. I'm still paying for it. Guess I'll cancel my bank card so they can stop taking my money now..,
