Review Text,Category
"Just returned from a cruise today. I used the app but had some concerns. There was a gap between sending and receiving messages. Wanted to see deck layouts, especially for the public use decks. My biggest issue was the inability to research info on places we were visiting, people who we part of the history, etc. I would like access to information similar to that at home. Not cellular at sea, something with better comnectivity.",
There was never enough information available. The text to other cabin members was nice but I found it hard to navigate the app and find where things were and some things seemed redundant while things that were necessary were non-existent. Much more information about the ports should have been provided in plain site .this is not a good substitute for the paper navigator it's supposed to replace. The only thing easy to find and track his meal times and on board showtimes.,
"Essential for cruisers. Very good app. Only criticisms: You must enter your birth date, and can only do so by scrolling a calendar backwards, a month at a time, for decades! It was so ridiculous, we laughed our heads off. Also, filters don't stick, have to select every time. Annoying, but not a terrible flaw. The app is very good at keeping plans and events up to date. Definitely the best cruise line app I've ever used.",
"it shows you activities based on the time in your phone. This sounds like a good idea, but when you're constantly changing time zones and your phone doesn't update (or update correctly) to the right time it causes some usability issues. I did like that I could see the menu for each night at each restaurant even after we ate there. The messaging system from app to app is super slow. Messages between my husband and I were getting delivered 45 minutes after we sent them.",
"While the app is helpful in many ways and really a necessity when cruising, there's nothing telling you that you must be connected to the on-board WiFi to fully utilize the app. You cannot just search locations, you are not shown where you are, no directions where you need to go next, that sort of thing. UI and UE both lacking at best, confounding at worst. Disney, you can do better!",
"It's a good concept but poorly executed. the texting would take anywhere from instant to hours to send a message, which is honestly the main point of it. It has some other great tools like the ship map and itinerary that were excellent. To be honest the texting issue is mostly due to I'm sure to connectivity to the wifi on the ship. However, this kind of thing should have been kept in mind when developing it. it would also be great to have access to the Disney on demand stuff within the app.",
"Really helpful. It notifies the events, shows, meet and greets, characters, and pictures. You need to make sure your phone clock is the correct time for the app to navigate things perfectly and on point. Only downfall is that the text messages are notified later than usual and some phones' navigators didn't connect until a few hours later. Other than that it was really helpful.",
"This app kept disconnecting from the on board wifi which made it impossible to communicate through the app with other people in our party. 7 day cruise and it was constantly not working for the 8 of us in our party. The app worked much better when we went on the same cruise 2 years ago! What did you change? The rest of the app in terms of information about events, menus, and locations was great! No complaints there! Just the lack of use between people's phones through the app was a problem.",
"The messaging feature is the best part about this app. If it worked consistently, I'd give this app a rating of all the stars I could. However, I kept having to shut it down and then reopen it in order to load the messages. Not cool especially if this is one of the only ways to communicate with your party on board. The portable wave phones on board in your stateroom are cool but they don't ring, so I always missed the call and the texting app on it is ancient.",
"This app has all the information you need on the cruise, in the strangest navigation you can imagine. There is a disconnect between the personal section and the guidebook section, with unclear navigation between them. Any reservation planned are totally separate from the schedule, and favorites cannot be shared between users. The app also requires a connection to the wifi, which does not stay connected due to no internet access. A few other things are also located in extremely weird places.",
"We really needed this app to work well on our cruise because my family had rooms on different decks of the boat. But unfortunately it hardly worked at all for us. It's partly the app, but mostly the issue is the wifi on the boat (we were on the Magic). Android phones don't like wifi that isn't connected to the internet, and their wifi isn't, so it keeps disconnecting, which resets and freezes the app. Disney really needs to work this out because large groups really have a hard time communicating without it.",
"Dramatically improved! View deck plans, join virtual queues, chat with customer service from the app. I hope they continue investing in it. I'd love to order room service from the app, for example. Another idea could be to use the app as a room key, although that wouldn't help with stateroom lighting. Overall, it's a great app that will make it easy to find cruise activities.",
"The app is a step in the right direction for cruise scheduling, but has some rough edges, in my opinion. The experience off the ship, before and after, could be improved. Turning on and off the connect@sea internet access was confusing and frustrating relationship with the app. You couldn't share itineraries if you had one planner in the group who liked open events. I couldn't find any search functionality for specific events. Overall glad I had it, but needs some more investment.",
"We've used this app two years in a row. This year, the interface was better and I liked having our navigator electronically. I also LOVED being able to see times for shows and character meets, being able to make a list of favorites, and being reminded of scheduled events. The messaging functionality, the most essential, was unreliable. I continued to receive push notifications for other apps, but wouldn't get messages if my phone was locked. Messaging should work flawlessly.",
"Overall, it was a good experience to use while onboard. It was really difficult to use for the 1st time onboard. We downloaded it beforehand, but it wouldn't link to the room or connect to the wifi. We followed the provided instructions to no avail. We ended up deleting the app and re-downloading it. There are bugs trying to book onboard reservations (time not available but still shows as available).",
"The texting feature on this app is very buggy. There were MANY times during our cruise where there was a significant time lapse between a message being sent and delivered. Sometimes for a couple hours. It made onboard communication and planning frustrating. The electronic cruise navigator was nice but it could be improved with better descriptions of the activities. Overall, this app is better than nothing, but there is a lot of room for improvement.",
"It was great to see all the activities and more on the app, but as for communicating with people through the texting part of the app, the Navigator did not successfully send and receive texts in real time. The app had to be open and running to send and receive texts, which killed our phone batteries. Other than that, it was decent.",
"Every time my phone screen shutoff, I'd have to reconnect to the ship's Wi-Fi when walking the phone up. Also, the texts/notifications would not come through unless the phone was awake and I had the app actively open. In other words, it's useless for texting or knowing when to pick up your kids. Three only thing it's good for is the daily schedule/menu. The connect@sea desk hardly looked up from his computer and said ""it's a bug in the app. Been like that for months.""",
"There are many new nice features on the app including more detailed dining info and allowing booking of a placeholder in app. The new chat features are also nice. However, the schedule is just too hard for a lot of people who don't want to use a phone all the time. I understand that there is no paper navigator any more, but why not still create the old ""paper"" Navigator as a pdf to be a accessed in the app? That would allow a lot more useability for people that loved the paper version.",
"In theory, the app is great. The access to daily schedules, menus, character greetings etc. was all very helpful. The downside was getting it working in the first place (so much trouble logging in and loading reservation), and the texting feature was very inconsistent. My wifi dropped nearly every time I went to send a text and often there were people in my party that never received messages. Frustrating for communication, but helpful for information.",
Great for checking daily activities and booking things. But the chat feature wasn't consistent. Messages were delayed a lot of times. Sometimes you would get a push notification when you received a new message. Other times you would have to go into the app and then multiple notifications pop up🙄 That was frustrating when trying to communicate with your party.,
Excellent application that is very intuitive and easy to use. Love the instant messaging feature especially for parents to be able to communicate if you go to different events on the ship. Huge plus to be able to recieve messages from the youth services team when your kid is ready to be picked up from the Kids club. The ability to save favorite events and get reminded as they get closer to happening was great. The daily itinerary being live updated really awesome as well. Deck maps didnt work.,
"This worked great! I'd love it if they had an overlay schedule like they have for the paper navigator. I do hope they will still have the paper navigator upon request for those who don't have a smartphone or want to disconnect from their devices. Also for those of us to have as mementos. I love looking back at them when I'm at home. But, I really loved this and enjoyed using it. It was easy and had everything I could've needed!",
"the app is a lot better than many of the reviews indicated. We just got back from a 7-night cruise and first use of the app. The biggest negative is the lack of text notifications, but that is not really a problem if you check it regularly. I have an android and set the permissions to allow notifications always from the app, this seemed to help with the speed of the notifications/texts. The app did forward requests for pick up from Oceanear's Club, same as the wave phones",
Overall the app was nice to have while on the cruise. The messages did not always go through even when the app said they had been delivered. It did not have times for breakfast and lunch each day. It would have been nice to see all of that information in the app. Loved seeing all of the activities for the day as well as dinner plans and restaurants for your set dining. Messaging was nice when it worked. Thanks!,
"While it's a useful app, it can use some improvements. One issue is the filter sometimes does not work. Also when you click info on a particular event when you go back to the main page, it starts you at the beginning of the day instead of where you were so you have to scroll all the way back...frustrating when you're searching something in the evening.",
"The app was not consistent while on board ship. I would favourite some activities and it was hit or miss whether I could see them later. Even after refreshing, I would not necessarily see the activities. I ended up going down to guest services each day to pick up a paper copy of the Navigator so I wouldn't miss any activities. Hopefully all the bugs will be worked out for my next cruise because I really like the idea of the app.",
This app is horrible. The text messaging for communication did not work reliably. The internet doesn't shut off. It's difficult to navigate. It impacted our trip with unnecessary anxiety and stress. We looked forward to unplugging and going on vacation and we are forced to plug in? Old fashion print out and itenaries work. We found out where to pick up the printouts the last two days. The wave phones are not an option they only vibrate. Lack of communication for our group was stressful.,
The app has improved over the past year. There were a few things we found needed improvements. First you had to always be online for the app to work. You never got notified when you received a text message. Plus we noticed you could not filter events. ie you could not request adult events for the day instead you had to scroll through all events. It would be nice if they could add to the app the ability to contact the spa to make an appointment or order room service. Just a few thoughts.,
"Very helpful with viewing daily schedule and activities. The chat function needs work, and it was hard to schedule popular events through the app, but the option to try was nice. The map was semi helpful; being able to see where things are was good, but it was cumbersome to use and does not show you where you currently are on the ship.",
"There are a couple of very annoying design flaws in the UI. First, when entering my birthdate at the start of the trip, I had to tap through every month of every year instead of just entering the numbers or selecting them from separate lists. I had to tap over 650 times to get back to my birth month!!!!! It took about 10 mins!!! Second, the search filter reset every 30 seconds when the data refreshed. This was frustrating as I had to keep reentering my filter selections!!!",
"The app is great! However, it relies heavily on the WiFi service onboard while sailing, which doesn't ""play well"" with the phone's OS ""need"" to be connected to the Internet always. The onboard activities and schedules are well presented on the app, however, some lack details. The chat feature would be a great trip companion to gather and communicate with other people travelling with you, but because of the WiFi being dropped off, it doesn't always get messages.",
"the app was almost completely useless. my sister and I both had different events on our apps that never correlated with the actual events taking place. they never updated on time, and the description for events were vague and useless. the fact that you cannot click on your excursions to see what you signed up for was unhelpful. the best feature was the ability to see the daily menus for dinner.",
"Much better than a couple of years ago. Now has better itinerary information. Could actually get by without the paper navigator now. Took two stars away because Android version of the app (at least on a moto x4) has a major usability issue: when looking at activities, half of the screen is taken up by an image representing the day, leaving only to to view a couple of activities at a time as you scroll. This issue doesn't exist on iOS, where the image goes away when you scroll.",
"The app is useful on the cruise, but is lacking in a few key areas. 1. Using the app before the cruise, all important tasks redirect you to the website in a separate window. Things like check in and modifications all happen this way. It very much detracts from the streamlined experience. 2. While on the cruise, the maturity of the messaging aspect of the app is sorely lacking. Messages sent to family members in the same (or other) cabins were often received hours later, or not at all.",
"Great for checking the schedule and getting reminders about events; not so great with messaging. We were hoping to stay in contact with our teenager through the app. There were significant delays, especially the first day at sea, with message delivery. It would have been nice to have the ability to add photos to help locate folks on the ship or to share experiences. When it worked, it was nice. Love the emojis.",
"The app doesn't work at all. I get past the log in page, but as soon as I mark that I agree to the supplemental terms and conditions it says 'Updating' with a spinning wheel that just keeps spinning. I've deleted and re-downloaded the app. I've left my screen on for over an hour and left the app open, but it never goes past that screen. Makes the app a little difficult to use if it doesn't work at all.",
"Overall very useful. The ""texting"" feature was highly useful. There is no internet on board, so being able to message family members via this app was very useful. Other useful features like seeing your itinerary and available activities was also helpful. Getting off the boat was kind of slow; would have liked a ""now you go"" indicator in the app.",
"The DCL app was useful, and moderately intuitive. Your app could be a little easier to navigate though. The app needs to include an easy to follow map of the ship to assist your guests with moving about. And each event listed on the schedule should show a small thumbnail that shows the entrance of the venue. Once we chose an event to attend, the next question is ""where?"". Stating ""Deck 4, Aft"" is just not ample. The itinerary and scheduling format is pretty good.",
"A useful, must-have while you are on the ship. Messaging needs a lot of improvements in terms of delivering delay, reliability and features (sending pictures, group chat, etc). Activities should be cached so it can still work without the wifi connection. Overall a good start but still has a long way to go.",
We sailed with a party of 17. The app was helpful in communicating with everyone in their various places onboard. We found that we had to frequently close and reopen the app in order to keep messages current. Also the ship's WiFi was spotty at times which sometimes interfered with getting messages in a timely manner. Great for keeping up with all the various activities and shows that were continuously running onboard. Definitely worth downloading!,
"The only thing that prevented me from giving 5 stars is the fact that the app froze and/or crashed frequently. The also send to be a delay in receiving messages; sometimes they wouldn't show up until you opened the app again. The app is very useful to find your way around the ship, and find times and locations of things you want to do. Very easy to use.",
"The ship-board handouts pushed this app as the main method for messaging the rest of your party. Nice idea to have onboarding text capability that doesn't require you to pay for the expensive wifi. However, the messaging feature was completely useless. Messages were routinely delayed for 2+ hours, making it impossible to do any meaningful coordination with our party. This led to missed events. The crew acknowledged this as a known issue but didn't have any useful solutions.",
"very useful for getting the itinerary on the ship. the chat piece would've been great but the wifi on the ship kept disconnecting while we were on the ship, for my whole party. so it wasn't just my phone. went to guest services for assistance but they acted like we were the only ones it was happening to and said it must've been a setting on the phone. other than that, was very useful.",
"From a UX perspective, the app wasn't the easiest to use. Ultimately we were able to get the information we needed but navigation could've been easier. For example, it would have been nice to have the paid activities hooked up to the schedule so if it's booked you don't see it as available. I did like how you can see all the times an activity was offered.",
"very helpful! this app really helps maximize your cruise experience. one upgrade I would suggest is the ability to chat with groups of people. maybe you can and I just never figured it out. it would also be good if you could add events to the app. for example, add family members spa treatments so you knew that person couldn't go to Disney trivia!",
"Nice app. It worked when connected to the ship's wifi but be aware you'll be prompted to sign in to the ship's wifi service - and you don't need to for the app to work. Just having your wifi on and connecting to the DCL Guest SSID is enough and no further web portal authentication is needed, in my experience. The messaging feature did not reliably work; keep the wave phones handy. Notifications (kids self checkin out of activities, etc ) can't be cleared. You'll receive alerts again and again for messages you've already read. The activity schedule was top notch though. We never missed a thing. Editing to add that to select a date you MUST tap through a calendar one month at a time. Not cool if you are selecting a birthday from 1970",
"Useful app while onboard, but very unstable connection. Onboard app only works when you're on airplane mode. When you're at the port or have a cellular connection, the app is unable to connect or update. This was especially difficult when checking in at the muster station and no one could connect to the app. The staff kept asking if anyone had an iPhone to use instead since that works better which was frustrating to hear. Also, wish the app had prices for fitness classes listed!",
"A little tour of features would be handy! I didn't know there was a map of the ship until days after we departed! And then showing our location on the map would be exceedingly useful. But I loved seeing all the activities listed by time, having the ""favorites"" feature where they show up on your itinerary, and being able to sort activities by age (125 activities per day is amazing, but lots to scroll through!). You can also find a location and see what's happening there specifically, and when.",
I wish it was designed better to see all activities. Half the screen was devoted to seeing a picture of the ship. It was difficult to see the coming events. Also I wish the texting component had a vibration with sound feature. It would have been helpful. We also were receiving texts 2 to 3 hours after our children would send texts.,
App was good with information. Only problem I had was you had to do airplane mode & wifi. If you did just wifi you got a charge. Also the times weren't accurate. If you go into a different time zone then it was all off because if you have your phone ser to automatically update then it's all thrown off. Also if you are associated with more than 1 stateroom then you wont be able to text with everyone. Only the people in your stateroom.,
"Good idea, but very poor execution. It CONSTANTLY gave incorrect info, both wrong dates, even for big events like one of the evening musicals, and times. It was often giving us reminders 45 minutes after things happened because of a time zone change that our phones recognized, but the app decided not to for no apparent reason. It could be a good app, but it's so so unreliable that I really found it frustrating and would rather not have had to use it.",
The app seemed to work okay. The wifi on the ship (Dream) was terrible. I bought the medium package that ran out in 30 minutes. I turned off everything I could find on our phone and bought the medium package again and had the same results. $80 for 40 minutes is pretty ridiculous as i am not a heavy data user. Otherwise awesome week!! 😁,
"The UI is very disorganized. Almost all the information I could want is present, but it's all over the place and very difficult to navigate. Users in your party/stateroom cannot see each other's favorites and coordinate a unified schedule. Finally, why isn't the primary menu button always available to click?",
"This app is good for leading up to the cruise. Exciting to see the countdown and book onboard activities. While onboard the ship, I feel it could be better. The ability to call other passengers, not just message would be super helpful. Plus an onboard GPS would also be a plus. Daily weather forecasts might be useful too.",
"App is overall decent while onboard and before the ship sets sail, but messages while on the ship were sometimes quite a bit delayed for us. It would also be nice if there was a wait list for excursions/activities that are fully booked so that when someone drops, whoever is next in line is automatically signed up or is at least alerted. Having to go into the app to check multiple times per day of someone has dropped the activity you're looking to book is not user friendly.",
"Completely useless. To add a reservation you need to enter your birthdate. It forces you to click backwards month by month for years starting from 2006. Once you complete that torture, it won't find your reservation and you'll need to start over again. And again. The deck plans don't load while on ship. Neither does it allow me to send messages while onboard. Sometimes I receive them, but then they disappear, never to be seen again. The frustration is Worse than not having an app at all.",
"We relied on the app to communicate across a large group. The problem we had was that it was very unreliable with sending messages, some people were getting messages an hour later and this was while we were trying to meet up with each other in the ship. The app design itself is fine, we just wish the connection want so spotty and iffy. Also cost wise for wifi, we pretty much had no other option but to use this app. TLDR: app design is fine but connection and reliability were abysmal.",
The app did not work as advertised. We were never able to book activities through the app. Causing us to miss out on events. The chat function did not always work and messages would get delivered late or not at all. Very frustrating when you are trying to coordinate family activities. The wifi would randomly drop and require you to sign in again to use it. Since there is no other way of communication on the ship there should be more reliable communications and greater functions.,
"Not good. There is tons of potential and very little follow through. The staff is pretty great, it's the timing and services that are very unsatisfactory. I had to leave my cabin and find a place on the ship where my wifi (additional charges per device) would actually work just to leave this review. In that same purchase I'm supposed to be able to make and receive phone calls (I had to go to shore and turn on my roaming cell service to do so). Unfortunately I am unable to say more, out of space",
"Doesn't meet expectations. Disney has a reputation for quality. Quality does not discribe this app. The app itself is a bit clunky and not very easy to just pick up and navigate. The app does have some features that would be very useful however, the ships wifi dropps signal all the time and while the access point shows as connected the site needs to manually be logged into. For this app to be useful it needs to log in when the app connects, which is really a problem with ships WiFi.",
This is great when it works. We had a lot of issues with the texting aspect of the app. It would tell you that the message was sent to your party and then not send tue message. This makes communication extremely difficult. Otherwise it's great. Shows you what's going on each day and includes a map for ease.,
"Usually I love the app, especially leading up to our cruise date. Not happy that now, one year later, we have to log on to the app EVERY TIME we want to see the countdown clock!! It is bad enough that I can't put this app on my preteens phone so they can see the countdown clock, too. Now they can't look at the countdown clock on my phone without me having to log in first! Very inconvenient!",
The app really helped when I wanted to know about what was happening on board the ship and helped me plan my days. The messaging feature was problematic though. The messages wouldn't always send and I would receive notifications for messages only when I went on the app. Aside from that everything was working fine.,
"Great for planning activities, viewing dinner menus in advance, viewing account balance, etc. The app is supposed to be useful for staying in touch with other members of your group, but was not always reliable. The phones in the room were better for staying in touch, but bulky to carry.",
"App is great for daily activities, account balance and menus. It was great to be able to now book Excursions and reservations through the app like the web. The chat feature has improved since the app started but still lacks tremendously in functionality. There were times messages didn't show up until the next day which made difficult to locate family members on the ship. Additionally the wi-fi often kicked you off the network causing messages and schedule notifications to be missed.",
The app was great but it kept logging me out of the WiFi so i had to keep clicking on keep connection and then my texts would go through to my party. loved being able to see all the events around the ship right at my fingertips. Loved the Disney emojis. it just added to the fun. Being able to check my account and see what was on the menu for dinner was AMAZING!,
"great to be able to communicate with others on the ship and nice to have access to navigator, maps, schedules, menus, etc. would be nice to be able to text more than one person at a time. sometimes texts were slow at going through. sometimes lost connection on the ship.",
"Have had the app since our cruise last Sept. It was fun to watch the dates flyby  till our next cruise. Suddenly today I needed to open a new version of this app. I did, I tried, but keep going in circles.  No app to view at all. I will be calling, but am very disappointed!  May 12, 2019, still unable to download app. I am not sure about email on my phone, never do it. I followed instructions, to a ""t"" says it downloaded, go to Google app store to ooen, I did, but wen right back to step one. So, the ships no longer have the daily paper navigator on board? I hope they are available at least. I'm old school. Thank you.",
"The app is nice for seeing your itinerary, cruise events, and ship map. However, it is very buggy. It crashed frequently and messages were delayed. It may be more stable on IOS. My wife has an iPhone and her experience was better. Also to enter my birthday I had to arrow back through every month using Android. IOS did not have the same issue.",
"App is clunky to use. It is cumbersome to link reservations between staterooms. App will not push notifications, so messages and reminders come in very late. Unfortunately you're stuck using the app onboard the ship as there are no other options. We ended up texting over wifi to stay connected in real time. Unfortunately data on the ship is incredibly expensive at $89 per gb.",
"The app has just been installed and will not let me log in or create a new account even, it pops up with an error message/apology. It is up to date as is my phone, I have other Disney apps that work no issues, but this one obviously has issues! I tried to uninstall and start over, still had the same login issues.My other Disney accounts allow my login no issue. I hope this is resolved before my cruise!",
"A world of room for improvement. Navigation is extremely unclear, and I only found additional tabs of schedule categories by accident. Deck plans need to zoom farther to be fully legible, and it would help to update to user's location. Cruise event descriptions are notoriously uninformative, in or out of the app. Needs updates to actually make appointments, order room service, book shore excursions -- maybe even access photos and order products.",
"This time (second cruise) using the app was a great improvement over the first time using it. So much that I don't have time to mention it all. Easier to find specific details and scheduled events, ship layout, and dinner menus, etc... This app helpfulness was very useful for us and our kids to make plans, meet up times and places convenient.",
"Good app, but I have suggestions 1.) similar to the way Google Maps works, if you wanted to go to an event, the app would show you the quickest path there. 2.) It would be nice to have a widget displaying things like a countdown to your cruise or the events that you liked. 3.) I would love to see more features for texting, such as calling and uploading photos and videos. 4.) Since Disney records the events it would be nice to have a live streaming section. 5.) The ability to order room service",
"The schedule of events and reminders were super helpful. The messaging app is a little glitchy and it's sometimes easy to miss messages. The only time it was an issue was when our kids wanted picked up from the kids club and we didnt see the message. But, overall it's a great tool!",
"App kept crashing during our trip. It was very hard to keep in touch with the rest of our party during our voyage. The messaging part was not instant. It often took hours to get or receive messages. Only gave it 2 stars, because I could see menus, and activities for the day. App needs lots of work!",
I found the app to not flow well. It was difficult to navigate. Just not intuitive. It was also questionable on the connection. Sometimes I received text messages 2 hours after they were sent. So not at all reliable. I feel the app can really afford to have a major overhaul.,
"For 95% I loved the app. Every activity was accurate and easily found. I was keeping a diary of my experiences and wanted to check a past menu however they were no longer available. Also, if the user has overlapping timeslots for activity choices, they are not both remembered on the individual list.",
"I hate having to use an app for everything. Went on vacation to relax away from cell phones, not be hitched to one. Seems like a drop in quality from Disney service to force everyone to use if they don't want to. I would have booked another cruise on board the ship, but did feel comfortable putting private information on app, which was allegedly only way you could do so.",
"The app was an awesome free way to communicate text messages to my family that were on the ship, Magic Kingdom, and Disney's Castaway Cay island. Even if they stayed behind on the ship and you went to the park or Island. Some spots on the ship were dead zones but mostly great all around. Remember to to keep your phone on airplane mode and wireless on, you can remove your SIM card like I did to play it safe. Settings on a cell phone happen to mysteriously uncheck themselves.",
"The layout of the app is good and easy to navigate. It is a bit glitchy for messaging party members and was REALLY confusing to set up the day we boarded. It is completely different on-board, and we had to relink our party members. Staff were willing to help, but there were long lines at guest services just to figure out the app.",
"The app would freeze amd messages from family wouldnt go thru until hours later. Sailed on the Fantasy. When the app did work, it was helpful to know what was happening next. The problem is I had to restart the app.over and over again. Other family members had a better experience with their iPhones. As an Android user my experience was less than magical.",
"Full of glitches. Messages would take hours, sometimes days to reach my party. Schedule would randomly refresh sometimes, making me have to scroll back down to what I was looking at. When it actually worked well it was good though. Useful to see times, locations, and descriptions of events.",
"Very helpful app which kept us updated on various shows times, character greetings, and many other activities while on board of the ship. The app is also helpful in keeping track of all of our chosen activities, including the ones ahore. It keeps track of expenditures which helps if you are on a budget. The app allows family members to communicate with one another via the app text messaging. The app does not require internet connection to be used. It is amazing and we loved it!!!",
"This app was definitely helpful, during the cruise. There did seem to be a delay on time between sending and receiving messages. Additionally, I felt there was something missing. Easy back-keying or something. That said, we really needed this way of communication to keep the grownups and teens together.",
"The app is a little confusing because it doesn't give you your full itinerary until you get on the cruise, and it's not the most intuitive to navigate. Also, the Wi-Fi on the cruise ship is TERRIBLE, so even though Disney wants you to receive notifications on board through the app, it's not very practical.",
"Our window opened to book cruise activities for an upcoming reservation and the app stopped working the same day. We can't access anything on the app and have to go through the website. Unfortunately the website doesn't reliably work either. And we haven't been able to get through on phone lines x2 weeks. Everything is completely worthless since the March 2022 ""upgrade."" Worked fine for prior cruises.",
"Love the cruise. The app needs updates/features that would be important to guests. Even though I'm on airplane mode, with wifi on... The app sometimes won't receive messages if you don't run it(not on foreground). Needs a feature to call other guests by voice(sort of internal voip system between guests). Yes, the state rooms have mobile phones, but we always carry our phones, since it's also a camera. I don't want to carry 2 devices when I'm on vacation. Disney, email me if interested with more.",
"The app is wonderful and we enjoyed having a way to plan our activities on the ship and communicating. It was very easy to add or remove events from our plans. However, the app had trouble at times sending and receiving messages with other guests. It even crashed for most of a day while on the cruise. I'd also like to see an update so that members of a cabin can automatically see what events our members of their party add to their itineraries.",
"App is a great idea and works great for ship maps and the daily navigator, but texting is intermittent at best. Texts sometimes took an entire day to deliver, even with app open. If app closed then texts did not come through or even go waiting for app to be opened. just never arrived. Not good for trying to meet friends or other guests. as person likely had already moved from when they sent message.",
"Good App but still needs some improvement. But I used it on our Cruises and enjoyed it for the most part. I also agree with some other reviewers who said that some text messages didn't show up for hours. But now that Disney Cruise Line is getting rid of the paper Navigator we will all be a bit more dependent on this app (we've been on 3 Disney Cruises and l love that paper Navigator). But you know Disney, save a tree increase a fee.",
"Setup was painful, but good after that... When registering while aboard to the ship, there was seemingly no way to select my birthdate without scrolling back month by month for 30+ YEARS. Maybe it's specific to certain phones as i can't imagine everyone not complaining about this. Schedules and text capabilities were good. App should show which events require registration and show folks to do so.",
"App is good to review on board events and events you have signed up for. The text feature is slow. Wouldn't recieve messages from family until minutes or hours later. Understanding all the people using it on board, the technology needs to be improved for faster text sending and receiving. A word of advise when texting, enter the time you sent the text at the end of your message so the receiving knows extactly the time you sent it.",
"Good UI, better than Royal Carribean. Sadly what makes this app the worst aspect of an otherwise great cruise and the reason I'm giving it two stars is that it loses connectivity to the ship wifi every few minutes! This app is used by daycare to notify you if there is a problem with your children, so I spent a lot of time force quitting, reconnecting, and starting the app again to make sure I wasn't missing messages. Devs need to test this on Android devices under real life conditions.",
"When it worked, it was useful, however so many glitches we finally stopped relying on it. Events would stop showing up, so we would have to re confirm we were booked for things. Trying to add additional time to oceaneers club, I would continually get errors. The pin number I set up for purchases stopped working the 3rd day of the cruise, so had to go down and get it reset. The idea of this app is great, but has a way to go to be fully functional.",
"App is pretty intuitive to use however being the primary form of peer to peer communication on board the chat feature is not reliable at all. Message ""sent"" turn undeliverable few minutes later. If you don't actively monitor the app you would never know. Adding members to the group chat is a feature that should get added to future updates also. Some members of our parties had issues connecting when getting on board. Overall app is just okay and needs some improvement",
"Unreliable! Couldn't get the app to refresh and that caused lots of confusion a paper navigator would have solved. This app shouldn't be viewed as a replacement, rather an extra tool for people who enjoy/demand technology. Because WiFi was unreliable on the Wonder it trickled down to the app too. The most disappointing part of the trip was the app functionality.",
"Not intuitive where to go to find the info needed. More details about debarkation needed: I had no idea that you could skip breakfast and stay in the cabin until ready to leave whenever the debarkation announcement was made. Thought I heard an announcement the day prior that debarking would be in groups, but never saw it anywhere. Very unclear and confusing. Connection to WiFi was terrible, making the app and especially communication with others in our group very difficult and frustrating.",
"The app is easy to use once you get connected to the WiFi on the ship. Your phone may give you errors when connected to the wifi because there is no net access (choose options to ignore the error & use the WiFi as is). When you go to the splash page for the wifi you may think that you need to purchase internet access. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS UNLESS YOU WANT INTERNET ACCESS. Once connected, enter your DOB, name, & room # in the app. Your itinerary will show up w/ available activities.",
The app was very helpful on our cruise. I wish the schedule system was easier to use. When browsing for events it would not remember my filters and when the post refreshed it would jump you back to the top without remembering where I had scrolled to. I wish it had a view that was more like the paper navigators on the boat.,
Absolutely DISASTER trying to use first day and half on recent 5 day cruise. Was on Disney wi-fi. Tried to download 10 times kept timing out. Came 1 hr late to dinner first night had no idea where to go or what time! Never been on a cruise with no info on paper anywhere! Was unprepared to say the least! I have been on 25 plus cruises and this was most frustrating! Disney needs to do a better job communicating that having app is the ONLY way to get info!,
"I had trouble with the app randomly not connecting. I'd get messages hours after they were sent because I was unaware the app was not ""receiving the latest updates."" I'd have to disconnect from the dcl wireless and reconnect to get it to receive my latest messages. When I did get messages the notification sound is so quiet I could hardly hear it.",
"The schedules are difficult to understand the start and end times. it needs to have a better layout to know overlapping events. also inbuilt GPS to go to specific locations will be useful. Chat option only works when app is open. No option to call between app, for which we need to carry wave phones.",
"For all the money Disney seems to have.. which is a lot. All this app seems to be good at is crashing. It never loads when I want to and I always have to exit out of the app to refresh. I loved the Disney cruise. It really is a magical experience, and I would die to get back on the boat. But I feel this app needs to have its many kinks worked out",
"the app while on the cruise kept disconnecting from the DCL_GUEST network. most of the time my family and myself did not receive messages or if we did much later after constantly having to restart the app and reconnect. Being able to have the schedule in hand and map was wonderful. All the emojis are cute,just couldn't use the app half the time",
App was difficult to navigate. It would freeze and often erase my choices. It kept saying error and had to reboot me back in line if I was waiting to connect with guest services services. I had to screen shot my choices as a way to keep track of my choices as I knew as soon as I closed the app my selections would be erased.,
"This app is an incredible source of info for your daily activities once you are aboard the ship and ready to cruise. I would have given it 5 HUGE Stars... however, the texting feature was constantly unable to be used unless you completely closed the app and reopened it. This caused tremendous frustration in our party of 5 with the grandmother and our teens. I was constantly reminding every to ""reset the app,"" because no one would respond or know where to meet or when. Hence, three stars.",
"It is great for seeing the daily activities, drinks, menus, and just about everything else. More times then not i needed to communicate with my wife via the app. The notifications do not display in the action bar every now and then but none the less this app is a must have on the ship! It would also be great if we could see the location of each other on the ship. (we got lost a few times hahaha)",
The DCL App is Not very User intuitive friendly. (and I've been using computers since 1981) More contextual help needs to be added. I had to go to guest services on board the ship to get the app to work properly when connected to the ship wi-fi. Some options were difficult to find.,
"The important texting feature of this USEFUL app was confusing when sending to a single recipient (group text ok). When you attempt to text, if the recipient is offline or out of range, the error message (""not delivered"" in red) is the same as if you yourself are out of range, which can happen. The message is not delivered, and you are not told why. I cannot send a wake-up message to my sleeping mother whose phone is off. Also, notifications persist for expired events. Please fix for 5 stars!",
"It's mostly great, but there were a few times when the messaging completely died. Could not send. And always when we had something important and time sensitive to say to the rest of our party. Everything else worked as expected, but the messaging needs a reliability boost.",
"This app is so buggy and does not function 90 perfect of the time. It crashes everytime I try to view an option on the menu. Not at all what I expect from Disney. If I didn't have to have this app as my sole way to communicate onboard, I would have deleted it already.",
Experience with app was weird No search function. Maps virtually hidden. Cutsey titles did little to convey info so often spent time opening an item then realizing the content was vague. Examples: wanted to know if any of the lounges specialized in martinis. Never figured that out. Searched for specialty coffee . Eventually we figured that out.,
"Super great idea, to have ship info and on board texting. Texts were sometimes delayed, and sometimes not good signal, especially on castaway cay in places. Also a bit awkward adding contacts... would be nice to share contacts and/or look them up by name.",
"I can't use it! I downloaded the app and tried to select the use at home option (not the port/on boat option) and all I get is a blue screen with a spinning loading circle that never stops. I've ensured all permissions are set up, too.",
There's a lot of info but it's hard to navigate. The chat and notifications are useful but you have to stay connected to a wifi network with no internet access and many phones have a hard time with that.,
"""At Home"" Function Broken. Every time you select ""at home"" and log in, as soon as you click on your reservstill it imediately goes back to the home screen asking you to select ""on ship"" or ""at home"". It an endless loop. I've cleared cache, reinstalled, nothing fixes the problem.",
"This app is currently non-functional on my device. I'm unable to view any cruise details, book activities, etc. It's just stuck in a constant loop of asking me to login. I've tried deleting and redownloading with no effect.",
"This was an exceptional app to have during the cruise. It made making plans, seeing the characters, and overall experiencing more so much easier. IT'S A MUST HAVE!",
"Great, when it works. We used the app during our 7-day cruise. We were able to plan our events, see menus, reserve shore events & more. Our only problem was that occasionally, it would give us ""lost internet contact"" error messages & messages would not work, yet the rest of the features still worked fine. It's still a must-have for any cruise & we're using it again hands down.",
"The app works, but it can be very difficult to find what you want. It desperately needs a search function, and needs to maintain filters between days.",
"App will not load my reservations anymore. After I click on my reservations, it goes back to the hone screen. Worked fine weeks ago but NO longer! I have a cruise Monday and it isn't working!! Called Disney IT and still can't get it in.",
"First review: app has a bad UI, and onboard WiFi doesn't work. Update: with Disney's attempt to unify passwords made it so I'm locked out of my account",
I felt like the App was confusing once we got on the ship and that it did not explain like food places and choices well. Somebody said there was a full menu for room service on the App. I did not see that nor did I find it anywhere else. There were other things that could have been presented better.,
App isn't working on my phone. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing. I've even contacted help from DCL and I still haven't gotten it to do more than circle around. I can't see any details of my cruise or book anything.,
"Great for Disney notifications and Chat for using with family. Only thing is, it would be nice to see itineraries for linked Accounts, similar to prior boarding the ship.",
"Can't make port adventure plans on the app, but works on the website. Always gives an error something went wrong, try again later after the last update",
"This app worked fine for our first cruise, now I am trying to look at things and it keeps taking me in a circle of signing in but never opening my reservation. Need help!",
"Worst app ever used. Should only need 1 app for Disney, shouldn't need to go to 3 different apps, which then redirect you to the website anyway. Fire your IT people. Shouldn't be that difficult.",
I am in a circle of logging in and trying to access the at home portion. I can see my reservation but just takes me back into the Disney account log in. I have installed and installed at least 5 time 🙄,
"A good idea but the messaging is hard to use. On the ship I had a lot of connection issues. It would be much better if I could somehow leave chat open while I'm looking at other parts of the app. I'm usually chatting about things that are going on the ship, but when I go to the chat I've lost that page.",
App struggles onboard the ship with prompt messaging for chat among guests. Also couldnt see the rest of our party's booked activities after boarding when we could prior to boarding. Felt Disney failed in a big way in all things IT related on this cruise. Navigation of activities was good.,
Good app for a family and friends to keep in touch. The notices from the ship was great to know what was happening and when. Only wish there was an adult only filter to shift through all the options of things to do.,
Great to have this app available but it didn't always connect for some reason. Nice to have the ship's activities handy! 🙂,
"App continually crashes during check-in process. Super slow response rates in the app for basic functions. Tried on Android and iOS, with similar issues. Please fix these issues!",
"Won't run in the background hardly wont work off the ship. I miss the way phones. It is usefull for finding things on the ship though, but it kind of cost us a lot of party communications.",
Not reliable: goes in and out of access to the internet. Also we were not able to use the chat within our group easily. We ended up using the WhatsApp to communicate with each other on the Disney Dream cruise.,
"Fine, not great but only option, was strange that it didn't link/share favourites from all parties in the reservation and some of the menus are not very intuitive",
"Updated: I was able to get the app working by going in to settings and giving it permission to access my location. The app was so useful on our cruise! We were able to see all events for the whole week, add things to our favourites, look at menus, and got notifications 15 minutes before events and scheduled meal times. We used the messaging system constantly, it's great but can be slow (Disney acknowledges this and are working on it). Keeping the app open all the time seemed to help.",
Very useful app to know what is going on in the ship but there should be an option where we can receive messages (text based) and a map to show the ship's position. We saw some tiny islands on the way and it would have been good to know what they were buy checking a map. But overall an extraordinary service by Disney which I would highly recommend.,
"Very useful for ships maps, activities, and managing your account. Only downsides are the lack of a search, and sometimes the cabin messenger messages didnt go through or were delayed",
"I found the app helpful with information regarding events. It was a safe way if accessing menus with less chance of cross contamination. But I do prefer normal menus and encouraging children not to use phones at the table. The app didn't work very well before the trip though. The signal was poor, there was no information about events or what to expect uploaded until on the ship. However, I did like the instant chat options to talk with friends and crew. Overall, improvement needed but helpful.",
"Easy, convenient, and the perfect reminder system. Low Tech App Mom",
"Crashing as soon as you try and open it. It won't even let me see anything,yet alone change any details etc.",
WiFi to connect app is very hit and miss. kept saying not connected,
Great for the trip. One thing I would improve is being able to send pictures,
Very helpful and informative when you've had a chance to go through it,
Worked on my phone but after software update 7+13-23 app will not open. We are boarding today,
This app continues to not work on my Samsung A52 device. Even after the latest update 5.13.0,
Almost perfect. Would be nice to have a map of your boat on it,
Chat was unreliable. All else worked fine,
App text missing and displayed mirrored when installed in a phone in RTL language settings and the app is in English.,
"The App is no substitute for a printed daily schedule as it does not show at a glance all of the events going on around the ship. We felt that we missed out on some activities that we would have enjoyed because we simply did not know about them. Being forced to use the App was not helpful. Also the messaging does not work if you keep your cellular connection on, so you either have to keep switching that off and on again to get a data connection, or to buy an exorbitantly priced Internet deal",
Incredibly well organized. Incredible tool with a clean interface. Well done! We got tue most from the trip thanks to the app (and staff).,
Ap is always a pain to get started on the ship. The ap will not stayed connected to the ships wi-fi and is very glitchey. Information is good and its easy to navigate and message other people in your party.,
Overall the app waa good. There was a group of 15 of us. Would have lovex to be able to send a group text when phone waa out of range for carrier.,
There are too many missing features. Searching for all times that an event is available is just one.,
Horrible experience with the app once on board. Missed multiple experiences due to malfunctioning. Cruise was great nevertheless!,
"Super easy to use, would like to see an icon for the maps but was very easy to manage.",
"Good app. Definitely required to cruise with Disney. It's a bit finicky, but helps a ton!",
Messaging feature is awful. Use WhatsApp instead.,
"Too many times texts did not show up on the recepients device until an hour or more after they were sent. I would like to see a schedule type listing, similar to the paper Navigators. I would use it again as it was very handy and sent me reminders for my favorite events.",
"a tad buggy at times with connections. somewhat difficult to navigate. wish it had a search feature and more info explaining the facilities on the ship. e.g. lounges, bars, recreation, menus, etc; really liked the chat feature though it was a little clunky to set up. however all in all a good app",
I just loaded this up and so far it seems pretty good. I think it will be very useful once we are on board. It needs to be looked at as it made me go through 75 years of calendars to put in my birthdate it would not let me type in the date. I have used several other cruise lines apps and this looks very useful again once on board.,
"Useful app while onboarding, but it's pretty glitchy and seemed to crash alot. The instant messages weren't really instant- often delayed. wave phones might be a better option if you need something quickly. I'm also a little surprised that the app wasn't better- the maps weren't interactive, no facts about the ship etc.",
We used an old phone with the app that did not have cell service and it worked well. We still like the paper navigator so we did not feel like we still had to be tired to an electronic device all the time. There were many times having it with us that it did make it easier finding certain information.,
"The ui/ux is severely lacking. The responsiveness is horrible. There aren't any settings for notifications or anything. It feels like a beta. You can eventually get to all the information (with the exception of ""chat with a crew member which I could never get to work, and the end of cruise survey which is not even available?? They still use paper like they live in the 90s.",
"Overall a good app. I'm sure like everything disney it will continue to be better. Would be nice to have a map or layout on the app. I thought it was a little ""blocky"" with the layout but overall it did what we needed it too. We used it early and often on our cruise. It is a must have.",
"Messaging was horrible. Half of my family couldn't use it because of errors or unresponsiveness. many of us had to clear cache to get it to work. Even when working, messages would not be pushed to the app and only available after long delays. app would say messages were delivered and seen when they were not. Do not expect this app to work like normal messaging apps. also, network switching while at port for wifi for example, will prevent the app from working. Disney needs to rethink this app.",
"Messaging component of the app was glitchy and functioned poorly at best. Sent/recieved messages were often delayed for hours, sometimes over 24 hours. This was not isolated to one phone. Most guests in our large vacation group experienced the same issues. When forced to use Disney app on a Disney Cruise for messaging please provide a reliable feature so guests can communicate/coordinate effectively on the ship.",
"Provided great information but was a little slow & texts sometimes failed to send. a phone reset worked half the time. it could be more intuitive, esp if older passengers are trying to use it. For example, make the daily weather forecast a really obvious button instead of hidden in our personal daily agenda.",
The app works well once you figure it out. The organization could be a lot better because there are literally bits of information that you need scattered all throughout the app and there is no clear organization. There's definitely a learning curve if you're a first time or on a Disney cruise because it takes a while to figure out what you're doing once you get on board. You definitely need to do your research and read all the emails you received ahead of time!,
Overall a good app and absolutely necessary if cruising with Disney. Would like a few more features like ordering from the app and an over all search function as well as ability to call family and not just text. Hope to need it again on a future cruise 😁,
"This app is the best idea ever. No glitches or connection issues once we knew how to connect properly. SO many suggestions for improvements: -Function to show live where other family members are on the ship -Voice/talk functionality to call other guests -Emoji quick responses to messages, thumbs up etc -Instant chat messaging function with Guest Services -Ability to leave text messages with Housekeeping -Ability to view account (expenses accrued etc) -Daily weather & news updates",
Terrible. Very little description of the events and ages. The staff doesn't use the app to make recent announcements like canceling firework show or that we were skipping an island. It would be much easier to just print out the paper schedule for everyone. Even the staff said they prefer the paper schedule and refer to it when you ask questions on board.,
"double check that you are truely logged out of everything once you have signed in. you get limited data onboard and it can be eaten up very quickly, so then you get absolutely no updates to your itinerary. When it works, it is beautiful, the data issue not an app problem, but something to know to stretch its usefullness on ship.",
"The apps only works while onboard. It's great because you can see all the activity broken down by hours and days. They can improve the app by having a better in description of what the activity is. It's not informative at all. Just a title, location and time. When you press for more info, the description is not informative at all.",
"Has Basic Functionality but Needs Enchantments - Should be seamless and integrated like the Disney World App, meaning should be able to book appts for all the services and features on the boat just like the Disney App. Had I been able to do that without having to go to the front desk or calling someone I probably would have done more. I appreciate the schedule but need a full experience from my phone.",
"Easy to use, intuitive, and contains all the information you when on your cruise.",
"The information is great! The map is good, could be more user friendly. The one star is for the abysmal messaging service. The devs need a crash course in push notifications. I sent a message to my daughter one evening. She didnt get it until a whole 24 hours later and it caused a great deal of stress and confusion. This was not an isolated incident. It got to the point that we just left our phones in the room the last 2 days because they were dead weight.",
"It was nice to have information all in one place, however it was very patchy. I kept having to force close the app as it crashed constantly. didn't really use the messaging service however when I did it seemed to work okay. it would be better if you could filter only the once for the whole cruise for categories rather than each time.",
"App is ok, overall. Suggestions for improvement... 1) The heart icon (to select a cruise activity) is very difficult to tap for people with larger thumbs. Please consider making more user friendly. 2) Needs a widget for the cruise countdown. 3) Make the emoji keyboard downloadable to our phones. It's really cute. 4) Provide a link to the downloadable photos if we purchased the digital package.",
App was great on the ship but needed to be reset every now and then to send texts. It would be nice to have a button that would refresh the settings without having to go through the reconnection process. It would also be helpful to view activity details from My Schedule view. Other than that it was a great app.,
"Responsiveness, accuracy and issues. This is by far the worst application I have ever seen, and used. Horrible responsiveness, inaccurate on the schedule and worst of all, it crashes all the time. To make things worst, Disney has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.",
"There were some connectivity issues while on the boat, and the chats often didn't come through immediately on the boat unless you had the app open at all times. The navigator and itinerary part were quite helpful! Liked that you could add things to your schedule and get reminders.",
"I don't care for this app. It's not well organized or user friendly. As many times as I used it, I still had to hunt and peck for everything I went looking for. The DCL guest WiFi connection was absolutely terrible. I was unable to access it at least 85% of the time without having to toggle WiFi or restart my phone.",
"Unfortunately, this app will not work very well unless you purchase a data plan on the ship. It DOES work without a data plan, but that requires that you regularly ""sign in"" to the WiFi network on the ship. You'll notice that that WiFi will pop up and request you to sign in when moving around the ship. With Android, you can tell it to use the network as-is and then this app will work... But you have to keep on doing that. Because of this Android limitation, the app is not reliable for communications purposes, especially if you're relying on it while your child is at one of the kid's clubs. Use the wave phone instead. However, if you purchase a large data plan, you should be ok with this app for communications. Disney Cruise Lines should honestly just setup a free WiFi SSID for customers who do not want to pay for data but would like to use this app. Aside from the disconnection issues, the app is extremely helpful for seeing the daily events, menus, etc",
"Com'on Disney...you have to many resources not to have an A+ app for your ships. You get no passes from me bc your pockets are deep enough to fund proper R&D for your app. It worked well enough, but very sub par Disney. We can't have anything to complain about when we are on your boats, but this app is one of them. It's got good bones, now put some meat on them bones...we know you can do it! Get it done so when I come back, I can update this rating to 5 stars!",
"Super helpful! The entire time it would alert me whenever an event that I liked was about to happen, also included was a map of the boat. The only time I didn't like it was when my phone died. I would totally recommend this app to anyone planning their next Disney Cruise.",
"This app was ideal and worked perfectly until very recently, then it suddenly stopped loading my account. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it, contacted the support and checked the settings of the app and my phone as requested, but now the support team have stopped answering my messages. Pity really because this was a useful app on many cruises, but can't even get excited by using the cruise countdown this time.",
"App is useless, since it always says something went wrong and it wants me to try again later when attempting to log in. At least use more specific error messages! I have no idea what's wrong, and after resetting my account password, and trying to create a new account with a different email, I can confirm that it's not about my login credentials.",
"Works amazing for most things, but texts sometimes don't go through and/or you have to keep opening the app to manual check. Oftentimes you get through all of the activity booking screens only for them to be full. That could be avoided with a check on the previous screen.",
"This app isawesome!! Could organize my days without having to carry around the paper version. It gives you reminders for normal scheduled dinner and other things you have picked. It has diagrams/layouts of all the decks. Another feature I loved, was the account feature. You could see all charges made to the room.",
Texts would not go through so there was no way for my husband and I to communicate. This is part of what the app boasts as a feature to keep you in touch on the cruise. We heard from plenty other people that they couldn't contact family members either. Done people just deleted the app all together. The app was informative about upcoming events but needs work on the messaging part.,
"Overall it is OK. It is now required, as of the date of the review things change all the time. Messages often delayed. Required frequent reboot to receive messages. Presents information well and easy to navigate. Bookings are easy. New debark que is nice and avoids lines.",
"This app was INVALUABLE for the cruise. Keeps you in the know and helps you stay in contact with your family at almost all times (doesn't work if you get off the boat). My only beef (and it's not enough to lose a star) is that when I went to do a load of laundry, I got a message within 5 mins saying the machine had stopped, but when I went aaaaalllll the way back to the launderette it was still going just fine. Could have been a handy feature but, oh well.",
"Not only did the countdown add to the excitement, the app gave me a chance to keep up with next steps before the cruise. During the cruise, it was my electronic go-to for what's happening. It was also handy for social distancing because it sent me reminder alerts for the activities I favorited. I didn’t have to go stand in line for a long time to make sure I could participate.",
"Very bad messages, delayed the whole trip some people in our party didnt get messages. Frequently I would be disconnected from the app. Two party members were kicked from the app as if they hadnt been on the cruise. Feels like the app was tested with wifi connection and cell service in mind and then shipped for use on a boat where you have neither.",
"This app was very user friendly! It helped up navigate activities on the ship and the times when the activities would be. It was very useful in finding restaurants and shops. It allowed me to keep tabs on my account balance. The app reminds you when an activity you showed interest in, starts. The best part is that it allows you text other people in your party while on the ship, so you can keep in contact when you not together. Highly recommend this app if you are on a Disney Cruise!",
"This app is recommended/required by Disney Cruise Lines for use on their cruises, and it is indeed an extremely useful tool. With it you can review your cruise itinerary, cruise ship events, port weather and your port excursions. Once I understood how to navigate through the app using the DCL logo it was very helpful. The app sends you reminders about your scheduled events. It has many more features. This is a very well done app!",
"Great app, a MUST for cruising with Disney Cruise Line! Extremely helpful and easy to use! 👍",
Chat experience was frustrating at best. Being cut off before I can view final charges is inconsiderate. Overall concept is good. Make more user friendly for older users if Disney is using the app as the primary option for communicating. Not all of us are joined at the hip with our phones.,
app was great for ship maps and times for shows and character meet and greets ! also was able to like things and the app would push notification too remind you (make sure you allow push notifications on this app to do so) only reason for 4 stars cause the messaging system was soooooooow I was with a group of 22 on board and it was our goto communications system . sometimes messages would take upto 30 minutes too be received. if you are trying to meet up w/ people post what time it is in the text,
"Messages don't get received consistently. That was the biggest problem I had with it, but it really made communication difficult on the ship. Scheduling was pretty good. Enjoyed the dinner menus being available. Fix the messaging and the app would be about all I would need",
"Great on-board app. Would be nice expansion if you could export a pdf of your ""my Plans"" on the last day.",
The app works great as long as you can keep connected to the wifi. It seems you get kicked when the phone screen is off and miss the messages sometimes. But the only option to have at sea. The deck maps are great and schedules are perfect.,
This app doesn't hold a candle to the original Paper Daily Navigator. The paper Navigator should be continued to be available to anyone needing a vacation from their cell phones. It didn't work in all locations of castaway cay and I experienced many issues both before and during the cruise. It's very time consuming. This Is My Vacation Time! I only want to use my personal phone when I need to not for everything all the time. The Wave Phone was better for communication with family and friends.,
"Was a great way to keep up with everything that was going on during the cruise. Did have a problem messaging our group sometimes, but otherwise it had good information. Everything was so wonderful and unbelievable !!! Everyone is very helpful and we all loved the experience. Ready to go again in the future!! Thanks so much for a great time.",
Very helpful in communicating by text. Navigating the site took a lot of exploration to find certain information. Posted menus were nice feature. Liked selecting my items to attend and then getting notifications. Also liked that the user name could be edited. Keep perfecting the app!,
"The app worked well on the ship as long as the ship's internet worked. There were many times that pages wouldn't load or the app was having trouble accessing information. It became frustrating after a while, but there is no alternative, so you are forced to trudge through.",
"Huge improvements made from 5 years ago, but I wish the onboard messaging was a little more consistent with message delivery. If the message system was more reliable it would make having a little one that is old enough to explore on their own, but needs to check in a little less stressful for everyone.",
"The Cruise was amazing from the amenities to the staff!!! our family of 6 had a great time and a lot of fun!!! The Stateroom host Brian was Excellent! The staff on the ship were Excellent as well!!! Malcolm, Nicha, and Cindy were Excellent as our servers and we learned alot about them and from them!!! I could not have asked for a more amazing experience and any more Excellent staff!!! We would love to take this cruise or another like it again!!!",
"Super unreliable. Depending on where you were and when, the app would not notify us of messages from the nursery, kids club or others in our party. It was extremely frustrating when trying to communicate with members of our party on Castaway Cay because it was hit and miss for when people were messaging us. Also annoying to find that my kid had been crying for an hour but we never got the message until 2 hours after pickup. The concept is great, they just need to work out the connection issue.",
"This app is barely functional on Android. I'm guessing this was built on iOS, and outsourced for the porting work to Android. If you have any sort of privacy settings turned on, this will not work. Any time I needed to message my family, this app would fail. After 4 trips to guest services, where they all failed to resolve the connection, they let me know ipods were available to borrow. Next cruise, my family will just get those instead. Used on a Pixel 4a and Pixel 3a.",
"App works well - great resource to know what is happening when, view restaurant menus, and communicate with others on the cruise! Would be better if the chat feature worked while on Castaway Cay using your data plan - right now, it only seems to work when connected to the ship's wifi network.",
"Can't even login, just get spinning ""updating"" at the terms and conditions like a previous commenter. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache and cookies, restarted phone, tried in different cities and different days and just cannot get through. If just logging in is this difficult I can only imagine what kind of difficulties I'll encounter actually using it.",
"The App used to be great. Yesterday it started glitching and wouldn't let me sign in. I deleted in and reinstalled. Then it told me my password was incorrect. So I reset my password. Even with the password reset, it still says my email and/or password is incorrect. So I restarted my phone and reinstalled the app for the 2nd time. Still nothing. I know it isn't and email or password issue because I check on the Disney cruise website and logged in without any problems. I hope it's fixed quickly.",
"The chat feature was really good. It was the only way to communicate with my wife, since there was no regular phone reception out in the sea, and i did not want to pay extra for wifi internet service. It was also easy to see all the upcoming event schedules, opening/ closing times for everything, etc.",
lists all the cruise info and itinerary. easy to follow and nicely shows what is in the past but still in progress. would be nice to be able to see more prior to the cruise as the only thing you can do with the app beforehand is set a generic day countdown.,
"Really like the new features of the update, but would be better if it would give you the option to stay logged in if you want to. My daughter also has this app and loves using the countdown when we have a cruise booked. But I don't know if she can log in on her own just to see the countdown.",
"Most enjoyable! Never missed an appointment. Loved the fact i could read the menu before dinner. Planning to see what movies or shows to watch was made easier. If I want to do something, I just check the app to see what to do. This app was most helpful.",
"Great for planning out the cruise and chatting. It was having some connection and notification issues when I used it, so I had to keep refreshing my phone. Other than that super handy for getting everything set for boarding and sailing.",
The latest update to the UI made the app usable even before the cruise. My only complaint is that the built in navigator for each day is a list that makes it a bit hard to keep track of when things start and end on the timeline.,
The concept of the app is great. it's a way to communicate with other people on the boat using the boats airplane mode/Wi-Fi however it's inconsistent. Notifications wouldn't pop up until the next day which does not help when your child wants to be picked up from the kids club.,
"The app was helpful when it came to schedules, activities and such. However the message feature which I see everyone speak of, would be better if you could get notified of having a message whether the app was open or not. That was our main dilemma when trying to locate people in our group which was majority, adults. Otherwise, I'll definitely use the app again for my future Disney cruises.",
"Loved the app! It definitely beats carrying around a piece of paper or relying on memory. The chat feature is awesome for communicating with others in your party. The menus for each night's restaurant were so helpful. Nice touch, Disney!",
"1. Android scroll is broken in daily activities view so the port picture takes half the screen. Works in iOS. 2. Cannot click on saved activities for details you have to go to main search view. 3. Search filters are inconsistent. Ex. character events are ""all ages"" but filtering for adult activities doesn't include them. 4. Search filters should be saved. If I'm not interested in youth events I shouldn't have to filter every time. 5. HAVE👏A👏 CALENDAR👏 VIEW👏 PLEASE. Like the paper navigator.",
"Fine but slow and crashes everytime I open. I have a Google Pixel 7 (previously a Pixel 3) and everytime I open the app on either phone the screen glitches out with an error screen and I have to force close the app to have it reset to the login page, re login, then it works for a while until I open it another day. Very frustrating bug that has been going on for over a year.",
"Had difficulty connecting when we arrived at the ship. Had to go to Guest Services to remedy the problem. Then, once I was connected, certain aspects of the app did not work properly. Went to Guest Services again and they could not rectify the problem so the clerk at the desk had to manually go into the system to make the transaction. It is dangerous to rely so heavily on technology, especially if your system goes down or experiences a blip. If the customer has device issues they're sunk.",
app doesnt work on my cruise. pixel2 xl. app countdown clock in zero. on board it doesn't know what to do. my wife has it working in her pixel xl. worthless to me. it seems app doesnt know I'm on ship. even tho I'm connected to ship wifi and now on day two of seven. wasting a lot of time filing with this nonsense. did all three regular things. rested cache. reinstall. looked at location settings. i give up.,
"I have downloaded this app on my phone. When I login it flashes my reservations and then logs me back out. I have tried everything I can think of Uninstaller and reinstall, shut down phone, make sure it's up to date, cleared cache and storage, and it still does the same thing. Super frustrating be ause I can't even contact someone for help since it won't let me log in.",
Super helpful on board the ship! Highly recommend this app. Great for activities schedule/character appearances and for chatting with other guests on board the ship for free with onboard wifi - my husband and I used it to find each other all the time when we were on different parts of the ship with our kids.,
"This app has quite a few flaws and very frustrating software design issues. Your phone has to be unlocked and the app open for the app to send you chat notifications, once it locks you don't get notifications. You have to be in Airplane mode for the app to work, which is terrible when you are in Port, especially if you have kids as they only contact you through the app if they need to be picked up. Disney's reliance on this app means you are just about required to use a flawed app. Not a fan",
The app is a nice tool to help you schedule activities and communicate with your kids on the ship. However half way into our cruise the app started to have problems on my kids phone. The app would get deactivated and my kids could not use the the app to text. I had to relink the app on their phones to our reservation number and enter a new passcode almost every time when they used the phone. The only thing that I could think of is that I am using Google Family Link on my kids phone.,
"Just ok. While the onboard communication feature is handy, there's often a long delay in receiving messages. Further, the app itself will frequently crash or lock up. Good for keeping track of excursion times and other events.",
"App works great and is very convenient. I don't have to walk around with the paper version of the cruise navigator like I used to before they created the app. Also very useful to check dining assignments, dress code for dining, and the dining menu for each night of the cruise.",
"It was extremely helpful during my Disney cruise. Although, there were several app navigation issues (cant access event description from your favorites list), and it crashed more than a few times. But this did not affect my cruise experience.",
"Helpful but could be better. Key shipwide announcements should also be messaged as some parts of the ship are noisy makong it difficult to hear. More information on destinations for those travelling independently, such as bus stops, taxi ranks etc. Option to link plans for activities rather than everyone needing to add it to the planner.",
Not consistent and given you have to rely on it for all the cruise as no paper versions needs to be better really,
"I am rating this app a little harder because if you cant keep the connection on the boat and on Castaway Cay, then it doesnt matter how good the app is, it becomes unusable. I really like the app but the hard issue was being able to send a msg through it and make sure it reaches another party member.",
Works well to inform you of the events on the boat but the notifications from the app can be spotty when the phone is on standby. I found that my power saving mode made it worse. Make sure your background app updates are enabled.,
well the app was useful and had a great countdown calendar built in which you no longer have. and you can't navigate anything in the app without a reservation. seems useless to me when you would like to consider a reservation but you can't see itineraries or anything before hand.,
"Since our family (17) of us couldn't use text messaging, the Disney app was a great way to communicate. The app was very helpful before the cruise to get important info and register our flight times etc. While on board, the app was very helpful with show and activities schedules, shop open times, location of restaurants etc. Thank you.",
Loved the app for planning up to the cruise. Unfortunately the messages between cruisers and pages from oceaneer club were often delayed during cruising. Probably the wifi and not the app but overall the app is very user friendly and convenient. Love the countdown to cruise feature.,
"The navigator part of this app is great, everything you need to know at your fingertips. The chat function needs work. Most messages didn't come through until you opened the app again so it wasn't very useful for communicating with the rest of our party.",
"1) Greatly improved since last year... sometimes messages are very slow to deliver, and the app often takes over a second to respond to a tap. 2) Cannot use countdown anymore without logging in, which means kids cannot enjoy the countdown without risking them buying things or cancelling bookings. 3) Cannot filter by performer, each performance type is a separate entry (G, 18+), cannot text search, only by tags. Cannot filter across multiple days and filters reset if change day.",
"it was an amazing experience at the disney fantasy using this app. I was able to message anyone else who used this app and meet up with them anywhere on the boat. I truly loved the vacation!! The app helped to see any show times, dinner menus, or even when different clubs, such as vibe, edge, and the oceaneers club, open. if you end up going on a disney cruise, believe me you dont want to be stuck using the wave phone. So trust me when I say download this app!",
2018: Very helpful when onboard. Needs way to exit chat and return to app without closing the app totally. 2019 update: fixed previous issue Lots of awesome improvements to app. Alerts for laundry machines and can register for Disney Vacation line on app. I love that ongoing balance info is available throughout the cruise.,
I was in a group and there were many people that had a hard time adding contacts into app. Sooner people didn't get all the massages. Some messages were delayed for no apparent reason. Better instructions on how to change WiFi connection to work with ship/app for both Android and iPhone.,
"App was great listing activities. An improvement from our last cruise. However, it still frequently gets frozen, or stops working & kicks you out, and messaging function is spotty. but thankful for messaging option on board the ship, hopefully next time we'll have picture sharing too.",
"I wasn't sure how it all worked, on day 2, I went to guest services and asked for a quick tutorial. The cast member was very helpful, problem solved. The one thing that I would have liked seeing is a more close-up image of where the ship is than was shown on the TV in my cabin. All in all, the app was very helpful. One last thing, the answers to the Disney Trivia questions would have been nice so that we didn't look like we didn't know anything about Disney.",
"Great for planning the day and communicating with friends on board. If you don't want to buy an internet package but still want to connect to ship wifi to use navigator app try this... From the ""wanna buy a package"" screen... Press three dots for menu in top right. Touch ""keep connected"". Voila.",
"Absolutely wonderful, loved the fact we could heart an activity and 15 minutes before hand you get a reminder. I enjoyed that I could see the dinner menu before hand, and liked the way you get notifications when your kids are done in clubs. Great way to check out everything on ship, what you have left with onboard credit and so on.",
Amazing and easy to keep up to date on activities and family members! You can see the character locations and times as well as what movies were playing on ship. The excursions were all listed on the app too! The chat feature was amazing and helped me communicate with my mom when I wasn't near her.,
very useful in a lot of ways. unfortunately unless you download it before you get on the boat you are stuck. would be nice if they had an easy way to sideload it wirhout the play store. it crashes a bit and the messaging app doesn't provide much value because it is often very delayed,
"App only works properly when you're connected to the DCL-GUEST wifi network otherwise you can't send or receive messages. Problem is that connection drops constantly onboard, and service was terrible on castaway cay (could barely connect long enough to send a message.) Needs to be more reliable!",
I would constantly have to reconnect to ship wifi. Texts with groups would be recieved later than sent. Not all of the activities get listed or when searched get popped up. It is a neccessary app for the ship so you would hope these issues could be resolved soon. Make sure everyone in party who has a phone (children included) downloads app before boarding.,
The app was great for knowing what was happening on board and checking times etc. I had a problem with my folio disappearing so I couldn't check my charges etc. Notifications were helpful reminders. It was also easy to view menus at all the different restaurants.,
The app was difficult to us before the holiday. Crashed a couple time and had to clear the cache to get it to work again. problems booking events. But worked well while on the ship and very helpful tool to make the most of the cruise.,
This is a great App to provide basic info. I would like to see a brief event description and even a tracker to show you were you are located as you sail along. It would be helpful to be able to request friends in the chat feature by room number vs Chat ID. That way it is easier to communicate with people you meet on your cruise. This feature should come with the option to deny requests.,
This app was great while we were on the ship to help us plan our days. Two things that would make it better would be a notification sound or vibration option when a new message is received and the ability to see your selected itinerary on a single page once you've favorited the events your interested in doing.,
"App was great for seeing activities and getting notifications that your favorite activity was going to be beginning. Map was also very helpful to get an understanding of where different places were located on the ship. Was looking forward to the chat functionality, but unfortunately it only worked for members of my party on android devices. Those with iPhones in my group kept getting error message not sent.",
"App was terrible on-board. Messaging was delayed. Chat sessions with guest services would constantly get bumped out of queue. 2 people in same room could not see each other's activities in order to plan, and if you had multiple rooms forget it, it was worthless. App doesn't work in port if you come out of airplane mode.",
Super convenient and easy to use. Everything I needed was always available and I loved the reminders when I picked a favorite activity. I wasn't late for anything because of lack of notifications. Even my laundry notified me so I could do other things while I waited.,
"Love the app! Now we can chat with eachother (from different staterooms after you add eachother) and get notifications for things you ""liked"" as an interest, you get notifications when your washer/dryer stopped (if you do laundy on the ship- but the timing was a little off for laundry only), dinner time/location reminders, activity reminders, characyer meet n Greets etc. Nice upgrade for sure! Love the app!!",
Good app and I enjoyed the messaging capabilities. The daily activities were hard to sort through as some span over several hours but you would have to go to the start to see when the activities actually started. There should be a scan feature to acan other member msg codes and should l also integrate the wave phone feature from kids club to the app. It would save from having to carry multiple devices around.,
"The app was glitchy on my Samsung Galaxy S7. Message notifications from chats wouldnt come through, when I was able to get the app to work. When it worked, the schedule info was helpful. Hopefully the app will be updated and more functional by our next Disney cruise.",
"If I wasn't constantly on.my phone, the connection would drop and I would have to go shut off my connection and restart before I could send my wife a text. Otherwise, worked fine. Additionally, it was difficult and not very intuitive to find the schedule for meeting, autographs and photos with the characters.",
Not user friendly other people had a hard connecting & using it. We should be able to add people based on room number and names. Delayed receiving messages. Not intuitive I thought I had to scroll through the calendar it should have told you to click on the year first then month.,
"Awful app, I installed got signed up linked my reservation looked around a little before having to get off. Came back a little bit later and it kept telling me something went wrong when trying to log in. I uninstalled the app cleared everything and it still won't let me log in no matter what I've tried. Super frustrating.",
"Excellent app. Shows you all the activities on the ship/plan them, allows friends and family to communicate with each other since two people can be on the two different ends or two different floors of the ship AND its a big ship. Only caveat, It works on Disney Wi-Fi and Disney gives you 50MB free wifi (I know!), so if you leave wifi on then all the other apps in background will use your 50MB in a matter of minutes to hours. We all have data hungry apps so be wise and use phones in the rooms too.",
"good idea, lots of issues. can't scroll through previous messages. have to open the app to see new messages, notifications don't work. freezes constantly. personal itinerary information wasn't accurate. not reliable.",
"Good app on board but wished it was more accurate onboard. We had scheduled items that we couldnt view. Also, they need to improve viewing between shared staterooms. I could only view scheduled items for those in my stateroom. They just need to add booking a new cruise as an option.",
"The app was great! when it worked... The chat function is buggy and delayed, and it should be easier to add people from outside of your stateroom, especially if they are in the same reservation.",
"Tried to login with my email. Realized I needed an account first. Without thinking, added my birthday with the current year (2020), which for 2020 means i am not yet born. Error says I am too young to have an account and locks out the acct process. Couldn't fix it. Each attempt resulted in error. Exit app, restart phone and Restarted account creation. Entered real birthday and other information. But, my email is already assigned to an account I didn't yet have? Needs better error handling.",
Found the app difficult to use before sailing. Once on board given no instructions on how to find menus etc. Only towards the end did I discover it had a map of every deck! I use many apps but found this one NOT user friendly. I would have expected Disney to do better.,
This worked out well on the ship as a substitute for normal texting for our group in 3 different cabins. Also a great way to keep up with what is happening on the ctuise. Liked seeing the menu before we got to donner each night. Ship floorplans were helpful.,
"Difficult to figure out how to make it work. (Which is why they have a person on board whose job is to help with the app) Constantly have to reboot system for updates and to get family messages. note: This is only the on board Navigator system. To use the ""ship to shore"" WiFi is very expensive.",
Generally poor functionality overall. It's random as to whether messages are sent and received ones don't always pop up as a notification meaning you have to keep checking the app for potential new messages. Pretty much in line with Disney IT overall!,
"Extremely buggy, need to clear data upon initial install (android) and will disconnect from wifi anytime you put to sleep. When you wake it up you then need to reconnect, which works approximately 45% of the time at which point you will see the 20 missed messages that were sent amongst your party while your phone sat in your pocket disconnected from the ship's wifi. I attempted multiple fixes (turned off power save, autoconnect etc.) to no avail. This app was built by the lowest bidder",
"Not being able to call party members. App would not connect many times on several members phones made it difficult to get notifications to meet up. Also there should be a notification when there is a time change occurring. We were told by the crew about the extra hour if sleep but then no announcement was made when we crossed back over and ""lost"" an hour causing many of our party to miss events.",
The app is a great way to track activities and view dining menus while onboard. There were problems that had misinformation and needed to reset often on board. Prior to sailing it could provide general information about events that would be happening during the cruise so passengers would know how to pack.,
"By day 4 of our cruise I had finally found all of the info I was seeking. some information is difficult to find (account balance and daily itinerary, for example). Once you find it though, the app is amazing.",
Can be a little hard to navigate. Biggest annoyance is the layout is messed up it seems on Android devices. The character countdown is partially blocked by the action menu. Been like this for years with seemingly no interest in being fixed.,
"I only wish we could use the app to message the oceaneers club to check on the littles or to order room service. Would be ultra convenient to do these things from anywhere on the ship. Otherwise, the app was incredibly useful in planning our days at see and navigating the cruise.",
"The cruise was AMAZING and it is great for talking to your new friends without giving them your actual phone number. It has no ads. However you need to be in range of the ships wifi in order to talk to friends, and get updated with new stuff. The app gives you the complete schedule for the whole day, including programs for kids and teens! They tell you the whole schedule at the start of the day, 12 AM! And it doesnt make noise so you wont get woken up. So nice",
Great for notifications and keeping track of events. Being able to chat with your family or people on the cruise is definitely a huge plus. The updates required internet which was not that great and it still used data even if the app is closed.,
"It works well enough. Force closes quite a bit and NEEDS a search function. But for a cruise with no reception, it helps you keep in touch with family and look up what's happening on the ship.",
"very patchy and unreliable. we actually preferred using the wave phones and paper navigators. It also appears that an update was pushed out during our cruise, making the app unusable without the update, and there was no way to update unless you bought an internet package.",
"There were times when the DCL Wifi would not connect, the in-app messages would not send or appear regularly up-to-date. No notification woyld appear unless you open the app and load it. Also were not enough details in activities description, would appreciate some pictures added to each activity to clarify the activity more.",
"Overall, it's a solid app. Onboard features are phenomenal and so helpful, pre-sailing functionality needs help. The CHANGE DAY feature when trying to book activities does not function correctly on an Andriod device, you must exit the activity and choose a new day.",
Continously lost wifi. Was never able to text my shipmates even though several follow ups with customer service said it was working. I was traveling with 2 adult special needs individuals who also had the same issues. Made for difficult communication and coordination of activities.,
"Great idea, but needs improvement. Many of the issues are probably more caused by the ship's glitchy WiFi. Messages took an unreasonable amount of time to reach recipient. There was no pricing available for spa services.",
"I can't even get past completing the registration, once I check the box for terms and conditions, the updating is endless. I've tried it several times, different days, and just for kicks different locations and still nothing.",
"This app is helpful for viewing the schedule, map, and menus onboard the ship. The messaging feature is nice, but it isn't reliable because the phones do not stay connected to the network.",
"Good app. Prompts me to turn on push notifications, which I want to do, but get an error saying the screen is having trouble loading. I'd like to receive push notifications but there's no way to report the error thru the app.",
Awful. Worked less than 5% of the 7 night cruise. My entire family kept getting booted from the cruise wifi and even though we had it set to auto reconnect it never did. The app was connected but messages would fail 99% of the time. Not reliable at all. Extremely frustrating.,
By god this app is awful. Its the only thing you can use but it is absurdly bad at what it does. My messages rarely send. I rarely recieve messages within the same hour they are sent AND it crashes repeatedly all whilst draining battery life at lightning speed.,
Perfect for knowing events and the times so able to plan activities accordingly including bookings. Also great to be able to view options available on the dinner menu. And the messaging/notifications facility was very handy too. Found it to be very helpful app indeed,
"The app isn't letting me sign in. I've tried to delete it and re download it, close it out and re open it. I've even tried every day for the last week or so to sign in at different times thinking it maybe was just my wifi connection. But based off the other comments. It looks like this is happening to other app users as well. Please fix it soon, so that I can start planning my vacation as soon as possible.",
Good app but can't always connect. Also the app should stay turned on till everyone is off the ship on debarkation day so people can communicate on where they are. This is especially helpful for people who are international and may not have cell service and got separated as part of debarkation.,
"Really fun, detailed and informative app when you're on the ship. Best features are how you can communicate with your party and the easy to use schedule for each day. You can also keep track of your account balance and check out menus for each evening.",
"For my needs the app was fine. The limitation is in the ship's Wi-Fi. It's no better than any other ship. And all the ships have to do, is add more repeaters for the Wi-Fi signal on Floors and at the interior to the ship.",
Good for checking what's going on around the ship and seeing what's on the restaurant menus. Bar menus are selective and rely instead on the QR codes they make available being compatible with your phone (they weren't with my brand new Sony Xperia).,
"This app is a must if you are doing the disney cruiseline! It serves as your handheld navigation system for all things disney cruise. I was able to stay connected with my family members and get feedback when organizing activities. Since it was our 1st cruise, i genuinely can't imagine not having had this app!",
"The app for android is spotty at best when on board. Everybody in my party without an I phone only got sporadic texts from others in our party. Impossible to keep up with family, resorted to old fashioned dry erase board. Navigator was accurate when it worked.",
"Bar none, this app is the reason I'll only sail with Disney! Completely helps me relax as a mom. I can talk with my kiddos any time I need (interface is just like texting) and it takes the guess work out of trying to find your whole party onboard when traveling with a large group. Love it!",
"Easy to use. Sometimes it's difficult to find very specific things, like Room Service menu. Would like to see games added to provide a little entertainment since cell service is either non existent or expensive at sea.",
Awesome short cruise to Castaway Cay. The app let me communicate with my party and see the activities that were happening on board. Best part for me was seeing movies and shows aboard the ship! The app let me see the times and I was able to see two movies in one weekend!!,
"In the end, it does what it needs to but not a very stable app. Messages don't come thru and you have to restart the app to receive messages. Wouldn't be a big deal except messages telling you that your kids need to be picked up are kinda important",
"The Disney Cruise app was easy to use on the ship. The only thing that could be improved is when I favorite/heart too many events it wont let me favorite any more, even if I unfavorite some events. Besides that everything worked seamlessly for me!",
"Good app to stay up to date on the daily activities and info on your cruise. The texts were spotty at best. Sometimes it worked great, but others we didn't get the text till later. That's not good when you're texting your kids.",
"worked great when active. but was temperamental when trying to use the ships wifi. consistently cut in and out / logged in and out. VERY USEFUL throughout the cruise, just some minor glitches staying connected consistently.",
"The chat feature is a great concept, but was often delayed in sending messages on board. Also, some of the standard info regarding schedules was not always the same as what was printed and delivered by the ship's staff.",
"This app was SUPER flakey on the ship. I would have to force stop, turn off and on wifi and even then it would work SOME of the time. Disney does just about everything well. Technology is not one of those things.",
"I've been on many cruises, But this was my first Disney cruise, We had an amazing time. Great shows, Great activities for the children. A great dining experience for me and my family. It was just as wonderful as actually being in Disneyland! The crew members on the ship were very friendly and helpful. My Grandkids loved all the characters, And taking pictures with them. The Halloween 🎃 cruise was so much fun, The decorations on the ship was great! The only problem, It was to short!",
"Although the chat feature is nice, it could be greatly improved with additional features. A ship map would help when navigating to events. A search function would also be helpful.",
7/23: Reducing rating to three stars because the old issues have popped again. Endless ring of death not allowing me to login. UPDATE: They updated the app and everything works now. Like the changes. OG: Since the update I haven't been able to login to see my countdown. I've even uninstalled twice. Hope they update again soon.,
you are told it works without paying for the on- board WiFi but there were times my account balance would not update and my alert reminders wouldn't come through unless i connected. but it is a fantastic way to look at schedules and menus!,
The app was useful however we did find it inaccurate a few times. For instance we were at la piazza for origami waiting and it was at the tube. We practically missed the whole thing! No big deal. But should be looked into .,
Overall it is a decent app. It is not as easy to plan with as the navigator. I like being able to look up menus and all the times a movie or character will be available.,
This was so helpful to have on the cruise! It made it easy to know everything going on at any time. I love that you could add things to your itinerary and receive notifications before the event started. Literally all the info you needed was at your finger tips.,
"Great app, only complaint would be there is no alert when using onboard messenger. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it doesn't; there is no audible alert, which makes it frustrating when using it for oceaneer club.",
"It was a good app and had a lot of information, I just wish that the notifications would be more regular and timely. On top of that, the wifi was spotty in parts, so it was unreliable sometimes.",
"crashed several times, many messages didnt go through, various times for restaurant hours were incorrect... it was nice to see all events in one convenient place though & be able to search what was happening at a specific time!",
"All 4 of us were able to communicate without needing the wave phones. You can keep track of all activities and ship info....answering most questions. My girls (9 and 7) each have old smartphones of ours without SIM cards. We installed the Disney Cruise App and purchased water proof lanyards for all if us...to hold our phones and ""key-to-the-world"" cards and it worked out great. We could message each other if they were in the kids club.",
Very horrible issues with the app Spent hours on the phone and gotten nowhere. They frozen the account. Can't book excursions after the entire trip has been paid for. This was supposed to be a special 50th birthday cruise for my father-in-law and they have been rude and condescending when it comes to resolving the issues. They offer no solution and keep saying the situation is going to the hire ups. It's been over 3 WEEKS!!!,
"Great concept. Horrible implementation. Have to re-login everytime you reopen the app. On top of that, the intranet connection on ship is tenuous at best. It would be a great app were it not for these issues.",
"It was very good when it worked, but there were times that it would just shut down and say app stopped working or app closed. At times when that happened I would have to shut phone off and restart than worked fine. Very good way to communicate with party.",
"Crashes often, delays in chat messages, not consistent in wifi connection or notifications. Especially disappointing because they replaced the paper schedules with the app only....they shouldn't have transitioned until the app was working more reliably.",
"This app was, for the most part, horrible. Texting on the ship was a joke. I would text my kids and they wouldn't get it for hours and vice versa. You would think a company who makes as much as Disney could create a working app. Carnival's app you coukd text with worked much better. It was extremely disappointing.",
This app was wonderful. It made my experience on Disney Dream even better. It kept me and my family in touch with each other. The only thing I would add is a msg that I could send to Oceanere Lab or Vibe. There were times when I wanted to give my son a msg and his phone was dead. Other then that. The app was excellent!,
"Good app for knowing what to do around the ship, reading the food menus, finalizing bills, etc. But needs work when errors occur. Very little feedback and ways to get out of an error state when they happen.",
App is for grrat to view events going on throughout the day. You can also see the restaurant menu before dinner to make the ordering a bit faster. The texting kind of sucks because it lags depending on the ships WiFi.,
The app was very confusing in that it was difficult to find the page you wanted. Too much information was hidden levels down in the selection levels. It was difficult to get to the internet. It was also difficult to log off the Wi-Fi.,
Works well and good for knowing what's going on and where it is. Ok for messaging your group. Had to restart app several times. Could've been due to inconsistent wifi strength.,
"Barely remained connected while in use, let alone anytime I had to back iut to a different screen. Constantly had to manually disconnect from internet and reconnect, them reopen the app in order to hope to be able to send a message to others onboard.",
"App only takes a few minutes to get used to and then you'll be able to see where you're dining, what the menu for that night will be, what shows and movies are playing, what characters and other activities are ongoing. If the itinerary updates, the app will update to flip flop events. Our day at Castaway Cay was rained out, so they switched out day at Sea and Castaway Cay. Messaging works too, just have to check in the messenger portion of the app if you're expecting messages.",
"Major pain to get sync-ed up upon boarding the ship and EVERYTHING on board expects for you to have a working app. Finally got it working on day 2 at sea. Also, I had used the app to pre- schedule several activities for my family. Once the app sync-ed on the ship all the activities I scheduled for my family members disappeared on my app and transfered to their phones, even activities to members that didn't have a phone. All their activities just disappeared. Fortunately, I had papercopies.",
The internet service for certain providers was no good. This caused many delays within the app for notifications. Giving it 5 stars anyways because the app is still a great and helpful idea. Just need a service provider that had better roaming connections.,
"Very useful app, a little difficult to navigate and some features are not as intuitive as expected. But essential for your cruise! The map is the best part.",
"The Disney app on board is extremely frustrating. It drops connectivity often and there is an incredible delay in your messages. Don't be fooled, the app is not a real time chat, it's more of a message board. I couldn't communicate with my kids and they couldn't communicate with us. Not sure why an organization like Disney can't have a proper communication tool...they keep nickel and diming their guests when all other cruise companies offer free wifi and drinks.",
"Very difficult to connect initially, but that's probably a problem with the ship's network. Chat worked for me, but other members of my party would not receive messages until much later. No useful information was provided about any of the scheduled activities/events, often just repeating or rephrasing the name of the event in the ""more details"" section. Please, provide more information for events and activities. Having full dinner menus available was very helpful.",
"App was working mostly for announcement, which was helpful, but other than that it was very buggy and clunky. Im still not sure if my orders via these app were confirmed. Definitely there is still some work that should be done on that app, because it can be very helpful",
Would like a schematic of the ship on the app. And where to find elevator to bring us to the 12 & 13th floors. Also what floor ship is disembarking and embarking. Wifi is not strong throughout ship. Handicapped accessibility areas for shows.,
There was an issue with the WiFi. It kept dropping and causing me to have to reconnect. The messenger part was not reliable when trying to get in contact with family members on the cruise and on the private island.,
"Really any one test this App. To log in I requests to apply your reservation, it asks for your birthday on the res.. and connects to the OS calendar. If you're over 44 make you page through 500 to 600 calendar months. Hey tell the programers to pull their head out of their shell. For some one that pays $10k a year for Disney vacation. This is a customer failure.",
Great add for cruise info.,
Tried to check in the app Won't accept my surname which I can't change. To add photos of passport and a security picture the photo and app don't match and then doesn't show whole picture or it rotates it. My security picture it says it isn't right and won't accept it. I haven't been able to get any further so won't bother,
Overall very easy and reliable. Excellent for planning events and activity aboard the ship. Only complaint is the app doesn't notify of a message unless it's open. Won't push notifications. (iPhone 8 and Samsung S7),
Navigation within the app isn't very intuitive. I wish the app gave more information pre-cruise. Notifications of messages while on board don't always go through right away.,
"Refreshes for two seconds each day to show the program for the day but couldn't get the chat to work throughout all the trip. Doesn't have a search option, hard to navigate.",
It worked when we were on the boat and didn't have cell service. But when I was typing I experienced some difficulty with deleting or backspace. The wrong text will delete.,
"Keeps signing me out. And then it's hard to get back into my account. Currently, it's not even giving me an option to sign in... only to create a new account. I've had my account for many many years and even just checked my cruise last week. Now I can't even do that. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it's the same. This new update sucks.",
The app crashed often and had to be reloaded. It took hours to get messages. We missed out on a lot of family time because other members of the family weren't getting the message until the activity was long over. Nice app for activities and menus.,
"Most things worked fine like the daily schedule and the descriptions of restaurants, etc. The messaging between individuals on the ship did not work. Also, need better wi-fi connections.",
"The app was really useful on the ship making it easy to find activities and characters. My daughter loved watching the characters change on the countdown. Great cruise, great app, I'm very happy.",
"The app was helpful with showing the schedule and other options BUT it was awful with wifi. You could pay, I chose not to pay but I couldn't use the texting my cabin mates/friends option because I wasn't allowed to use any wifi. That was very frustrating.",
"Overall useful, but after two days the text messaging feature mostly failed and I couldn't message most of the people i wanted to. You need to fix the text messaging feature Disney. It needs tobe reliable.",
"Very difficult to find things - multiple screens and all behave differently. Hoped to refer to it to recall info about the cruise, but it automatically erased everything after we disembarked.",
"Unfriendly user experience. Difficult to use, missing information, and now we have to use our mobile devices on a vacation where we are trying to unplug and relax. Definitely the wrong direction.",
"Overall, awesome tool for keep tracking of all the activities on the boat and communicating with other cruisers. Recommend adding other things like making or viewing open nursery spots and getting an alert when laundry is done and ordering room service through the app. App did crash several times a day.",
I was not able to view the deck plan and continually received the same notifications from previous days (very annoying). I turned off the app after a few days. Other people in our party had other issues.,
"Horrible. Even the crewmembers were having trouble with it. We finally figured out how to see our daily charges, and we had been double charged. Guest Services reversed the charge. Never did see our final bill. Difficult to use.",
The chat/messaging didn't work very well unless you were on the shop wifi or you would get the message late. The option to chat was hard to find at first because it was at the top and not with other menu option at the bottom. Also the description for events were not clear for who could participate. For an example- Edge open house all ages was not for little kids but 11-14 year olds.,
The app was okay.. You are dependent on the app to communicate to others in the group but often the messages were delayed so getting the group together on time was difficult... the list of activities and happenings were very nice to have.,
"The app itself is a must-have! Connectivity on the ship was spotty and messages were often delayed or didn't go through at all, likely more to do with the ship's wifi than the app.",
Great app on-board. Love the on board texting between family members and how all the activities were on there. I kept having an issue staying connected to the ships Wi-Fi though and had to reconnect many times to be sure I got the most up to date info,
"This app was useful when texting family members and receiving daily itineraries and reminders but I was never able to receive texts from the Oceanears club. Oceanears club said it was a Guest Services issue, Guest Services said it was an IT issue, IT said it was an Oceanears club issue. All I got was a run around and it never worked. Yes, you can carry around the wave phone provided but if it's lost, stolen or broken you are charged around $300. It worked with every other department on the ship and even at scuttle's cove on Castaway Cay. If this issue gets resolved, I would gladly give it 5 stars",
This app worked fantastic. It allowed us to check what was happening each day. Had an alarm so we wouldn't miss any show. It allowed us to text each other to see where they were at. Also able to check our bill for charges we made.,
The app works most of the time. I have a few suggestions to make it more user friendly: -users should be able to input personal activities. -users should be able to search with key words -users should have the ability to deselect categories they don't want. For example we don't have a kid in Vibe so we should be able to hide those. -When you ❤️ an activity the app should take into consideration the length of that activity and made the following ones a color.,
"Useless, except for the stupid countdown timer! Seriously never was able to connect my room to the app. That's after 2, count them 2!, Disney cruises this year. LOVE Disney cruises, hate this stupid app. Friends had no problem using it...but, it never worked for me.",
Overall good. Sometimes WiFi is inconsistent so it does not load the info properly. Would be nice to have the ability to download a PDF of the menus.,
"The app was actually very convenient and handy on the ship. My main issue was lag time and functionality of the chat feature/WiFi connection while on board. Other than that, great app!",
"This app helped our group stay in contact, helped us get to the shows that were suggested by the staff. It is a must have when going on the ship. Make sure to ask staff to help plan. The staff that helped us was excellent. Jon, Victor definitely kept is entertained, great suggestions of food options and the best spots to go for shows and even a little magic for the kids. Oscar was a great with the kids. Patrice was an amazing artist with the towels and very accommodating with the bed layouts.",
"The app was an amazing tool. It helps us to keep track and time of all different activities on the cruise; see the menu of the day and in which restaurant you were eating on that day, choose favorite activities to receive reminders, and the best part is the chat which allows you to commtunicate with everyone in your party while you explore and enjoy the cruise.",
"While the app is useful for finding activities, needing to be on wifi to use it and nothing showing up ahead of time make it difficult to use. It would be nicer if things were organized differently.",
"Very good app, able to schedule activities and my phone would alert us before the activity so we were on time. Also we could preview the dinner menu each night. It made our cruise even better...no missed events! 😊",
"The biggest issue with the app is the fact that it doesn't save my password. After logging in and enabling fingerprint logins, the next time I try to login with my fingerprint, it says my password is incorrect and I need to reenter it.",
"Easy to use and once on board, you're able to see every activity happening and where then set reminders. Couldn't have managed without as there was so many things to do!",
I sail in a week and have been trying to log in now for two weeks and it keeps saying there was an error and to try again later. Any more later and I wont be able to talk to my family through the app. Didn't have this problem 2 years ago. Seems like this app needs an overhaul.,
goes in and out with the wifi on the boat. you have to reopen it every few minutes to reconnect to the wifi and update your messages. or you can pay 100 bucks for unlimited wifi for a 5 day cruise. you can make reservations and find out everything that's going on during your entire stay. pretty cool app,
"The app was a great way to communicate while on board and was helpful when checking on daily activities and dining. However, when setting up my account I had to submit my birthdate. The only way to do that is to go backwards one month at a time to the correct month and year. Since I was born in 1962, it was a very long and tedious process to get to the correct date. There is no way to just type in the date.",
would be perfect except the app crashes often. messages will not send/receive with no indication. every now and then you have to kill the app and reconnect wifi to get messaging to work again.,
"This was very helpful to see all the available schedules and it was nice to have the text feature to keep in touch with everyone. A couple of times the messages were delayed, but overall, was very pleased.",
Nice when it works. The app was great to use to find things to do where to go and talk to my people. But that means it has to work. So we had trouble with opening the app many times. Or we would text someone only for them to receive it an hour later.,
"There app worked adequately, but some improvements can be made to allow media sharing and preserving filters when navigating backwards. What makes me the most sad is the loss of chat history upon disembarking.",
The app does not function well for android. The app won't stay connected or reconnect. When connected the messages were not sent on order. the rest of the app worked well when connected.,
"Great app, but would freeze constantly and I would have to reset the app almost every time I wanted to send a text through it. Also, the map of the ship section never worked.",
The trip was great. The 95 minutes to get through customs was a ridiculous experience. Disney should have had ground transportation when we booked the trip not when we get on the ship. Very poor experience in Galveston. Will not cruise through this port again.,
"App is pretty reliable, however several people in our party had problems setting it up so it would be nice if the app laid out better directions (ie, have location enabled, airplane mode on, etc.)",
"°o° Overall amazing, useful and helpful. On my droid it did keep switching me to the DCL Crew for some reason. Also kept forcing close, & no notifications for messages. I wish there was a way to track where people are that youre connected to through messenger.",
the idea of the app is great however messages were not coming through timely. downloaded the app mostly to communicate with my family on the cruise and I was disappointed with this aspect of the app. The other features were the best of the app.,
Lots of crashing and connectivity issues during the Cruise. Works well when it functions properly. Would like to see a few improvments including response to oceaneer notifications.,
"Solid app for organizing and coordinating your cruise activities. Includes an instant messaging function to communicate with others on board. Easy to organize listings of activities by type or venue. Allows you to create a personalized schedule by favoriting different activities, and provides push notifications of upcoming favorite events. Can receive messages from the cast, including updates and notifications from the Oceaneer's Club (kids club), guest services, merchandise, etc.",
My disney cruise app experience was great. I was able to get notifications for anything I planned to do making it simple to navigate through my itinerary. The chat feature allowed our party to stay in communication on ship too.,
"The app doesn't always notify you when you receive a message. Also, it would be nice to see an integrated activity itinerary of your whole family's/stateroom party's plans, possibly using your disney app avatars to identify what each person wants to do or ""liked"". A visual time block itinerary to show activity overlaps may also be helpful.",
Great info bad chat service: This app was very helpful for knowing what was going on around the ship and the island. I also like that it could show me where i was on the ship to help me navigate. I used the app the purchase internet and check the amount of useage. however my family was in 4 different cabins. we linked all our phones which was a process of typing in everyones chat ids one at a time. then most of the time the chat features did not work on the ship or ashore so it did not help us.,
"The app works very well for keeping you informed about ship events, dining options and your cumulative bill. I think Disney can expand the functionality to make on-board purchases (like drinks) easier to deal with",
It's a but difficult to navigate. My Grandmother could not navigate that well. Need old fashion paper to help. Since wifi was very slow the app was slow. It's got a good bones but needs improvement.,
"The messaging feature is nice, but not the most reliable. Use the room phones instead. Great way to keep track of your day! Thorough information with several ways to search.",
Great app to have while on board the ship. We could see all of the events that were happening during the cruise and favorite it. We would then get notifications 15 min. before the events started. It was also nice to be able to text the other members of my party.,
"The app doesn't allow me to create an account. I'm not currently in the U.S. so maybe that's preventing me from getting this set up. It's frustrating scrolling through 30 years of a calendar, month my month, just to say try again later.",
"Great info, easy to find and save events. The only complaint is that when scrolling through a day, it would refresh randomly and take you to the top of list again.",
"Good app, but cannot book through once underway. Would be helpful if there was an interactive map like at the Disney parks to find where activities/characters are. And if they added a map for castaway cay too.",
"confusing navigating the app a little, but overall great access for all the information you want on your Disney cruise. Well recommended. Loved that I could plan ahead for dinner with the menus.",
Overall a great tool to communicate with other guests. Make sure everyone in your party downloads it before leaving. Easy to see all the ship's activities and you can search by category. Only downside is you can't search by an event title to see if it is offered more than once.,
This app was excellent to see what was going on during our cruise. The messaging part was horrible. Kept disconnecting and we would receive a bunch of messages all at once.,
The Navigator was great but the messages while on the cruise were sometimes not delivered for a half an hour to an hour. Very frustrating when trying to coordinate everyone's location.,
"Amazing, It made my trip so easy and fun. I got to communicate with my friends and family that were on the ship with me without having to pay for wifi which was great and I was able to view showtimes and other times on the planning section. Thanks for the memories.",
Super helpful for navigating our magical cruise!! Very impressed!,
Great way to keep up with ur cruise before hand and during.,
"This app made it extremely easy to keep in touch with our group. The adults could plan our activities and flag them on our children's app so they knew where we would be. Also allowing us to ""help"" plan our children's day to assure they weren't in the kids club playing video games all day. Only issue was texts were slow to go through, and you often needed to log out of the app and then back in. Adding the time we were sending the original text helped.",
Constantly had to reconnect while on the ship. Messages were very delayed as result. 😢 I try to avoid advertisements in apps! We prefer the paper navigator. I do not use QR codes!,
"App didn't work a whole lot so it wasn't reliable. Wish DCL still have paper reminders of tastings, meet-n-greets, excursions, etc. The app just isn't that reliable to do without it.",
"this app is great to help manage all the things going on on the ship. character appearances, tasting classes, bingo... it's all here! I appreciate the menu previews and reminder functions most",
Generally not bad but kept failing and had to start over several times. The concept and layout is great and the push notifications are invaluable.,
"Like other reviewers I found the chat function to be just ok. Delayed messages, frozen app due to messaging, app crashes (due to messaging). Our friends with IOS experienced no such problems.",
"It was pretty easy to use but didnt have events that required tickets, so we missed out on events. Would be great if you could build your itinerary with alarms!! So much to do!",
"When it worked it was great. Kept me on time for all the things I wanted to do. However, it crashed multiple times daily and requires a complete phone restart to get it working again.",
Great tool for communicating with your party and find out what's going on aboard. Only issue was I had to often completely close the app and restart to get messages out.,
Great app. Great design and very easy to use with helpful information and personalization. Only 4 stars because the texting feature required almost constant app closure for new messages to come through.,
"It was a very good app, while on the cruise. It helped us to see our upcoming events. However, it could be a little more user friendly (i.e., I had to stumble around to get to the person to person chat function).",
"APP does not work. Only guest services knows how to configure phone to work on network, so 10 people trying to help 4000 people. And needs to be reset everyday. The tech on ship is outdated for 2022, it's outdated for 2012. Time to hire professionals to get a real app to work at sea.",
The app was clunky and very spotty on the messaging side of things. You have to close out of the app and fully reopen it to check notifications for events or for messages since it crashes quite often.,
The paper navigator was much easier to use. I could not get more cell to turn off everything and blow through our data package in 1 day. Never could get to the sea connection desk at the right time. So I just turned it off.,
Like being able to text each other on the cruise. The con is the app is constantly disconnecting from the ships Wi-Fi so you miss messages a lot because it does it so often.,
"This app had the potential to be excellent, just needs to get some of the bugs worked out. The app kept crashing. I have high hopes for it to be worked out. Disney cruise is the best cruise!!",
It was great when it was working. But sometimes the texting part wouldnt send or it would be delayed. Great for reminders on upcoming meet and greets or activities. Easy to navigate.,
"App was useless 80% of the time. The chat was useless because of wifi connection issues. Getting messages about children was spotty. If child was in distress you may never know for hours later or at pickup. Paid for seaconnect, charged double because of wifi connection going out and charged for mbs even after logging out of the seaconnect app. This app and cruise wifi could use a major over haul.",
"Most of the time it stated that I didn't have internet, even guest services couldn't turn it on unless I bought the internet package. I had to ask for paper menus and check for activities through the tv. I thought this was taken care of.",
Chat never worked for us. We should have had access to some sort of activities schedule prior to sailing. The charges to the rooms were not available to view once we left the ship. We PAID for internet access (free on other cruises) and it was slow as I remember dial-up.,
Just got back on the 28th from our cruise. This app was a huge convince. We were able to keep up with the daily activities without paper and could keep up with eachother with the messageing feature.,
"App reflects overall CS experience with Disney Cruise lines - terrible! Waiting on app to chat with agent, returned to end of queue 6 times (8 hours!). Once agent connected, wasn't near the phone (""YT? Please try again later, bye!""). Ship counter was much worse. 4 hours across 6 visits, repeatedly being told we're lying, but when they finally realized it was *their mistake* - ""Would you like a free shore excursion?"" Cruise with someone else - avoid!",
The app was easy to use. I did need assistance from the guest services to unlock the messaging portion because of my profile. Once I got that up and running it was a lot easier to communicate with others.,
Crashes a lot while on ship and useless at castaway cay. Helpful..when/if... it works to keep in touch w large groups. But still lacks timely message exchange and can cause some members not to meet or miss what others were planning,
Vital for getting the most out of your cruise.,
"Great to use and decide what to have for dinner ahead of time or if you want to order from another restaurant. Also great for planning day. Would give 5 stars if I could put it on my Kindle Fire or Asus Transformer Pad, would really be helpful to use it in room on tablet or even laptop. Would also be helpful when onboard for activities it would keep your filters.",
The app worked great for us on our cruise...messages were received timely and able to get notifications of events. Only issues were with activity filtering was limited and food service times were incorrect for the most part (e.g. Cabanas showed breakfast served something like 6:30-8:30 PM. Oops).,
"Handy to see what is going on for the day. The text portion was helpful but frustrating, if the app isn't open you are not aware that you have a meaaage. Also, it does not work on Castaway Cay.",
"Crashes on BACK when using on Galaxy S5. Messages often come in hours after send. Would be great to be able to use chat while on Castaway Cay. Initial sign up having to scroll through every month between today and when I was born was absurd - should be able to select month, day, year independently. When it worked it was helpful - info available was handy.",
Excellent to use on board,
"This app really help enhance our time on the Disney Dream. It was a wonderful planning tool, helped us navigate around the ship and even let us text one another. I really like it!",
Repeatedly have trouble opening app. It never recognizes my password even though it's the same every time. Might be good if I could ever open it. It has opened a few times and I like looking at the countdown with my kids when it does open.,
"Absolutely love this app! Everything you need while on your Disney cruise, gives you detail information about your account, from balance to dinner menu's, theatrical show times, movie times. Just everything. We had a blast on our 2nd cruise on Disney Dream.",
loved the app idea but needs some improvements. ability to send pics in chat would be great. Also there were delays at times with messages coming through which is worrisome when you have kids at camp etc.,
"keeps crashing. worked fine until after the most recent app update - now whenever I log in and tap on my reservation, the app crashes. so, apparently it will be useless to me. I have an Android.",
Great planning tool to use on the cruise ship! Wish it were a bit more descriptive in the events including if they required reservations. Liked that it showed a running tally on our tab.,
Availability to message would come and go. Messaging would crash the app constantly on my phone on one day of the cruise. It had trouble sending and receiving among all of our phones on another day.,
"App worked great on my last cruise. But since the last update, I can't login. Using the correct username and password just gives a ""Something went wrong"" message. Since the app is now useless, it didn't even deserve one star.",
Great for finding out what's going on on the ship. Texting feature not so great. Text show up hours after being sent. We used the phone provided to keep up with family on the cruise.,
App was pretty cool. It assisted in helping to keep track of all the activities. Chat feature was a little shaky. Had to reset it once or twice but it served its purpose.,
"Excellent - very useful! In our case, when instructed to put phone on ""Airplane"" mode we were not able to log into the app. Otherwise it worked great.",
"At first it seems overwhelming but once you practice navigating, it aids to plan activities accordingly. We only experienced a few delays with the messaging but overall the app is helpful.",
The app was good. Sometimes it disconnected from the on board web service which made it putzy at times. But definitely super helpful and enjoyed its convenience. Easy text app for family members around the ship and on Castaway Cay.,
Helped with scheduling but it crashed alot. Also it would have been great if it had other useful info. Like maybe live wait times or business and minor things like temperature outside etc.,
Frequently locks up and/or crashes. poor push notification when closed. Would be nice if it worked when disconnected from shipboard WiFi to stay in touch with others while ashore.,
Great way to find out and plan adventures on the ship. Texting was inconsistent as at times they wouldn't go through until 30 min plus and others right away.,
app went out multiple times and would not work. Definitely an easy way to message friends onboard and check activities but would not respond sometimes for long periods of time on cruise.,
Great for keeping up with events but message were not reliable. Would have liked to click on a location and see event schedule of that location. Would have liked to see weather forecast and ship location & info through app.,
"was good before I updated. I tried to log in using my email and password, but it keeps saying that something went wrong. my family members can all log in with the exact same info, so it might be my phone. my vacation is very soon, and I would like to actually use it...",
Worked ok! Was inconsistent with sending texts onboard. Great for updates on what the schedule for the ship were! Overall good app! Not perfect by any means!,
"Connectivity was spotty so using the texting feature was difficult, but it was great when it worked. Having the schedule available with reminders was helpful.",
App is amazing when connected. Our party often had to keep reconnecting to get message updates - not ideal when the messages from Oceaneers come in but don't notify you right away umless you manually keep checking.,
One word -- Outstanding!,
"App very useful with daily events schedule and dining reminders. Chat is unreliable. Sometimes works quickly, sometimes there's a long delay between send and delivery.",
This app keeps crashing and I get a message that the app has a known bug. It used to work about a month or so ago. Not sure if a recent update caused the issue.,
The app was great to keep up with daily activities and information. The communication was a neat feature when it worked. I was never able to communicate with my mom or daughter but I was able to communicate with my hubby and youngest daughter.,
"It was AMAZING! Super easy to use, extreamly helpful and informative! The wonderful texting feature helped our family stay in touch throughout the entire cruise! We can't wait to use it again😊!",
"The app works great to check the daily activities and find places on the ship, but the chat feature does not work well. Most of the time we received chat messages only if we had the app open.",
"Great! The only thing that would be better is if you had live maps. I know that might be too difficult but it would be really cool if you had your location in the ship to navigate around. Like a live ""You are here"" type of thing.",
great app for tracking events and getting alerts for things you favorite. the chat function is unreliable though. took 10 minutes to get a message at times.,
"App is horrible. When adding reservation, it asks for your birthday. When you click on birthday, a calendar pops up with current month. You literally have to swipe month after month after month, to go back 65 years. Why don't they have the Wheels like the one on 'Price is Right""??",
"The chat option is spotty at best. It either works. doesnt work, or messages are super delayed. Since they're forcing the digital Navigator on board, it gave a 15 minute warning to whatever activity you 'loved' as a reminder.",
Love the app. Suggestions.... the picture for the day is to big and fills the screen up. try to find a way to add connect@sea directly to the app. being able to see what others in your party favorited would be nice.,
A friend was unable to use the app on their iPhone and iPad because the devices were too old. Basic operation was fine. The deck maps were really useful.,
The app was very hard to get working. Had to go to guest services for help. My wife couldn't get the app to work at all on her phone. Our friends who cruised with us also had similar problems,
"Had issues with text messages coming through in a timely manner. Other than that, it had good info while onboard to help keep track of on cruise activities.",
"Informative app however if you are using the messaging part of the app, the messages do not go thru when you send them most of the time and requires you to restart it multiple times to get them to go thru.",
"Just used Navigator on a cruise and it was awesome! Everything offered on the ship was easily accessible including all menus, plus can schedule activities and chat with other cruisers. Great job, Disney! 👍👍",
"Nice App, Messaging, Easy To Use. The messaging was a nice way to let others in our group know where we were or what we were doing. The dining part reminded us of which restaurant, and the menu for each evening. the account allows you to monitor your account daily if you are wayching your sprnding. The daily activities allows you to plan your day and reminds you 15 minutes before something starts. Nice app.",
Disney should invest in Android UI designers. The only way to select my birthyear is tapping continuously from 2004 til the corrrect month in the 1980's... One.tap.per.month. Several other apps let you choose year independently of month/day :(,
Idea behind the app is great. Unfortunately it crashed more often than not. Fix the bugs and it could be a great tool for cruising.,
"Did not stay connected on the ship, very frustrating!",
Very slow/didn't always load while on the cruise,
"amazing app! really great alternative to paper. it would only be better if everyone in same cabin can see other persons ""my plan"". also better alert for text messaging",
This is a great app to have on board! Only problem is it locks up on you every now and then while scrolling. This could just be an issue with my Samsung Galaxy S6 so your experience may differ. That's honestly the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.,
"Decent, but more in a better than nothing way. It's not up to Disney quality. I wish you could click on the schedule and have it take you to the ship map where it is, automatically.",
great app and done well for handling a cruise. it would be more beneficial if it could have some maps about the stops built into the app so it is easier to navigate when leaving the boat,
"Great way to keep in touch with others on the cruise with you. Plus, you can see the schedule of events and get notified before your favorites are about to start. Works even if you don't pay for the WiFi and also has a map of the ship!",
"The app is great for getting information, but the message function is completely unreliable. Quite often, messages are delivered as much as an hour late.",
Useful for many things. Thanks. Improvement areas needed: 1. Time did not update when we changed time zones. Telling us is not enough. 2. We were never able to use passenger to passenger chat. I couldn't get connected to my daughter.,
Updated phone and app and crashes. Not useable. Disney needs to have a 3rd party develop the app. With new ships coming on board it needs to be redone for easier use.,
"Works well off the ship. Not reliable once you are on the cruise. Missing activities, hard to navigate and chat works when it feels like it.",
worked fine except: chat messages were delayed by hours sometimes. Would like to see the ship's position and heading with the app; even an update every 10 min would be helpful.,
"Great app! We used it a lot on our trip to keep track of planned activities, our dining rotation and all the activities available on the ship. I liked that you could also preview the dinner menus for each dining room.",
"This was our first Disney cruise, everything was amazing. Our server who's name is Mareliny was the best we have had in any restaurant we have ever visited. She gave us a 7☆ service. Thank you Mareliny. And our stateroom host Christa was the very best. Everytime e came back she had our room exceptionally clean. Thank you for great service.",
"You Need This App on board No wifi on board that is affordable. at sea you probably will not have a signal on your phone. This app works when your cell phone is in airplane mode to keep you informed of events and all of your scheduled events , dinner arrangements, showtime schedule,. ect",
the app was great but the access was a bit faulty in some occasions. The app when workable was excellent and I am glad this is a feature they have on the cruise.,
The chat feature wasn't always reliable.,
"This is what you need to enhance your cruise, my wife and I loved the fact that you can see the dinner menus ahead of time. The texting feature was a big help to stay in touch. Then you can customise your schedule.",
"Great app with loads of features and messaging during your cruise. The messages were sometimes delayed, but otherwise it worked great.",
"App works great for activities and dinner reminders. The messenger portion is not so great. Theres quite a delay in the sending and recieving of a message. If you ask ""where are you?"" By the time up get their response, they arent there any more.",
It worked fairly well for our group. Some had issues installing it. For one person it kept dropping out. Our personal experience was fine.,
Works good when on the ship except for the messaging. It has some what of a delay getting to the person one is chatting with. It does work when setup thw way they mention it.,
"It's really helpfull. The only thing that should be added or clearer, cause i couldn't find it, is the themed nights. They were nights when people were wearing their pajamas or the Captain night. Otherwise, it's a good one",
Overall it was good! The only feature I wish was available on the app is the photos to view and purchase. Other than that it was very helpful to view everything.,
It was great WHEN IT WORKED! Often I would get a notification that I was not connected. That was very frustrating! I couldn't contact my family or find out where they were. ☹️,
App was great for what I needed. Only issue was the maps didn't work. Managed to navigate ship with maps near elevators. Did not use chat option.,
"It was great to have the navigator on your phone, however, the messager part is not reliable. This is a major flaw because that is the main form of communication on the ship (no cell service).",
"I really like to app, but wish the app was able to have the countdown clock as a widget to your home screen for android. That is why it is getting the four stars. If you add that option five stars all the way.",
"Our first DCL!!! We couldn't have had a better time. It was so easy to keep in touch with my party through the messaging, and the updates for events were amazing when we were in the middle of something else. Thank you for an amazing experience. See you real soon!!!!!",
"Super informative and helpful app to keep up with all of the events, activities, character greetings and port adventures of the cruise. We were also able to communicate with other members of our party without using our personal data or wifi!",
this is a great way to navigate on the cruise. it made the cruise so much nicer and easier. it gave me an alert every time there was a event going on. and it's so easy to use. it tells you all the details and everything.,
"Extremely helpful! With so any activities being offered, this app is great to help one plan the days. The chat feature is also great to keep in touch with your party and any new friends you meet while on board.",
we did not like it at all. It was so tricky to use. Kept disconnecting. I didn't even want to carry around my heavy phone. The paper schedules were much better to see everything at a glance. This app and bad luggage service are reasons I probably won't go on another Disney cruise.,
"Go way to see what is going on the cruise, however, there were features we were not aware of that would of been more helpful to know of. We messaging on board to each other my husband never got notifications like he was suppose to so he had no idea I was trying to talk to him.",
Works great for finding activities and easy to use. Chat feature on iPhones did not work reliably on last cruise during April 2019. Apparently a known issue. Chat worked fine for Android.,
I loved using it on our cruise. Wished the notifications worked better when receiving text messages. The concept is great but drained my battery constantly.,
"DCL app is awesome! All the information you need for a great, smooth cruise is right at your fingertips. Loved being able to text through the app.",
There are not enough words in anyone's vocabulay to describe your first experience on a Disney Cruise Lines Adventure. The app is the perfect complement if you like to keep up with events (and your family) in real time. Try and see!!!,
"Mostly works on board during the cruise. Messages sometimes hang and then flood in hours after they are sent. Messages should include timestamps that tell you when they are sent, not just when your device receives them. This would alleviate confusion when hung messages flood in.",
The app is very useful. I wish the chatting features worked better. Several times I had to close the app and restart it to get messages.,
"Great idea, however I didn't always receive messages from my party nor did they from me. This created some very tense moments. Please address that problem, otherwise great app!!",
Great app. I used it on the Disney cruise with no problems. I would like to comment about pirates night. Many people on the ship did not know anything about dress up pirates night or dressy fancy night . Maybe when people book a cruise this fun feature should be mentioned to the people. We dressed up both nights and had tons of compliments on our pirate outfits and dressy night outfits. Would send a pic if I could. Loved every minute of the cruise. Happy Disney cruise and dvc member. Michele M,
good app to track and remind ourselves of the events happening. Also a good tool to stay in touch without a working internet. would be good if d chat has a photo sharing feature too btw.,
Overwhelming at first but wonderful by the end of the first day. Please create a tutorial which could be accessed prior to boarding. App was great for guest services and dining. Loved the chat feature rather than standing in lines.,
"Messaging texts were delayed and sometimes weren't received until hours later. Good for schedule, but not all scheduled events had descriptions so we didn't know what some things were.",
The app should be able to see the pictures taken from the cruise similar. Connectivity isn't great so messages are sometimes delayed or not received.,
Our Disney cruise was perfect! There was so much to do. Attention to detail is notable from decor to cast members to service. Every aspect was awesome! Have already recommended Disney cruising to others.,
Lots of glitches but good to check what's happening on the ship. Took ages to get it working on my phone once on board - even staff had problems trying to link my room. Once up and running it was helpful.,
This app is super helpful while onboard-allowing you to use your phone. it has most of the details you want and need. It could be more user friendly but i wouldn't skip it,
"Pretty decent, but the text messages were not instant. Sometimes they took hours to show up. It was a great app for keeping up with events on the ship though.",
"does not work well with android. the cruise offers 50mb of www free prior to leaving but if you access the wifi and send traffic through it to find your itinerary, it counts against the 50mb. theres no way to access your itinerary without sending all traffic through it. need an option to block www while making itinerary and cruise activities available.",
"Samsung Note 9. This App was the lifeline of our cruise, communication between family members, between any cruise personnel, areas, parties, etc and us. Maps, schedules, events, reminders...all were done through this App. Needed for cruise and must load on all devices PRIOR to leaving port.",
Chat in Edge did not always work. My daughter did not always get the text I sent her as you can see if it sent and was read. Sometimes it started not delivered. We used the stateroom phones instead. they worked better.,
Doesn't allow me to sign in. See in the reviews others are having the same issue. Just gives me an error message. Other Disney apps allow sign-in no problem. Hope Disney is working on a fix.,
"Wouldn't allow simultaneous wifi and 4g connections. Push of notifications was weak, causing family missed connections. Had to restart app repeatedly to create pull of notifications.",
Not good. We never did get the app to communicate between our family members. Basically just used it for a list of events. Loved the voyage though!,
Easy to use and used it constantly when on the cruise. Would love to see real time cruise tracking of where the ship is located just for fun. Liked that I was able to text with my wife while onboard.,
"I really like this app, but I tried logging in today, as it's exactly 1 year out from my cruise, and I wanted to see the countdown. It says my password is incorrect, but it isn't, and just sends me in circles. By reading the most recent reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one with this problem.",
great app. didnt like having to reconnect with the wifi randomly while on board for the messaging. . . but messaging was available! great for the map or itinerary,
"Overall this was a good app. a few suggestions, have the deck plan open to the users location. Also add a section that shows the names and photos of the ships senior crew.",
"We had a lot of trouble getting the app to work. I did visit the tech people on the ship on 3 different occasions, but still couldn't send or receive mesaages regularly.",
"Great app but it disconnects from the WIFI frequently which makes the texting unreliable. The wave phones work well for messages from clubs, etc. though.",
"I cannot use the navigator. I \t says it is installed, but then it says This app is not available for this device. My computer, my phone or my kindle. I need to check in today and can't use anything. I can't even do my early check-in. I really am in need of some personal help, if possible.",
great for looking at the daily schedule. terrible for texting as everyone has to have the app open at all times with screen on in order for messages to go through.,
Messages could be delivered better. Some messages did not come through when sent. You had to go into the app to check and see if you had messages.,
"It keeps disconnecting from the Disney wifi and you cannot receive messages if your phone is locked. I had to keep unlocking it, reconnecting to the wifi just to check the messages",
"If you are doing a Disney cruise and not using this app then you are not giving your cruise all that you can give! You can set alarms for events that you want to do around the ship or for excursions off the ship, you can chat and talk to people you meet or family that are on the ship as well. This app is a must if you're doing Disney Cruise.",
"Great app for sailing on Disney Cruise Line. Just got off the beautiful Disney Magic, wehad a blast on board and the app made it easy to keep track of everything happening on the ship. Looking forward to our next sailing!",
"Great APP to use on the ship. I wish I could see my discussions after leaving the ship to show others. Also, there needs to be an ""adults"" category to make finding adult only activities easier since the majority of actitivites are family and youth.",
inconsistent. could not access all features. messaging was slow and could be delayed hours. did not receive new info when activity was changed.,
"Schedule information was good, but the chat functionality was problematic at best. Nothing but failed and undelivered outgoing messages with no notification for new incoming messages.",
"useless update...Everything is all sold out anyway.... 3rd cruise with Disney. How many freaking cruises do I have to go on to get priority booking? The app update just slaps me in the face that I have apparently not done enough. Between DVC membership points, actual park tickets, dining plans, and having to go to the theater everytime a Disney/Marvel/ Star Wars film comes out, may as well have the Mouse direct draft my bank account, and STILL everything is SOLD OUT so I cannot book cabanas.",
Really well organized and easy to use,
Great app! You will need to set up your phone so your wifi doesn't auto-disconnect or auto close the app in order for the messaging to work well though.,
Good for information but unable to use a lot of the functions and the text were extremely slow to reach the other party if they went at all.,
"mostly usable for chat. you should be able to wifi call other guests. you should also be able to book things like the nursery so you don't have to call with a ""land line"". we had to pre-order meals for dietary restrictions. it would be nice to notify the chef that we're on our way so we don't have to wait 20min once we're get to the buffet.",
It worked ok.... But hard to figure out and navigate. Using some of old terminology would have been helpful. Like explore should have been the navigator.,
The app was great to help my family keep track of all the activities around the ship. The deck plans are great to help you find everything! I would recommend anyone going on a disney cruise download this app!,
Terrible!! App would not stay connected onboard. Guest Services reset it a few times. Could not rely on it working to receive notifications.,
"Many great features... intuitive, easy to keep track of your schedule. Sailing route map and weather map would be a nice additions.",
It was a really nice app. I always got my friends texts sometimes it was slow but normally right on time. If this app was never here I wouldnt have been able to find my friends (:,
The app made it very convenient for us while we were on our cruise. The navigator showed times and locations of all the activities and characters onboard.,
"Had 5 people in our party. Those with I- phones received HUNDREDS of duplicate notification reminders, and their text messaging to any phone NEVER worked in the app. Had better luck with Android phones.",
"Great for daily information and schedule of events! The messaging part of the app worked sometimes, but not consistently.",
"You can't order or book things through the app like other cruises. App is responsive, just lacks an interactive experience other than viewing menus.",
"Horrible! Lost service repeatedly, stopped updating, and lacked a lot of potential to be great given all the tools we have these days.",
Great app for keeping in touch with our family and friends. A little slow on receiving messages. Overall a great app,
"Lots of great info, but had to refresh often in order not to miss a message from my group. There were times when we almost missed a show or fun event because one of us didn't realize that the other had sent a message.",
disney cruise lines are exceptional!! best cruise I've ever been on!! staff was amazing and the food was out of this world!! the app was incredibly helpful to navigate all the activities!,
App is okay. Could use an option to see what tastings have openings and book them from the app like you can the kids center times. Also a ship map would be useful.,
Just finished sailing on the Fantasy ship with my daughter and her family. We had the time of our lives. This is the second year in a row that we sail with Disney and find the service excellent along with entertainment and activities. Disney is truly magical I would recommend 100% with children.,
I would le to see what I can purchase I excursions character breakfasts and bedtime stories before I book. None of this is available now anywhere unless u have a confirmed booking. This app should off experiences and information as well as able to sign in once booked,
"The app itself was good, but it kept disconnecting. Ask guest services on the ship and they said it was a know issue with this update. Come on disney, it's an easy fix",
Does not work well for messaging other people. Does not notify us of messages. And our phone times were off due to not having a connection so the event times were incorrect in the app as well.,
"Great app! Would love to also be able to swipe to see real-time ship stats (ship speed, position, air temp, sea depth, etc.).",
"They have improved it, but we still had issues with it freezing on us. Texting on board was nice, didn't need their phones!",
"Great to use on the ship, although print navigator is still easier to see the overall day. Occasionally has to be restarted throughout the day.",
"For what it is the app works, however the messages system does not work what so ever. We either wouldn't receive the message at all or would get it several hours later.",
"I liked it at first but all of a sudden it says it's outdated and I have to go to the app store to uldate & it doesn't work, we are leaving in about 130 days & would really like to get this straightened out but it seems impossible.  Not very happy at all.🤔",
"The app works well. I would like that, once you set your filters, they kept set. I had to change them every time.",
Good as long as it doesn't crash. had to restart phone (Samsung S10+) multiple times to get it working again. Needs castaway map.,
"This app has not worked since the new update. After logging in I see my upcoming cruise, click on it and the app crashes. pretty much worthless to me.",
spotty service. always have to re-enter app to get messages. texts don't go through easily and it is difficult to connect to friends,
Amazing app! I love that I was able to stay connected with my son anytime we weren't together on the cruise. I also loved that it includes the itinerary everyday as well as reminds you about your dinner time and location.,
Easy to use with free msgs. I WISH however that there is a GPs version of the boat map so you can see where you are!,
"Good app, changes with the day but everyone in our party had a hard time staying connected to the wifi so couldn't rely on the messenger service",
Our daughter lost connection to the app and it took us an entire day to get her back on. This made it tough with communicating with her.,
Not constant and not available too often,
Excellent tool to use on the boat!,
"Need to develop a keyword search function, we ended up scrolling through days of events to search for one event.",
Internet was intermittent on the ship. It was difficult to get our phones on the system. The back button would take us completely out of the app,
"App would only work for about 2 to 3 hours at a time, then had to wait in guest relations to get it re-fixed. For others in our party it didn't work at all. Also it wasn't very user friendly when it did work",
I really liked this app. It lets you see all the happenings during the day and save favorites to youe personal list. Also it lets you view your detailed balance of charges.,
"This app is truly awful! The glitches are continuous I have had to uninstall and reinstall it soooo many times! If you are trying to book things pre boarding, good luck 😣",
"Perfect resource for show times, activities and meal times (menu) when on the boat.... would have missed out on a lot of fun stuff without it!",
I keep getting an error message that something had gone wrong. I used this app before on my trip and it was awesome. Going again in November and i want to start the count down.,
"Great idea, great quality - like all things Disney. Messaging is a little slow. Deck maps didn't open on my phone (Moto e4).",
The whole cruise was pretty sub-par and this app was somewhat useful but mostly unreliable for messaging others on board. Definitely needs some improvements,
"An occasional delay in communicating with fellow travelers, other than that - a great app! Typical Disney efficiency and customer care!",
"It worked great most of the time,but whenever I entered a group chat, things would get mucked up and I'd have to close and reopen the app which could take up to 5 minutes",
"Found some links difficult to locate. Suggest, maybe making it bold. Honestly, everything else was great. I just found this part frustrating. Thank you for a wonderful cruise.",
"The user experience is simple and intuitive. it would be beneficial to add extra features such as the ability for staff to properly converse with guests if needed, or to make reservations at the spa or specialty restaurants",
Hard to get stateroom connected at first. Once connected it got better when wifi was working. Sometime Wifi on board was spotty at best.,
At times the written information is so tiny as to be useless. Not really user friendly for elderly users. Also for people just starting out with Smartphones.,
Randomly does not up date. Several instances one event showed then later another showed. Did not seem to refresh. Plus having to be connected to dcl guest caused issues. Deck guest kept not working,
Most valuable (for me) for text communications between the family. Also details ship attractions and daily activities. Even reminds you of your specific dining room plans for each evening.,
Awesome app....very simple to use. East to view and more information than daily paper schedule. Download before travelling with DSL in case of difficulty getting wifi in board,
"This App was amazing, it was extremely helpful and easy to use! With it being our first cruise with Disney Cruise Line it did not disappoint us! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars",
"The app crashed several times a day on the cruise. Also, quite often could not connect to the Guest wifi to get on the app.",
Good for looking in to what's going on the ship and the dinner menu as far as the texting part most of the time you get them way to late to make a difference unless you just keep it running 24/7,
Having the activity schedule and being able to communicate with the rest of my party extremely helpful and convenient. I used the app all day everyday.,
What a great experience the whole trip has been! This app was just one more way Disney takes it to the next level.,
The info on the app is pretty good but the chat feature never worked well on my family's S9's. We kept getting logged out and would not receive messages we were sending to each other.,
"content within would be great for the trip. however, it crashed constantly, and messaging could take hours to reach other guests.",
Worst app ever.. dates are not directly editable so you have to flip thru pages by the month to get to the year you need.. the UI is not intuitive.. absolutely the worst..,
"l have been on other cruise ships, but they do not compare to Disney . The service was impeccable. You were so awesome, the food awesome, the staff, everything was perfect. I will be back.",
useful app. not always up to date and doesn't allow you to roam (on your own data) whilst usong the app. also i would encourage disney to allow you to surf their sites.,
Very user friendly and so convenient. The app was used to group chat and because each day's itinerary for the ship was listed we could easily book activities as well.,
The new updated version keeps crashing when I click on my reservation. My cruise is in a week and I'm afraid that I won't be able to use this onboard!,
App has a delay so texts on board were late. The initial setup wasn't very clear. Overall the app gave you the daily information you needed during the cruise.,
It works so well! The only issue we had was with making appointments for Guest Services. That page would load fully and glitch out. But Everything else is seemless,
Loved using the app while on my cruise. It was very helpful. Sometimes the messages on chat didn't go through right away though. That would be the only thing that I think needs to be adjusted.,
The app is useful but for the most up-to-date information you have to be on wifi which costs a fortune. Disney should figure out how to make sure the most up-to-date information is accessible on the app without wifi.,
"Great app in concept but the execution is terrible. It froze, locked up and crashed multiple times a day.",
Cruise was wonderful. App confusing to navigate and slow to send and receive messages...still needs some work.,
Very helpful app. The only thing it lacks is a map of the ship for ease of finding where all the locations are at.,
"Countdown clock is fun before you board. App becomes fully unlocked on board, where it is very useful for picking activities and texting your party.",
"Loved the countdown, could never get it to work onboard. It would update then give a message it was unavailable. Service desk was unable to help with it.",
Multiple issues on board with connecting and the text functions. Otherwise it's useful for getting date and times of events.,
download it before your trip! friends trying to download it while on the ship had trouble. The app works on the ship without having to pay for any internet package.,
"Enhanced our cruise experience. Needed to view menus, see events around the ship and find your way around. Worked flawlessly, or magically.",
The app was very useful while on board. We had difficulty loading and Disney was very helpful in determining a fix.,
"Love this app, it provided all the information needed during my cruising experience. Disney has really outdone themselves with these apps the one for the parks and cruise.",
Easy to use and great to see the activities on the ship. The messaging part needs some work. You get kicked off the ship's network alot.,
Good app. My only complain is that text messages are confined to notification area and appears cut. No way to view full body text message.,
"Couple of glitches to workout, but a must have to keep track of your itinerary and available activities! Overall, runs well, our family has droid and apple devices.",
Selecting your birthday from a calendar widget was painful. Not totally intuitive as to how. To find different functions within the app.,
it was good experience with DCL the app was a bit different from the paper navigators and took time to adjust but there is lots of info avail. and is great for planning kids club activities,
We just got off the 14 night Panama Canal cruise and the app did not have all the entertainment listed and the paper Navigator doesn't either. We used the app mainly to see what restaurant we were eating and the menu.,
the app is great except the chat function randomly stops working. there was a full day I couldn't send messages and other day there was a few hour delay in receiving messages,
"Sometimes a little challenging to follow but while on the ship it was very helpful with ship map, my plans, character greeting times and to text between our family group worked very well!",
"Had an fabulous time. The service staff for table 114 was amazing (all 3 if them), as well as our room 10092 person. She was very friendly and very helpful. Everyone who helped with us were top notch. Thank you for a wonderful time",
"Very glitchy, not always useful... required several trips to the connect@sea desk. Paper navigators are still the way to go.",
"Very useful, liked the ship maps and the dinner menu the most. The event guide and character tracker was very helpful.",
Very useful in having the list of daily ship activities accessible by phone.. no more need for paper copy of this info. Also extremely helpful in maintaining contact with travel companions using special ship guest wifi.,
"It was awesome to see the navigator right on my phone, but messaging was sketchy. We always had to restart the app to get new messages.",
"Great way to keep up with the day to day activities. I would give 5 stars but for the lag in messaging. Sometimes, the app needs to be open in order to receive updates and messaging.",
The BEST vacation we have ever had !! The disney app was so helpful in planning our days as there were so many activities and we didnt want to miss a thing !! Thank you !!,
"Android version of this app very poorly implemented. To enter date of birth, you have to keep swiping through all the months. This is just one issue.",
Times given on App aere at times different from the actual begin times. Excursions had no descriptions like on board activities. Often had issues with app stating connected and notifications were often sent 15 min or more after the activity already had started,
Would like to have multiple screens on the app at the same time. Spent extra time opening the itinerary having to go to chat and back again.,
Chat was helpful for staying in touch. It didn't always go through the first time. I like seeing all the possible activities and choosing favorites.,
"Works very well on the ship, eliminates the need to carry the paper navigator, very useful to be able to filter for specific events on any day of your voyage",
Some favored activities would inexplicably disappear when browsing. Please add bridge report with location too the app. Liked the handy map of the ship's decks.,
It was convenient to have all activities at hand. Glitchy sometimes so alerts for activities late but for the most part good. Liked the countdown for the cruise,
"Good app,  but has some issues.  Filters don't stay applied... you have to re-apply anytime the data updates (every few minutes).",
"Had some connectivity issues on the Wonder, undelivered texts. Content is great, kept us updated on what's going on during our cruise.",
"Effectively shows on board activities but could have a few more features. Such as being able to share activities that you ""❤️"" with others from your stateroom. Also a Disney themed countdown widget for the home screen would be nice and one for your next planned activity.",
very useful on our trip. needs a button bar at the bottom for quicker access to frequently needed items beside the map and chat.,
App very helpful. I used it a lot. Would be good if the time of day that text messages were sent could be displayed.,
App worked great and I consider it a valued tool while on the DCL cruise. Minor challenges with chat on Samsung 7 including messages were sometimes delayed and required several restarts after locking app.,
Great for seeing what is going on each day and creating a plan of the things to do. Used the chat feature regularly. Well thought out app and easy to use.,
App is incredibly useful for communication on the ship. It needs to be able to clear its own cache though because it locked up numerous times for me,
Spotty wifi. Even when you're paying per megabyte it still didn't work at times. The layout of the app is confusing and not user friendly. You'd think a multi billion dollar company like Disney would put a little more effort into their app.,
It is a great idea and very useful. Unfortunately it crashed several times and messages were not delivered or received in a timely manner. It worked well most of the time.,
Too many bugs. Too slow to update with messages. Terrible navigation. Can't update messages when on public internet. Not up to Disney standards. I say this as a professional app developer.,
Would be great if we could use it to call each other as well as send messages or even share pictures. Another great thing would be to use it to locate each other whilst on board.,
Very user friendly. The chat option to stay in touch with other members of your travel party is great! You don't need to worry about using Wi-Fi with that feature.,
"Great app, but was very choppy on ship. Kept having to reset and re log on. Messager was great but again kept loosing connection and having to reset.",
App and navigator did not match when you add an event to favorites. This caused a lot of scheduling problems on the cruise.,
Loved this app. Daily reminders 15 minutes before something was scheduled to happen and made it really easy to find what was going on and where. Would recommend and use again!!,
I experienced major delays using this app to communicate with my family while aboard the Fantasy. My plans and the daily information worked well. App did not work on the Disney Island which was upsetting because we were unable to find family to enjoy that time together.,
If you don't buy the internet package I had to continually reconnect with the app to get it to work properly. We had the same issue the last time we sailed and used the app.,
Poor navigation; someone missed the UX class. Please add a communicator tool so you can text others. The onboard phones are outdated.,
kept me updated on activities as well as could look at the dinner menus in advanced. got a lot of people going on the trip who have phones? you can text them via this app.,
Not very informative with rhe navigator would lime an option of a paper copy so it is easier to view. Keep in mind that not all guest are text savy,
"The DELAY in Receiving TEXT Messages was a Major DISAPPOINTMENT! All Messages were Received at least ""TWO to THREE HOURS"" after Messages were Sent. On the POSITIVE SIDE, we found the Other FUNCTIONS Very ACCOMMODATING (ie, Dining Menus, Entertainment and Events Scheduling).",
overall the app. was great. however there was nothing to let you know you received a text and there is a long delay in receiving text.,
Very useful app on the ship. Just wish the texting was faster. I would get text 10-15 min after they were sent sometimes,
It was hard to add people to the chat messages. Not user friendly. Should be able to add them by name or room number. Some messages weren't delivered.,
Download the ap before you go. This is awesome for traveling in a group or solo. I wish members of our group had it from the beginning. It uses the ships wifi but you are not charged for it.,
So I'm told I must use this to manage my cruise book activities etc. But all it does is give an error and say please try later. UPDATE. It's working now. Can rate better once it's close enough to cruising time to make bookings etc.,
"The app worked great, when trying to figure out what I was doing durring down time and finding the characters.the messaging worked great.",
App didn't work after the first 2 days. The help desk tried to fix it but couldn't figure it out. Definitely not the quality one would expect from Disney.,
"A wonderful app, but crashed frequently. Overall, this is the best way to communicate and stay informed on your trip",
"Loved the cruise and the app was very helpful. Some delays in reaching family members, but VERY helpful in knowing what was happening every day.",
Does not work well with Android users. The app is constantly shutting down. There is no countdown clock and I cannot check my itinerary.,
App won't let me log in. Just spins and spins and spins. Happening with the Disneyland app too so maybe the update my phone did makes these apps not want to log in. Frustrating!,
It took us all week to really learn the app. I wish I had seen a tutorial or instructions. I found it hard to navigate for the first time on this cruise. I will know it better on our next Disney cruise.,
Locator app would be helpful. Maybe I missed it. But how about a listing of on board stores with hours of operations. Also an walking app to give you not only where the store is but maybe an active inventory of what is left in each store.. pie in the sky.,
"The app was useful for dining menus; however, was very unstable when you were trying to open my plans or other links. Even sometimes said need to reload or try again.",
The app sucks... DCL relies on the app to do everything but when the app needs to restart daily and only works to recieve your daily notification about COVID symptoms its kind of worthless yet required. DCL needs to look for alternative methods of communication or spend some money further developing the app.,
Pretty difficult to connect to wifi and text messages do not always work. Pretty disappointing for the cruise.,
App worked great on board and at Castaway Cay for staying in touch with family members. The app also worked great keeping you up to date with what is going on and reminding you of what events yiu have scheduled and where they are located.,
The Disney cruise line app doesn't work properly. This was the only negative thing about Disney cruise line. Everything else was amazing!!!,
Not the easiest to navigate. Still had to get the printed navigatior each day to be current with the plans each day.,
"My phones time never adjusted, so I always wondered what the real time was during the whole day. It wasnt just a hour difference it would be off by 7, 4, 8. It was weird.",
"A bit delayed communicating between my family I was with. But other than that I loved checking upcoming events, reminders for events we were booked in. And the ability to check my balance and purchases.",
"App was ok. But never worked on the ship that well. If you bought the overpriced wi fi it updated, but the texting portion was poor.",
On my Samsung Android device there is no way to type in a birthdate to add a reservation. I had to scroll though 30+ years of dates one month at a time. Certainly the developers and business testers would have caught that and noticed how big of a PAIN that is for us paying customers.,
Great app. I used it extensively on board. Would be nice to add a function or link to access weather on the ships during at sea days.,
Loved being able to see all the activities and menus for every day but the app crashed multiple times and the messaging portion only worked 30% of the time,
Great to have onboard for all information. Crashed from time to time on Moto Z2. Chat app would not notify all the time when messages were sent by boat mates.,
"Very easy to use ,.great for viewing menus at the various dining experiences on board very easy to keep a track on your spending",
Difficult at best to set up and then not enough free wi-fi to make it worthwhile. Don't you think guests spend enough money to get at least free unlimited free wi-fi like any other hotel? Jeez!,
"Poor quality control. The app crashes very often and requires to re-register the room repeatedly. The eng team should be ashamed, very annoying.",
A helpful app but alternatives should be offered on the cruise. Sometimes can also not be very intuitive.,
Split screen makes it difficult to see all the inform. Moving between screens not consistent.,
"great, easy way to keep in touch with family on board and in Castaway Cay. Also, easy to keep up with activities without carrying around the Navigator.",
The app was great to stay intouch for a large group. Only glitch is it did not vibrate fir seperate messages unless the app was open.and the app went down on Castaway Cay.,
"I wish I could search for activities by keyword. I also wish the map was integrated into the activity descriptions, so one could click the location in the description, and view the location on the map.",
Terrible app for a terrible cruise. Great for seeing all the stuff you can't do on a ship where they close everything as soon as dinner is over.,
a lot of useful functionality. text feature very useful for keeping in contact with your group during cruise,
"Good app but not availible for older model android phones. Also, the messaging feature was difficult to use at first.",
"This was a fabulous cruise, dinner team with Gavin was awesome, Tony in lounges was the bomb. The 2 ladies that did the sign language at plays did a marvelous job. Would like to go on a Disney Cruise again! Thanks to everyone 😘",
"Wow, the Disney Wonder Cruise exceeded my expectations! What a wonderful time. It was truly a vacation to remember! The musicals are phenomenal! The children actually enjoyed going to child care!!!",
The App is a MUST for the cruise...make sure you sync/link your reservation before setting sail tho so you dont miss out on anything.,
"great app! wish it did a quick tutorial on the features when u first sign in and beware the using of data, type logout or else it keeps running!",
The Disney Cruise is so big. This App definitely help my family and I navigate around the ship to different activities. Also it shows you the itinerary for the day.,
"Very helpful app, a must use when crusing DCL. Con: sometimes it wouldn't update properply which was frustrating especially with the ""chat"" function.",
"Good (and only) app for the cruises. Be good if there was an option to see where the boat is in the ocean, instead of just using the stateroom tv.",
"Great app for cruise information on dinners, excursions and onboarding activities. I love that I can chat with my family or crew members on the app while on airplane mode. Very helpful.",
It's a very useful app. A bit of UI tweaking and it could be easier to use otherwise the functionality is very good.,
Had to constantly reconnect to the ship WiFi to get the app to work properly. Missed several texts in realtime.,
good app that works well and easy to navigate. i would like to see the map tracker of our travel with the speed...etc.,
"great to use while onboard. connection gets sketchy when on deck 9/10, and messages sometimes take ages to process or dont set off notifications.",
"The messaging feature that we tried to use between our party of 4 was so bad, unreliable, and delayed that we stopped using the messaging all together.",
App is a great way to see what's going on at all times on the ship. At times the text messages do not go through or are delayed. Overall great app!,
I love the Disney cruise and it was a great tool to use on the boat. Thank you. Feel free to send me discounts I would love to enjoy another one at a reduced price I would to go with my family again,
It's useful to have on the ship. But not very intuitive or user friendly. You have to play around with it and go through some trial and error in order to use it.,
"This app is not easy to navigate. Also, I had challenges using the chat feature to communicate with my wife. It did not always see her online. I think it is in serious need of a change to the main page.",
The messaging was inconsistent and schedules didn't sync 100% but otherwise it was a great and useful tool.,
Love this app. for the Disney Cruise. So easy to use to find happenings and events around the ship. Nice chat feature with new chat massage notification included to keep in touch with kids while adults are at play.,
"I recently went on a Disney cruise, and I used this app. I would rate it a 4.5 because the app was pretty slow at some points of my trip. Other than that, the app was pretty good.",
Super flaky. Messages dont always arrive or are delayed. Notifications are slow to come through as well.,
"Good for keeping track events and plans on the ship, but the text communication portion is not as reliable as it should be.",
"Excellent app ensures we didn't miss a thing and could keep in touch with family on board, would be lost without it !",
"needs help on the communications. map and navigator are great, but i do wish the texting worked more regularly",
"The app was helpful. It has a learning curve, but we got the hang of it after a while. More information than just the paper available for each day.",
Was pretty good you can use the app as long as you are connected to the ships wifi and you do not have to purchase the internet package to use it,
"The app is very handy when it works, but the messaging portion is unreliable and requires logging in and out constantly in order to get messages.",
The app is solid and kept me informed of all the goings on the cruise. The only thing I would add is a better search capability.,
"Communication App is a great idea and worked well for us. I would sggest that you add our Charge Account information in there too, so that we can be up-to-date on day to day.",
"Great seeing the daily activities and setting reminders, only issue was the chat. It did not always work.",
"Amazing experience, except for the internet package that I bought the best one and was gone in a couple of hours without using.",
Worked well for checking the ships schedule and my personal reservations. Not good at texting other shipmates. Could have been the internet service on the ship too.,
Great and useful tool to use. Anyone with a phone should use this app to navigate the ship. Especially useful to contact family members easily.,
Needs to be intuitive for older passengers not too good with technology. Billing appeared to ha E double charges which we had to keep going to Guest Service about.,
"The texting could be better, there is always a delay and sometimes texts are not been sent or received.",
Very glitchy. Was preloaded on my iphone but quit working once on board. I loaded it on my Android ang it worked ok but my wife was continually booted off and my son's in-law never got it to work even with the help of the crew.,
"For those doing back to back cruises, it would be nice to access our 2nd cruise while on the first. It would have helped us manage our adventures on our own vs having to visit the adventures desk.",
The app worked mostly ok. Sometimesa little difficult to find what i was looking for... And sometimes the messaging wouldn't work.,
"Charges with added gratuity show up twice in the folio. Otherwise, it's a great app while on the cruise.",
Very helpful tracking all the on board events and keeping contact with family members on board. Only issue is app required to be left open to get notifications and messages.,
App does not allow you to ask questions or communicate with guest services just tells you where it is. Gives you an idea what is going on around the ship but is slow to update when changes are made.,
Got booted off the app and now can't log back in. Due to sail next week and now can't use the app at all! Have tried to contact support but received no reply or acknowledgement of my message or what they are doing about it,
Excellent. App helped a lot with planning the week. Professional and courteous staff. We had an awesome time and cant wait for the next cruise with Disney Cruise line.,
"Great! For schedules and things to do aboard and ashore. Only downside, on-board chatting was delayed receiving messages.",
I love the app but Guest WIFI wouldn't stay connect & had to keep reconnecting which wasn't good since text msg through the app was the why we talked to our kids when we weren't together!!,
Great App except the messaging has no pop up to alert you have a message. Very difficult to use on ship when communicating with family members.,
Very helpful app! Was able to see the menu options well in advance. Was able to easliy see daily activities too!,
The app was very helpful to my family and our son loved the countdown. The on-board text messaging feature was awesome.,
"The app makes for a Seamless cruising experience. A few glitches (Chat feature was sllllloooooww and Cruise Place Holder option did not work right away), but seamless, touch free, line free experience. I LOVE it!",
"easy to use, convenient, schedule constantly updated, broke everything down in categories, message feature was a big plus",
Only common complaint is having real-time chat notifications otherwise helpful for planning your days out. Capability to cancel/book/reschedule events would be nice and ability to purchase merchandise to pickup.,
I love this app!! It makes it easy for the family to stay in contact on the ship and keeps us updated about events amd attractions on board. This app is must have for cruisers.,
"This app is fantastic, except one thing. It is not available in Japan Store. It should be globally available since Disney accepts guests from all around world.",
Great for contacting your party members on the ship but little tricky to use and have to constantly check it because it keeps kicking you off.,
My issue is I have an android and it makes me sign in every time. I'm afraid on my cruise I'm going to have to sign alot which is a pain. It doesn't allow to save password.,
"Can't even open the app! This used to be good but when logging in just the cricket going round, and round, and round. What's the point? Update seems to have broken the app.",
"It's a complete waste of time, all it does is display a message saying 'something isn't right - try again later'. In other words it does not work and fails to even give an indication of what is wrong.",
Awesome app! Easy to use and made planning our time on the ship so much easier! My daughter loved seeing the countdown.,
"Easy planning and communications with others in your party. Does not need paid wifi to work. Deck plans, dinner times and all events on ship easily shown on app. Track your account balance too.",
this app was not excellent to communicate with one another. it was promoted that it would be. it also did not make it easy to look at the itinerary for the next day.,
Way better than 2 years ago. Complaint-wifi was spotty on parts of the ship. Ideas for improvement-add sit down breakfast and lunch menus. Be able to order room service.send pictures.,
Doesn't always send messages on time. It may be the ships wifi signals at different parts of the ship are not very strong.,
"Perfect to use during the cruise.. one suggestion, clear cache and delete data after you connect to onboard wifi.",
"The on board chat function only works when I'm actually using it. When my screen times out, I get kicked off and receive no notifications about new messages",
Difficult to use. Not intuitive. Wifi on the boat is horrible and makes the application almost unusable.,
Easy to use on ship and pre boarding. Worked very well to see activities and menus. Good for texting family members while on cruise,
Nice concept. But does not work if you do not have the reservation. I have tried and tried to get back in to the app to view my cruise my family and I are taking this September. Please fix and rating will be higher.,
"On android when you select the birthday, you have to tap backwards month by month. For some of us older travelers, it's a lot of tapping to get back years and years",
The app keeps logging you out making receiving messages in a timely manner extremely hard but the schedule for ships itinerary is great to find something for everyone,
I love the update from the last cruise. My biggest complaint is the connectivity on the ships. The wifi on board The Magic The Dream or The Wonder is very spotty and text sometimes and alerts go through late,
"This app was extremely useful while on the cruise, I highly recommend using it. Heck the countdown timer up to the cruise was adorable!",
This app it's amazing! Most helpful app I have encounter with even being an app support technician myself! It was my first cruise but felt so confident with navigating the ship with the app as my ally!,
Most of the time the app did not work. It was unreliable to use for texting. i had to restart it many times to get it to do anything.,
"great for planning and knowledge of the daily activities, but very poor message feature. It. does not have an efficient delivery of messages on the ship",
Dislike that it can't be used to plan before hand. On ship messaging slow if they even go through at all.,
"Everything from viewing your bill, to free chats with other cruisers, and checking the theature showings. Color me impressed, this really did work.",
"I love the upgrades from my previous cruise, I would like to suggest the menu to be enabled to allow me to pre-order so my server can save time so I'm not waiting to be served until after all the families with children so I am able to enjoy my evening and not be in the dining room when servers are clearing the tables and rushing me to hurry up and finish my dessert so they can leave.",
Awesome App and features... needs locator and map like DisneyWorld to help navigate ship more easily...if this feature added 5 stars.,
Just got the app. It has crashed on me nonstop since because of a bug. Rating will change when bug is fixed.,
"Very helpful with daily activities times. However, when sending texts they tend to not show up on the other end for hours later...",
It crashed a lot on my S8. Would freeze up and would not get messages unless the app was open.,
Very helpful while on board the ship. I checked it frequently and also used the in app text messages.,
Would have liked more info on how to access certain features or where some info is found while on the ship (didn't finde drink of the day info or ship highlights until the last day).,
The app works well on Cruise. We love the emojis so much! Just wish it also have record voice message function.,
Sometimes had difficulty with this app while on the ship. It would get stuck on one page for over 24 hours!,
"i like the idea of it, but does not work great. Some stuff comea thru right away some messages can take a couple hours. ot was nice to gave the activities listed there,",
"pretty good app, could use a bit more information. There was no heading some things i was trying to look up, but 90% of the stuff was there.",
Works great for texting on the ship. Doesn't help with calling and doesn't always go thru right away.,
"I liked using the app with the different areas like dining, characters apperances, events by time the app was very useful!",
It is a good app but the guest wi-fi went on and off. I had to connect a numerous times to be able to see the app.,
"I didn't like the app, I used it on the cruise but had continuous challenges with it. it only works while on board.",
"texting was intermittent, had to reset the app many times to ensure I was getting all texts...and even then, I wasn't even sure...",
"As a navigator, reminder it is ok. For texting- terrible not real time. Hours of delays for delivery",
the app was great but wifi on the dream was terrible and kept disconnecting. it was difficult to het messages from other guest and the kids club.,
"It was a Great Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends! Great food! Diners truly a great experience. Jose and Dody added to our Dining experience, they are truly an asset to your team!",
"Of course it was very useful to have the app, sometimes it was difficult to navigate and a search function would be nice.",
Great to see and keep track of events on the cruise. Messaging is sometimes delayed.,
Great functions. Could use a map when onboard and it would be nice to be able to get to the port arrival QR code.,
A must have tool while you are on board. It get you connected with your family and staff members 24/7. It helps you plan ahead every activities so you won't miss anything. It's like having your personal assistant on your vacation. Love it!,
Why does this app make me scroll back by the MONTH to get to my birthday? That took a while then found out that it doesn't recognize my reservation number. Not impressed and very frustrated.,
We enjoyed our trip immensely! This app is very helpful in keeping up with things before your trip and while you are on the trip.,
The app has improved so much since last year. It is now needed on ship as they no longer provide daily navigators.,
"This app literally makes your Disney cruise easy! You will never miss out on an event, character or activity with it. Don't go on the cruise without it",
App is great except messenger feature is unreliable and messages fail to notify if app has been idle for an extended period of time.,
"It was really useful, specially to stay connected with Occeaner's Lab for Kids. I'd improve the onboarding journey, though.",
Was very handy. But still liked having the paper copy each day. Able to see the over lapping activities and when the activity is over.,
App did not update even when signing out and logging in again. My activites (character events that I signed up for) did not show on the days events,
"Works great on the ship, very informative & easy to use to keep up with on-ship activities, the countdown till boarding day is fun for everyone.",
"it doesn't work- won't let me passed the terms and conditions page, just says updating- please fix as i need this app for my upcoming cruise, and it seems as though others have the same issue",
"The Cruise was great and using the app helped so much, from what was going on and where to hearing from my little when he was ready to be picked up!!",
"There was no wifi. You guys seriously wasted your time taking away wifi but made this trash? Yeah, I can text people and not even get the notification back, real useful. Thanks...",
"this app is amazing, I have been on 7 disney cruises and going on a another one in March, it is really good when me and my brother split up and we need to text are family to tell them where we are on the ship",
Great app...needs to be a little more accurate. Many items I signed up for were not on my personal itinerary.,
"Great app, but we couldn't get the chat option to work. Otherwise a great way to track activities throughout the day!",
"Very easy to navigate, it helped to figure out when things were happening on the ship and at the ports as well.",
Alerts were inconsistent and not always in real time. Chat was sometimes in a huge delay.,
App buggy and unstable. Requires constant refresh to get texts. Better than nothing but not up to Disney standards,
"Has some kinks but otherwise really useful. Booking activities, finding stuff to do, and navigating the ship.",
Such a wonderful app! Love being able to chat and see the activities scheduled. Would like seeing a sunrise and sunset time listed on the app.,
"Can't book anything. 3 weeks now it's been escalated. Must be a long escalator. No help from customer service, tech team or anyone else that you have to wait hours to talk to.",
The app was great! It really helped with navigating the different events and character greetings around the ship!,
"Great app while cruising, to stay up-to-date on the happens around the ship. Great for communicating with family and friends while aboard.",
Never updated the Navigator. It kept saying I was off line. I wasn't going to pay Disney their exorbitant prices for internet service. My last cruise with this money grabbing company.,
Impressive software to use at Sea. Experienced a few hiccups but overall a reliable means for communication and organizing,
Great tool for inside the cruise! You can plan your day or the entire cruise! Gives you alerts of upcoming events/shows. Definitely a must for your cruise experience!,
Very helpful and easy to use. When you favourite an activity it sends you a reminder 15 minutes before.,
Fantastic. Worked well only problem was the ship's wifi sometimes wouldn't connect right away after leaving ship.,
"The app was okay, but the chat feature didn't work for me & I had trouble connecting to ship's wifi for guests.",
It was very nice on the Disney Dream! Only downside is the app kicks you off a lot. But I like how you can use the app to message friends and family.,
App is good for finding things to do on the ship but is terrible for it's chat feature. It's glitchy but I suppose it's the best they can do,
This app is horrible. Difficult to install. Continually loses internet connection. Difficult to find info. No search button. Worst ever.,
Absolutely wonderful. Can not say enough about the staff. Louis our waiter for dinner treated our daughter like a true princess. Thank you for a wonderful time and all the memories.,
im an android user.. can log in see my reservation.. tap to go into it and i keep getting message that app has stopped. we are cruising soon and this will be useless if i cant even get any further than 1st page,
love - hate this app. the app works great when in it. Maybe my phone but my phone would drop the wifi so the app stopped working. past that it's a good app.,
It's great when it works. I understand android has it's issues but the last two days of the cruise it kicked my daughter out on her iphone.,
There were several instances when signing up for a scheduled event was not working. If an event was full there should have been a note stating so.,
The messaging was a little latent. I'm sure Disney is working on this. Great App overall.. very usefull,
the messager system never worked! the main reason for downloading the app was to keep in contact with family and we couldnt do that.,
"I like the app for keeping up with schedules and account balances but the messages sometimes take hours to get to your other party members, making it useless in that respect",
"Internet in and out, went to guest services multiple times. Couldn't figure out what was happening when. DID NOT LIKE AT ALL.",
Great. It was easy to get all the activities and menus on my phone. The texting family had quite a delay,
"Is a very functional app once on the cruise. You can comunicste with anyone, see all that is happening on the cruise and have notificación about the kids club. It's a must once your in the ship.",
Not very use friendly or intuitive to set up. The way to delete read messages is hidden.,
"Great time, I only wish that they had adult only dining and more adult only activities. I get that it's a Disney Cruise but you are never to old for Disney.",
"Great service, great food, and loved the atmosphere. Down falls were animators palate has changed and we didnt make port at cast away. 😰",
Really enjoyed the app during our voyage! It was very informative and made planning easy.,
app was initially not working upon installing new version. If using an android you must turn off battery saver mode. So far it works now!,
The app works very well for daily planning. The text message portion works but requires regular log ins to ensure all messages are received.,
"I would prefer to leave my phone off and just use the ship phones with a paper navigator, but then again, I am not a younger traveler!",
It is such an awesome app. We were able to text within the app and it was great having it let us know what we were doing next so we could be there on time,
Recent updates have lost everything. They can't find my reservation and keeps telling me to try another time. Now its useless.,
A must have while on a Disney Cruise and on Disney's private island Castaway Cay. It worked very well during my cruise on the Disney Dream. I knew what was happening during the day and evening and where character meet and greets were.,
"App worked fine, no hangs, it could be better if it had ship deck plans and weather information similar to weather apps.",
I loved it while on the DDream cruise. The messaging was sometimes delayed other than that it was easy to keep up with the schedules and the happenings daily on the ship 🚢,
"worked great for messaging while at sea. didn't care to log in all the time, and setting up your age was a pain.",
"The DCL navigator was helpful in deciding what activities were happening, menus for the restaurants on the dining rotation, and times & locations for entertainment. You can also sign-up for various tastings and other activities on the ship.",
"Great app, when it works. Has all of the information you need but there are some issues with Android connectivity.",
Excellent app for knowing what is happening on your Disney cruise and for planning your days. loved the feature that let me know when my kid checked into and out of the kid's clubs.,
Liked it. The layout is useable but I think that it could be a little easier. Chat could be easier,
I downloaded the app for my S8 android and doesn't work. Only has a countdown clock function and nothing more. Need to wait until embarkation to use the app?,
This app was a life saver giving times for activities and menus. The kids loved it to see what was going on in the kid's clubs.,
this app is helpful with large parties. the wave phones are also helpful but they do not have the information available in this app.,
App works as required. Very impressed.,
"I've been trying for 2 days, so has my daughter, to set up our account for our upcoming cruise that we booked last week and no matter when we try, message says there's a problem asks try back later. not impressed so far.",
"The app will work once, but when I open it a second time it flashes the screen over and over and won't load.",
Please add a plan of the ship we couldn't find one once on board. We would love the ability to pay your folio via the app.,
"Easy to use and keeps you informed while you cruise. They help you set things up when you arrive, which is just another part of the Disney magic.",
"I found my self rather annoyed with it, I wish it had boxes , easy to find information, like movies in wonderland, and Luna what's happening , the vibe what's up, castaway club you have been here for 8 times this is your benefits, your dining plan ect",
"Not easy to find information. Makes it necessary to carry your phone at all times.now that I'm off the ship, I can't access my account information",
Doesnt work well bring back the paper navigator drains battery does not make sound when u get texted message in app useless would rate 0 if i could,
Our first cruise ever Disney made it very very enjoyable. The service was the best I ever had and the shows well worth it.,
Great way to keep track of activities on board. Unfortunately the messaging component is very slow to deliver the message to your party at times,
Doesn't give notification when they are Recieved if the app is operating in the background. Can take over an hour to receive notifications.,
"Overwhelming fun, never a dull moment. Abundance of exquisite food from sun up to sun set. Thanks for the great memories!!!",
loved the cruise! just wish wifi was cheaper. the app is a great way to keep up with family members on the cruise.,
Good app while you are at home. Works 1/3 of the time on the ship. Didn't work for us at all on castaway.,
Great app ! Let's you know what's happening all day and let's you set reminders so you dont miss out. Great way to keep in touch with your family and friends on the ship.,
Nice thought and differentiator to keep guests connected. The chat feature needs more improvements to be real-time,
The app made keeping track of all activities and where to go on the ship really easy. Can't wait to use it again!,
"The app made finding information easy while on the ship, menus for dinner easily accessible and made texting to family members on board super easy too.",
the app would cause my phone to crash. also the messaging would lag. I would receive delayed messages 10 to 20 minutes late.,
This was so helpful! The updates on activities & reminders were great. Please add a weather feature.,
"Wonderful!! The app was a great asset during our cruise, and even helped us towards booking our next cruise in minutes!!",
Loved this app!! Highly recommended using while onboard the cruise for a daily schedule of events and character appearances!,
Excellent app made the cruise easy to plan.. find activities and view the menu etc before getting to restaurant.. brilliant,
Very useful app new since our last voyage. Used messaging feature often with quick delivery most of the time. Also used activities daily listings.,
It was great! Except for the fact that they test the app alot and it makes the messages not send.,
"I liked the availability to see what events were taking place, but it lagged when reporting Wifi usage! Went over budget!",
crashes every other time i use it. disconnects from WiFi constantly. time stamps are not correct,
"The app works great on the cruise ship. I just wish the wifi wasn't so spotty, but it's expected on the cruise.",
Sometimes had bad connection and could not chat with my son but that was due to wifi connectivity. The app itself is great.,
"App worked fine when it worked and the chat option needs work, on more than 1 occasion it took 14 minutes for the other party to receive the message and more information and ease needs to be given about the Connect@sea",
Great information to keep you up to date on what's happening each day and to select favorite items you to keep with reminders.,
The app let us know in advance what was going on. Very helpful. Love the Disney Dream cruise. Wonderful time. Food is A number one.,
This app is a must on the Disney Cruises! Keeps your schedule and gives you reminders and updates of all your activities. Easy to use.,
having this app on board the cruise ship was valuable easy to use and made our trip that much more enjoyable Thank you. see you on the next one 6.1,
It is nice to be able to contact family on during the cruise...BUT youre lucky to get the messages to go thru. Had to restart many times a day,
"excellent for communication of activities. however, messaging family not so great. kept getting knocked off, messages wouldn't send.",
"Great idea, but the chat function is spotty at best and the app shouldn't require manually refreshing to get updated info.",
This was the best thing on our cruise. Always telling you what was coming up & what time. Exceptional all the way.,
Very helpful in telling us where and what time everything was going to be. I like that it had the weather for the day and a layout of the ship so you could figure out where you were going.,
Hard to find things like room service.. not easy to navigate. Internet on ship never worked consistently so didn't get to use the app mich,
I had a very good experience a first time Disney cruise staff were very friendly and helpful the ship was beautiful I cannot wait to do it again,
Great way of staying in touch with members in same stateroom while on cruise. Excellent up to date information in the activities around the cruise,
"Was able to get messages, but not always when they were sent. Great for knowing what is going on on board!!",
The chat feature is questionable. Sometimes it works. Sometimes the messages don't go through for hours.,
Easy to use app. Provided all the information in one location and great tool to communicate with while out to Sea.,
Great app. Just needs an update so the older android phones can see the deck plans. Other than that it was awesome!,
"Love the app before and during the cruise. After the cruise is over, the app loses its appeal rather quickly.",
This is for the app and the cruise line itself. App is great and easy to use. Cruise was terriffic.,
"the app was so helpfull, it made the trip so easy knowing all your activites and being able to see the menu for dinner ahead of time.",
"Only way it could be better is if the guide for activities had a way to change format to TV guide style, similar to the printed one.",
"Great app, and easy to use, the only thing was that messages on chat section sometimes had a long delay.",
The Disney Cruise Line Navigator app plans you're daily itinerary every day.its very useful on board the ship so you don't miss any off the activities & shows.,
"Schedules were very helpful. The chat often had a terrible lag time, but we made it work.",
"Concept is good, but messages from others are often delayed, sometimes by hours.",
It has all u need. But make sure u have your wifi on and in airplane mode. My wifi kept disconnecting and missed messages,
It froze constantly and messages didn't come through unless I opened and closed the app at least 3 times.,
"Overall, my experience with the app has been good. However I really wish it had a dark mode option.",
"App is good, but I wish it had better chat push notifications and I wish it had information on the restaurants /diners etc like hours menu stuff like that",
the navigator worked well but messaging other people lagged. you would send a message and several hours later they would get it.,
"The app has alot of useful features that will make your planning a lot easier like the messenger, the daily schedule, account tracker and many more functions",
This app is VERY Glitchy. Information does not match ship Information. App closes out or has errors. Especially with communications.,
Useful in most respects. Messenger function hampered by lack of notification until you open app. Otherwise no complaints.,
"Would love to have a countdown calendar widget, so I can put the countdown calendar on my 9 year old's tablet... Who am I kidding...I want a countdown widget on my homepage too :)",
Android app seems to have a lot of delays. Challenges with messages going through.,
"The app on Android phone does not have ""Exlpore"" tab, but the app on iOS does. I cannot view events or make reservations!",
"Great for ""filling in the blanks"" for the cruise, perfect for planning daily activities and deciding what to eat.",
"This app was a great tool on our cruise! It listed all activities, character greetings, shows and scheduled restaurant for the evening.",
Caused my phone to constantly tell me to login to onboard wifi. Within minutes of already logging in and even when I wasn't even using the app.,
"The app is ok, hard to get use to at first and you cant use it before the cruise so by the time you figure it out your cruise is half over at least",
easy to use. a must download for your disney. everything you need to know all day everyday. like a pocket concierge! kudos Disney!,
Works wonderfully on board. Only thing that could be improved is that I wish it would give notifications of messages received,
"I have been traying to add my reservations to the app for 2 weeks naw, and the app just keep loding and do nothing... This is here in land, I dont wsnt to imagine on board. Is ther is anothe way to book activities?",
"As with anything new, practice makes perfection!! Delivered informative information when needed! Can't wait to sail again and use this app again!!",
Overall pretty good experience. Biggest problem was messages not being delivered many times until hours after they were sent in the chat room,
"Very helpful, wished the filter settings would save through the entire cruise, instead everyday had to update them",
the app was wonderful! Only issue was the messages are terribly delayed sometimes so it was a little hard to communicate,
Honestly I'm a bit disappointed in this app. It continually told me that I was not connected and I had to keep redoing the connection.,
"Very good. I will say that the on board texting was mostly late, sometimes by a whole day!",
Super easy and organized help alot on the cruise and give you a reminder 15 minutes each event you pick and the most popular.,
There were some things I wished it had. Prices for restaurants and more information on port excursions. Overall 4 1/2 🌟,
"This is a great way to countdown to your trip, complete check-in, and stay in touch while on board!",
Good app with lots of info about your cruise. The ability to chat with a crew member came jn handy and booking activities was a breeze!!,
Great app for the cruise! Loved all the notifications they gave to help get us where we needed to be.,
Good app would have loved a calling feature and couldn't find a tone for notifications but that could be me over all though easy to work,
Awesome app! Loved the ability to text family while onboard. Great way to keep up with activities too,
App messengeronly works when open. Does not alert you if closed. Good for ship itinerary and that's about it.,
The app kept us up to date it was great for the before we cruise to communicate on the boat when it worked the ship wifi not so much yes I would use it again,
Loved this app. On the ship we were able to keep up with each other and where everyone was at or going. Great Job Disney!,
"it notifided me when ever i had dinner, or something i saved. it also worked well becuase it had a countdown. i loved it!",
"Was good. But if they had maps and directions like the Disney parks app does, it would be great!",
Prefer the older version. This version keeps booting you out. Not as easy to navigate.,
I liked this app except for the inconsistent way it returned from sub pages. Make the it the same in all cases.,
We our family had a great time frist time for us all Disney spoiled us they set the bar high I look forward to my next trip. And it will be on Disney cruise line. the entire crew members ROCK!!!,
"Very helpful! I was able to see what activities went on what days, chat with friends and saw deck layout for all 14 floors.",
Don't even think about taking a Disney cruise without this. Great countdown pictures. Looking forward to our next cruise!,
"I loved the Disney app, it made communication very eas with family and provided great cruise information' as well as providing us with reminders of our appointments",
Overall really great for keeping you up to date and allowing you to stay in touch with people in your party. Be nice if you could delete older messages,
The app continually crashed and did not allow for consistent messaging for communication on board.,
Is easy to use but the internet is very slow I spent 3 days in the cruise without internet and the prices are so high paying for internet isn't really worth it so next time I go to the cruise I am using no internet because once again very slow and not worth it.,
"Worked well on OnePlus 8 5g. Easy to navigate menus. Can't say for other phones, I've heard mixed things.",
"Can't access 90% of the menu options, such completing the emergency drill an excursion details. HUGE disappointment!!!",
"helpful to use, once you're registered! in order to register I had to hit back about 400 months to reach my correct birthdate (including year!)",
great trip and I highly recommend this app if you have children. you can locate all Disney characters movies and shows,
I can't get past the terms and conditions acceptance. It just says updating and spins.,
Great tool for setting your schedule and texting family but had to re-start it many times each day.,
Magical vacation and easy to navigate and communicate with other members of our adventure. Thanks Walt!!!,
Great to use when it is working. The majority if the time it opens and then closes out.,
"Staying connected to wifi on the ship is a challenge but when it works, the app is great!",
"Great way to communicate with members of party or new friends on the ship. Also, it's a great way to keep track of everything you want to do!",
This app was helpful doing my cruise,
Very difficult to download if you forget to do so before departure. Otherwise works great.,
"It was nice to be able to communicate, but messages came in super delayed for the chat feature.",
App worked well to see activity times but there was a major delay when trying to communicate with with other members of our family on the ship.,
sometimes message didnt go through for about 30 minutes after sending. it made it hard when trying to reach our party,
Great app sometimes the texts do not come through when on ship. Overall found it very useful!,
"Very useful to have countdown to the cruise. While on rhe ship, very useful to know what is going on.",
I used to use the fun Disney countdown feature for all of my upcoming Disney vacations. Now it only shows my cruise.,
So easy to use! Was able to set reminders for cruise events and activities I did not want to miss!,
Very helpful! Used it everyday. Great help to choose your dinner menu.,
I was really sad that all the dinner menus went away. I wanted to look back on the 5 days I was totally papered.,
Great app once I figured out how to get it working on my phone. The messenger part was very useful for keeping track of everyone.,
"overall the app worked, but it did disconnect every day, and at multiple times during the day.",
the messages were delayed when communicating to other passengers on board. sometimes 3 hours.,
Maps of our ship would not load and display properly on my Moto G4 Play. Notifications and activities listings worked normally.,
we had trouble talking to each other needs a lot of work. but was great to see show times. but chat needs to work better,
Loved this app! Made communicating on the cruise so easy! Had all the info I needed and it was updated often!,
"communication can be delayed sometimes, need to have the app open at all times for quicker messaging.",
"easy to use, keeps you updated on all events and reminds you if you have anything scheduled.",
Useful at times. I was frequently kicked off and unable to communicate while on board.,
Only displays notifications when the app is open. Messages in chat shown out of order and with wrong time stamps.,
The app in theory is great on the Disney cruise by the ship map didn't work and many times the messaging didn't go through or was severely delayed,
I really enjoyed using the app. I could keep tabs on my family. I also enjoyed having access to the menus and entertainment.,
Still more features and fun that can be added so looking forward to all the features that can be possible.,
"Very useful on the ship to keep in touch with family, receive alerts from the cruise, and keep up with the itinerary for the day.",
"When the app worked it was great, however, there were several days where it crashed repeatedly.",
Now that we can text with the app I would like to make calls also! With no stateroom phones It would make communication easier!,
Absolutely excellent couldnt haveanaged without it. All the information we needed all in one place.,
Love it with the new upgrades and very useful for keeping up with the activities and things on the ship!,
Disney Dream Cruise was perfect! The ship was so clean and friendly! Nisha from India at Guest Service desk made our trip fantastic! She helped to set up my App and WIFI on the ship. Ask for her help if you take this cruise!,
Great app when it works. Has a tendency to freeze and has a delay in receiving messages,
"Reminders for events always came late to rhe point that events were already over, chats were delayed, time changes weren't easily communicated or coordinated",
Best. Trip. Ever!!,
Works for a bit and then shuts off. Most messages aren't delivered nor received.,
"Awesome, but they need to make some adjustments on when you receive the messages, because there is a delay half of the time.",
Took the guesswork out of our experience,
Horrible app. Information is spotty and useful features are not included.,
"The app was helpful for keeping in touch while on the cruise, however responses and replies were delayed.",
Nice App that only works while aboard a Disney Cruise. It would be 5 Stars if it had features that worked before the cruise.,
i have installed and uninstalled several times. it doesnt work at all!! im cruising soon ans disappointed its not working correctly.,
Great app but I could not find out how to tip online. I would have liked to leave extra gratuities online as I did not carry cash with me,
worked extremely well but would like to see the ability to see your cruise schedule and activities before the day if the cruise so that you could plan your trio better,
Helpful while sailing. Information and or text can be delayed but better than not having any communication.,
On board wireless connections were unreliable at times so app performance was spotty.,
Loved the way you could look at daily activities and message people. Only critique would be it only worked on the ships Wi-Fi which cut out at times,
The chat is too laggy. The iterinary is useful but should be able to filter for interests.,
Why can't I view my reservation when I log in? Error message reads reservation can't be located. Try again or call for assistance?,
Excellent for on board info. Very slow for communication. Some messages would deliver a day late.,
It made navigating the activities on the ship very easy to navigate. I always knew what was going on each day!,
"A little laggy at times with delivering messages, especially if you don't have the app open at all times",
Doesn't always work properly when on the ship.,
the app was great. when we got on the cruise there was a chat available on the app that anyone in our room could use.,
Very detailed! and it's a must when you're on board!! Arrrrghhh!!!,
Sometimes impossible to use and no connection. Messages can take ages to successfully go through.,
Smooth sailing ... This app kept me informed.,
Great sey to stay in touch with your group on board. Messages didn't always send on time.,
Great app to use for keeping in touch with your family while cruising & all the different activities offered onboard!,
Disney has the best experience ever!!,
No access sometimes. Activities difficult to find.,
the app was great for information on the cruise and checking my account balance but horrible for communication with my family.,
Certain features of this app do not work the way they're suppose to which makes it frustrating when you really need those features.,
Great experience! Definitely beneficial to having an app with all the activities in the palm of your hand!,
Great app for keeping in touch with your other travelers and knowing what is going on everywhere on the boat.,
"All your reservation information, countdown clock, itinerary, all of it. Great app.",
"App is amazing, but would perform much better if the wifi on the ship worked the way it should.",
Easy to use app!! You can mark all your shows & activities you want to attend - it will notify you!!!,
Worked seamlessly. It was easy to communicate with family and friends. Easy to see itinerary.,
Loved this app so much! Everything you want to know about your trip is at your fingertips. Perfect!!!,
It's a great app to see what's happening around the ship. There is a delay with communicating with family and friends via the app.,
all and all a good app but the message system didnt work and you would only see messages if you opened the app...,
Disney Cruise Line App was so helpful on our first cruise. The reminders were very much appreciated! Hakuna Matata!!!,
"We went on our first Cruise, this last week on the Disney Dream. And our family loved it. The crew and staff were amazing. Food was fantastic, and loads of activities to do.",
"The app kept crashing when I needed it the most of the cruise. But other than that, it worked most of the time",
"Had a hard time loading properly...could not use it most of the time. When it worked, it was great!",
Decent app but could be better if there was a map of the cruise ship on it that helped direct you to events,
It worked great on the ship... especially for communication with others on the ship and planning our day out!,
The only problem I found was a delay in receipt of text messages and it would only vibrate when you got a message,
"To register some idiot decided that you need to scroll backwards from 2010 to your year of birth in months, in my case over 400 button presses. Why can't you just type it in. Imagine a 90 year old!",
This app worked half the time for me while on the Dream last June. We were forced to carry around the bulky phones.,
very helpful on ship. The only problem is that ship wifi boots you every hour or so and it wont autoconnect.,
Messaging system needs improvement. Didn't receive an alert for most messages I received.,
I love DCL and this app is so good that it actually makes me look forward to cruises even more. I love spamming my wife's messages with Avengers and Star Wars emojis,
"Nice app for onboard activities, menus, chatting, etc. Deck plans never appeared on their page though.",
It doesn't always deliver messages. You can't send pictures just text.,
Loved being able to text everyone in our party! It was great to be able to have my kids keep me updated on where they were.,
a bit buggy. crashes on me sometimes. also i cant find the photos easily.,
Able to text each other during cruise. And keep up with all activities choices each day.,
You have to sign in with your email and password every time you open the app. How stupid is that. Can you really not save my login information?,
"Takes a bit to get used to and know how to work it, but very helpful while in the ship with no Internet.",
It's helpful but confusing at first. We have to depend so much for every move:(,
Not able to leave tips. However everything else was made easier by having it on the app.,
"Needs wayfinding, and to be more interactive. Never could get texting to work.",
Found it helpful most of the time. Did not like that you could not see everything that you had signed up for.,
Not very user friendly. Would much rather have the itinerary printed. Missed many activities.,
Had some trouble while on the ship with the text messages even though we had the data plan.,
Won't load! Tried the suggested things and still doesn't work.. I sent an email last week and recieved no response,
A bit glitchy. Sometimes the conversations didn't load and I had to keep exiting the app.,
Very helpful and convenient. Better than carrying the paper navigator around.,
Messaging feature performance is poor. Sometimes messages show up 12 hours or more later,
Great way to keep track of things happening on board and sending messages to others in your travel party.,
it doesn't always update on a timely basis. it also crashes often.,
Keeps you updated on board. Very nice interface. A definate must have.,
Needs alert tones not just vibrations. Texts only come in when refreshed .. missed a lot of important things,
"Convenient, but wasn't reliable and kept disconnecting from wifi.",
Great information. Only negative was that text messages were often delayed.,
love it! worked great on the ship. having the daily navigator schedule on my phone was so handy!,
Great app! On board messages should have sound notifications to alert user if incoming messages.,
really helped with what's going on and where it is on the ship. Chats were helpful also.,
"Generally good, needs deck plans. Also it still reminds you of activities even if you unlike them after liking them.",
Great app to find detailed schedules as well as message (for free) while onboard.,
"Continues to fail, couldn't send messages at all and recieved messages hours late while on the ship.",
"Fantastic and easy to use, worked so well on the cruise and really enhanced our experience",
"Had some connection issues, but it was better than nothing. Did not work good on castaway cay.",
Great app. My husband and I could stay connected! The schedule of events was very helpful.,
The onboard text messaging with this app was slow BUT the inroom wave phones worked great for communication!!!,
Overall extremely useful and easy to navigate app for your Disney Cruise.,
On the boat the connection is very poor and ability to chat is poor. The agendas for the day worked very well.,
"Great tool! When it's not down our having issues, this app provides an abundance of information.",
Confusing navigation. Logging out to save data should be easier.,
great other than message recieval delayed and phone doesnt alert to new message despite notifications on.,
app is good. the messages going to everyone didnt always come through on time. some were hours later,
"It was helpful and cool to countdown,but once we got on the boat it would not let me do anything, and would not give me latest updats",
"A great help, a necessity really but alot of bugs with text messages.",
"the app worked well to view daily schedule, but was a complete fail for use as on board texting",
App never really was working on phone. Made it difficult to communicate with family and kids.was disappointed,
Not enough communication prior to know and understand how to use the app during the trip.,
"Great app. Only drawback, you need to be in texting to receive texts.",
The app was very helpful and easy to use. The messenger function kept us in contact with each other.,
I'd still like to see end cruise luggage readiness. I can't always hear announcements.,
"Easy to use, great informative tool in hand & easy to text the kids while on shore.",
"Fun, but not 5 stars because I had to restart quite a bit because it would freeze.",
Optimal! The app made it easy to plan all activities and manage our time efficiently.,
Awesome and very easy to navigate. Enjoyed being able to text onboard for free,
Lot of issues logging in for the first time. Not too easy to navigate at first.,
"it did not work. with 42 people , it make the task of getting together hard. it was like herding cats.",
Nice app but sometimes it disconnects from the wifi and you don't recieve onboard messages.,
Really easy to use! Loved the reminders and the map of each deck.,
Keeps crashing when I tap my cruise reservation after logging in. I'd give it a zero if i could.,
Constantly crashed and would send multiple notifications about events already passed.,
Easy to use. Perfect for planning a min by min itenirary. Great for messaging between people or groups + oceaneer club members.,
this really helped keep in touch with things on our ship! will continue to use it for all our Disney cruises!,
uses alot of wifi and only sends alerts if application is open-including having converstations with your roommates or fellow shipmates.,
The app needs an option for tutorial. The layout could be better.,
loved being able to use this app to text and keep up to date on events even without purchasing internet on the ship,
This is a great app to use to communicate and find out activities while on a Disney cruise!,
This was an excellent tool to keep up with the daily activities and chat sessions with the family (there were 11 of us going in different directions).,
Fantastic app. User friendly and a must have for your cruise.,
Easy to use and very helpful before and during your cruise,
Very helpful for managing activities and looking for things to do,
App worked great as long as the ships WiFi was stable.,
"This app was pretty good, it's useful to rizz up some women at times on the boat. Overall good app I guess",
It was excellent for chatting and navigating things around the ship,
"Ypu gay no notifications so you never know when someone texts you. Other than that, pretty good.",
This was amazing and so handy to get ahold of each other while aboard the DISNEY Dream! Thank you!,
The cruise ship wasn't prompt about updating the time schedule and adjusting for changes.,
The app would be more fantastic with a GPS type of map to show the current location of the ship.,
"Took some getting used to and had trouble finding some information, but overall was useful.",
Very useful with keeping information updates before cruise. Great app will keep for future cruise.,
messaging service is very slow! other than that it's a good app.,
So easy to see everything you need from the day you book your cruise till the day you get home. I love DCL and this app is a must.,
"The app only allowed for messaging between roommates, but not between our whole party.",
Couldn't get some of the information to load. Ended up using the on board planner instead.,
"Easy to down load app, but does not work when you are on the Disney Dream ship or Island.",
The app was easy to use...once on board the navigator was easy to read and keep up with,
This app was very helpful. My only suggestion would be to add an option to communicate with the kids club.,
Good app for getting info on what's happening on your Disney cruise. Decent chat functionality.,
Great app for scheduling and keep up with updates on your ship. Disney is #1 hands down.,
The app worked great. Very useful in keeping in touch with our party.,
Very helpful before and during the cruise! Used the messaging app frequently worh family.,
Easy to use. Nice feature to heart events and get reminders of them.,
App is clumsy. Won't stay on onboard. Hard to navigate. Chat is awkward.,
Was a short but very pleasant voyage will try to use the app more for our schedule next time.,
"Very helpful, loved the reminders for activities!! Nice way to communicate with other cruisers!!",
Solid for communication while on the boat. Works without having to purchase wifi.,
Super great idea but it is really dumb how it logs you out everytime it's very annoying.,
"Kept dropping off Wifi regularly, and text messages would get stuck on queue for hours.",
Incompatible with my smart phone. Disney should have made a simpler program.,
"Easy, kinda confused me on my first cruise when I was on the ship one of the crew members told me I didn't have to use Wi-Fi to make this app work.",
Very helpful when you are trying to keep up with all the fun activities and character greets,
Delayed messaging up to an hour. Doesn't stay connnected throughout the day.,
"we had an amazong first cruise, will be going again. love the app on my phone so easy to look at what is going on.",
Out was useful but very glitchy. It would freeze in the middle of something I was doing,
"I thought the app was really difficult to navigate, confusing and marginally helpful",
cant log in. I called Disney cruise log in phone and they said they knew it was acting up and there was nothing they could do,
Paper would have been easier and quicker app need wi-fi and not always available,
"freezes often. doesn't always connect, mwssages sometimes take hours to go through",
The app is not letting login its been 3 week since i was able to access my account thru app now online its doing the same thing,
"This app is very helpful in knowing what's going on around the ship, notifies you of activities you favorite and it has the deck plans to show you where the public spaces are",
weak signal. could never text each other like it claimed. updated info was late.,
The app was very great for communicating with other members if my party and help me with schedules.,
"It kept disconnecting me from DLC GUEST. I had to connect EVERY TIME I opemed the app, which wad teally irritatimg",
"great app, but performs poorly under stress, many times on the ship messages wouldn't load or send",
Fabulous and magical vacation! This app made communicating easy! Wonderfully thought out app!,
"Great help when preparing one's time with so, so much to do on such a wonderful holiday.",
it worked great for one of our seven in our party but the rest had continual issues with chatting and getting the schedule to load daily.,
"I have found this app very helpful prior to taking a DCL cruise and very helpful while at sea,! I highly recommend using this app.",
Did not stay connected & was hit or miss to work. Great when it was working.,
Hard to navigate at first. Older people are not as astute as younger ones used to apps,
app worked well only problem was the text feature did not seem to always work.,
Very helpful and great way to stay in contact with your party while onboard.,
Can't use for a trip because it thinks it's a day ahead and won't let me change the date to the correct one.,
Wifi not staying up made it hard send messages they would never go through so made it hard to find other family members just wish had worked a lot better when was our first Disney cruise,
"Awesome and easy, great to have and use with messaging on board to communicate with the kids and family and friends",
Navigation isn't good. Not all scheduled events show up. Needs use case UAT,
Loved this app. Easy to use and loved being able to communicate with the reat if our group,
It is a first class app. From talking to family to finding things to do on board with reminders,
"constant crashes, not stable enough. cant communicate directly with onboard teams",
When onboard would not stay connected. Texts wouldn't consistently go through.,
"This app was really cool. Its helpful and tells you dinner, activities, and many more!",
The great app ever,
The messaging portion (Which is what it is mostly used for) Is basically useless and barely works,
"i'm in Brazil, i have a reservation, but this app just set the clock for voyage, not else ! don't works",
Wonderful resources for information..map of ship could be helpful..shopping and ordering services would also be helpful,
A great tool for our day to day while on the ship! used it very frequently.,
"It's ok, the messaging feature is really nice when it was working.",
Exceptional everything but don't like using the navigator. like paper copy.,
"Alerts didn't pop for messages, itinerary of activities didn't match true activities scheduled.",

The app will not open. I turned off app and tried again and it still doesn't open,
It would not update once on board and my wife's phone did not connect at all.,

"Essential for a Disney Cruise. Very well executed, per usual for Disney.",
Awful. Much info missing. No automatic updates. No search.,
good to have on board. made remembering when and where events were happening very easy.,
I was able to do everything I wanted to do and more. Its great for planning meals and activities for people of all ages.,
great. except the wifi for the nav texting was slow and we didn't get messages sometimes,
I think it Needs to be updated more frequently to match the ships changes such as menus,
Good app for when the ship it tells you the layout and gives you a heads up for a upcoming event you bookmarked and you can message people the only con i can think of is that you have to be on the app to recieve a message,
First time connecting to the ships wifi was filled with DNS errors. Good otherwise,
The app notification was not very reliable with alerting for new messages.,
Not yet ready for the demands put on it. Go back to paper until the wifi and app works,
Great as always. Would like to see a way to reserve daycare hours on the ap for the ship.,
The app was not user friendly. My party stopped using it. This needs to be revamped.,
A must have for the cruise! Friendly reminders so you do not miss any of your favorites.,
Service is unavailable on castaway cay. Other than that it worked well.,
The app didn't work with my husband's and sister's phone until magically the day before we left.,

"love the messaging option to your crew party, wish there was a way you are able to communicate with guest service from app",
Make sure you download the app before you get on the ship. app worked great on the ship. easy to use.,
I work in IT and the last thing I want to do is stare at my phone while on Vacation. I am not happy about having to use the app for everything.,

The time on my phone didn't always sync up correctly with the app.,
App is good for knowing what each day's schedule is....but the OnShip Messenger was very unreliable,
It was taking hours to get messages and you had to keep restarting the app,
Worked if while on board. Couldn't use it to buy a placeholder. Kept losing my favorites.,

Used this nonstop on our cruise and was perfect for communication between the parents!!,

unstable on android. had to reconnect to wifi repeatedly throughout the day to get messages,
Service on the ship is spotty but still better than cell phone service alone.,

Overall a very good app although the chat feature notifications are unreliable.,
Getting out of chat window painful and the delivery of chats was extremely slow sometime up to 2hrs delayed.,

Disneyland's one of the best places to be and one of the best planes to fly on to get to wherever you want to go very comfortable and one of the favorite of mine.,
Fantastic vacation. The app kept me informed and help me navigate.,
"once we figured it out, it was very helpful. especially the chat function",

Great for texting on the ship and keeping up with all inboard activities,

Everytime i click on my reservation the app stops working and i have to close the app,

"EDIT: Two days after I wrote this review and before I had a chance to respond to the developer, I saw all the features in the app were working. I'm happy again! Thanks to whoever fixed it I've recently reinstalled this app due to my upcoming Disney cruise with my family, and I'm 100% disappointed and upset with the app. The app isn't working like it should be at all. The only thing I can look at is my reservation, and that's sometimes. I can't see the countdown to our sail date or anything else.",
Excellent,
Spotty,
Great,
Excellent!!!!,
On board texting could use some work. Only gives a very short vibrate so if you miss it you don't know you got a text.,
Poor connection,
Unforgettable experience,

Not impressed,
Works great,
Awful,
Incredible!,

"Love the App we can connected all the time during our sailing, check the activities and also everything under the app.",
Perfect experience,
"Just updated for my cruise - much worse. No Virtual Guest Services any more, can't manage activities and data is often incorrect anyway. Very poor update.",
Loved it!!,
Amazing,
Great,
"The Interface of this app is very poor. everything is organized in a single long list you have to scroll and scroll through, and there aren't any good ways to organize it. It's difficult to keep track of what is happening where and when. The save activity constantly drops activities I saved.",
"Very helpful to look forward through the trip activities and dinners. Messaging had issues, and had to re-download on ship before ship departure.",
Simply awesome,
Wonderful!!!,
Excellent experience...,
Would disconnect,
Ok,
Wonderful,
Needs ability to share favorited activities and add time changes to the notifications Update: does not save all favorites events,
Fantastic!,
Great,
"When a message comes in, I get no audible or vibratory indication until I open notifications in app. I don't stare at my phone while crusing. Phone is a Samsung S21+ . My wife's S9 has no indication either. Other functions are nice. (This has been an ongoing issue for more than 2 years)",
3/31/22 - Most recently used during our sailing on the Magic and app worked well.,
It's good,
Great resource,

Great app!,
Funomenal !,
"Ok, I think the recent upgrades sound great and can't wait to use them on the ship in 43 days when I sail, but for the love of all things Disney, please get something cuter for the new countdown clock! I miss seeing the cute suitcase and you've killed the joy I had every time I opened the app to see how many days I have left until we cruise! Don't care if you bring back the suitcase or come up with something new altogether, but please bring back the fun!",
"Edit: In 2020 the chat still never works - don't rely on this if you need to talk to someone in the same day. Lack of a grid makes it hard to see what's going on. Get a paper navigator from guest services. Chat never worked with either members of my stateroom or other we linked up with. Horrible activity filters (can only include, not exclude) and it never saves your settings. Please bring back the full paper navigators! This thing is a POS.",
"This is a useful, handy app with cruise info. After finally cruising with this app, it was a godsend. We've never liked the on board Wave Phone, so having a useful texting tool to keep in touch with our party was great. Also being able to set reminders about upcoming events on the Navigator was clutch. Especially after a day of snorkeling and drinking on shore! Update: after several years, it looks like the app keeps improving!",
Only thing is I wish the on board WiFi hadn't timed out so quick.,
Great l,
Amazing app,
Great,
Awesome,
Wonderful,
"The chat feature needs work! 10 minutes to receive messages, if they were even sent. I kept dropping from wifi. Really annoying if you're trying to coordinate with others in your party.",
"Fun to use, especially the dinner menus. Great App to use during the cruise being up to date of all daily events and shows",
Was good. Now not so much. Ever since the latest update the app logs you off completely and you have to re-enter your reservation info just to use it. Not sure about when you get on the ship but before you could use a countdown before your date. Not now. Now it's just bloat ware.,
"So much potential, so little realized.",
App was great for cruise Jan 2020,
Koko came first. 1924,

***Please fix the beginning of registering with your date of birth. Nobody wants to tap through every month of their life. Tip: chat feature works more timely if you leave the app open on your phone don't close it out. You can also now get notifications for activities you favorited when they are about to start. Latest update added ability to view itinerary and check availability and book activities once you have done online check in.,
Missing biometric API support. It's annoying to have to constantly enter my password instead of using face unlock.,
Good app!,

"2019: The app must be open continually to receive texts. It has been YEARS now. Hoping someday the chat feature will work like texts. 2017: I love the navigator online, and the dinner menus, but the chat feature is terrible. Serious delays, 9am text sent at 5pm! Not good when trying to keep track of the kids. It has been a few years now and we were really hoping to see some improvement as its the most important feature to us.",
"Samsung programming glitch, deckplans won't load. Chat function, itinerary and dailynplans very handy.",
Hard to figure out paid reservations - it showed mine a day late - I missed the reservation and I still had to pay.,
This was great....much improved since last trip.,

July 2019. This app has improved a lot. It didn't crash once and all my previous complaints have been addressed. It would be nice to be able to add people to your chat contacts by tapping instead of entering their chat number. It is great that you can also view your reservation and port adventures when not on board. This is much better than just the countdown.,
"When you can get to WiFi access on the ship, the app is very useful. However the ship definitely needs to boost its WiFi power onboard. Way too many dead spots on the vessel. Missed a lot of texts that hindered communication among our family on board the cruise.",
App fails to keep you logged in after updating. App keeps giving error message when re-entering password (know it is correct because it works when logging into DCL site on computer). Message times are the time you downloaded/looked at the message rather than the actual time they were sent.,
"The app was great for it's intended purpose, wish it had not crashed as much. 08/19 edit to my last comment, used the app for a full week and did not crash once. It was a pleasure to use.",
Loss of connection. Had to go into app to find I had messages.,
No need for wave phones anymore,
User friendly!,
Very handy!,

Simply AMAZING.,

"The texting feature was VERY flaky. This is supposed to be an option/substitute for the Wavephone on the ship... very unreliable EDIT: 1 year later, WAY better on functionality and reliability (3 up to 4 stars for this). We did not take the Wavephone with us this time. I would give the app 5 stars IF these functions were added: - downloadable daily Navigator (like the paper ones). Disney is moving away from the paper ones. - texting photos - audio, either as a phone or short audio recordings.",
"We used to be able to see the countdown without logging in, but now it's a hassle to have to log in repeatedly. The characters are fun, but the end of the countdown is anticlimactic compared to the fireworks from before. Notifications are spotty for some users. Filters are also a hassle to repeatedly apply. Overall the app is helpful, but navigation can be improved.",
Edited 2019: It still needs a place where you can see all activities laid out like the Navigator. But overall it is a really good app.,

"pretty good, needs some tweeking. instant messenging on board should be easier",
THIS app was a life saver!!!! It helped us so much and made the cruise so much easier!!!!!!! I don't know what my family would gave done without this app. The cruise was perfect because of this app!!! I love the Disney features too! So cute! Because of this app I am definitely going to plan and go on another Disney cruise very soon! Would totally recommend this app to everyone who is going on a cruise! My favorite part is that there are no ads! 5 star review for sure! BEST APP EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
very useful!,

"Updated - 3/19 - used the app during our cruise this week and the app worked PERFECTLY!!! EXCELLENT reference tool for ship's itinerary! However, the app crashed several times due to the chat feature. The chat feature also does NOT have any notifications for new messages, causing you to miss messages. Adding a sound or vibrating feature would help alot!! Over all, this app helped ALOT with keeping you aware of all the activities on the ship!!",
removing a star. the on board chat feature is extremely unreliable. messages will sometimes arrive hours after they are sent. it seems that they only show up immediately if you have the app open and running in the foreground.,
"we had 2 rooms linked and it was great to use on ship to communicate between the 6 of us. I just wish that the whole weeks itinerary was on it, not just the days.",
"I originally gave this app 3 stars because of issues I had with it on a previous cruise. I have upgraded it to 4 stars after my most recent cruise because I did not have the glitchy experience I had before.  What it is still lacking is accessing account information, shore excursions and ticketed events specific to the user.",
A bit buggy especially the chat feature. Update 4/20/19. This app now works very well. Even the chat! Happy cruising!,
first class!,

"Sort days correctly on long cruises. Days 10-14 list before days 2-9. Show the drink of the day with description every day, it was only listed a few times. Show the evening attire. TV channel guide / schedule on app including the TV movie start times. Include laundry locations on deck plans. Notification on incoming messages. Time stamp each individual message. Add Delete for individual messages. Show breakfast, brunch and lunch menus (helps in preorders for allergies",
"Much better than in the past, no longer hanging and crashing. Still occasional problems with chats arriving hours later with time received instead of time sent. Addition of dining menus a plus. The activities guide is useful but really needs a more general keyword search that works across days instead of a day at a time. It would be better if you could also check availability and sign up for activities directly in the app. An option to chat with services staff directly would be nice.",
"Updat3: Still very nice and useful but I REALLY wish you could see future day events given a particular location. For example, if I select Buena Vista Theater, I could view not only the current day movies but the schedule for upcoming days. Very well done app, simple but very efficient and clean. Works well for providing details about the cruise and ship, good use of notifications, and nicely designed navigation.",
"Texting feature is great ... when it works. The texting feature is the reason for 2 stars. Everything else was great. Unfortunately, the texting feature failed constantly. We had 11 in our party (7 with phones) and it would fail across devices (Android and iPhone) at, seemingly, random times and proved to be the most frustrating part of our trip. When you have a large party changing plans frequently, it's nice to know where to meet up.",
It would be nice to be able to put my birthday year in without having to scroll through ever month. The design on my Galaxy s8 is horrible since the update. It takes 30 mins to get my birthday in... Once I do it crashes on a loop. Useless since the update.,
App has been improved from the previous year I used it. Loved that I could see my running tally of spending. Also liked that I could see the dining menu ahead of time.,
"The app had a great design to it, but I had serous problems with the wifi dropping or saying I needed to pick a wifi internet package 90% of the time. It got to the point that I just turned my phone off. My wife has an iPhone & that worked fine.",
"I love disney fantasy this app is great to talk to people in your state room, UPDATE: Well, today I got of Disney Dream it worked well of course we knew our way around but for departure times to here Mickey Horns",
Love the chat feature! Love the Navigator but it would be great if they could add a calendar feature to add your own events (Palo or Bibbidi Bobbidi reservations). Also constantly disconnected from the wifi. UPDATE... much improved from last update!,
"Indispensable onboard tool. We regularly tracked events, planned meals, and communicated with our group directly all seamlessly. Incredibly useful and helpful tool.",
"Good app for keeping informed on what's happening around the ship. Could be better with the communication aspect. You have to keep the app open and check it often to get texts from others, and even then they usually come through long after they were sent.",
"So far so good. I don't board until March , 2015 so only able to set up count-down timer. I'll update when I embark. It would be more convenient if the screen would rotate to the horizontal and not just be vertical. very,very slow or never connects DVC, or WDW PAGES",
Really liked that you can now check your account balance on the app. The chat feature needs a lot of work though.,
"This greatly enhanced our trip. The ease of seeing everything in one place, texting our friends, and seeing when our kids entered and left kids area.",
Disney Cruise line navigator is the absolute life saver on the cruise it's an amazing way to communicate with other cruisers on board and navigate your plans throughout the duration of your cruise,
easy to use. very useful to navigate with on the ship and great way to communicate and keep tract of fellow travelers,
The app doesn't work. It was updated from the last cruise but the update is in fact worse!!!!,
"The cruise was great, i met a lot of friends that i am going to continue to talk to and the app helped me to communicate with them",
This helped us make the most of our time. Was able to plan daily events for everyone!,
They are a great update to it. Awesome to nav the ship and not miss a show,
it is very useful tool while staying on the cruise ship. Disney is the best,
This app kept us informed about all the events we were interested in during our cruise. Terrific app!,
Wonderful way to stay up to the minute with activities,
this app was so helpful to know all the activities happening on the boat!,
Great way to stay up to date with the boat activities!,
Amazing app to stay connected while you're aboard,
very well organized and easy to understand,
Had a wonderful time on the disney dream,
Loved the usefulness and the countdown clock.,

"The messaging feature was often delayed be 15 to 30 min. The app is not laid out intuitively, so you have to play with it a lot to discover everything. It took a week to discover everything out in it and by then your cruise is over. I didnt want to spend my cruise trying to figure out all that an app has to offer. Disney can improve a lot on this app on its reliability and complicated interface.",
"We used this for the first couple of days of the cruise and got frustrated as it only works when the app is open and running. I missed loads of messages as the app would keep closing or my phone would lock. For the last couple of days, we used the paper personal navigator provided and the wave phones... so much better and actually works (unlike the app)",
I had no problems - messages were instantaneous so long as wifi was available (free for this app on the ship but wifi not available in really remote locations) and notifications were received 15 mins prior to favorited events starting. Lots of handy features like map of the ship and onboard account to keep track of your spending.,
"The schedule and ship map are nice to have, but it doesn't alert you about your upcoming scheduled activities until after they have begun. The text messaging system is good, but none of the messages reach their recepients until 1+ hours after they are sent. This makes the feature basically useless.",
"App was helpful but wish there were more details especially when you link your reservations to the app.. Beware when you use the app on the ship it tells you that you are not connected to the DCL Wi-fi, there is No need to connect and you will still receive updates. If you log on as it tells you, you will be charged wi-fi fees... Messaging only works if everyone downloads the app.",
"Very well done and indispensable tool for your voyage. The only complaint would be that chats are highly sporadic...sometimes they're sent and received instantly, but most of the time they never arrive or arrive hours later. This likely has to do with their background service implementation (if you open the app then the messages tend to arrive, but this isn't a very realistic way of using a messaging app. The result is a mostly unreliable tool for onboard communications. It would be outstanding if you could share images with your party, but that would presumably overload the shipboard WiFi network.",
The app kept crashing. Once off ship it's useless. I expected it to work on Castaway Cay. But it didn't. Otherwise it was a great way to know what was going on.,
"The app is great for checking out the schedule of the days you are cruising, but the chat function needs to be fixed. Our messages would come through hours after we sent them which obviously isn't helpful.",
Great to stay abreast to all the activities happening on the ship. I did a load of laundry and it even notified me when the washer & dryer stopped LOL. Very cool & helpful.,
It was helpful to keep the intinerary with us and to be able to chat to our group in the ship. It has some delays on the chat but other than that was great tool!,
"On board text messages wouldn't come through unless you restarted the app. Then the messages would come through with the time received instead of the time sent. Pretty useless. Also, many of the event times were wrong.",
Messages were to slow and many would not send at all. Husband gave up and we used the State room phones in the end. Alerts did work but not enough notice if you forgot you planned them. On a brighter note you could easily see the plans on events for the day.,
I tried to use the app and set up my Login information but it would never accept it. We checked with the help desk on ship but even after that it still didn't work. Was very disappointed with this app.,
"Great app. It was very helpful with know what was going on, when, where, and even for hour long. Also helped with letting me know when to pick up my child from the kids club.",
Great intentions but reliability along with WIFI was unstable. When it worked it was great but there are still kinks to be worked out. My phone would freeze up and my connection kept dropping.,
"Overall it was a great app but from time to time I didn't get texts from 
our party for 20 mins or 1 hour later.",
"Loved the app on my Magic cruise 2017 but on our Fantasy 2018 cruise it was 
very unreliable, buggy and slow to download messgs.",
Did the job on the cruise. Communicated with my party (delayed sometimes). Helpful in setting itinerary. Will use again.,
Such fun on the ship to communicate and find out what's on. Sometimes it isn't always accurate and sometimes the notifications don't work but generally very good!,
"App was great when it worked properly. My time was off some of the days and 
some of our group never got the messages sent. So it worked sometimes and 
didn't other times.",
"I'd like to see this app work more like the one that Disney parks uses. 
Coming from a vacation T Disneyworld and using the My Disney Experience app 
to this one...I feel like it's a step backwards and leaves a lot to be 
desired.",
"Unable to get the app clock to work. Have installed and uninstalled and 
still won't work",
The messaging was awful. I had to keep closing the app to get notifications of new messages. Seems to work better on iOS.,
"If they could fix the message delivery delays, it would be 5 stars",
App worked well on our 7-night Western. The only thing I would like to see is a search feature so I can look for specific events without scrolling through everything.,
"The app serves to keep you informed about the activities on the cruise , but it is terrible to communicate among the users, the app must be open in order to receive messages, you have to reconnect all the time , because it loose the connection.",
Very helpful for on board ship information . It could use some improvements in the text message dept. Overall good app .,
Perfect for navigating your time during the cruise and messaging with family members if you split up,
"This app was so beneficial!!! We were in 2 different staterooms and we 
could spread around the ship and still be in touch!! It was great to keep 
in contact with other ship mates!!....especially if you don't want to pay 
for internet.",
Loved using this on our cruise. Found out current activities and contacted other people in our group! Very helpful!,
"Messages between guests was not always available unless you were on the app 
and notifications never came through",
Great way to communicate while on cruise. My only wish was that the chat feature have notification within.,
I think it was great except the messaging feature yes it's free but it had to be opened to get the messages or if it did notify you it never seemed to be on time they should stick to the way finders phones so helpful,
This app is so helpful and so easy to use. I highly recommend this app to anyone who goes on a disney cruise.,
Good for letting you know what entertainment is happening but inconsistent for communication.,
Great for quick info and notifications while on the cruise. Shows account balance too.,
"Great app reminder for daily activities, dinner menu very useful",
"Loved the Emojis in the chat. And the chat helped me stay in contact with 
everyone on board",
So helpful on the Ship!! Will use It again,
It was very easy to use and all the info we needed was in one spot for easy access.,
"Great for communicating while on board. Wish it would hold the filters 
placed.",
Awesome experience! Disney raises the bar for sea cruises.,
really good for texting your families when needed and works great,
"Fix the group chat and fix the technical bugs the app has and it would be 
perfect",
Is good communication and update activities app when you inside the cruise,
Very useful when I am on a cruise this is basically my guide.,
Excellent app. It helped us keep track of events,
Very helpful while on board and easy to use!!,
Was a very helpful app on the cruise ship!,
Very helpful to see the cruise schedule of events,
Very helpful with a map of the ship and ease of use!,
Its very useful when you are in a rush,
It was very easy to use.,
Very helpful onboard the ship!,
"Just perfect for a Disney ""park"" (cruise line)",
Very detailed app.,
Awesome app!!!!,
Really helpful app when on the cruise,
Great tool and very helpful,
Information on all the activities for the day,
It was very helpful and useful,
Great app.,

"Headed in the right direction. Had trouble receiving on board chats from 
other members in my party unless the app happened to be open. It didn't 
seem to work well in the background. Also it would be cool if you could 
integrate the ships course etc. On a map. It would be neat to know where 
you're at",
"App is good when it comes to seeing what you can do on the ship but the 
messaging leaves A LOT TO BE DESIRED. You have to have the app up and 
running for a message to come through as a notification, unlike any other 
messaging app out there. Otherwise you wont get the message until you 
reopen the app. Hopefully Disney can fix this soon.",
"Was great to be able to keep up to date with activities and chat with 
others in the cruise. Only issue I had with the app was that the chat 
notifications only came through when the app was open. I made sure my 
settings allowed for background data and my phone wasn't shutting down 
background activities as well. Other complaint would be with the access 
point switches on the boat and phone losing connection so we found we 
needed to stay on one place to avoid jumping APs when trying to find 
someone or we couldn't send/receive messages.",
"Wi-Fi on ship is horrendous and makes the chat feature impossible to 
function around the ship. Will work if person is standing right next to 
you. Your itinerary does show up (which is good) and especially how much 
your charging to the room (but of course)!",
"If using the app to find your way around the ship, view your itinerary or 
any information that does NOT need frequently updated then it's wonderful! 
However, if you're using it to stay in touch with other guests on the ship 
then find another way. I would constantly lose connection and receive all 
messages at once, missing the entire conversation and some events. I never 
knew if the oceaneers club need to reach me or not which was frustrating.",
"app constantly crashes, doesn't stay connected, misses messages, notifies 
you late for appointments, and is generally useless and unreliable. The 
times listed for events didn't sync up with the actual activities, and the 
crew couldn't have cared less about the lack of quality or discrepancies. 
Since they also use cell jammers on board you get stuck without any useful 
information. Whatever you do, Don't rely on it to be your source of 
information for anything you are trying to do, schedules you have to keep, 
or add a way to keep in touch, even if they don't give you any other 
choices. Also don't expect the crew to care that the breakfast or lunch 
time are listed on the app as open but they decide that they wanted to 
close a restaurant early and there are no good choices available.",
"Navigator itinerary was great for character times and menus for every day 
in advance. Texting was often not delivered or delayed, experienced errors 
in sending, contunually dropped DCL GUEST network, and no way to customize 
notification options leading to being unaware that someone had tried to 
contact you.",
"When this app first came out it was awesome! Being able to message family 
on-board and to find out what is happening on the ship. But they CHANGED 
it. It is more difficult to find out what is happening and the messaging 
portion worked about 5% of the time. Yes I went to the on-board help desk 
but they fixed it for about 10 minutes and messaging stopped again. I ended 
up using the wave phone and the paper navigator. Make this app great again.",
"The app itself was pretty good; it was a little slow, but overall ok. All 
the information was extremely helpful and otherwise essential. The texting 
portion of the app, however, was absolutely terrible. Me and my entire 
family hated it, and it was extremely slow and didn't deliver messages. 
Otherwise, this was very nice to have for our cruise on the Disney Fantasy.",
"It is helpful because there is a map of the ship by floor so that helps. 
The activities are listed and if you check the ones you want to attend, you 
will be sent a reminder. My only complaint is the texting was not always 
reliable. Messages weren't always sent in a timely manner.",
"Used it quite a bit on our Cruise. Wish the messaging was more reliable. I 
burned through my free WiFi pretty quickly and it was pretty unreliable 
after that",
"Excellent little addition to a wonderful trip. Made planning our day much 
easier and helped us remember the times for events. I highly recommend it.",
"Great for schedule of daily activities. Useful for onboard communication 
with family. Would have rated higher if it actually notified you in timely 
manner of new messages.",
"Pretty neat and keeps track of all daily activities; very helpful. Not sure 
if it's the app or placement of phone on the boat, but some of the messages 
sent took a long time to receive.",
"App is buggy. Often freezes or hangs on my device. Chat messages are often 
delayed. Many times messages don't come unless I restart the app.",
"The app was great on the ship but this countdown, I agree is quite boring. 
The previous countdown had much more Disney magic. Please bring it back.",
"This app was great to use. It allowed our family to stay in touch while 
everyone was out doing their own thing. Kept us informed of all activities 
on the ship.",
"A great App if you're a Disney Cruise Line. If only the countdown could be 
configured with your port arrival time or departure time.",
"App has problems. Will crash for apparently no reason. Had to purge 
everything more than once during cruise. Very useful though.",
"Crashed lots. Could have been so much more valuable. Chat was horrible and 
things would show up hours after they were sent. Not up to Disney standards.",
"The app uses the ship's wifi to connect to other users. Text messaging 
capability lagged anywhere from 30-60 min. Frequently froze as well. The 
app is only good for looking at daily activities and itinerary.",
"Crashes often on note 8. Filtering multiple categories at once makes it 
stall or crash. Overall good.",
"Great for ship floor plans and tracking daily activities. Initial setup is 
confusing as it seems you have to pay for access, you don't. Also the text 
feature is nice but didn't seem to be reliable, messages didn't always go 
through especially if the other person wasn't active in the app at the time.",
"It was good to find out what was going on, but the texting service was 
unreliable and didn't always send, so it was hard to contact my parents 
throughout the cruise. Otherwise, very useful.",
"My husband downloaded app before boarding but when on ship sail date was 
wrong. Guest services couldn't fix it so he couldn't use it. My app worked 
ok but sometines had to close to get messages. Otherwise loved it.",
"Good app to keep track of what's going on around the ship. The chat 
function can be streamlined and less glitchy.",
"The App made it possible for the 10 of our Family Members to keep tract of 
each other and make and/or change activities. It also provided the exciting 
Cruise Countdown table. Thanks for providing the App.",
"If you're going on a Disney cruise, you should download this app without a 
doubt. It is exceedingly useful for getting around the boat, finding 
activities, and communicating with your party.",
"Great app. Thanks Disney for creating a app for our whole party to 
communicate with everyone. It's great for keeping us informed with all the 
activities. Very easy to use. This is a must have app while on the cruise",
"It takes some getting used to, but I like that I can now see all the things 
i have booked and when.",
"It was useful & convenient on the cruise. We marked our favorite shows and 
activities and then the app reminded us when and where to go. The chat 
function is also useful to communicate with others if you don't purchase a 
wifi plan.",
"Good but glitched a lot. Could be a lot better. But it was super helpful 
cause it was my only form of communication",
"I haven't used it on the ship yet. Wish that I could download and use it on 
my Kindle Fire.",
"Very handy. Good for p2p communications on board. Needs a couple things: 
grid view, times for meals easily seen, a where- am-I function (for super 
fancy, a VR overlay) a ship-board ""gps"", ability to sign up and authorize 
payment for onboard activities, and location - specific activities (where 
am I and what is going on at this location? ).",
"We loved the app but for whatever reason, no one could get chat 
notifications unless the app was already opened.",
"Works well. Would be useful to have a grid and a list of location/hours for 
like on the paper Navigator, and an alert when you've selected activities 
that overlap.",
"It is helpful for the cruise so defintly get it but the messages dont work 
on every part of the ship which can become frustrating. Otherwise it was 
overall very helpful!",
"WiFi kept logging off and I missed messages. Loved seeing the activities 
from my phone. Made planning poolside a breeze!",
"Excellent. Made the cruise so easy. Would be even better if you could see 
your location on the map.",
"Great for schedule and activities. Crashes quite a bit. Could benefit from 
improvents on the messaging feature",
"The app and website were very weak. While on the boat we could use it as a 
guide to activities. Overall could be improved, especially the website 
prior to the Cruise. The actual Disney Cruise was fabulous!",
"Fails to update/transmit (or notify about) messages quickly, sucks battery 
quickly, had to constantly close/log out and re-open to receive, read, and 
write messages.",
"I think that it was very easy to use and helped you navigate around the 
ship and it helps keep you up to date with the programs going on.",
Great App. Only issue is the messenger is slow to send and recieve messages,
"It doesn't work. When you get to the port, there's signs to download the 
app, and then you can't pick the same day you're sailing.",
Constantly crashes and the messenger feature doesn't always work.,
"All I can say is WOW! We've sailed Disney Cruise Line for many years, and 
the upgrades to their application are so incredible. The ship's plans for 
finding your way around, the dining times and restaurant/quick service 
locations and times, show times/character times and locations... great job, 
DCL! You should be proud! Now, about the Wi-Fi connection on the ship...",
"Wonderful app. It kept me informed of everything that was happening on the 
ship!",
Good app at times but it kinda crashed at sea alot,
"I was able to stay in touch with the family and know what was the days 
events on the ship.",
"Great way to stay informed about activities and chat with other family 
members.",
"The app was extremely useful in keeping onboard activities and meals 
organized!",
Very useful way to navigate around in a Disney Cruise and talk to my party.,
I liked how I could see the different activities going on around the ship.,
Mush have for Disney cruise!,
Messages took a long time to be delivered,
Confusing to get on line and use with wifi,
"Crashes a lot, needs more work, but good idea",
Loved it. Gives great details and up to date information.,
"Was very helpful to know what activities were happening where and when on 
the ship!",
Great way to stay connected while on a Disney cruise...,
It was great while on board to keep track of things.,
I liked it but sometimes it would glitch,
This app was amazing. I loved it,
Absolutely loved the ease of using this app!!,
When it worked it was great. Constantly had to be reset,
Great to communicate with family on board.,
This is a great app.,
"This app was really covenant to talk to my party and see what is happening 
around the ship... i just wish you could send pictures",
Kept us informed at sea,
I always injoy the trip,
I love Disney Cruise,
It's amazing,
Good App onboard,
Very useful app,
Chat is a great addition,
It Disney come on now,
Helped a lot on our cruise,
It awsome,
Helpful,
Wonderful,
I like it,
Love the app for on the ship but the new update SUCKS. The count down is so bland and Un-Disney. Where is the magic? We spends tons on a cruise to get a disney experience a d we start it off with a plain blue screened count down? Bring back the suitcase or heck make it more magical!,
"Updated June 24 to a better countdown!! Thank you Disney for fixing the 
bland one. 😉",
"The app did not stay connected so we had to keep opening and checking for 
messages from kids club. That was a bit of a pain! Update in June 2018 :now 
my app wont even open!!",
"Nice app to communicate with your party, check menus for dinner ahead of 
time, and know everything happening on the ship!",
The updated countdown is AWESOME! Love this app. 💓,
Does not send notifications unless the app is open.,
"My cruise is next year(2019) and I can not set the date. I have tried to do 
this many times.",
"Great app. Have all the info we needed on board the ship. Events, 
activities, restaurant menus, hours of operation for everything. Chat 
feature was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. I wish it had an actual 
notification cinge instead of just a vibrate. We missed each other's 
messages quite often",
"App has been updated since we last used Jan 2017. Very helpful to have 
working texting feature to communicate with kids on the ship. Only froze a 
couple times for a few minutes but restarted with no problem. Info was 
accurate and updated when our itinerary changed due to weather. Absolutely 
would recommend for cruising with Disney!",
"It was our very first cruise and I think that we may just have found our 
new way of vacationing from now on. Disney has gone above and beyond to 
make sure that you're experience will be one that you'll never forget. 
Thank you for everything Disney. This app will keep you informed of what 
event's are going on throughout the day and it's broken down into different 
categories to make it easier for the user. Great app for first time 
cruisers like me.",
"Very limited ""dumb"" app. It is just a canned listing of events. I could 
have written this app in a few hours. It doesn't havr any info specific to 
you. No dining schedule. No excursions. I didn't even know it had chat 
capability until day 4 when it randomly asked for my name and date of birth 
(with a very bad date entry user interface).",
"Immature software (buggy and unstable)-nice idea, weak execution. Messaging 
app was so unreliable as to be useless -- we actually did a deck-by-deck 
search for a kid before messages arrived. In stark contrast to the rest of 
the Disney entertainment machine, the app added nothing to our cruise. We 
found paper trifolds faster and more actionable.",
"Nearly useless. Constant connect, disconnect, lockup, log in log out, 
messages received hours later after sending, etc. Of the seven day cruise, 
it was consistent for a total of one day. Had to force stop it several 
times, restart my phone, manually go back and choose wifi due to system 
being disabled even though wifi was working... this app is a mess and was 
the only negative on an otherwise perfect cruise.",
"Very disappointed with the app. It was difficult to find the information we 
wanted. Some members of our family couldn't figure out how to use the 
message function, which made it pretty much useless. It re-set itself on 
day 4 of a 7 day cruise, so I couldn't even use it for the last 3 days of 
the cruise.",
"Had lots of problems in sending/ receiving chat messages. Went to the IT 
staff on board and all she told me was to close out and go back in several 
times until it works. It was very inconsistent and was not reliable with 
the messages to and from. The IT staff blamed it on my phone, which is a 
Samsung Galaxy S8+, coz she said it's an android. I didn't have any 
problems 2 years ago on the older version and I had an android back then as 
well.",
"Seriously helpful app for the entire cruise trip. It lets you know exactly 
whats going on around the ship and the locations of everything. Send you 
notifications when you have events coming up. You can communicate through 
sms texting to others in your party. And best of all, it's FREE to use on 
the boat with no Wi-Fi purchase.",
"Chat feature is useful but connectivity was not consistent (connection loss 
may be more about ship wifi, but is part of Disney's navigator system and 
the app experience). Deck plans did not work at all for me. Schedule was 
helpful but often rewound to the beginning of a day you were looking at. 
App crashed several times a day for me as well, though notifications seemed 
to work. (Disney Magic, June 2018)",
"The app was amazing for finding things to do around the boat. For all the 
people saying the msg didn't work. Thats cause you need to buy the wifi 
data plan on board. Also for any msgs that the boat needed to give you was 
sent to your wireless in cabin phone that would be carried around the boat 
amd cast away key.",
"A for effort, C for actual product. It sometimes took an hour or more for a 
text to go through, which made it less than ideal for locating other people 
in your party. It also reset completely on me in the middle of the trip and 
told me my cruise hadn't started yet",
"App has good UX and content is very applicable. It's designed to only work 
on DCL network. Unfortunately, the app does do so well on a spotty network. 
The chat is always delayed and sometimes missed due to how it.handles bad 
connection. Also it's missing a sign out button, we accidentally linked 2 
devices to single guest and one device just stopped receiving 
notifications. Given that we were on cruise, we couldn't download and 
reinstall. Luckily for android you can clear all data and cache for any 
app. Some improvements to network and app handling of connections.would 
make.this a must have.",
"Unfortunately, the messenging did not work more than a few hours on two 
days of a seven day cruise. It's the only way to get updates regarding 
child care, laundry facilities and schedule maintenance. Provides map, 
events and other happenings. Fantastic, if only worked.",
"Very helpful for communicating with our large group and for knowing what's 
going on around the ship. However, it was very buggy and kept crashing for 
many of us.",
"It was great for information. It would have been awesome to be able to make 
reservations for Palo or for activation while onboard. Prices of the 
alcohol activities would have been helpful too.",
"App kept crashing consistently. Chat feature had a significant delay for 
message delivery. Should add a feature to view official cruise photos and 
purchase from app.",
"It didnt list all activities. the dining room info could be better if it 
guided us to all the locations. Should show changes and when places like 
the cabana closed early without notice.",
"This app worked great and kept us informed about all the activities going 
on during our cruise. We also liked the family chat feature.",
"Very helpful app. The texting was offline several times during the cruise. 
Only downside is u have to have the app open to get text messages alerts.",
"Very useful. No need to carry paper around. Like that you can mark what you 
want to do and app notifies you 15 minutes prior to activity",
"I wasn't happy with the app because I didn't get messages until the next 
day, and when you have a 13 and 17 year old you really need to be able to 
get in touch with them at any time",
"Loved having schedule close by & ability to text. Just wish we could have 
called and shared photos with one another thru the app.",
"Great app for use on the cruise. Little slow getting some messages between 
people, most were sent timely though. Wish you could share pictures in the 
app. Would be nice when taking pics of the kids and their new friends.",
"This app is really on point. The only bad thing is it doesn't show your 
onboard spending account. Which would be very helpful.",
"Was very useful for finding out which activities we're going on and to find 
shows and food. Was not useful for texting our travel companions.",
"The chat portion was hard to use if the person was offline. The wave phones 
work better for direct communication",
"It was great to navigate around the ship and see when and where events 
were. The messenger part lost signal for me in some parts of the ship, but 
overall this is a great app!",
"The app works great as a personal navigator and planner, but onboard 
communications were buggy and often didn't work well between android and 
iOS devices.",
"My biggest problem with this app is that it cannot sync messages in the 
background; the app must be running. Also would have been nice to have a 
weather outlook feature. Maybe even make VoIP calls with it using the same 
protocols as the wave phones.",
"Really good. Except i dont get notifications for messages til i enter the 
app and it keeps on freezing. I suggest you add notifications and microwave 
it.=)",
"Some good, some bad.... Took too long for text messages messages to go 
through at times. On Android with no purchased wifi package, often had to 
keep closing and reopening app to receive messages. That was disappointing 
because it could be very useful for getting in touch with cruisers who have 
children in the Oceaneer lab instead of carrying around a wave phone, but 
it was too unreliable for that. Great for checking on activities for the 
day and our dining information was automatically included on it! Bravo on 
that personalization!",
"Good for daily activities, good for updates. Difficult finding more 
personal information like data usage, account summary etc.",
"Very helpful way to keep up with the onboard activities but the messaging 
feature did not always work which we needed to keep up with our family of 
14. I wish it had more thorough descriptions of my excursions on my 
itinerary.",
"This was so helpful on our cruise. Loved the ability to message others in 
our party about where to meet and what we were doing. Map of ship didn't 
work on my android phone. Disney said they were working on that.",
"Loved this app while on our cruise! It reminded me of the start time of 
things we wanted to do, dinner, and excursion meetings. The chat feature 
was sometimes slow, but I feel that was the WiFi not the app.",
"Works great onboard, the entire cruise schedule is on this app, from 
dinners to shows, location of events, event times, you can even text 
message with everyone in your group. This is a must have app for your cruise",
"It's a great idea! Very helpful on the ship. It's a little slow and clunky. 
Chat feature great idea, not always reliable. Would like if it would show 
ticketed events, excursions, and spa appointments, since it is linked to my 
reservation. One other thing that would be nice would be to include the 
dinner menus and seating time.",
"Its fine if youre just trying to get info about ship activities. As far as 
messaging goes, need some work. Have to have app open or something.",
"Great app for communication on board the ship. I loved the emoji selection 
that I was able to use within the app. Having the schedule with reminder 
was also very very helpful. This is a must have app for all Disney cruisers",
This app would not keep the connection and would only sent messages sometimes. The IT person on the ship said droids were sometimes a problem.  Could not communicate with my family at all.,
"The on ship texting to find members of your party was Sooo slow. It was 
easier to walk around and try to find them.",
"It's a cool app to look up event times on the cruise. It's not so great for 
messaging family and friends on the messaging function while on the ship. 
Messages are always late.",
"Great for schedule of events, but they really need to fix the messenger, 
unless you have it open on your screen, you want receive your messages",
"The app does not seem to be compatible with the latest Android OS and is 
not starting. Quite disappointing for a entertainment giant like Disney. 
Northern wayi imagined the cruise to start.",
"Would be nice if you could get notifications from others in the onboard 
chat with an actual tone instead of just vibrating. Sucks finding messages 
sent hours previously because didn't know they were sent",
"This was very useful, but sometimes it wouldn't alert you. It came in handy 
at times, but I only ever used it for the texting feature.",
"While on the ship, text messages within the app did not always come thru in 
a timely manner. Very unreliable! Left family members waiting for info.",
"Great information about events, but disconnected from Wi-Fi too much and 
hard to maintain communication with party members.",
"Searching feature needs to be better(search by name or room number) instead 
of by just chat ID and other person has to accept before chat begins and I 
think there should be forum boards for people to post on to set meet ups 
outside from what the cruise has to offer. Outside of that is was great for 
navigating staying in touch with scheduled events and people in my group.",
"This app is very useful while on the ship. You are able to favorite events 
you're interested in as well as check the menus for dinner each night. You 
can also keep in contact with members of your group through the messenger 
portion of the app.",
"Good for keeping track of the daily events, but I wasn't able to see future 
days and I had to register just to see the schedule.",
"The personalized info was nice but we had MASSIVE problems with chat 
connectivity. The daily event info isn't very intuitive either. Just got 
back from 8th cruise, first with new app",
"Messaging lags terribly at times . The app also locked up several times 
during our cruise .",
"It was a good app to use on the ship. I just finished a vacation on the 
Disney Dream and it was handy to have. The texting part was very helpful. 
It was pretty easy to use and understand. Recommend it. 👍",
"Needs a time and date stamp on each message sent. Otherwise it's helpful to 
communicate with your family and other shipboard friends.",
"Chat need to be updated didnt stay online and got messages late. But the 
app was great keeping us up to date with all the events and character meets 
and greets.",
"App worked great for keeping up on things happening. Thought the texting 
with other shipmates was slow. Sometimes we didnt get messages until hours 
later.",
"I had a harder time figuring out what was going to happen and when, and 
audible alerts to incoming messages would help with, a lot",
"The app needs refining and the network is blotchy at best on thw ship. 
Makong the app work have the time.",
"Need to be able to get messages whenever the app is not on! This is the 
only problem I had.",
"Didn't work half the time. When coordinating multiple families with lots of 
kids or was a pain not having. Need to fix asap!",
"It was ok, clunky, could be so much better!!! If ship separated 
communications and offered free on board secure wi-fi for communications. 
Map was helpful. Schedule helpful. That's it. Felt that purchasing wi-fi 
was a scam. ! Absolutely no benefit and a money pit. Do not pay for it! Not 
worth it!",
"Love the app, great for planning! messaging was delayed a lot though. Still 
rating 5 stars.",
"Disney is much better than their app. It would be way to easy to add a few 
items to it using data they already have such as tracking the kids via the 
app.",
"Great way to keep in touch/message everyone in our group. Lots of good info 
for daily schedules - show times, class times for arts & crafts, character 
appearances, menus & schedules for all the onboard dining options. Great 
app. Highly recommend it for anyone going on a Disney cruise. 🚢",
"The use of communication was AWFUL! We were unable to communicate with 
family members. Messages would come in hours later or not send. Time was 
wasted because of this MAJOR glitch!",
"Nice and quick update at cruise. Difficult to do text for communication 
better use their phone.",
"This app was very helpful, I was able to keep track of scheduled events. 
Disney thought of everything.... Thanks",
It's an OK app but the Wi-Fi on board was sketchy at best.,
"Countdown used to work, now it's always wrong because today's date is wrong 
in the app!",
"Liked the prevous edition much better. All the stuff appeared to be there, 
but, sometimes hard to find.",
"This app is very useful during the cruise, you'll find everything that is 
to be with the cruise activities and places, very handy.",
Wish u could find a way to make calls to other guest on the ship,
"Couldn't connect to ships wifi. Entered all info it asked & nothing. Very 
disappointed!!",
"Great overall, just would have loved a better search function and a map of 
Castaway Cay.",
"Helpful for those of us that can't live with phones. Talking to family and 
others was great. Meeting new people stress free.",
"It was very handy on the ship to text. But it doesn't send all text 
notifications if the AP is not actively on.",
"It was a great way to communicate with kids and friends on the ship, to 
keep track of your plans, and other events going on. It would also send you 
reminders of your events that you had planned. It was wonderful!!! Our 
recent Disney cruise was by far the best compared to other cruises. They go 
above and beyond with amazing service. Loved it!!!!💖",
"Awesomeness just finished the transalantic cruise on Disney Magic and it 
was a very useful tool. Keep up the good work Disney.",
"VERY helpful. Was able to keep up with my party easily. LOVED the reminders 
about shows, dinner, etc.",
"The app is very useful. Especially when i had to keep in contact with 
others on the ship with me and keeping track of events on the ship.",
Bring back the suitcase countdown clock...the current version is BORING,
"Great and easy to use App. It would work even better if it had a tone 
notifications",
"The app worked great except not being able to message other guests on the 
ship",
"I liked the app but it would have been nice if it could save your 
preferences.",
"Great for shipboard usage. Occasionally down, but makes life on the cruise 
very convenient",
"Easy to use. Would be cool to have a map of some sort. Maybe locate others 
in your party on the map.",
"This was my very first Disney Cruise, and this application was wonderful, 
this was a great way to start informed!",
"It is a great way to know every activity on board and to communocate with 
you family while on the ship.",
"Very Helpful on the cruise. Lists important events and dinner seating as 
well as menus.",
"Loved it, made life a whole lot easier.  Just used the app all day.",
Worked well on the cruise. I would get it again,
Kept crashing. Was great when it worked.,
The suitcase count down was better before you changed it,
Helped us have a magical trip always up to date and worked great!,
Great app. Helped us manage our days and activities efficiently.,
"Very useful to have show schedules, and general information at your finger 
tips",
"Great app. Really helped us enjoy each day of our cruise. Will definitely 
use it again!",
The best help me find out everything. You should try it,
Does everything you need to keep you informed throughout your cruise.,
Works good when you have no service in the middle of the ocean,
"Very helpful for knowing what is happening on the ship as well as keeping 
up with family members on board",
"I love this app because it tells you all of the activities and the time it 
is",
"It is crashing on opening, not usable",
The notification don't even work,
Not very Disney. Needs work guys. Especially the chat app.,
Fantastic!! Just like everything Disney does.,
Beware to use you must purchase internet... 0.25 per gb,
Very organized and neat. Helped us get around.,
"It was nice to know what events were taking place and to be able to stay in 
touch with my family",
"Meh. Chat would have been helpful, but wouldn't push notifications.",
It worked fine for us. It was our first cruise.,
Great app. Worked perfectly for daily schedules on the cruise.,
Great app. Wish it had more pre cruise options,
It was very nice yo get notifications before.,
These app came in such good use on the cruise,
It was really good would like better notifications,
Best way to stay informed and connected while on board,
The activity schedule was a wonderful help. .,
Helpful and easy to use. A must if sailing on DCL,
Message feature is very spotty.,
Excellent app. Very helpful when sailing,
A search function would be helpful.,
It was super useful for the cruise every day,
The onboard chat needs work!,
Very useful. Did what I needed.,
Great for scheduling..a little glitchy for texting,
The updates are late but it is an awesome app.,
Great app. Helped get stuff to do,
Great way to communicate with family on ship,
Helpful to organize all the onboard activities,
easy to understand and kept us informed,
This App is just simply amazing,
Great while you are on the cruise.,
Very helpful onboard the ship.,
I love the updates to the App.,
"Awesome, use in all cruises",
Awesome. Helped a lot on the cruise.,
It really helped me get around the boat😁,
Excellent resource for your curise!,
Great app for coordinating on ship!,
"Easy, convenient and fun!",
Great tool. Well crafted.,
I hate it!,
Very helpful!,
User friendly app!,
Loved it for my cruise!,
Amazing amazimg amazing...,
Worked well! Will use again!!,
Very good it shows the navigater,
It was good WHEN it worked,
Crashed a lot,
Keeps crashing,
Freezes often,
Great app when on the ship,
Not working on Android P,
Very helpful,
Very helpful,
love the app,
Easy to use,
It was great,
Cool,
Cool,
"Our party had trouble with the chat function, but I think that was due to our data/energy settings. Otherwise it was incredibly useful and fairly easy to navigate.  I particularly enjoyed the ability to read the menu in advance of dinner, as well as see which dining room you were assigned to for that night.",
Changing my review because of the 2.0 update. The new Countdown Clock is very boring and I am disappointed that you would do this to something Adults and Kids alike look forward to seeing everyday!  Even my 10yr old Autistic daughter is unhappy with the change in format. Please......please someone read all these posts and do something about it!,
"Push notifications for chat were spotty and app had to be reset frequently to receive them. Would love the ability to book spa and other services via the app. A map of Castaway would have been useful as well.   Great for checking schedule and communicating with party, but definitely needs a few updates to earn 4+ stars.",
Countdown looks very boring since update. Would be nice to be able to access more info before you get on the ship. On the cruise the photo took up most of my screen so I could only see 1 activity at a time and had difficulty scrolling. Other people with different phones could make the photo go away but it wouldn't on my BlackBerry KeyOne android phone. Made it difficult to use. Also others in my party had difficulty getting the messaging to work and it took up to 12 hours for messages to go through.,
"The text feature is the only good thing.  You should be able to load your personal schedule as well as all events (and see what you are registered for).  There is SO much more that could be done with this app.  Keep working Disney - you have world class resources ... use them.  Pricing, sign ups, expenses, check out, link to the photos, menus ... lots could be added",
Messaging feature was really lacking! On activation messaging worked but very slow on day one by day two couldn't send messages at all so not very helpful! The daily activities and map were great. Only vibrates to warn of message or selected events you want to attend audio prompt would be helpful.,
"The app is very convenient for onboard use, and provides everything in one place.  This version of the app is glitchy - messaging can be sporadic, app freezes, requires multiple restarts - just has a few bugs.  Previous versions of the app worked at Castaway Cay, but this one did not.",
"I used to LOVE this app until.you recently changed the countdown clock! What may not seem like a big deal to some, is a big deal to others. The suitcase was so cute and made you want to go back and check and share with your friends. The new countdown is just plain boring :(",
"The countdown feature is great. Once on the boat the app is easy to use. The schedule feature is also very helpful. It has all the times of everything. The problem we had went trying to use the communicator the app kept going offline and you are not able to validate if you are offline or not.. Many times we would have to completely close the app and reopen to get the messages, this made that feature unreliable. I had expected to use the app to communicate with my kids on the boat.",
"I have a OnePlus 5T. This app did most of what it's supposed to. If you do not need it to chat, it does everything near perfect. I, however, used the chat feature heavily on my trip and was constantly dropped of connection. Even if the WiFi signal was strong, sometimes it could not send or receive chat at all, which was very annoying. Sometimes it didn't even show the Disney emojis - it would just say something like (captain-america's-shield).",
"This app was a GREAT tool to have to have access to a digital copy of the daily agenda. However, it didn't work as well when trying to communicate with other guest on the boat.  Wish there was an easier was to locate other guest other than having their ID number, and messages came through very slowly.",
"This app was so helpful to have while we were on our cruise. I loved the fact that I could mark an event by clicking on the heart next to it and the app would remind me about that event 15 minutes before it. That part of the app worked GREAT. The ""chat"" feature, however was a MESS! None of us could ever get it to work consistently. That feature needs some help. But, the itinerary features were super helpful!",
"Countdown calendar is boring now. Cruise events listings and reminders are 
helpful while onboard. We used menus posted to plan ahead but only works 
for main dining room. Person to person texting is seriously flawed. No way 
to send message to kids club or wave phones. Important messages often went 
undelivered, especially near show times. Many messages would be delivered 
hours after they were sent. Overall, helpful but not great",
"Could not get the texting to work across 6 friends Android and Apple 
phones. Deliveries made hours later or not at all. Activity filters kept 
resetting selections causing me to view everything again. We used the daily 
Navigator instead. Not impressed.",
The app is a great idea but not if you have an android. I had to refresh and reinstall this app so many times. It was a bit frustrating to use on the cruise. I was told that android users do have issues with this app. I mostly struggled with sending and receiving messages. It is great for checking times and reminds you of events you wanted to go to.,
"We had used this app for our cruise with family. The app worked flawlessly for the ship schedule, billing, checking data usage, etc. The only downside was associated with the text/chat feature. Between a group of 5, We all kept showing up as offline. As a result we had to keep cycling off and on the wifi and app to check messages. And even then it epically failed. This was a MAJOR detriment for our trip. We spent a notable amount of time trying to locate each other on the ship, and couldn't use the kids zone without lugging the ship phone around. (It even partially prevented us from using the kid zone) Since we all have different android phones I suspect it was an app issue. Wound up being a major bummer trying to coordinate with my non-tech savvy parents. The rating only gets a 3 so that Disney is aware of the issue. The onboard tech support ""chalked it up"" to ""a new app release"". Regardless this is a must have app for your Disney cruise. It did however have an extremely negative impact on our vacation not being able to text each other. It would have been worthwhile to just pay the ship fees for cell service sms texting to each other. Unfortunately, I opted to leave the phone on airplane mode to prevent unwanted incoming work calls while on vacation.",
"The new update may be awesome on board, but those of us who use it for 300+ days before we cruise are extremely disappointed.  Bring back the luggage countdown...or something equally awesome. The plain blue does not scream disney magic. 🙁",
"We just took a Disney cruise (our 3rd) and this is a Great app for planning what to do while on board. You can look days ahead to chose what you want to favorite, or select on a particular event to see when else it will be happening. You can also find out what times shops, restaurants are open. The chat feature is great when it works, sometimes messages never sent or they sent but didn't arrive on time. We had issues with the maps of the decks not loading, but you can get paper maps at Guest Services. This app is a must have for while on board!",
Problems with text feature. There were significant delays receiving texts using the app. Sometimes took an hour to receive a message. That is a problem when trying to locate your group. App was good for planning daily activities and seeing dining options.,
"The on ship texting feature doesn't work. Very frustrated with it. DCL 
needs to junk the app or make this part of it rock solid.",
"Having the countdown was so exciting leading up to our cruise until the suitcase disappeared taking away the Disney Magic with it. I found that I was no longer checking it daily and decided to use a different count down app that I found more enjoyable. Once on board having the schedule at our fingertips was great but found the messaging portion of app was very much lacking as in messages were either severely delayed or not going through at all. Over all, could have gotten by without it all together which was disappointing but I did not allow that to take away from the magical time we experienced with every single show, meet and greet and cast member.",
"There are two main aspects of this app. It's your calendar of events and a way to send messenges to family and friends while on board the ship. As an event tracker, it worked fine. You can tag an upcoming event as a favorite and it will send you a reminder when it's close to start.  There are ship maps that I struggled to get to work, but can see it being a useful feature.  What failed repeatedly was the messaging feature.  For the app to work you are instructed to go into airplane mode and connect to the ships wifi.  I rarely could get connected and if I someone managed to connect, chances we're my family and friends we're not connected.  Messages failed to send, were sent and received hours later, and otherwise was a hot mess.  After a few days of trying various combinations of adding and deleting the wifi network I just gave up and carried the wave phone around.  Pixel XL running 8.1  Also, the sign up calendar defaulted to Feb 2005 and didn't let me select a year.",
"Essential to any Disney cruise. Used this on a recent Disney cruise and would not have had the same experience without it. Helps remind you of everything, the entire family can bookmark their own favorite events, and no more carrying around or potentially losing the paper Navigator. Reminds you of upcoming appointments and tickets, without being annoying.",
"I used to absolutely love this app, although the function may be better. Very disappointed with the boring esthetic. Please allow us to select a classic view option, so we can see the adorable suitcase that we love!! You literally took the magic from the countdown experience with the updates!! It's not just a countdown clock! It's a count down to dreams coming true!!  Very disappointed!!",
Nothing but a glorified schedule viewer. The chat feature is unreliable. Registering for the app (birthdate entry function) is annoying and archaic on android. Needs more interactivty and reservation systems.,
This app was very helpful in keeping track of what's going on. The chat features were a bit spotty and can use a bit of work. But still recommended.,
"Lot of missed potential!  App has a lot of potential but constantly closes which prevents the use for instant messages with family members.  Had issues getting initial connection to work while in the port Canaveral terminal. Felt like a capacity issue of some type with dcl being unprepared for peak load.  On android, never got the ship deck plans to load.  Other features could make the app more useful to cruisers to improve the overall experience.   With the tech depth of disney, expect more from it.",
HATE HATE HATE the new countdown. Not cool. Haven't used the app since it has changed other than the use of the countdown.,
"It's awesome when it works. It was a joke on our cruise.  If you don't pay the high price for Internet access on the ship, it won't work.",
Chat feature through navigator app constantly froze and needed reset.  Was told by onboard IT staff that it has an issue with Android phones.,
Messaging was spotty and didn't always tell you there was a message.  Now the other things worked great and liked being able to go and find out what was happening in a pinch.,
"Overall, the app was helpful. The deck plans never loaded on my Android phone. I also found it hard to filter through all the activities.",
I don't like the new look.  Also the menus did not update if you visit a restaurant more than once.  The update that made this app much less intuitive.,
"Handy to check activities, shows, etc. without bringing paper. Loved having 
the menu for the evening's dinner. Chat feature was great. Internet spotty 
and app had some issues in board the Fantasy ship.",
I liked it alot.  Wish I could call Wave phones and staterooms via IP calls or even in App calling.  Deck Maps didn't always load for me on Galaxy S7,
New update leaves out options from the previous version. Overall ok but could not pull up dining menus from all the restaurants only my seating assignments.,
"Used the app on both cruises so far. Love the countdown. Was a little disappointed in the way the app would not allow you to directly input your birthday to set up the chat. Had to tap back month by month until I reached my year, so I was tapping for a while. Newer version apparently has fixed that, but could not be downloaded after embarking on last cruise. Update: Dislike the latest update (Feb. 2018). It has lost a lot of the charm on the countdown page.",
"Chat was useless, did not connect, and messages delivered next day that my children wanted to get picked up from camp the night before, not helpful.  Didn't work on my wife's iPhone either",
"Overall, our group had a ton of trouble with this app as we had to 
constantly close the app to get messages. It was great for the schedule, 
but terrible for communication and since that was the only way to 
communicate with multiple people, it was very inconvenient.",
App was twitchy our whole cruise. 2 of.our party never got the texting system to work and it showed people as offline when we were online. It did work well as a digital substitute for the navigator flyers.,
"Loved it for access to what was going on when aboard the ship, however in our party of four, only one was able to use the communication feature on a reliable basis (not useful when only one person can send/receive messages...) and two others could not connect at all whatsoever.",
This app is wonderful to stay up to date on daily activities once you are on board the ship. I love you can favorite things and it sends a notification 15 mins before it starts!,
Very poor connectivity on the Fantasy. I liked the idea of the app but was very inconsistent and couldn't trust it to get messages from family or Kids Club.,
Don't like the new countdown. It's very boring. Bring back the prior countdown look with the suitcase.,
"Just got off the boat,  and the new update on board is helpful.   Loved being able to see my individual plans everyday.   But, like many,  I am super unhappy with the new countdown calendar.  It's boring and not at all ""magical"" like the previous version.",
"Prefer the app before the update. This one, while clean looking, is very boring and doesn't give way to that excitement we all feel when we see our cute suitcase reach 0 and the fireworks appear. Please undo this update!",
Used it to plan daily activities and communicate with our party. Very helpful! The text part of the app sometimes would not work which is why I only gave it 4 stars.,
"I loved this app until the recent update. I wish I could show the screen shot, but the Disney cruise countdown is covered by the information and doesn't look as appealing. It was so nice to have the countdown inside the chest and right in front of you. Now the countdown is half cut out. Disappointed of this new change.",
"Works well, we were able to text onboard within our party, and it sent reminders for upcoming events we chose and wished to attend in enough time to make it. Would totally use on our next cruisr.",
"The change to the countdown timer is super disappointing. The little suitcase counting down was perfect, and now it's a boring, normal countdown. Whoever redesigned it needs to change it back. Or disneyfy it.",
Kept me up to date with all the daily activities and connected with family! Very useful on my fun cruise vacay. Overall loved this app 👍👍👍👍,
It was very usefull to be on top of everything in the cruise. The messages from other  users were a little behind.  Would be useful if is added Palo menu and link to guest plans.,
"Messaging did not work reliably for Android devices. Pretty useless. Other 
functions worked okay.",
This year bc I'm using a Droid I couldn't use the message feature. I had no service 95% of the time. MAJOR FAIL DISNEY,
"The new countdown clock is terrible, you really should change it back or show some imagination. The app would be better if it had a personal calendar of events already selected before the cruise.",
"I liked the previous version better, but this app makes cruising with Mickey easier. Everything you need right at your fingertips. I used it my entire cruise.",
Worked o k... My wife and I had massive battery drain from the app and constant connection issues while on the ship,
"We had 5 staterooms to keep up with in our group, this app was easy to use, and it kept us up to date on dining menus and activities!",
This app is great to keep you informed.  I wish it would offer hours of operation for Vacation Planning Desk and Port Adventures.,
"Great idea! Once in a while the app would stop. One thing I would love to for this app to add is the map that the stateroom has. Live navigation,  where the boat is. Hopefully that will be be added soon 😉",
The display is completely cut off on my Samsung s8. I can't even see the whole countdown. Hate it!,
Fun but lots more could be done with it. Looking forward to seeing the updates and improvements if we go on a Disney Cruise again.,
"It's  not all bad from seeing the cruise schedule, but it's supposed to allow you to communicate with other passengers. This feature is very unreliable and therefore became useless.",
"Deck plans would never load. App was not able to communicate with ""wave"" 
phones provided in rooms",
"The chatting session did not work at all. It showed everyone as off line all the time. We even went to guest services and he went through the whole installation process and same issues. Also, a lot of the events were listed multiple times at the same time frame.",
Great app! Some of the bugs needs to be work out and it will be a 5 star app. My family constantly had to close the app out and restart to receive any new messages between each other.,
Our first time on Disney Cruise and it's best ever! Also definitely will do it again in 2020. The workers are so wonderful but it is moree likely AWESOME.. Thank u (Disney Wonder Cruise) for make my daughter had blast time 😁😊,
Not happy with the change in the countdown. Went from a cute graphic to a generic countdown. Please change back and I'll go back to a 5 star rating. Other updates look good but removing the magical suitcase is BAD.,
It was the only source of communication on the ship for multiple staterooms except for the wave phones Which are expensive if lost. The app was fine but was not consistent and needed to be reset in order to send messages.,
"All four of us had problems with the chat feature being HIGHLY unreliable.  It's such a huge help, but not I'd it doesn't work.  Please fix before our next cruise, Disney!",
Brilliant for checking what's on where but chat was disappointing due to wi-fi drop out & disconnection.,
Overall a great app for getting info  for what is happening while on the ship.   Problems are 1 Messages not always delivered or delivered out of order.   2 Wish the app allowed you to explore the ship and possible activities before boarding the ship.,
I agree that the new countdown was boring. While on the ship the app was gitchy and need to be rebooted a lot. And the chat feature was spotty at best and did not work at worst. Please go back to the previous app. It worked flawlessly and I saw no added features with the new app. Why fix what was not broken?,
BRING BACK THE SUITCASE!! New functions will be good but the suitcase was a lot better than the generic display available now.,
Great app for keeping up with activities on the ship. Never really got messanger to work on phones for all persons in our party.,
This app was awesome until the recent update. Bring back the countdown clock with the suitcase. The new graphics are boring and the full countdown clock cannot be seen on my Galaxy S8. So disappointed.,
"Great for seeing what's going on, but had a lot of trouble with the texting function on our phones ...difficult getting them to send,and kept saying offline .",
I liked the app before this most recent update. Now it is plain and boring! Bring back the fun looking app!,
"Perfect companion while on a Disney Cruise. Never miss a Character, activity, or show.",
The app had a cute suitcase countdown feature and now it's just plain blue. Disney should put it back.,
Nothing worked and the messages never sent it made everything so hard we would have really enjoyed the app if it worked.,
Countdown clock is so boring! I need some Disney magic to keep me excited about upcoming cruise😥,
Never fully loaded the maps if the boat. Only loaded deck 3.  No access to weather forecast only current day.,
"The schedule features were very helpful.  However, as others have noted we couldn't reliably count on it as a way to communicate with our group due to unpredictable delays in receiving messages.",
Excellent chat feature. Deck maps wouldn't load but it wasn't a big deal. Daily schedules very useful.,
New app. has great up grades but please bring back the suitcase for the count down clock.,
We want the luggage graphic back!!! When onboard the chat did not work well between a android and iphone applications!,
"SO bummed! You took my happy DCL Suitcase countdown clock and made it as dull, basic, and boring as possible!!! Ugh.",
"Don't like the new countdown it's boring, please bring back the suitcase or something not so boring.",
"Dislike the update.  The countdown is so boring, I might as well just use my phone's countdown.....  PLEASE BRING BACK THE SUITCASE OR SOMETHING BETTER",
I Don't like the update.  The suitcase is gone for the countdown. Very boring and blah now.  Disney should have a fun and exciting countdown calender,
Great app until I tried to use the messenging feature. It only works about 5% of the time,
"The app is informative, but the chat feature is spotty at best.",
The notifications need to be more than vibrate. Missed so many messages due to this while on the ship. Push notifications were vague and you should be able to click on them and take them to the item it is reminding you about. Also on your plan for the day you should be able to click an event to remind you what that activity is.,
"Underwhelmed by the new countdown in this app.  Disney is typically known for its magic and imagination, the countdown clock on the latest upgrade is about as unimaginative as it can be.  Come on Disney - we expect better",
I think app is great but do i do wish i could set clock for more then one cruise at a time.,
Disappointed with recent changes gone Disney magic to boring and drab. Bring back the suitcase,
"Was able to communicate with the family very well, especially if you are on different part of the ship. We loved it",
Often our messages didn't go through for hours.  Great concept but needs work.,
I hate the new update!!  There's no Disney Cruise logo or anything now!  Bring back the cute suitcase!!,
Very helpful with telling us what events were going on and what time. It also notified us for the events we wanted to attend,
I did not really like it but and I did most of the time I had a hard time sending messages to me family members,
"Nice app, messanger has some issues and had to be reset multiple times.",
The new update is terrible. There is zero Disney Magic left in it.,
Hate the new up date where's the Disney magic gone.,
Very unhappy that the countdown luggage could not be somehow incorporated in the new layout and colour scheme,
Wusung for countdown and it is so DISAPPOINTING! You're Disney for pete's sake! Show some imagination!!!,
I loved the app! Just wish they would add a kid tracker that goes with their wristbands and it would be even better.,
"Messaging function didn't always work great, but otherwise very useful on the ship",
Update is not a update. It is a set back. Please go back.,
The updated countdown is so boring!! Please bring back the suitcase!,
Awesome way to understand what's going on at any given moment on the trip. Thank you Disney,
"Helpful with scheduling and locations, but inconsistent with texting party members.",
"Updated my review, love the app, HATE the new update that changed the countdown clock to a boring number instead of the magical vacation suitcase countdown. Change it back!",
"For Android users especially, still more work is needed for the messenger portion to be reliable.",
"Allowed me to communicate with family on board, plan activities and shows by seeing time scheduled.",
Map feature / deck plans didn't work all week.,
Great App for Keeping in Touch with Family Members on the Cruise. Very Helpful & Informative. Loved It.,
Loved having the ability to communicate easily with our party of 9!! Disney never disappoints!,
Liked it better with the little suitcase countdown but helpful when on-board.,
They upgraded app  but took away the good countdown,
The app could use some work. It was offline a lot.,
I dislike the new countdown. Not magical at all,
Very spotty texting and notifications...very disappointed,
We love the old app for the suitcase. Please bring back the cute suitcase countdown clock.,
Count down  sucks. Come on disney you can do so much better,
The OLD count down clock was a better graphic design.  BRING BACK THE OLD CLOCK,
I love it because I can communicate with other people and I could see what we could do,
New updates suck can't even read if the text is to high or low on a screen and bring back the suitcase,
"Very helpful, i used the app all the time while on the crews. Loved it!!",
It would be good but once the countdown was over I couldnt do anything total letdown,
"Very helpful, and we LOVE the Disney emojis!",
Like it but why make the countdown for your cruise so plain ? That doesnt make sense its Disney wake up it should look Magical !! The countdown is important please fix it !!!,
I miss the old app I enjoyed the suitcase countdown clock,
"Useful when it worked, but didn't most of the time",
The old countdown was better. Yep that matters!,
"Do something with the countdown timer! It's ugly,boring and so not Disney. Who approved this? Come on guys.",
Chat is little iffy have to restart the app every time to use it if not it will show other person offline,
Bring back the old countdown clock!.,
Love that I can see whats going on around the ship.,
The connectivity on the boat sucked a lot but when it did work it was very helpful and connected us to the new friends we made,
Half the time you want to use it it does not work.😠😠😠,
Would send messages hours after you entered them.  Would not get maps for  some decks,
The new update no longer is appealing  my friends liked my mickey suitcase countdown clock it was part of the magic now it is dull no one would know it,
A sound for notification would be helpful.,
Would not work with android.,
The best app for a Disney cruise ship,
It was very helpful and worked great.,
Why did you take away the suitcase and nostalgic images? Ruined it.,
I love how it keep me inform of everything.,
Very useful for keeping up on cruise activities.,
Never got chat to work consistently,
Notifications for messages would be helpful.,
Needs sound alerts when a message comes in!,
This app is very help before and after your cruise and has increased how many cruises I have been on.,
I don't like it at all,
I thought out was nice.,
We miss the old countdown clock... this one is boring!!!,
I'm in love with this App! 10/10!!,
"Totally unimpressed with the update to the countdown clock!  Please put the ""Disney"" back into the countdown clock, PLEASE??????!!!!!",
Great updated DCL app!,
Doesn't stay connected....,
You wouldn't want to miss it😎🤘,
Frequently broke on trip,
IT SAVED MY CHIRLFDEDB FROM DEATH,
Where is my countdown suitcase?,
Awesome!,
I love the disney emoges,
Excellent information during the trip,
Very helpful...,
Best vacation ever,
Helpful and accurate,
AMAZINGLY AWESOME,
Bring back the suitcase!!,
Good,
Bring back the suitcase,
Amateur hour,
"It was great to have the itinerary right there all the time, and the texting was so much easier than the way phones. This app is indispensable for anyone on a Disney cruise. However, there were a ton of technical issues. The app crashed every 2 or 3 times I opened it, and the message notifications rarely worked.",
"Yes it has a map and lists activities and you can text others in your group, but as apps go, it wasn't easily navigated. The emojis were cute.  This app could use some help from the Disney Parks app.  After all this, it's practically a necessity on the ship. So, whatever the rating, you still should get it.",
"It works alright for schedules, etc.  Although information for stuff like Room Service hours are not even kept up to date.  After nearly a week of using messaging with our large group, app hung up and needed resetting.  Upon doing g that, all address books, etc. were lost and was not rejoined to old chats.  Potential is here but current implementation is disappointing.",
"This app provided lots of information and was good for onboard communication with the family; however, it did not work well on my Pixel 2. It had major delays on the messages - sometimes taking two days to receive a text. I couldn't pull up all of the information. I know that it is good because the rest of my group used iPhones and it worked great for them. I do recommend it, but it may not work as expected with the Pixel 2.",
"Lovely app that replaced the old outdated Nokia phones in the state rooms. It allows you to chat on board with your family and friends using the ship's intranet, get notifications from kids clubs or even the laundry room, announcements and manage your daily activities including sneaking on the dining menu meals. What an amazing job, just keep it up Folks.",
"Really good for ship activities, not so great for chat. The app locks a lot less, but it still seems that the protocols are less like texts and more like Instant Messaging, i.e. you must be active in the app to receive/transmit. It can and will lock up even while in app and not doing anything. Improvement to router query protocols would help this a lot. Don't skip this on board though, very worth while.",
"This app was very helpful to us, however there is a glitch with Android phones that caused our little one some disappointment. The character meets listed on the app were incorrect, and actually showed some that weren't occurring at all, therefore we didn't get to meet characters that we had hoped to meet. I hope they can fix this glitch soon for future cruisers.",
"The app was very challenging to use. The chat function did not work and many messages got missed. Don't bother. Just use the on board phones and call each other. Those are still a little sketchy, but are slightly more reliable then the APP. We missed a lot of family time together because we could not communicate or coordinate. Not. Worth it. It also crashes whenever you are somewhere busy like the pool or an event.",
"It is a good start. Texting on board is nice but needs to alert better and probably missed text alerts for times when you are in a noisy area. More details on the information would be great. The ability to have all the cruise activities, locations, and details in the app would be awesome so you didn't have to refer to other papers etc.",
"While the app was ok to get ahold of those on board, it would crash often, disconnect from Wi-Fi & then it was irritating. Some notifications would come in 5 minutes later, and some 6 hrs later. Disney emojis were a lot of fun. Was frustrating getting it set up without others numbers or a way to see their number",
The only way to communicate with others in your party while on-board as Wi-Fi was iffy.  Disney emojis cute extra touch.  Would have liked ability to view previously booked shore excursions in daily schedule; and also to view and purchase my photos taken by the ship's photographer from the app.,
"This app never alerted me when I got a new message, and yes, my notifications were on. I would say I got a total of 2 notifications the whole time I was on the ship, and they each came about 3 hours late/after they were initially sent. I believe that Carnival Cruise Lines had a better app, and they cost about 1/3 the price of a Disney Cruise. You would think that for the cost of a Disney Cruise they would have a better app, but that's not the case. I was thoroughly disappointed with this app.",
"Useless. Texts via this app can take 1 min or 1 day to land. Any useful info regarding what to expect using this app are non-existent. It's basically a calendar app with event reminders. However, nothing works until you board the ship, so you can't view or set anything up in advance. Useless.",
"This app was excellent for texting my family around the ship but it has some problems with freezing. Voice calling through the app would be nice. Also, paid for port adventures should appear on the app for easy scheduling along side the regular ship activities but maybe highlighted in a bold color to define the difference. Over all it was wonderful. A trip of a life time. Thank you.",
"This app was very helpful in deciding what to do on a daily basis. Great to see the menus and decide what to eat, which characters are where and times for all attractions. My only suggestion to make it absolutely perfect is to be able to see what your bill is without having to call guest services. If this is your first cruise, like it was for me be prepared to be blown out of the water. This service is impeccable!!!",
"Loved using this app during our cruise. We'd have missed so many activities without it. The chat feature made it so easy to stay in touch with our group especially when we got separated. Weather, dinner attire, and debarking info was also a huge plus. I highly recommend it to anyone sailing the Disney cruise!",
"Mostly good. The navigator information is accurate. The chat feature is okay. Some suggested improvements: We need the ability to add in our own agenda items. We could not add our Palo reservation or spa reservations, for example, so could not receive notifications for them. Also, it would be good to use the preferred keyboard. The lack of swiping and auto filling slowed down the texting significantly. Another valuable feature would be the ability to see where the people in our stateroom are. However, in our opinion, the app is much improved over earlier versions.",
"Would like to see the ability for voice calls to other people onboard (even if it were for a nominal fee) added. Also, better notifications [a tone and/or vibration] for  when someone sends you a text message. Alerts seem to work much better on IOS than Android. Unless you check your phone constantly, it's easy to miss a message. Plus, ability to add reminders/alerts for activities (15 or 30 minutes prior to scheduled activity start time) would be great.",
"The app doesn't provide any more information than the hardcopy ""Navigator."" The notable exception is the ability to text your family while on board. However, what could've been much more helpful are personalized information, such as your scheduled restaurants, excursions, and specifics beyond the printed bulletin of generalized ship events. All in all, a weak app, which will be totally useless when Disney provides Internet/connectivity in the future.",
"This app is extremely helpful on the ship! Easily navigated through the app and it is easy to use. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is onboard the fantasy,  it would freeze very frequently and (of course) at the most inconvenient times. And sometimes the messaging system would work for hours on end. But overall, a pleasurable experience.",
I liked the app because it gave us a way to plan our days on the ship and on shore by reminding us of activities we wanted to do. The chat feature was good. But it really didn't help that it would not notify me when I got new messages sometimes or that it crashed quite a few times while I was using it. I would love if it would help with checking in to the ship.,
"App was unreliable at best.  During the last few days of my cruise on the fantasy, the app would crash consistently and messages would always fail when sending.  It was a bad time and became a liability.  The same thing happened to other people in my party.  It was bad enough where we all stopped using the app.  Guest services recommended clearing cache but that didn't work and requires you to set up all your contact list again.",
"Knowing meal menus was good however would have liked to known about other dining area such as cost, like sweet on you, also changes like no Mickey  pretzels on last sea day. Onboard airline check-in that information would be good to k ow before the deadline to register had passed when you think you registered. Other good to knows would be how to use storeroom telephone, wave phone and wake up calls. Good app needs improvement.",
"Great for taking a glance at daily agenda or deck layouts, clever how it works on ship wifi in airplane mode. I installed it so our family could communicate when phones not unlocked for international calls become useless but none of us could figure out how to create a group chat so we used the mobile phones provided in room instead.",
"App was great when it worked. For some reason it would not stay connected. Kept showing people in my group away, so they or you might not receive current messages, without refreshing. Which, is not helpful if you need a response right away.  Very helpful with cruise related items like locations, menus, show times etc. Its better to have than not, even if it's intermittent.",
"Has so much potential, but execution is terrible. We just got off a week long cruise on the Fantasy. The biggest issue was the constant crashing (Not just mine...everyone in our group of 8 adults) and instant messages not sending or failing all the time (to the point that it wasn't worth using).  Extremely disappointing that Disney does not have this figured out. Network infrastructure should be built to easily handle the number of people on the boat and have enough range extenders to reach all parts of the boat. Complete garbage that we had to struggle to communicate the whole time short of carrying around the clunky room phones.",
"Great app for keeping up with our larger travel group. It does need a better alert for messages. Resorted to using the ship's Wave phone for important messages, like Kids Club notifications. Using the app we missed a message letting us know our daughter wanted to come back to us. Definitely useful.",
Texting feature had to long of a delay.  Would be nice if it could be used for the Oceaneers lab to contact adults on so the stateroom devices also wouldn't have to be also carried around. Calling feature wood be nice.  Activities itenary was great! And off you hit the heart icon it will remind you of upcoming events :),
"Not useful until you are on the cruise. I wish I could have planned my day ahead of time, as the Disney parks let's you. I was overwhelmed the first 3 days into my cruise. Plus it had issues with loading the maps.  It isn't clear you need to turn on airplane mode first, then log in to the ships WiFi. Which was a pain especially the first day chaos, as you won't have cell service once you are on the boat. So friends or family you are traveling with will be in the dark till you find them to get their unique ship text if, which is a pain to get to as well.",
Great supplement to Navigator each day.  our entire family had to keep resetting it though as would lock up.  just go to Front Desk on 3 - they will give instructions to wipe cache/data.  that DOES mean however that you have to reset all your chats with family members and start over.,
"Provided what you would expect out of basic app for a cruise...  times, locations, ship map etc, as well as a basic chat app...  having VOIP would be a great asset...  or some way to ring others...  found that messages would get missed if initial buzz was not detected.  Also would have been great to have a location tracking system built in.  With all of the rfid on board, adding tracking for others should be possible.  Also would like reminder feature built in... something like an alarm that you could set for a show that you wanted to see.  With disney, was expecting a wow factor...",
"Decent app for schedules and times. Intuitive and easy to use. The chat feature is weak - no auto-correct, poor integration with Android notifications and alert tones, significant messaging delays, and lots of trouble using it to communicate between party members. VOIP would be useful, but when SMS through the onboard satellite wifi was hugely more usable and reliable than chatting through the app, you know there's room for improvement. On the other hand, it's free and useful. You get more than you paid for.",
"Worked wonderful for tracking activities and character visits. We also used it to scope out dinner menus ahead of time. Only problem was the chat feature. My wife and I had constant issues with messages not going through.  The app would say we were ""away"" even though we were both connected to the Wi-Fi. Other than that, it's a great tool.",
"Not a bad app during the cruise, but could certainly be better. No way to check on your current account balance, not connected to Shutters photo account. Would be nice if could be used as a substitute for the ""Key to the World"" card for things like room access or scanning to get onboard or getting kids at the Oceaneers club. Had several crashes during the cruise and sometimes would hang causing onboard chat notifications not to come through. Also would be nice to use in place of wave phone for voice chat as well as notifications from guest services and/or Oceaneers club.",
"Overall, this app is very good.  It is slightly annoying that you cannot set an audible alert along with the vibration for chat.  I have coded around this with Tasker (at least you get a notification to key off of).  It is a great platform for future shipboard tech integration.  Can't wait to see that!",
"App was very useful especially for the chat, however, some events were not on it. An additional character meet and greet was not listed on the app nor on the paper navigator. We did pass by the characters and would have loved to have gotten in line but missed it since we weren't aware of the time.",
"I loved being able to set ""favorites"" for activities in the Navigator and get reminders. Wish I could have added my dining rotation/seating time and port adventures into the favorites/reminders. Would have been nice to see this app work similar to FastPass and Dining Reservations for My Disney Experience app. Had some trouble adding people outside my stateroom to chat though. And new chat alerts wasn't as reliable as the activity reminders, which was a bummer.",
App was only half effective.  Friend installed on her phone and wrong cruise date was selected.  Even uninstall and reinstall wouldn't reset the date of the cruise.  So we couldn't use her app.  On mined it refused to let me pick a birthday older than 5 years so it wanted my parents permission to log in to use communicator.  I'm an adult.  It had its issues but has potential to be helpful.,
"WHEN this app worked, it was great.  Yet, for some reason on our cruise it was not always active...messages could sometimes take several hrs to receive.  Would also be nice if future versions would include voice calls to replace the wave phone entirely.",
"The app was just okay. It didn't work for everyone in my party, so it defeated the purpose of being able to communicate. When my husband and I would message each other, it wouldn't go through but would randomly show up the next day even with our notifications turned on. The app was useful for ship info such as dining and events, but the character meeting weren't always correct and a cast member told me that the paper navigator you get each day is the final schedule so I just always followed that to be safe.  It's worth it to download just to have it, but be aware that it may not work for everyone.",
"This app is really great for any cruise. It tells you everything you need to know about activities around the ship, as well as restaurant times and menus. The chat feature is really useful for talking to family and keeping them informed, however there are still bugs to be worked out. Any time I tried to open a group chat, the app would glitch and I would have to restart it. There could also be a lot of lag time between when a message was sent and when it was actually recieved. A voice chat/phone option would be a really helpful addition; traveling with my elderly grandparents they didn't really understand how to use the chat feature and preferred to call on the wave phones disney provides in the stateroom. Overall, a great resource and worth downloading for any length cruise, but be aware that it is not perfect.",
"We thought the app was great for listing and notifying us of cruise activities when clicking on the heart by the activity,  though we were not able to add our personal excursions or appointments.  That would have made daily planning awesomely simple.  We also loved the ability to chat with others in our group, but it would occasionally freeze up or crash on us during use. We would love to have the ability to save our chat sessions as a souvenir and reminder of chats that we had while on the cruise.  Also it would be great to be able to download the app while on the DCL-guest network as well. One person (iPhone) in our party deleted the app after it froze thinking that they would just reinstall it, but was unable to do so.  Lastly the ability to add photos or location information would take this app to the next level. Our group used both Android and iPhone - we all had the same issues, but found the app invaluable and were happier to have it than not have it.",
"This app not only has a countdown to your cruise, but comes to life when you get on the ship. It makes it so much easier to communicate and find out what is going on and at what time without having to carry your navigator AND room phone around.",
Very helpful. Don't use paper anymore because of this. Selecting which activities to do and getting reminders are great. Just wish they had a search feature instead of having to hunt through each day. Message feature is best part - wish they would add voice so wave phones would no longer be necessary.,
"Sailed on the Fantasy, and installed the app on a Pixel 2.  The chat feature didn't work reliably (though it's better than it has been on past cruises).  To make it really useful they should really include a way to set up reminders for you ticketed events and excursions, so you can see you while day at glance.  We were also told that the app isn't as reliable a schedule as the printed Navigator sheet that's handled it every day.  WHY would the app be LESS reliable?  Come on DCL... Fix this up.",
Used for our 7 day cruise was useful for keeping in contact with my family and very easy to see what events were happening and when .Alerts you prior to start of any event you may have marked as favorite. Only negative was the IM feature ddint always connect and I or one of my family members either did not get the mesage or received it after the fact. Semed like some parts of the ship had very poor connection. Overall very useful app . They do provide you with a daily sheet that has the same info but having the app at hand is much more effiecint tajn having to carry the sheet all over witb you.,
"It was useful to connect with fellow friends on the ship, and helped with info on activities - but, it sometimes took forever to load, the last day it had conflicting information on room service times vs our print out sheet in the room, and last two days, some of my friends experienced full failure of app to load. They then lost connection to existing group chats they were in.  I wished there was a way to add people to an existing group vs needing to create a whole new group chat, allowed capability to share pictures to chats, and react to comments made by friends. It would also have been nice to be able to schedule port excursions, spa's, restaurants etc through the app.   So all in all, useful for what it is, but definitely could use more oomph to increase the reliability and functions within the app itself.",
"Great for finding and then keeping track of shipboard activities. The chat app is good, but needs work. It can seriously lag when you need messages to go through. It would be great if it allowed for shipboard voice calling and / or video chat. Also great for keeping track of restaurant hours and locations. Overall, excellent.",
"Massive fail! App worked great for last two cruises, but on the Magic now and the app this year just puts me in a loop to force me to buy a data package (which DCL states unequivocally you do not need to use) from their new ""Connect@Sea"" service. Tried on three different devices with same result - no service on ship. For a DCL-pushed app we used to enjoy and depend upon - FAIL Disney!",
"It's a great concept but feels like it's still in early stages. App kept crashing, wouldn't receive messages unless the app was open. It would also be great if you could add your stateroom number and get a schedule for your booked excursions and a summary of your expenses onboard.",
"Was far better on previous cruises. Ate battery like mad, crashed constantly, had different info on different people's phones even after we all shut down and restarted, was horrible about sending or receiving texts to and from people we traveled with. Hope future updates make this app far more useable for future cruises.",
"Great to be able to see all activities, and also h ave it broken into age appropriate activities if needed. The maps of the ship were helpful. Great to be able to see what was coming up in the days ahead. On-board chat was ok, there was no notification that you had a message, which was a little annoying.",
"This app was very helpful for keeping up with what was going on on my Disney cruise. I would have given it 5 stars if I had been able to get the texting to work. The app did not allow me to simply type in my birth date. It has a pop up calendar that would have required tapping my way through all the months from 2007 to my date (back in the early 60s). Your birth date had to match the date they had on record for your reservation. So there was no faking it. If they would fix this one issue, the app would be perfect. Right now it's *only* very good!",
"Schedule and activity view was okay., but the communicator is very sketchy,  notifications didn't work most of the time and connectivity while at castaway cay was poor at best.  Take the wave phones or bring some walkies if you want to be sure to stay in touch",
"2018: onboard WiFi failed repeatedly last cruise (for many hours each time). App frequently shows everyone as ""Away"" even if sitting next to each other, on wifi, with app open. Messaging functionality still very basic. App crashes at least daily...  2017: Onboard WiFi still terrible. Kids uncontactable most of the time, messages can get stuck requiring app to be restarted. Good info about activities. Keyboard problems (backspacing doesn't work right). No ability to forward messages or send images. Please Disney, just enable Facebook messenger, so we can communicate effectively with each other onboard.",
The app is okay as a communication platform. It falls short without the ability to send pics and it's very buggy. The app crashed often for the people in our group (using a variety of phones). The benefits were having the deck plan and daily schedule on the app.  On a side note the data packages on board are terrible. Between the price and the estimated usage they really take their money. I understand it's difficult to get data in the middle of the ocean but they should offer some free basic data when they are in port each day.,
"App was mostly just taking up space on my Pixel 2XL . Messages sometimes took until next day to get to me, when my daughter wanted to be picked up from oceaneers club message came through 3 hours later and she was upset thinking we left her (not good for a child who was neglected at birth). I never could bring up the ships map either. My stateroom wave phone was out of order so I really was depending on this app to keep connected with others in my party. You need to add voice feature so we can talk to our party members if they are elderly and don't text like my 87yro grandmother and my 69yro father -in-law who went with us. Make it more Android friendly also, put sounds for the messages so they aren't missed when they do come through.",
we used it to keep up with the different activities.   It was great to have when trying to locate things on the ship.  Chat worked fine.  It took a couple of days to figure out how to use it without using data.  There was someone there to help but we were too busy or lazy to go down to speak with them.,
This made our cruise so much easier to navigate through all the different things Disney has going on during your vacation. It also has a chat feature so you can text members in your parry while at sea by using the ships WiFi. Strongly recommend this.,
"Useful to see most times and menus and times for meal options.  Great for being able to create favorite activities and to see list, BUT alert vibrating only then gone . Needs pop times up alert. One thing I really wanted to do, Disney tunes trivia, changed time to earlier on printed Navigator, but it was NOT corrected in app, even after closing and restarting phone and app. Very disappointing to miss the event with no alert of change. Sometimes messages went thru righg wway, good to find each other and meet up. Somrtimes messages not received or delivery very much delayed, which was confusing.",
"Well for me it was mostly good BUT messages sent to others in my group Did Not have the correct Time Stamps. Every new message was given a time stamp equal to the time I opened the messaging portion of the App.... YES I did keep it running in an effort to avoid this issue But No Luck, Just ate my battery up. THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED ! ! !",
This app was pretty bad for our whole group. On Samsung it would freeze for 2 to 3 minutes randomly. Then sometimes require 3 or 4 times to open it. It had issues with iPhone as well half way through the cruise and would crash immediately.,
"Helpful, but not great. Locks up a lot. Cruise director told us to completely close each night and reopen to make sure we had the daily updates. Can select favorites but can't share between family members and can't add in scheduled paid experiences to help plan your day.",
"Pretty good app overall. Emojis are awesome, wish I could use them outside of the app. Messaging can use some improvements, like adding data - based calls and media sharing (at least with your party) then it would definitely get 5 stars. Hope this helps!!",
"Very useful for on board information.  For activities, dining, menus, etc. Messages aren't reliable and don't always go through. Would be better if there was an option for audible alert for a message. Also would be nice to show a map of where the ship is at current time and actual real time weather data.",
"The app was great and a much needed addition from our cruise 3 years ago in 2014.  The navigation was fairly easy and we liked all the emojis of the Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel characters.  The one problem we had was the ability to share favorites.  Since the app update gives each passenger a unique number for chatting it would be nice to share the favorites like you do when you invite someone to a calendar event. This would allow you to share with the people in your state room as well as with passengers from  another state room if you are travelling with a large party.  You should then be able to turn off the favorite if your personal plans change.",
It's a little klunky.  It does give great information but at times it is slow.  There phones we used didn't always behave with the app and we would have to restart the app.  It uses a combo of shipboard WiFi and text messaging but I'd you do not want to be charged by your phone carrier you must make sure that 1.  You have an international plan just in case.  2. You need an international data plan just in case.  3. You need to make sure that your data plan is off.  4. You need to make sure that you can turn off your phone service without turning off the wifi.  If you can do this.. then this app will work for you.  If you can't get it right...  You may end up with an international bill or ship to show bill .  Otherwise it worked ok.  It could use a tracking system for locating the kids.,
"App is a must have if you take a Disney cruise, but as of 06/17 it's not the most stable. Sometimes it lags real bad, and messages are sometimes delayed. You really do want it to communicate and keep track of shipboard activities thought.",
App is great to have access to the entire day's activities. The chat feature is nice but it would be better to have a calling feature like most other have said. Not sure if it was app related but it only worked intermittently for me on our cruise last week. Bring the wave phones!,
Usually a great way to stay connected with family and friends while on board the Dream. Only suggested improvements would be boosting the WiFi signal in the Teen Hangout on Castaway Cay as it is nonexistent and caused some delay in finding family in the late afternoon. We also found when the time changed on my son's phone all of his chats with his new cruise friends disappeared. Manually setting the time to GMT one of the chats came back but none of the others.,
This app is great. It is good to let you know of what is going on and where while on board. I did not use the commuications portion that much but it did seem to work well when I did. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it does not have the ship's location available. This was something I always wanted to know as we passed by land visible 20 or 30 miles away. I wanted to know what I was looking at. I would have to to my cabin and look at the TV to get that information. So the data is there; they just have share it in the app.,
This ap was the best way for a family of 8 to stay in touch and not get frustrated when we were trying to locate family members. This took the stress out of coordinating an enjoyable vacation with a large group. Plus knowing about upcoming events and setting reminders was AWESOME! Disney does it again.,
"We love this app...it is so helpful to use not only for the planning features, but also the live chat feature...much easier than using the wave phones and the Disney emoji are super cute! My only suggestion would be to include auto correct for the chat feature.",
"This app would not work on ship. A very few times it did, but it was a rare moment! Sadly we counted on this as a family communicator. Comebwith an alternative plan. The guest services was made aware and the Ship staff worked on the issue-our entire cruise.",
"The only thing I felt was missing was voice messages in the chat feature. Other than that, it provided all the information on activities in the boat.",
"We had troubles our whole trip with messages not going through. It worked great to see what was happening on the ship everyday, though.",
"Look everyone carrys a cell phone nowadays! This negates carrying your stareroom cordless phone along and carrying around the paper navigator because everything is downloaded into the palm of your hand. Stay in touch with 1 person or Include everyone in your group on chat so you can let everyone know at once where you are. It lets you plan your day, set reminders about what activity you've chosen and alarms you when its time to start your activity. Disney hit a home run here! And its free!",
"This app made it so easy to keep up with our friends while being offline to the real world! The only thing it could do better would be to have a place and information for your excursions with alerts for beginning and end times, meeting places, etc.",
"Very easy to use, but the Wi-Fi is no where near strong enough to support everyone on the ship. You constantly get logged out without knowing.",
"There is room for improvement, but overall the Android version works well enough.  I would love to have our entire prebooked schedule and dining rotation show up with alerts.  It would also be nice to have a search function for the complete activity schedule.",
Terrible. It locks up and it loses connection very easily. Messages didnt show up from party members until it was too late sometimes,
"Giving this 1 star thanks to the new update. Very bland and unimaginative looking. While waiting for our cruise the countdown is all we can access on the app, why not keep it whimsical and fun? The new update looks like it's counting down to a doctor's appointment or something just as boring!",
It was nice to be able to track all of the great Disney activities but the chat was NOT in real time. You would be kicked off the wifi while trying to meet up with the rest of your family. They would get the messages several hours after I actually sent them.,
"This is a great app! We used the count down for our trip to build excitement, we communicated with it during our cruise, we planned our day since it has all the daily activities, knew our way because of the deck maps and looked forward to our meals based on the menus, restaurant hours etc. I wish they would add a child tracker feature that would sync up with the children's wrist band and the deck plans to let you know where the child may be in case they run off. It would provide better peace of mind. Other than that we absolutely loved it and used it all day.",
Just awful. It needs to be personalized for each family member. The texting constantly gets lost or doesn't work. We should also be able to settle our onboard accounts via the app. Maybe even order services or expeditions through it. And reminders sent for expeditions as well.,
"Helped keep track of activities for the whole family! My son spent his time in vibe,  daughter in edge and we stayed in contact using chat.  We always knew when fun things were happening  and were able to plan accordingly.",
"Key part of my daily routine aboard.wake up, scroll through the itinerary marking favorites. Get reminders shortly before. Check out the evening menu. Also includes a messaging system to keep in touch with others onboard. Very helpful.",
"The messenger needs to be its own app. It is not real time all the time, making it useless for trying to meet up with your party",
"Messages did not go to others in a timely manner. Like that we saw menus, events and calender. Countdown leading up to event was nice.",
It was nice to be able to text instead of call.  The only thing I would recommend is there is a way to notify parents if their kiddo wants to communicate  (aka out) instead of carrying a room phone AND a cell.,
"This was perfect for knowing everything from the meal menus to the events occurring around the ship.  The only flaw was the dedicated screen for character appearances did not work.  The information could still be found, but by navigating through other links.",
"Works fine, it just may get buggy when the ships have wifi issues.   Would be nice yo have year round accessible content instead of only on the ship. Helps to prepare.",
This app was necessary to my cruising survival. I only wish you could also program your port adventures and dinner reservations into it as well. The WiFi went down so the app wasn't useable for a day or two as it didn't reflect the proper activities onboard.,
"It worked fine the first day of the cruise.  After that, it would crash constantly when using the ship wifi.  Very disappointed in the lack of quality.  6 people in my group all with different Android phones but all with the same problems.",
"Could not use the app for on board communication Ask for birthday, had to go over every month for over 70 years. Then kept stopping and had to start over and over",
"Good application. Would have liked to send pictures through the chat features. Don't have internet on ship, would have been easier to do that.",
Another tool Disney uses to make your vacation magical... easy to use & so helpful for keeping in touch w/the teens in our party & keeping up w/events we didn't want to miss.,
Nice app for on the boat. Connection was flakey some times. Would have been nice to be able to send pictures. Maybe share location (for kids),
Very helpful app.  We could text our family members for all three rooms while on the ship.  The app also gives information on food and activities.,
App was great when it worked but very glitchy this time around (Wonder August 2017).  Heard there were server issues and it got better after a few days.  Should add ship position & speed info.,
"Excellent chat device on the boat and excellent for finding your way around the boat for the activities and times. It even showed us restaurant opening times and type of attire for that day's meal. It gave us also some trivia for each port of call and the boat itself. I also liked the character meet and greet schedule times, the ability to BOOKMARK events for that day AND get notifications prior to the event. It also broke down the activities in simplified groups such as a movie times tab for all the movies shown on the boat, teen and children activities, and the ability to look ahead in time to each day of the trip to create a personalized itinerary. It was very comprehensive and a must-have to plan your Disney cruise vacation.  Excellent job!",
"Android and Apple versions varied somewhat. Schedule was not the same. For example, Edge talent show was listed as 8 p.m. on iOS and 10 p.m. on Android versions",
"My whole family really loved this cruise. There was always something for all of us to do, no matter what age. The staff were so awesome. There cheerfulness will be missed. We will definitely be going back again.",
"The app was great for looking at menus in the MDRs, times for activities, shows, movies, and info about the ports. The texting was plain awful. It froze, lagged, texts would not show up for hours. Very disappointing when trying to stay in contact with family members.",
"The app doesn't link to your account for activities you have booked so you have to manually go in and favorite them.  Also the messages doesn't work unless you are on the boat, linked to the WiFi and the app is open.",
"Great idea, was easy to see activities - texting needs some work. Mine constantly crashed, didn't send or showed sent but wasn't. Finding/adding those in your linked reservations should be easier.",
"Worked well and was helpful on our cruise.  Easy to navigate.  One suggestion, make the app notify of texts even when not open.  Missed a lot of texts with other members of our party because the app wasn't open. Would be nice to be able to enter port adventures as well.",
I would recommend the app for information about activities and entertainment on board. However as a means to communicate with other members of your group it was just not reliable.,
All I wanted to do was to text my family on the ship.  They were always shown as away on my phone.  Everyone else could contact each other.  We could not figure out what setting on my phone was different.,
"This app was pretty useless. On board chat never worked. We had some scheduling changes due to weather and was told by guest services that the app SHOULD have been updated with the changes, but it wasn't. If something did work, it was still confusing.  Disney is great, but this app was pretty much a waste of time.",
Download before you get on the ship .  And keep the app open to communicate if not you won't get the  messages when they are sent.  Other then that it was very helpful,
"This app is great for keeping up with your schedule, maps of the ship, communicating with your party on ship and the kids used it without any problems. It's improved drastically since 2015.  With no cellular access, it works on ship without any issues.",
We used this app constantly to help plan our daily activities. Great tool to keep in touch with my husband when we ventured in different directions.,
"For the most part, this app is great. A couple things could be improved. It should show the activities you booked ahead of time. Also, it should let you book activities within the app once you are onboard. Overall it was very helpful to have.",
"App is really useful to communicate with family members. Wish it had an option to take pics to send to each other as well, like Snapchat.",
"Not easy to locate people in your party. Should be able to find withe name, not just by chat #  this was very inconvenient.",
I like being able to see the menus early and know what is going on around the ship. The chat feature seemed to be too slow for our group.,
Helpful with activity times and locations.    Disappointed about the chat.  Parents never got message to pick up kids from club...uncle got the message.  Also location never updated on my cell for the towel folding event so missed most of that.  Bring a magnetic whiteboard for your door to communicate with family if app fails.,
Very helpful. Only suggestion I have is that it makes a noise when a message is received. I remember it only vibrated.  So I missed a lot of messages.  Also possibly a better tutorial on how to add people to chat from other rooms.,
"Only major negative on the entire cruise. Information was great when I could get to it, but the application repeatedly froze/hung, and chats repeatedly failed to show up.",
Love this app. Super helpful with knowing what was going on during each day. Also being able to send messages to my family while cruising was awesome,
"It's very reliable, get it especially if you want to keep in contact with cruise members of your family. Very fast but you have to check the app to make sure you haven't go any messages but everything else is good.",
"I used it to keep in touch with those who I was traveling with and to see the room service menu as well with what was going taking place;  movies, activities on the cruise,etc.",
Getting better each year and really helpful while on board your cruise. Liked getting reminders just before selected activities were occurring.,
"This is a must have app for the cruise. I used it daily to check ruined of activities,  Mark favorites,  check hours, etc. It is great. It could improve even more if you could incorporate end of cruise survey, excursions and dclphotos . Thanks",
Great at seeing where characters are and what activities are available. The dining times and menus is very helpful. Only problem was with the messenger. Messages would arrive very delayed and service was shoddy.,
"Great app. Helped a lot with communicating with your family on the cruise. It was also very helpful with finding what you want to do when and where. Over all, great app.",
It's improved since the last cruise but has a ways to go.   CONS:  The messaging system is a great idea but unreliable with messages arriving hours after being sent.   The activities for all ages doesn't show ALL activities and you don't realize you're missing something until you go to adult activities or activities broken out by age groups.   App could use listing and then updates on debarkation location for each port.   PROS:  The app does give you dinner menus which is helpful.  App allows you to favorite activities and then messages you a reminder.  App also links to a map of the ship location for each activity.,
This is really helpful to navigate the ship and the many activities. Definitely worth downloading. It also gives you reminders when events are coming up as it's easy to lose track of time on the high seas,
The app was useful to stay connected with family and cruise activities.   There was a challenge in getting notices when new messages arrived.  I had to reopen the app for the notifications to come through.  It did crash a few times during our cruise.,
"Awesome way to keep updated about the activities, and navigate your way through the ship. Sometimes the app froze at sea, but its understandable...you're in the middle of the ocean 😋",
"Good for on the boat info. Issue is text is slow and often delayed by hours. Three people with three different phones had the same issues. Very handy bit not as advanced as it could be, especially when it's used so much on the ship.",
"Works great for navigator information, but horrible for texting. Use the wave phone provided on board to communicate with your party instead of relying on the app.",
"Very helpful but closed often, especially when trying to use chat feature.  Also seemed to be issues with chat messages not always reaching recipients even when it it indicated message was received.",
"A few things could be added, like the port adventures. I'd like a personal calendar for organizational purposes. There's just too much to do on the boat.",
"We found it very useful for what was happening and when. We also found the menus useful, it also gave you the opportunity to try other types of food. We couldn't get the chat part to work hence why I haven't given it a full score",
"I loved using the activity schedule, seeing menus and communicating with others in my party.  My complaint is that the text messages took awhile to go through and sometimes did not go through at all.",
Easy to use but while on ship the chat feature is hit or miss. I do like the reminders for activities.,
Never got the chat app to work.  Overall good informationSometimes there was a disconnect between posted hours on the Daily paper Communicator and the App.  App was wrong.,
Was really good for on cruise info etc. Also includes texting capabilities. But I would like to see some sort of sound notification  when a text comes through.,
Love this app. Made planning ahead super easy. Very user-friendly. Handy for getting in touch with family members with he on-board chat feature.,
Wonderful idea when it worked.  The app crashed a lot and the chat portion was down more than up.,
"The app is very helpful and user friendly. If I had to make one suggestion, I wish it would allow you to see your onboard expense account. Other than that, it provides all the information you need during your cruise.",
Only only thing I would like added is spell check on the message section for Android. Had some trouble staying connected to the wifi on board but still a must have app.,
Great app that is super helpful on the cruise. Loved the notifications so we didn't miss anything and the texting with cute emoticons. Definitely a must for the cruise.,
"The app would lock up fairly frequently and I could not send texts to family members or receive them or look at activities on board the ship.  Great concept, just needs to function all the time as intended.",
"The app was good with one exception: the texting portion.  The texts took a long time to get to someone... a couple of times, it took 60 to 90 minutes for someone to get a text message.",
"Good idea but failed me mid-cruise.  After working with the app for half a cruise I exited the app and restarted it and it stated ""We are preparing for your cruise,  check back when you have boarded""  with no options available to troubleshoot the app.  I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app using Disney satellite internet at my expense.  Really Disney?  If I was less boarded I would be drowning in the Caribbean!",
"Really useful, if I didn't have to restart the app regularly it would be better.  Adding where the boat is in the world like on a plane would be a great feature",
"Buggy - messages delivered inconsistently, needed frequent restarts, filled with bloat that slows it down.  No need to list each restaurant menu separately, the main dining menus are all the same.",
When returning to ship it logged us into our data...even though it said we were logged out on the website...used up our 50mb and didnt know it!! So we learned we had to log IN then immediately log out when returning aboard,
Should have access to onboard account and photos. Connect at Sea not very good plan. Map and chat helpful.,
We were never able to get the messaging system to work on it. It was infuriating seeing as that was the whole reason we got it.,
"Good idea, but did not work well. Not enough instructions. Did not want to spend 1/2 day in Cust. Serve. Line to get more info. Sent msg did not show up for several hours.....not good for getting whole gang together.",
Had to close and restart several times to receive chat messages. Disney should add features like folio view and bridge report. Good for having a digital version of the Navigator,
Falls short. Would be better if you can get alerts for specific times of shows or events . You can mark something as a favorite but you get an alert for all times. Could also use sound alerts in the app.,
The app was very easy to use and provided all the information I needed. It was also very helpful to receive messages thru it when kids were at the nursery and kids club.,
"App kept stalling and crashing. Otherwise, contained great info during the cruise.  I never used the daily navigator (schedule) provided by the ship. Also, VERY nice to be able to easily communicate with the rest of my party.  Love the Disney emoji's!!!!",
A Must. Very useful.  The chat feature worked great. Very informative about both activities and ship details. Disembarkment procedures were explained fully in app.  Great free app.,
"Helpful on the cruise, performance was all over the place.  Some times it worked great other times it was unusable and we wouldn't see messages for hours after they were sent",
It's a decent app but my Samsung Galaxy S7 restarted numerous times a day when it was installed. Great for schedules and reminders for activities and character appearances.,
App is useful but crashes constantly. Tech support suggested it may be the group chat being the culprit. Reinstalled with onboard help and kept the group to 5. Helped for a while.,
"When functioning,  the app is very useful. However connection frequently drops and chat option is very delayed.  I would recommend a feature that incorporates your scheduled and booked activities.",
"Very useful and helpful in planning activities and looking at dining options. Way easier than carrying around the old paper Navigator. The only miss is no listing of shore excursions, which we hear is in the works.",
"Over all a solid app.  The messaging however is unreliable, do not reply on it as your sole option to keep track of your kids with cell phones.",
The app was great in every aspect except for the texting feature. I had problems with my Android and the rest of my family had problems with their iPhones. Which became annoying when trying to contact our kids elsewhere on the ship.  The information section of the app was fantastic.,
"The idea of the app is great, however if you have android it sucks. It needs to be faster on messages, it takes a bit to go through, a facebook like call feature would be awesome, the wave phones are useless.",
"Way cool way to find out what's going on during the cruise. Also, being able to text family while on the cruise or Castaway Cat was awesome.",
This app really helped out my wife and I. We had to split up to try and make some of the may things disney has going on. So texting back and forth was simple.,
"Worked great at first, then began glitching. I didn't receive messages until sometimes a day later. It would give me the layout for deck 3 but tell me I was on deck 4 (It said deck 4 at the top). Times and events were there one minute,  gone the next, and then there again. It would have different events listed from one phone to the next. Got the welcome message the day before the cruise was over lol. When it worked it was great. A lot of the time it was useless though.",
"Used this on the voyage my brother and I took last week. It worked wonders in a number of ways, from setting event reminders to reviewing meal items ahead of time. Definitely recommended.",
So helpful while at sea! Made it easy to know what and when shows and activities are going on. Love the menu features. Love the count down to your cruise feature too.,
"Hi hi hi, can I please get an reply...  I am going on the Disney cruise in August. Just wondering... how do you chat. Does it work outside of the cruise. Thanks  Plz reply",
This was helpful with plans tho it would be nice to have the app remind you. The chat feature should alarm to new messages. We all missed messages.  Overall this was easier than carrying lots of papers all day every day,
"The concept of this app is great!  Tons of useful information and the ability to communicate with others. Unfortunately, we had huge difficulties getting it to run about half the time.",
This app was super helpful. 1. I could text my family without using my data. 2. I could see what time activities were held ( time and place). 3. I could see at what time characters would come out ( time and place). It was very useful throughout my trip. It works very well. I totally recommend it,
"Where to start. There is so much room for improvement on this app.  1st there is almost no functionality before the cruise.  Ideally, you should be able to book and reserve excursions using the app.  Not there.  The app should also run in the background and not require the app to be open for communications.  Not there.  The app should have voip, connecting to the ships phone system.  Not there.",
Great to use during our cruise..loved favorites hated that some info was blank...missing a gps feature to locate where we were on board or a simple scavenger hunt type thing to familiarize yourself with the ship..overall great app,
"Great way to see what's going on, but if your phone is on roaming the timing will be off.  That was a problem when trying to mark favorites.",
Yes the app is awesome. It let me stay in touch with my family. You just have to remember to stay in the app otherwise it says you are unavailable.,
"The app is great. It is very useful for location, activities, times, menus  or any information that you may need during your cruise.",
"The concept is great, but the app crashed multiple times and texts were delayed. Would love to see an upgraded version",
"Provide very basic time/schedule info, would expect way more to cope up with today's technology/customer expectation.",
"Handy while onboard, but wish my daily itinerary could update with port adventures, etc. Likely won't use while not on the ship.",
This app was a wasted download. It didn't even work the first 4 days of our cruise.,
"Everything that doesn't involve communicating with people works great. It's easy to check what activities are happening where and the hours for different places, including menus, when it's not crashing. Unfortunately, that's not the main purpose of the app. The main purpose is to let you communicate with others on board, and it pretty much fails at that. Firstly, the contact system. You can't search for someone's name, you have to have them give you a number and send them a text, and then you lose the number so you can't give mutual friends that person's contact info. The not having friends numbers also was a problem when the app consistently crashed and was unusable for a full day during the cruise until they told me that the only way to fix it was by deleting all the app data, including contacts, which made it a pain to find people to give me their numbers all over again. At least half of my friends had the crashing problem and had to reset the app. Also, the timestamps don't work, all the timestamps on my group texts turned into whatever time it was at the moment I was reading them. By the end of the cruise, the app also said I had my phone off whenever I wasn't in the app and wouldn't receive messages unless I opened the app. There are some major flaws with the communication but, unfortunately, you still need it if you want to communicate with anybody.",
Loved the app. One thing I would add would be ability to order room service through app and being able to add things to your reminders like private mixology class and/or ticketed princess meet and greet time.,
This app was super handy on the cruise to communicate offline. However you need to be connected to the cruise's wifi to use it which was not always reliable. overall a very good app!,
Constantly disconnects and you have to have app open to get texts...cant integrate your reservations either.,
"This app was very helpful and informative. You could check out what is going on on the ship, what time everything happens, etc. I recommend this app to anyone who plans to take a Disney Cruise.",
"Kept crashing. We just had to communicate the old fashion way, talking and leaving messages in the room.",
"The app was great for keeping track of all the activities during the cruise. However, the in-app chat didn't work properly.",
The messaging feature was slow and often text messages came LONG after it was sent... led to many issues and miscommunications.,
"We went on the Disney Fantasy for 7 days and this app was very convenient and made finding shows, activities, and other information easy. It was accurate and also provided the ability to chat with others via text.",
App sometimes won't respond till you rekick the wifi on the ship.  But when it works it's awesome.  Notifications for activities you want to do and keep in touch with the family while on board.,
It was great to keep us informed of ship activities. Detailed. Love it. The Messenger program was fantastic to communicate with other party members elsewhere on the ship.,
"The only gripe I have about the app is that from time to time, I would get logged out. So I would have to sign back in via a browser to connect to the ship's internet.",
Would get a 5 🌟 if it had sound notification instead of just vibration.  I missed several things I wanted to do on ship because it was in my pocket.,
"I love the app. It helped me know when the upcoming activites were on ship. 
You should also go on the cruise. It is so much fun. You will love it.",
Overall loved the app. Makes communicating with other passengers easy. However there is a delay in receiving messages often.,
Used this app all week to get in contact with others from our family and looked at it for upcoming activities. Loved the reminders for activities that were added to favorites!,
"Still pretty basic.  Given how key this is to the overall experience and the costs involved of such a trip, it is surprising that Disney doesn't have the app in a better state",
This app made navigating the ship easy as well as finding activities.  The only downside was it would be slow during high traffic,
Please release this app for Kindle tablets. Now that we must use it on the cruise it needs to be useable in a larger tablet format. My eyesight is poor and using this app on the phone is very difficult.,
We had a large party of 18. It would have been easier if we could have been linked all together in the beginning rather than having to link each one of us separately. Especially on a short cruise. It took to much time and than we keep having separate conversations with only some of the group included at times. Other than that it has great potential.,
It was great to see schedule and to set reminders but terrible for communication. Often shut down or had to be restarted. Very spotty.,
Known Apple issue. Poor refresh rate. Background pop ups when communications received needs work.,
The app helped me know everywhere I wanted to be on the Disney Magic.  I did not miss anything I wanted to attend.,
Works well when it workd but had connecting issues that they couldn't fix on the boat. So wasn't able to use the app for 1/3 of the trip. Needs a way to reset if issues arise while out at sea.,
I loved being able to be in contact with the other members of our party.  We had 16 of us so it made it easy to get in contact with each ther3.  As being what was going n around the ship was awesome.,
The cruise was amazing and the app was very helping on giving me updates on the activities and the location... I hope to go back soon,
"Chat feature needs a lot of work. Most messages either don't go through, or take too long to go through. Makes using the chat feature very difficult.",
Great for what they've done!  The ability to communicate with others is absolutely wonderful. Viewing all navigators up front is helpful for planning and saving favorite activities. Need the ability to see booked excursions to help plan onboard activities around them. Also would like to access stateroom charges and book tastings through the app.,
"The schedule is great, however the chat section only works half the time. Lots of failed sends or no notifications about messages.",
"This app was very helpful when I wanted to contact family members on the ship. I also loved how this app have us the schedule of activities, so we could see all of them ahead of time and choosing which ones we want to do. And I liked how it gave you the deck plans because on the first day or two, it was easy to get lost.",
"Great for activities,  but not communication. This app tells you what is going on regarding activities,  but the communication feature rarely worked.  The app was also never updated regarding news, etc.",
"App does not auto update as it's supposed too.  Same problem on three different cruises, tech guy onboard couldn't even figure it out.  Worked someday, not others.",
"Very helpful app as it allowed us to communicate with others in our group, understand the layout of the ship, look at meal menus, and much more.",
"Great app and very helpful and convenient to use, a real life saver during the cruise. HOWEVER, very glitchy. Had to constantly close and reopen. Time stamp was GMT, which was very confusing, especially when trying to find out schedules for current activities.",
"It was great to use for keeping up with activities on ship.  Terrible for communication.  Only vibrates when you get a message, there is no sound.",
"Very useful,  would like to see the app connect with my I'm board account and booked excursions and tastings and such",
"Very helpful while on the Cruise ship. Since your phone will be on airplane mode to prevent roaming charges you won't have any contact with the rest of your party but with this app you can text one another. You can also view events for the day and the following days while on board. This includes special events, restaurants, menu options, basically everything happening on the ship.",
Loved being able to quickly communicate and not carry personal phone and wave phone.  More upfront education on how to connect with others outside your room party would have been nice.,
The messaging feature was slow to deliver and often delayed by hours.  Would be nice to have the ability to review expenses.,
"App worked well when it worked, however  two days into cruise it stopped working. And would not work for reminder 5 days.",
"I only used it for the ""passive"" features, like checking schedules or deck plans or restaurant menus.  I did not use it for messaging.  So for getting information it was very good.",
This app was helpful while we were on ship.  It would have been even better if we had been able to see our scheduled activities (the stuff specific to our stateroom) and been able to book activities through it as well.,
"The app itself is great, however the ability to stay connected to WiFi on the Magic, hinders the ability to use the app. It was hard to communicate with others in the party. Sometimes we wouldn't get texts for hours.",
"When connected to ship wifi, this app constantly crashes making it nearly unusable. Terrible",
"Nice concept.  Has deck layout, activities, and port info.  The app continuously crashed throughout out our cruise and became unusable for our entire group during last full day of cruise.",
"The app is good but the countdown clock is off a day, today is 1/6/2018 and the date on the clock is 1/7/2018 and it can't be change to present, please fix this so it doesn't  confuse anyone else.  Thank you.",
Very helpful. Just wish the text received amount would show up when you see the icon rather than having to go 2 screens in to see responses.,
Once on board this app is great for communicating with others in your group.   Also this is way easier to find out about activities on the ship verses the paper navigator they give you each day.,
Major lack of features and unreliable chat service on board. Reminders shouldn't be just 15 mins prior. Calendars should be linkable. Should be able to access more info. Surprisingly poor app.,
"The app could be great.  The navigator times were off by half an hour, so we were late or missed things that we wanted to do. All other features are great.",
Great for maps and knowing activities on ship. I loved you could put activities in favorites and it would remind you,
The app is great when it works. The WiFi on the ships needs to be improved. We couldn't use the texting function for at least three days on our last week long cruise.,
"Was great to keep track of activities and remind us of what we listed as ""favorites"" to check out. It would have been nice if it connected the user's account and favorites between different devices used by the same person. For example, I couldn't see the favorites I identified on my tablet on my phone.",
It was great when it worked. It's a little laggy and sometimes didn't get the updates so the schedules were off.,
"Getting to your birthdate for chat is a pain, have to click left to go back a month at a time which for an adult is many, many clicks. Should be able to choose year independently,which is a standard calendar function. I couldn't use my swype keyboard in the chat window which was annoying. I wish everything was integrated - controlling whether you're using the ship's wifi, viewing photos from shutters, getting reminders of booked events like Palo, gingerbread making, mixology). I was on the Wonder and when we were shocked next to the Dream my app started thinking I was on that ship. Only way to fix it was to clear the app data so I lost all my favorites from the navigator. Oh! And the deck plans didn't show the laundry areas on the Wonder! Weird. Needs some work but it's better than it was 2 years ago so I'm looking forward to seeing the enhancements next time we sail.",
"I love the countdown feature before boarding the ship! Also I love that all of the info for the week is right at your fingertips so you can plan accordingly. However, the chat feature is a little bit touchy. Great app before and during your cruise!",
The communication functions is unreliable.  Notification are rare and messages are delayed.  Can't use to manage or book any activities.,
"App would be better if staff updated activity changes & if the app would make a noise when a ""text"" was sent.",
"Great app to see the activities. Chat is awesome.  But PLEASE allow family sharing and port adventures to be added. As a parent my wife and I had to plan the next day and get our apps in sync. Having a family plan would be way better. And we had excursions that ate blocks of time we couldn't select or even add manually.   Other than that, essential and great for help on a cruise.",
Quit working after day 3 on cruise.  Had to get it reset and then lost all contacts.  There were 11 people on our contact list.  Many times messages would not go through.   Heard they are getting an updated system February 2018.,
Useful time saver during entire cruise. Automatically updated each day. Character locations  menu previews texting  and other attributes made this our go to planner each day.  No glitches on our samsung 7s. Fully functional well designed app that performs well once on board.,
"Good start, but needs more development. Freezes up constantly, can't pull your dinner/excursion info, and i would have liked to access the schedule after we got off the boat",
This app came in so handy on our recent cruise. The messaging feature is especially helpful. A great tool to make your Disney cruise even better.,
Great concept but app was unstable and useless.  Text messages were not always received.  Had to keep resetting the app.,
This app is great in theory but it crashes so often it's almost useless. When it's not crashing it's great but it crashes multiple times a day.,
"Crashes often and messages often take hours to get through, often needing cycling of Wi-Fi or restarting app.",
"When the app works it is very helpful.  Unfortunately it locked up over 50% of the time. All 5 in our group  experienced this problem. After the day 3, most stop using the app. Not what what you expect from a Disney product.",
"Very easy to use on the Disney Fantasy. Helped with keeping track of events, activities, and to check evening menus at the main restaurants.  And especially, finding out where places were on the ship!",
"The app did not consistently work on our cruise on the Fantasy in Dec. 2017. It would not load properly, texting family did not always work and the app would crash. When it works properly it is great.",
It worked great for the most part. A few times my messages wouldn't send but it was definitely a great app to Have!,
App does not sync with Disney website. So none of your scheduled excursions or activities are on it when you open it on the ship. Freezes often. Gave up using it after 2 days. Did not match onboard ship activities or paper Navigator schedule of activities...,
"This app really helped me every step of the way once onboard the ship.  It kept me up to speed with all the activities. It had information about how and where to disembark the ship for excursions, and it even had the menu for each meal everyday. And most importantly it helped my family and I communicate on the ship.  This was an amazing app. I'll miss using it. :-)",
Works onboard ship only and allows communication between your party. Very helpful to keep up on current and future events,
This app shows the deck plans and what food options but the chat function is horrible you can't reach people that is are in your party and sometimes it doesn't work at all,
"Invaluable app during our cruise to communicate with all onboard family members and mark favorite events (for push reminders). Can be a bit delayed/slow at times, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",
did not work for 2 days... star wars and private island- prob the 2 most impt for scheduling and planning among our group!! otherwise great,
"Great app! Easy to navigate all the ships activities. Used the ship map often for directions. We enjoyed viewing the dinner menu prior to going to the restaurant, so we were ready to order as soon as we were seated. Especially with the later dining time.",
I loved it. I could communicate with my family even If we were across the ship on different levels. I would highly recommend getting this app before your cruise. It was a great experience the first Disney Cruise I went on but the last time was even better because I installed this app.,
"Great app for knowing activities, dining, shows, and all sorts of information to help you navigate the ship. Having chat is especially nice.",
"This app was perfect for us to keep up with our kids on the cruise. We were able to enjoy our vacation worry free. The app also provided important information about activities, schedules, dining options, and navigation on the ship.",
"A must have. This app is easy to use, great to keep in touch with the whole family on board, gives you all the info needed regarding shows, character appearances  and everything regarding schedule times and changes on itinerary including wheather.",
"Expected so much better...  The app hangs and crashes constantly. Does not work when you need it to, and drains your battery faster than constant netflix with no Wi-Fi.",
"Fantastic app. The only improvement we would suggest is the ability to view ticketed experiences, as well. We booked a few tastings and also a few ticketed character experiences and it would have been helpful to see them on the app. Other than that...loved this app.",
"Overall, this was a great app to keep in touch with my party. It was fairly easy to navigate. One suggestion I do have, please create a search bar to make it easier to find information.",
Overall the app was pretty good but it kept crashing or glitching.  The chat worked pretty well but would like more emoji.  Also a call feature is really needed! Also you need to be able to send photos through the app because it would be very helpful when giving someone directions to where you are. I would give this a five star except it would not let me text the other people in my stateroom whenever it crashed bit it kept crashing not allowing me to text them.  Also the app would become disconnected from the wifi and not let me send any texts,
It is a great general ship app... would be nice to personalize it more per room. Such as have account info dinner time reminders with events that relate to your sitting time for dinner reminders. Interactive map with quick links like the one Disney has developed with their parks.,
"This was a super way to keep informed of all the daily info without needing a paper itinerary to keep track of, as well as keeping track of messages from others in your party.",
Works great when connected.  Crashes and had to reset several times a day to make it usable.,
Text feature MUST be updated with a ringtone. Missed many messages because only vibrates. Had to reconnect to WiFi occasionally. Schedule is great.,
"Great tool to use on the ship. Texting made it easy to stay in touch with my family but it only worked in the hot spots on the ship, so some messages were not received. Used it to plan the day each day!",
"4 stars because it was so helpful and convenient. The 5th star would've been earned if the app provided ship's current time. With all the time chances on our cruise, having current ship time would've been the icing on the cake.",
It worked for my vacation but the auto correct didn't really work and I would have wished that you could have sent photos but otherwise it worked,
"While able to chat with each other, we were not able to chat with another person to help him out, as he was new to the ship. There was no ""send"" button.  Otherwise it was very useful.",
"Just returned from a 5-day cruise. Used this app extensively to communicate with my child (12 yo) while on board, and as a single parent, was very comfortable with how it worked for us. As other reviewers suggested, a locator would be a nice feature to have. No signal problems, but the time did reset on day 4 for some reason, must have been a setting that was changing it.",
"Great for keeping in touch on board. Occasionally, messages would not send. Probably related to signal strength than the app not functioning.",
The app should have a more Disney magical countdown. It would also be more helpful if there were reminder alerts for your booked activities and if you could check your onboard account balances.,
It has a lot of potential. But it crashed a lot for Apple users on our cruise and didnt load updates a lot this week on Android phones,
"Useful features, but it crashes A LOT and staying connected to the ships wifi is problematic.",
This app was great and had a lot of helpful information while on the cruise.  We really enjoyed the fact that we could communicate via text with each other.,
"Like that we can countdown to trip. Is very useful on board with maps, menus and schedules. You can msg each other but tends to be delayed if ap isnt open by all parties  when msgs are sent.",
"Great source to keep cruisers in the know! Love the breakdown of meals, shopping, activities and character visits.",
Found the app to be very helpful.  Almost made the Daily Navigator obsolete.  Two wishes. Easier setting of birthdate.  Had to uninstall and redo to get unstuck from the wrong-and took a ton of scrolling.  Also wish that we could get notifications when cruisemates text us.,
"I would like to have seen all the guests names on the chat, on the other confirmation numbers without having to add each one separately.  I would also like to be able to work on my reservation before the cruise on here.",
I think it's super addition to the app would be to be able to track if my child is in kids club or not via the app.,
"It was very useful. It helped keep up with activities, dinner, lunch, and character appearances. Easy to read and understand. We can't wait for our next family adventure!",
"The app makes it easy to txt other members in your party, keep up with daily schedule (including marking favorites) and is great for reviewing dinner menu in advance.  A must for cruises.",
It was great to use.  Easy to find things and communicate with the family and others.   A must have for your Disney Cruise 😃,
"Great app for information purposes during our cruise. The chat never worked though, we didn't really need it that much thankfully.",
"This app was very nice and had everything you needed on it, but unfortunately it wouldn't let me use the texting feature. Overall it was amazing.",
"Love it!  I loved being able to have the schedule for the day easily accessible and to be able to see the location on the ship.  Also, being able to see the menus to prepare ahead of dinner was also fantastic.",
Perfect tool to navigate the ship.  All times and events are correct.  So get to all events and signings early.  And you'll always get a spot.,
Great app to keep up with shows. Had issues with the communication portion.  Half the time the messages didn't go through.,
"Not a bad app but has much room for improvement. Sound notifications would be a big plusVoIP would also be nice. I also wish they would add a search bar in the events area, it would be better than scrolling through very event. I did use it everyday and found it very useful",
"Plane and simple,  it was a good send app. Only thing that it needs is sound for texts.",
It froze up a ton and text messaging only worked for the first couple days.  Great for checking activities though and you'll still need the wave phone for oceaneer club and nursery communications.,
"Convenient to view your navigator, less convenient to communicate with your family. Would send messages that were never received until much later. Sometimes a full day later.",
Overall a fantastic app. I used it every day while onboard for activities and communicating with my family. I would love to be able to book nursery services thru the app and order room service. Hopefully in a future update!,
Hey all just got off the boat today!!!! Did a seven day cruise and this lil app was amazing. It helped with meals and to navigate the ship. I didn't use the text part because I had walkie talkies but this app was a hit,
This was great for planning daily activities. As a communication tool it was mediocre and we missed meassages regularly.,
"This was a great app, I was very confused with the time zone while on the cruise, it wouldn't hurt to add the current ship's time somewhere",
"Most of it was very good. The main problem was the text mesg. Mesg would not go out for a few minutes, they would end up in the wrong order in the app, the app would show the other party off line when they were not, it would not show as read when it had been read.",
Great to check day's events and favorites but message component inconsistent at best.,
"This app is very helpful on ship, but the communicator portion doesn't update like it should. But for maps and finding what's going on it is great.",
"The app is highly useful when it works.  However, it freezes multiple times in a row and sometimes refuses to load fully in multiple tries.  It's a pity because if the app was more reliable it would be an awesome tool.",
"Incredibly useful app for your Disney Cruise! A word of warning: sometimes the daily paper navigator will have different times and locations, and usually the paper version is correct. Otherwise, it is so wonderful for looking up menus, and setting reminders for all the activities.",
Great app on board the ship but it will be best if we were able to use before to coordinate activities and schedule of shoes or character meetings.,
It's great you can talk to people and you do not have to get your paper navigator,
It is a Great connection tool but it still needs some work. Msgs were often delayed but still a huge improvement from the in cabin phones from before. The daily navigator paper copy was still nice to have in addition.,
This app worked great for a few members of our party and then consistently locked up for a few others. Texts could also be delayed by 30 minutes sometimes too. Other than the locking up we liked it.,
"So helpful, some glitches, but nothing you can't work around while on vacation",
Only complaint is that it delayed chat messages often and sometimes by 30 minutes to an hour.,
"Helpful at narrowing down the large list of daily activities to show only those which interest you.  Also, nice for taking a look at the dinner menus earlier in the day and getting your tastes buds ready!",
"Loved this app! Didn't have it on our 1st Disney cruise, so it was wonderful knowing when and what was going on the ship, at all times, without have to carry around the navigator!",
Great source of information; texts were delivered slow...wave phones provided may be better communication for group.,
Very helpful.  Had a bit of an issue but on board staff reset and we were up and running again.,
Excellent app u won't miss a thing.. the communication between others and all the shows are up to date great app. Enjoy ur cruise ❤,
"App was fabulous for our recent cruise. We could communicate via text with friends we cruised with, and kids club. Loved being able to ""star"" activities we were excited about, and get reminders before they started.",
Love that we can see everything going on at a glance while onboard. It's great that the app has a texting feature.,
The chat was worthless send message and they get next day to a few hours later.,
The messages don't load unless you're in the app and don't give notifications,
Chat capability was useless.  Both parties had to be in that part of the app for it to work,
Love it! It comes in so handy on the cruise because 1. I hate carrying around the paper navigators and 2. The chatting I'd crucial to keeping up with family and friends on the cruise!,
"The app is great for planning activities and events as well as chatting on board with other users.   To reach 5 stars... the addition of a live tracker/mapping for current sailing position, speed, etc. would be fantastic!",
"Was such a great tool on board! Staying in touch with family members, looking at menus, viewing the schedule anytime... I used it so many times! Loved it!",
"Freezes up and frequently disconnects from ship WiFi. When it worked, it was helpful, but I usually found it frustrating.",
sometimes messages took a long time to appear and sometimes the app would suddenly stop.,
"Great for planning your day, but not so good for communicating... Texts often delayed.",
This was extremely helpful app while on the cruise.  It was a wealth of information at your fingertips and also allowed my group to communicate freely,
"Extremely helpful! Kept us updated and in touch with each other via chat, schedules, maps, and character appearances. A must have before sailing.",
"My app crashed at least 2 times, and 3 other times it had to be cleared of data and cache- meaning we had to reenter chat numbers each time.  When it worked, I liked it.",
"App is great, but the reliability of it on the ship is poor so it makes it far less useful.",
"Liked the app really well but don't like how it's completely useless when not on the cruise. Would like to look ahead and back at our itinerary, menus, and so forth.",
Such a huge help in keeping track of others on the cruise and all events.,
This was great on board although slow with updates. As always disney programs just are lacking.,
Very flaky app that froze at least once a day while on our cruise.,
Most helpful! We were able to text on the app and stay connected with our party. I even love the Disney emoticons. Great touch!,
Bout the only  communications u will hav sumtimes useful but sum phones it doesn't work well with,
on board chat did not always work.  That was really the only issue.,
This app was the best way for me to stay connected to what was going on while on the ship.  Making plans for myself and my kids was easy.  Also messaging my family and the large group of friends we were sailing with was fantastic!,
"App didn't work properly, couldn't use chat feature.  I wish app would have a clock that showed current ship time.",
Great way to find your way around the ship and time of shows and outlets. One add would be to be able to upload our itinerary.,
We loved this app! Easy to communicate with family on the ship! The only thing that we wished the app had was access to look up the balance and/or charges on our room! We also wished that the ship offered a drink package for bar drinks for the adult cruises!,
This is a great app to know whats going on and where. Also no one in the party got lost cause we had constant communication with each other!,
"Excellent for activities and maps once onboard. Only downfall, Communication texts with family 20 min lag time.",
I loved it because it was so fun. And you can text your friends and family and tell them where you are and I expectly loved the Disney emojis,
"This app is a must-have for your cruise! Maps of the boat, locations and times of on-board activities, restaurant info, and of course the on-board chat feature. We would have been so lost without the chat feature that allowed us to stay in touch with our entire party anywhere on the ship!",
Loved this app!!  I was able to see what the dinner menu was ahead of time.  It told you about the weather.  I referred to it the whole cruise.,
That apps chat function is handy for communicating with your family when at sea...when it works but it is NOT reliable.,
I basically was every information I needed to know about the day's events in one perfect little app plus you get to communicate with family,
This app was great! We used it to keep track of events and the schedule. It reminded us which show we wanted to go to. And it was great for keeping up with a couple of very active teenagers. The texting feature is the best part about it!,
"great app, wish It would let you know when the messages arrived if you are not in the app, and a new way to select DOB would be awesome.",
Awesome app allowed me to keep in touch with the kids on board and provided list of activities and time frames accurately.,
It's a good app to communicate with people and to see time of stuff on the boat when you go off their Wi-Fi though you cannot use it,
This was great to see what activities were available. Also a helpful way to stay in touch  with family members.  Loved the app.,
Kept crashing on galaxy s7 edge. Notifications on chat were often delayed.,
"App was great for activities, but the texting was really delayed for some reason.",
The texting on the cruise only worked half the time. Wasn't super helpful.,
Would have given 4 stars but messaging didn't work,
Great app onboard a great cruise! App is exponentially better designed and easier to read/understand than the paper daily Navigator. Constantly updates throughout the day for what is next at that time rather than scroll from the beginning each time!,
really good for talking to our group. saw schedules of upcoming events but would like it if it showed our booked events,
"Overall,  it  was very useful.  It would be better if you could type in your date of birth instead of having to swipe. Other than that,  the app is great.",
"I liked the app, I just found descriptions of some of the activities to be a little vague...",
"This Disney information is very nice, but the texting application is extremely unreliable, to the point we rarely used it. That was the piece we would have used most with a large group.",
"Great on ship to check navigator, but usually wouldnt get notified of messages from others in my group.",
"Helpful app for keeping in touch with family members, but a bit buggy and comboresome to use.",
This app was very helpful for information on planning your day. It was also great for keeping in contact with each other. Love it!,
"Good app. Was great to be able to stay in touch with family members and to see daily schedules, dinner menus, etc. Would love if they added a feature to be able to look up future cruise itineraries while on board.",
"Good: maps, info. Bad: messaging unreliable. Not linked to personal itinerary",
"Easy to use! Reminds you of upcoming events, so you don't miss a thing! Good at keeping you in touch with other members of your party too. 👍",
"Did not consistently work for sending messages, but good for knowing what was going on.",
Good app not as complete for activities as I would like and I had trouble setting favorites,
"The map function was good, but the communication part of the app proved to be very unreliable, we ended up having to carry around the wave phones instead.",
This app made our trip so convenient and allowed us to get the most out of our cruise and it's activities,
Worked great for me but my wife was unable to get the chat features to work while on board,
This was the best thing ever to keep up with everyone on the ship and to plan the day for Everyone!,
"At times, there were long delays for the recipient in getting the text messages otherwise the app was very useful.",
Great app allowed me to share info with 8 retirees on our Western 7 day Cruise. Dinner info great! Loved the welcome each day and the island info. Show details were great. Meet and greets fantastic!!! Thank You ~ The Disney Sistas👍👏,
Overall a good app.  Would be great if there was a location map showing where the ship is located at any given time.,
Texting functionality did not work reliably and app crashed a lot.,
I loved using the chat feature to keep in contact with all of our group. The emojis were great too.,
It was great to text and keep in contact with the rest of the family! Notifications are great too...just make sure you turn them on!,
Loved having this to keep up with all the activities on board. Deck plans are very helpful as well. Great to communicate with others in the party.,
Great app for use while aboard the ship.  Would love to see more options when at home prior to the start of the cruise.,
Good app lets you communicate with your party instantly on ship. Wish it would allow for the exchange of pictures.,
Awesome app. Worked great to see what was going on each day. And keep in contact with family members and new friends on the cruise.,
Kept our party of 8 in communication out at sea and it was nice having a schedule at our fingertips.,
"Needs better way to add activities to an agenda for the day/week, not just favorite s..",
Functions are great onboard but app freezes frequently.  Disney should fix.,
"VERY useful, easy to communicate with my family, without the extra cost, and I loved the disney emojis :)",
With so many activities going on the ship this is a great app to keep track of them and the members I. Your party.,
"Used to love this in the past however on our recent Cruise the app kept freezing and locking up, and text messages would take hours to get delivered",
"Great to use on the cruise.  Use the favorites option to bookmark upcoming activities including shows, character appearances, etc.",
app very helpful while onboard the Disney Wonder.  Didn't have to carry around the paper Navigator. Easy to use.,
"Loved information on activities & menus. However, chat was spotty & unreliable.",
Super glad they have this app.  It really helped me connect with my teen daughter.,
"Great, but can be better for organizing by multiple filters at once rather than a single filter.",
Loved it. Provided me with exactly what I needed. I think we used it most a preview of what was going to be on the dinner menu.,
Very helpful while on the cruise. Makes it so easy to communicate with family in our group while on the ship. Loved the emojis.,
My only complaint is that it won't alert you when someone texts you.,
"It seemed like my battery ran down really fast & this app was the only thing running ... There were some odd things about the chat feature - the time shown was not the time the message was sent ... Someone on the ship's crew mentioned creating a personal itinerary on the app - that would have been helpful, but did not appear to be available",
"Received a message that the cruise fare includes a hopper ticket to the parks, after 45 minutes in guest services line got sent to port adventures, which had closed much earlier. A sign posted to see guest services.  Visited guest services once more, just to find out that it is not being offered... wasted time off my cruise waiting in lines to get nowhere. If there is no such item offered maybe hold back on notification...",
"with all that Disney can do technology wise, this app seems like an afterthought.   Basic functionality, when it works.  Disney does a lot right so why not this app?",
Very buggy when using the chat feature. It kept freezing and crashing.,
"Messaging is delayed at best and unreliable at worst. Need to integrate with Oceaneers lab so that state room devices do not have to be carried around also. Ship map, activities favorites, and schedules are great.",
Didn't work on wife's phone. S7. My note 8 worked half the time,
The chat feature was spotty. Good to see and plan activities.,
"Very helpful for looking up events and other information, as well as for keeping in touch with others on board.",
Great way to find what is going on during your cruise and fun for counting down till you go.,
Chat was unreliable... Notifications appeared hours after message sent.,
It was great but I had so many problems texting on the ocean!,
It would be helpful to implement the onboard chat with the possibility of voice calls.,
Chat function was unreliable at best. Not a Disney quality product.,
Great communication tool. Used it to favorite activities each day and to check dinner menus. Definitely recommend getting this app!,
"Worked great for tracking events and activities scheduled, but the ""chat""  messaging aspect was inconsistent and would not connect at time to receive messages from others.",
This app was a great way to keep up with everyone in our party. It was also a great way to keep up with all the activities on the boat.,
The messaging did not work well but  otherwise it worked well,
Essential app if you are going on a Disney cruise. Good information and great tool for communicating on the ship.,
"This app was everything! !! It helped us communicate with each other, alerted us on our favorite activities, and kept us on schedule!",
Love the app. Easy to use and very helpful with keeping in touch with family and knowing what activities were happening.,
Easier to keep in touch with others in our party. Kept us up-to-date on shipboard events.,
Does not give specifics about your excursions or shipboard account.,
Amazing it really helped when everyone was apart all doing their on thing.,
"On the RARE occasion the ship's Wi-Fi ACTUALLY WORKS, the app was useful.",
"This is such a great  app, I went on a Disney cruise with my family and I could text and see what was going on  in the ship!",
The alerts were great so you didn't miss the events you wanted to go to.,
"I loved this app! Easy to use, great to plan my day! And the chat fx was ingenious!",
"It's useful and informative, but chat messages are usually not delivered on time.",
This was a great way to keep up with what's going on. It was easy to use. Great job!,
We just finished using this for our Disney Magic cruise. This was very handy and kept us in the know about what was happening where and when. Easy to use and worked perfectly during our entire trip. No app crashes! Love Disney!!!,
I love this app!!! I have been on 11 disney cruises and love to see how many days are left its awesome,
Very useful to see what's on the DCL Ships and plan out your day while on the ship.,
"App was great, but the on-board messaging feature is not ready for prime time.  I'm surprised that Disney allowed it to be used, unless they are trying to test it.  More than 50% of the messages our family sent were not received for 8 to12 hours (both Android and Apple devices).  The rest of the features were top notch!  Every character appearance and event was updated and accurate.  Made the cruise activities easy!",
This app was extremely helpful on the ship!!! So much more detailed then the navagatior you get in the morning,
"This app was extremely useful for planning daily activities, but the menus weren't updated",
"This app was very useful while on board the ship, will definitely use it again.",
This app was so use full it made things so much more easier,
Very helpful but don't like that app has to be open for you to receive messages.,
That app was not very good with the onboard chat notification.,
Loved the emojis! Liked this better than using the wave phones.,
Easy way to know what's going on each day on the ship and wear!,
It was easy to use on the trip. Didn't have to carry around the navigator paper version.,
"Great way to stay abreast of the activities on board, and also stay in touch with your family & friends on board. Great app!",
We just loved the navigator app as it supplied you what was on daily also listing the menus at the restuarants.,
It was amazing for planning all our onboard activities and to keep in contact with friends and family on board.,
It was great  to keep in touch with the people in your group. And it showed all the activities and menu,
Did Not work for texting most of the time.  Waste of time.,
loved the convenience of having all information and messaging in one place!!!  The Disney emojis in messaging are the best!!,
Besides freezing occasionally it was really helpful during our cruise,
The app is an overall success for me and my family but I wish they would let us have the emojis from the text part of the app on our regular phone messaging.,
"Very useful.  It help us keep up with the ports, shows and all the characters.",
"This app was very helpful with ship info,activities,send txt messages to family who is on the ship with you!",
It only did vibration for notification but other than that the app was amazing,
Kept freezing and crashing And not user friendly,
"It didn't work have the time, great idea but doesn't work",
"Great idea and execution for deck maps, activity schedules and ship announcements but messages are not always sent reliably which could be a wifi issue vs an app issue",
Great. We'll organize. Very helpful. You need it but it makes things easy...,
"Real time information, absolutely love this app, I used in my cruise all the time 😍",
Works well and the notifications are really helpful so you don't miss an event that you really wanted to go to!,
GREAT app for both parents & kids.  Especially Onboard Chat texting feature.,
It would be nice if it showed the events you signed up for that may not be public.,
This app was easy to use and helped us to know what activities were available. It was fantastic!,
Texting doesn't work much of the time. Useless.,
Works wonders!  Great asset to have while on the ship and the Castaway Cay!!  Will use this every time I cruise Disney!,
"Helpful for when I want something to do, or need to find somewhere on the boat!",
loved it! I was able to communicate with all my family members on the cruise.,
This app is awesome I would give it a 5 🌟 rating any time that's how good this app is 😊😁❣,
Texting on our deck 8 didn't work well but the app was very helpful overall,
Loved the app super helpful on the Disney ships. A must have if you cruise with Disney.,
Easy to use and loved being able to stay in touch with my family while in the ship and at Castaway Cay!,
A must have if you are in a group.  Text capability is great.  Loved this app.,
Perfect to get info about events in the ship and keep up with family! Super handy.,
Was not working well this cruise. Didn't have problems in the previous cruises,
Best app ever! Helped us meet all of the characters and remimded us when certain activities were happening,
Love this app i had the time of  my lifeon the trip! it  was helpful On the cruise! ⛴🛳,
Very easy to use. It made scheduling meet and greets with characters much easier.,

I like this app for quick checking of the ship schedual and keeping in touch with others on the ship.,
Amazing. So helpful throughout the trip. Used it everyday. Didn't want to delete after the trip was over.,
Was a little buggy with communication but still great over all.,
It was very helpful for my wife and I to use on our honeymoon.,
"Useful for maps of ship, also could carry instead of wave phone.",
"It should have real time info for speed, location and weather",
Very helpful when it comes to knowing daily activities and staying in touch with your family.,
"Good app, wish it would give the full weather forecast for the day.",
This app is very useful. Wish it was  customizable to show the activities and reservations specific to our accounts.,
Would be excellent if you you could get audible notifications from messaging feature.,
Used the app extensively on our last cruise. Definately allowed us to maximize our time on board.,
Excellent for knowing all the activities going on around the ship. A must have 😊,
Very easy to use. Kept us informed what was going on during our time onboard.,
Was super helpful. Please incorporate calendar option for excursion and mixology type events.,
"Buggy, but a good pocket schedule and menu when you're on your cruise.",
Too buggy. It kept crashing particularly with the chat,
Loved the app for info. But I couldn't text from my Droid.,
Good but wish you could integrate your own schedule with the app.,
"Perfect way to keep track of daily activities, character appearances and restaurant menus.",
Great for communicating with family. Also liked the map of ship feature. All features great for cruise.,
A must have on the ship! Keeps you informed on everything that's happening (and that's a lot!) and when and where.,
Problems with oreo. Battery optimization in oreo kills the messaging service in the background.,
App is perfect for Trips! Gives you full schedules events and location!!,
Great for a big family who don't all want to do the same thing.,
Loved being able to keep in touch with family on the cruise! Worked perfectly!,
This app helped us throughout our cruise with all the latest information.,
Messaging needs some work. Other than that a good source of info.,
"Being able to communicate onboard without having to purchase a data plan.....  magical!  Also very informative for events,  schedules,  dinner menus etc...  Disney rocks!!!",
Text were very buggy.. Had resign to wifi everytime to use it.. No info on weather (updates) or map location.,
It freezes sometimes but other than that its fine,
It was good to see the schedule but the chat feature did not work well,
Easy to use and very helpful when trying to keep track and plan  activities.,

Very helpful app while we were on the Dream. Always aware of activities and menus,
Good app just wish chat alerts would update sooner and more consistently.,
App did not work most of the time,
Easy to use. Fabulous way to keep up with everything happening on the ship.,
Using this app was easy and made it easy to contact other members of our family.,
Lost ability to group chat half way thru the cruise,
I think it oils a little budgie but not bad,
Great to keep track of activities going on as well as chat with friends,
It was a fantastic way to navigate events and activities on the ship and communication with other guests,
Kept us connected at all times to meet up for your spectacular adventures,

The messaging did not work.,
Chat feature never worked correctly.,
Great app until last day it moved too far ahead and thought our trip was over,
"Loved this app,we were able to stay in touch aboard ship and knew what our plans were and our meal menus!",
It was great I just wish I was able to call and send pictures,
Not enough settings for alerts.,
Love the count down.  Wish it would signal you when you receive a text.,
This app was a real lifesaver to help our family stay in touch! Really loved it! Wish I could keep the emojis!,
It has some limitations and some serious bugs regarding large linked parties. For example after your chat history gets to a certain length the app needs to be reset forcing you to add everyone again and erases chat history. It also does not automatically add linked reservations members. When we travle we often have 8 state rooms 2 adults each. Adding and reading people to chat is a pain. I would rate the app lower but it has no competition so what are you going to do ;),
"Would not try a cruise without this app, loved it.",
Was very useful while on the cruise.  Loved it!,
I love the app because you can chat with people you know and and it gives a lot of information,
Kept crashing or wasn't working during the trip,
"Wonderful tool to have, it helped the family all the time.",
Constant need to reconnect. Had to 'clear' and register once as well. Needs audible alerts.,
Great App to track all on-board ship activities.,

"Very convenient,  accurate and easy to use!  Loved it!",
Keeps you very informed with what's going on the ship!,
A wonderful guide on the ship. Great countdown clock.,

Great for what is going on. Texting nearly worthless,
"This was super useful during our vacation! I used it for everything...schedule, map, chat, reminders!!",
"Best parts are texting, and events & movies and live stage",
Very glitchy and slow. Messanger rarely works.,
We were 12 and it was really helpful keeping in touch with everyone.,
Very helpful with staying connected and reminders of events throughout the ship!,
Great app -- indispensible while on the boat!,
Good app but there were glitches in the message portion.,
Great way to communicate with your family and friends.  Easy to use,
Works great on apples ios blows up frequently on android.,
Loved it!  Kept us up to date with just about everything on the ship!,
This app was very helpful when I got lost on the ship.,
This works well for other stuff but when you are trying to text someone it can run slow and get a message from hours ago,
Very helpful in keeping me on schedule. Loved the convenience.,
"I am so gratefull i had a way to talk to my family for free on the boat , thank you disney",
Was ok but didn't help us as much as I hoped it would.,
Kept shutting down and unless you were holding it in your hand you did not get alerts that someone sent you a message because it only vibrates,
Very easy to use and it was better than carrying papers around.,
It's a great app!! U don't even need wifi or data connection. 👍,
Loved it!  Just one more way Disney proves that it is exemplary!!!,
App could be better. It is useful if wifi was better on ship.,
Very good app.  Makes knowing what is going on on the ship easy,
The cruise app was awesome and it had everything I needed.,

Texting fellow travelers needs to have alarm for more than a second,

It was a good way to keep track of events.,
Perfect way to communicate with the kiddos while cruising!,
Great for keeping up with activities and show times!,
Invaluable in keeping up with our family on our trip!,
Group chat always fails.,
The app once on the boat is a lifesaver,
Did not include individual activities,
I really helped with the youth activities,
Very useful on our recent Disney cruise.,
A must have on a Disney Cruise!,
The app was great for the activities and guest to guest communication.,

Balls to the wall,
It sucked,
It is an app,
Ok,
Grate,
Ok,
Great way to stay connected with family when airplane mode is on. Also gives complete listing and times of all ship activities as well as maps of ship levels.,
"The app is well designed and easy to use.  I did experience some issues where the app would lose connectivity and some messages were not delivered.  Restarting the app would resolve the problem, but in some cases this delayed message delivery by over an hour.",
"Cool app! Wishing to add a feature where it tells you if time of the Activity is already overlapping to the ome you previously faveorited. More free MB for wifi as well in the future, if possible, like 50 each day.",
"A very useful app for finding out daily activites, location hours, dinner menus and communicating with others on the ship!. Don't sail a Disney Cruise without it.",
Loved the app. Would love location finder to be added if possible.  But it was a great tool.,
Had a wonderful time. This app helped me keep in contact with my family.,
"This was my first Disney cruise, and i absolutely loved it. I am so ready to cruise with Disney again. It was truly magical in every way. With that being said. See ya real soon!!!!!!..",
Thanks now it works following the latest update,
It is cool,
"The on board schedule works OK, but frequently is missing events, and occasionally the wrong time. While the on board messaging feature sounds like a great replacement to T9 texting on the wave phones, the messages take hours to go through. It is much faster to message with Facebook messenger and an internet package than to message on the ship's free wifi and the cruise line app.",
"The app is wonderful on the ship.  It was easy to look at the menus,  times and things to do on board. However I had trouble with the chat head actually receiving messages. Sometimes they would come in sometimes they wouldn't. The Tech Guy on the ship couldn't really help he suggested resetting the app which meant I would lose all of my chat friends numbers and I had no way of getting them back unless I would run into them on the ship. That part was not so user-friendly.",
"We always knew what was going on around the ship and we love checking the countdown. The dinner menu feature was great. We knew what we were ordering before we got to our table and that saved time. It was great to be able to chat w the kids while they were in the clubs and we were on the adult side. It was super easy keeping track of things we wanted to do under the Favorites section. I wish it kept track off shore excursions scheduled and onboard reservations, such as the spa, Palo or Remy, Princess appearances which you have to get tickets for, etc etc.",
While on the ship the app is billed as a way to communicate. This is an ineffective app for communication. The app gets knocked off the ship's WiFi every 3 - 4 minutes after you open it to see if there are incoming messages. If a bit frustrating to have to log in so frequently.,
"It is perfect with 2 minor exceptions.  One, the character appearances are not linked through the main page for them you have any go into the activities page and two the uses between cruises should be improved as as of right now you can only set up a countdown to the next cruise.",
App was good for information and communication when it worked. The app consistently froze or would fail to load for all 6 members of our party. Even afyer a phone restart the app still wouldnt work. The chat function also had errors such as not send messages to all recipents and creating wrong timestamps.,
"Bad for communication, good for schedules-  We loved this app for making our daily schedules and knowing when everything happens during the day. Very convenient.  However, we had problems with the onboard chat feature and couldn't depend on it between our 11 family members.  People would not receive, and/or the texts would go through hours after originally sent.  Extremely frustrating.",
was amazing for keeping track of ship activities and where character meetings.  the text part was spotty.  worked great if phone and apps where open.  if phone was in standby it'd take hours for the messages to come through.  please fix the notification of messages,
"Used to love this app but the 1.6.2 update has killed the entire thing and now all I get is an error message the ""unfortunately, disney cruise has stopped working"" and it won't start at all.  I was looking forward to using it this weekend but I guess now we will have to rely on the paper schedules. :-(",
Loved using this on our cruise. We were able to text friends so easily. And we knew when all the characters were going to be out,
Was a very useful app but onboard chat didn't really work.  I only got half of the messages that were sent to me which isn't good when kids are on the kids club.,
This was very useful bit I had to add wifi on my phone for the text messaging part of the ap to work more consistently.,
I loved the on board chat option because it made keeping in touch easy and convenient.  I didn't have to carry around the daily navigator because it was on my phone.,
Great for use on board the ship.  Love the ability to text through the app.  I like this option much better than the wave phones.,
Overall the app is pretty good and is useful during your cruise.  I'd like to see future upgrades allow which allow you to sign in so you can pull more specific updates about your itinerary.,
"All the older phones cannot run the app after your latest update. And we cannot even downgrade to an earlier version that we know worked perfectly on our last cruise.  ""For a more magical experience upgrade to the latest version!"" Thanks for the magic! How do you keep your jobs.?",
Very helpful with managing activities.  Not the best for communicating though.  Sometimes it took 30 min for a message to get through.,
"Can't even launch app. When opening, I receive error: Unfortunately , Disney Cruise has stopped. Other reviews suggest this is a problem, with v1.6.2 on the android platform .",
Darn thing is super buggy. The way Disney regulates WiFi makes provisioning the app very hard.,
"Great app, when our walkie talkies were not working we communicated through app. Always aware of activities, easy to navigate!",
Very helpful to keep up with all activities going on around the ship.  Loved being able to chat with other guests in our party.,
App frequently freezes and messages don't always go though or are received in a timely fashion that would allow meeting up for activities possible,
Made finding & managing activities easy. The menus helped us plan for dinner and made ordering a quicker process. (This was especially helpful with little ones!) Loved the Disney emojis in the chat; the app made communicating easier. Very helpful and informative in all areas. Definitely enhanced the trip!,
"A little clunky.  Once we got the hang of it, it was useful.  The activities section is not easy to navigate, better to just use the paper sheet they give you everyday with all the activities.",
The ship is big but with app you can always know what's going on and where to go. The character location tool is awesome,
"For daily activities, the app was awesome but everyone in our party had trouble with the text messaging. Messages were sometimes delivered hours after they were sent, making it difficult to coordinate plans.",
Didn't work half the time I could not see my itinerary not what I expected from Disney,
App is fun for the countdown to cruise. After you board the ship it's a must have. Everything going on onboard and useful layouts of the ship. If you cruise with Disney you need it!!,
This app tells you everything you need to know & helps you keep in touch with your family too. Super convenient.,
"The app was so helpful when communicating on the ship and seeing the events for each night! When I tried to start chatting on the 1st night it was giving me a hard time, the birthday option would not gi beyond 2004 so I had to go to guest services! And it would be nice to be able to register for events via the app I spent wayyy too much time in the GS line this cruise",
"Great app. Let's you know where and when everything is on the ship. The chat part of the app is a little glichy when someone messages you. Doesn't seem to notify you until you open the app again! Regardless of that small issue, it's great!",
Glitchy because messages don't always show up. Otherwise really useful!,
Liked having a list of all the ships activities at my finger tip and loved being able to chat with members of my travel party.,
This App totally took the place of the   published Navigator provided in our stateroom and was available  in my pocket all the time. Especially nice was it provided full dinner menus.,
Absolutely essential for a Disney cruise. You don't need to buy the wifi. It gives you notifications and shows maps.,
It has stopped working ever since the update. I was using the countdown to my cruise feature and am leaving in 2 weeks. I have tried to uninstall and install 3 times. Won't work anymore.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!,
This app does not work at all when updated to version 1.6.2  please fix it.,
"Because this was the first time I sailed the Disney cruise line, this app was a fabulous tool! We were able to keep up with what was happening and going on outside of what we had planned/scheduled!",
"Helpful when working properly, but had numerous glitches and messages that never sent.",
Very useful app.  Helped me plan all my daily activities on the cruise.  Great way to communicate with others in your party.  Love the disney emojis!,
"Easy to make a list of favorite activities, then get reminder prompts through out day.",
"still need tons of improvement. so basic. especially on communicatiom. Surprisingly, they could have done better.",
the texting wasnt helpful at all it only worked half the time,
Great app to keep up to date on all activities in the ship.  Used the complimentary in room phones to keep in touch rather than the app,
"Great app. Let know what was going on for the entire cruise, even what the menus were for all the dinners.",
Easy to use.  Very  informative. Also great way to communicate with others on the ship. Love the countdown feature!,
This app is amazing so are the ships I recently rode the Dream and I was so sad when I had to leave🙁😟 Im still sad😔,
This is a great app that helps on the cruise. It is very useful!,
"Great, easy to use, and much more convenient than the wave phones!",
"Great info while you are on the boat! Plus, the messaging app is great!",
I dont know what to think i can not open the app it keeps crashing,
Very useful to get up-to-date info of the programs food menu restaurant timing etc.,
Can't get it to do anything. Ready to uninstall I guess.,
"The app was informational, but found the paper navigator more up to date then the app.",
Easy to set up and use. Better than carrying that room phone around.,
Complete rundown of everything on the ship. Will use again,
I really enjoyed this app andit was awesome at helping me find things to do on the cruise,
This is a great app.  Love the onboard texting and being able to quickly lookup information.,
The update version 1.6.2 does not work on my phone. The old version did. How can I install the old version?,
I really using it during my cruise🚢🚣,
My kids loved that they could text each other,
Great app for keeping up with all that is going on during the cruise,
Great for communicating with others while onboard as well as tracking activities!,
Very useful while on the boat & informative.  Great way to communicate.,
Immediately crashes when I try to open it.,
Handy for communicating with family and seeing the activities during the cruise.,
Invaluable tool.on the ship. Text with family. See what's going on each day. Used it constantly.,
On the cruise it was functional and helpful for characters and events on the ship,
Very useful and easy to use tool.,
I think it's very handy and helpful,
Great for keeping up with friends in different cabins,
Made it easy to know what times for all events,
Texting didn't work at all,
Easy to use and helpful during cruise.,
This app is great. Very helpful.,
Helped me navigate through the trip. Awesome,
Love the app. Very convenient for the ship.,
The app will not open,
First time on a Disney cruise and it was a big Help.,
Great way to communicate while onboard,
It is helpful throughout the cruise.,
I loved the app. Very informative. I'm glad I had it.,
It was very helpful to have!!,
Cant open it on my phone!!!:(,
Great tool for communicating with the family!!,
A must have app for Disney cruises,
Worked well when scheduling activities and giving reminders,
Great app for an amazing cruise,
Was very useful and convenient,
Very helpful on the trip,
Great job,
Extremely useful,
The best,
Amazing,
Ok app,
Like,
"The app was great for the most part. We could never get the chat to work properly. It always said our names and room reservations didn't match, and so we could never log on to use the chat. Everything else was very helpful, and we used it for everything from navigating the ship, finding events we wanted to attend, and figuring out the drink of the day!",
"We just disembarked The Dream and were very impressed with the app. We chatted, checked menus, and used the Navigator information to get times, locations, and expanded information on listed activities. We had no glitches, used the free onboard Wi-Fi and only had no service once (in the spa locker rooms). The emojis were a fun added perk that are already missed!",
"The app did an amazing job at showing events and notifying me when my events were coming up. Having a map of the cruise on the app was very helpful as well. However, the ""texting"" on this app didn't work so well. When you send a message on the app to a family member, they get it but the app doesn't vibrate or ring. So the app was great for navigating the cruise but not a good communicator.",
"Just got off the Magic and used the app all the time. It was great to help plan our day (instead of using the paper navigator). Loved the chat option... we traveled with 19 people and it was very useful to send a message to find out where everyone was. I would highly recommend having this app while on your cruise. It also had info like the weather, how to disembark, drink of the day, restaurant menues, etc.",
"Just got off the Wonder, the app rarely worked and kept crashing. The chats worked a few times but the messages were so delayed we had already moved along to the next activity. It drained our batteries trying to connect.",
"Was an awesome tool to have for the most part. I traveled with a large family spread across multiple rooms.  We had to gather together to get everyones chat ID numbers so we could communicate. That itself wasn't a big deal. My issue was every time I closed the app, all the conversations and contacts were gone! I would have to hunt every one down to readd them over and over again or else I couldn't contact them.",
"The app was very useful on the cruise to let us all keep in touch. The Disney specific emojiis are great and the text description of them is even better. However, it is glitchy and clearly is a work in progress. Also it shuts down about 8 or 9 on the last night leaving you unexpectedly out of touch with your party. Lastly the count down clock leaves a permanent alarm set and the only way I can get it to go is to uninstall.",
Just got off the Wonder and all though this app did at times not connect properly it did what it was intended for. Kept us updated on the events around the ship and being able to set reminders was a great feature. The free chat was great as well to keep our party of 8 in contact,
Slow to open at times while on the ship. The odd message took a long time to be sent. It was nice to carry my own phone vs the wave phone.,
"The DCL app has much potential. However, currently, it has serious issues with connectivity and consistency.",
"This was an awesome alternative to carrying around the paper agenda. It was accurate,  easy to use, and great for keeping in touch with my husband when we were separated (chat feature)  It also sends reminders for events that you star and interested in attending. 5 star!!!",
The app kept crashing on me. During my 7 day cruise it had to be restarted  multiple times. Made the messaging feature useless.,
"4/2/17: I'm taking my rating down. Still sad to see that booked activities (characters, et al) were still not available to keep track of in the app. Would also like the ability to add reminders for personal mixology classes and the gold/platinum captain meet and greet that might not be in the system. Chat functionality froze during busy times. I was not able to coordinate with my son where we were prior to fireworks on deck. Couldn't log into the chat at first but that worked itself out. App froze several times during use and while trying to open. Rebooted my Galaxy S7 several times in effort to fix problem but it didn't.   Review from 6/15/15: Will bump up to 4 once the messaging issue is fixed. My problem was that our port adventures and ticketed character meet and greets didn't load in. What's the point of favoriting a talk if you're off the ship or waiting to meet Anna and Elsa? Also, would be handy to share favorite items within the family. Also, would be good if it used the ship's time once on board versus the phone's time.",
"Great for keeping in touch with fellow travellers.  Had issue keeping the wifi connected,  had to keep reconnecting.  Great app that is easy to install.   Loved the countdown to cruise !",
"Great tool while onboard. I had some connectivity issues, but I think that was more an issue with my phone than the app. Love the text tool - perfect to keep up with family members, especially kids.",
"Good to get cruise information and connect with family using chat,  But we didnt pay for wifi.  So we cant chat with family after the free 50 MB is used up.",
It was a huge help for communicating with others. It was great seeing all the activities offered and receiving alerts before the activity. It was helpful seeing the menu before going to dinner. It made our trip easier. I would highly recommend the app.,
There were 11 of us in 3 staterooms not near each other.  This app was vital in keeping everyone on schedule and knowing were to meet up. It even worked on castaway key.,
"This was an awesome way to stay in the loop for what was going on throughout the ship! Also, it was really nice to chat with friends I met and communicate with the family.",
It was very useful to see the programs going on at any given moment. The text was a bit delay a few time in my case but over all great app.,
"Once aboard the ship. You would log in. And it should stay that way, instead we kept getting kicked off and have to start over, which made the text feature unable to use.",
The ability to text each other without carrying bulky wave phones was nice. Easy way for the youth staff to reach parents,
"None of the three in my party was able maintain a Wi-Fi connection on the ship, so the chat feature was not usable. The other features were helpful.",
Good app.  Great for the daily schedule.  My WiFi disconnected frequently so it was difficult as a reliable communication app.,
"Awesome app. Works great on the ship to show you the schedule, maps of the ship and you can text your family. All for free, and without being charged for Internet use. We used it a lot while aboard the Disney Wonder. You need to download this a if you will be taking a Disney cruise, which I also highly recommend!",
The app may be better than I'm rating it however Wi-Fi connectivity on the Fantasy was terrible.  I had to reconnect constantly meaning I wouldn't get important messages from my daughters unless I actively looked.,
"It messes up with the alarm clock once you set the countdown, the only way to fix that it is by uninstalling it. I'll use is later on on the ship hopefully it will be of help then. As a general feedback go and fix the alarm clock issues Disney.",
Loved it. Super easy to use. Helped quite a bit when I needed help getting to the correct deck for dinner/event/activity. It was nice being able to communicate with family through the app.,
Just got off the Disney Dream!App kept freezing and forcing us to restart! Once those problems are fixed I would have no problem leaving a higher rating. Using Galaxy S7 Edge,
Kept us up to date on what was going on around the ship. Never missed a thing :),
"If the app ever freezes, crashes, or texts aren't coming in, delete it from your phone's recent apps then reload it.",
Love the app because we didn't buy wifi while on the cruise. I just messaged my party when I lost them on the ship and got a response right away. We were to use it for the map of the ship and the menus for dinner.,
It was so easy to keep in touch with everyone we were with.  Also loved that it had the navigator on it so no need to carry around the hard copy.  Loved the emojis too.,
"A MUST if you are sailing on a Disney Cruise. You get the daily itinerary, and are able to communicate with people on the ship.",
It was great to keep in contact with the family & see what events were happening. I wish the app gave like a 30min notice before the events you marked as favorites instead of right at the exact time,
This app is very helpful. The chat option makes it nice to keep in contact with other families traveling with you.,
"App was good. Used It on last 7 day trip on Disney Fantasy. It could get better by  linking your room key, account balance, ability to use nfc/ Bluetooth technology. Connectivity was wacky at times. But overall it gets the job down.",
The app to keep you updated was good but the app to stay connected to family was junk.,
This app was extremely helpful during our cruise. It definitely provided a peace of mind for me and my husband to enjoy ourselves in the adult area and keep in touch with our daughter as she enjoyed the youth activities.,
Great app for what's happening in the shop and future stops. But notifications when others are trying to message you is poorly done.,
"Good, but...Need to add pictures, better reliability of wifi connectivity on board, more ability to add favorites, quicker activation on sail away day are just a few.",
Just had slight issue with connect to the WiFi for use of app...It was a very useful item to have.,
I feel like you should add calling to it so you don't have to always text someone.,
"Loved it... this app made the trip that much better. With event times and directions to each event. Plus for every event you favorite, it sends you a 15min reminder to ensure you won't miss anything. My family and I can't wait to cruise again.",
It was very helpful when it worked but the app had a slight tendancy to crash.,
It was really helpful to keep up with my party but the only was I wasn't getting all my text.,
You should totally have this app I texted with my whole family they're emojjis were awesome it told me everything that was going on I herd about trivia so I went to the promenade lounge and I met so many characters and saw movies this app makes it way more easier,
Is excellet but on my i have to refresh to can get the text messages,
Did exactly what it said it would. Made life easier on the few occasions we had our phones on us.,
Chatting feature is priceless! Love the ability to view and plan on board activities. Missing ability to connect to your personal account to view purchased personal excursion dates and times. If one were able to do that it would be a 5 Star app hands down!,
"It was great on our trip.  Make a Wish Foundation granted my Grant Niece Alyse Fitts, Survivor of Cancer is 6 years old, her wish, which was The Disney Cruise The Dream She wanted go on that slide, and sure did over and over... There 9 of us, Thank God we could text abd find each other! It was a real fun, great trip! Thank you!",
"Perfect countdown clock for before the cruise! Absolutely necessary when you're there, especially for a Millenial like myself. It was much easier navigating the ship daily, with the ability to save favorites, and get reminders. Make sure you get the app set up before sailing away!!",
"I really liked it but I wished I could use it out side of the ship so I can still talk to my friends, to be honest it is kinda depressing it is deactivated",
Make sure to download before you get on the ship! Was extremely usefull for everyone in the group to have on their device.,
"So easy to use. Helped us stay in the know of all things happening, and perfect way to communicate! Loved it!",
The app keeps getting better. It really played a big role during an amazing cruise.,
Worked great for our family.  Would be great if it would also include details on your scheduled ports of call.,
"Great app to be able to keep track of times of shows, menus, and everything going on aboard the ship.",
Only thing I'd like to see is adding excursions... s/b easy because they are unique to each stateroom/guest.,
The only reason why I liked it (4 stars) and not loved it (5 stars) is because it crashed mid cruise.,
"Good app, works well. Glitches frequently",
Keep track of family members.  Very helpful on ship. Recommend to all!,
Awesome App! Helped with everything. The Chat was very helpful with the kids!,
Very helpful enhancements suggested would be group messaging and ability to see traveling party's favorites,
Wish to buy pictures and didn't realize could not after 9 last day I think your cruise was my best vacation ever just wish pictures offered longer LOVE All the MEMBERS OF CREW,
Current version sets a silent every 20 minutes or so in the status bar on Android Nougat.,
Worked good but if you don't keep it open you won't get the msg,
Worked great. Was able to look at menus and show/character/movie schedules. Would recommend.,
"Phenomenal resource,  better than any printed materials we got.",
App was not working when I wanted to communicate with family and friends even though I refreshed it multiple times,
Was amazing while on the cruise!!! We were able to find characters without dragging the paper around!!,
"Great cruise, and the app is a great way to keep up to date on the activities.",
This app was our go to for all events during the day. Very useful,
Great app for seeing the menus and hours and able to message each other on the ship.,
Worked well and helped to get us up to date and in touch while on boat.,
Amazing app that helped manage everything we wanted to do on the ship!,
Easy way to communicate with family and new friends you make while on the cruise.,
Good app! Would like ability to enter my own schedule items in the daily list,
"Great app for your trip. A must have, very informative.",
This DCL app was Amazing!! Information up to date and so useful! The chat feature was the best!!!!,
Very nice app aboard the ship.  Deck plans and up to date activities happening! Must have for a cruise.,
The app was nice and helpful. It'd be great if a 'where are we' piece was added. We kept thinking 'I wonder where we are.',
"This app is AWESOME!!  So easy to use, very informative and so useful!",
Great way to keep in touch on board without every day distractions....vacation time!!,
Awesome App! Very easy to use.,
I loved having everything on the ship right at my fingertips!,
Great for reminders of events ...And communicating​ with your party,
I THINK THAT IT WAS VARY HELPFUL,
Great App Easy to Communicate with others in my group.,
"it was good, but the wifi disconnects sometimes",
This app was very helpful and easy to use.,
Update made this app put a clock on your phone all the time so I uninstalled it . They need to fix it,
Very helpful onboard as an alternative to wave phones.,
Perfect and liked this better than paper navigators.,
Sometimes the messages you sent others took a while to get to the intended person so if you wanted to meet up with someone before a show you would have to send the message 30 minutes before then show started to have a chance to meet up with them,
This app worked great....We used it the entire time we were on the ship!!!,
Need access to delete IMs while on ship.,
Worked just like it said it would!,
Great app.just like everything Disney does!!!,
Super rad organizational tool.,
Perfect for cruise communication and schedule.,
Amazing app to have on the boat..,
Great app for the high seas!,
There should be some app training by the crew when we board the ship.,
Easy to use and accurate.,
I want a page where you list every service in the spa and it's prices. A list of every area in the ship and what to get or do there.,
Great app really helpful,
Perfect app for our cruise,
Great for on the boat and the countdown clock,
I loved the Disney Magic,
Works great easy to use,
Worked great.,
Best app ever,
I think it was handy,
Works great on the cruise,
WiFi should be freeeeeee,
Very helpful,
Great app,
Awesome,
Wondeful,
"The app was great for texting our kids on the ship. When they left the activity for their age group they would let us know they were on the way back so we could keep an eye out for them. I also liked that all of the day's activities were in one spot. The paper navigator is nice, but this was convenient.",
It was a real handy option on the ship to be able to text with your phone rather than use the in room wave phones Disney provides. But the app kicked me off on our last day one the boat and it would not allow me to log back on. Also it doesn't work on Castaway Cay island. That would make the app the ultimate if it worked on the island.,
This app never worked for our group of 13. Our batteries were continually drained. You could charge 3 times a day and they still wouldn't last. If it wasn't locked up then the messages wouldn't go. I saw the screen that asked if I wanted to report a problem or close the app everytime I opened it. Not worth using as you can't depend on it.,
"The premise of the app is great, but there are some major flaws in the execution. The chat only alerts you to a new message if your phone is on & running the app. And while on Castaway Cay it reset & lost all my favorite activities as well as the friends' chat numbers I'd added. Also, there was no way to add reservations to your reminders.",
"This should be avail ahead of cruise. Always cut off wifi for no reason,  had to reset constantly. Notification should be heard not felt. Should be able look to find other passengers by name not number. Should be easier to select activities and add to itinerary hearting them as a favorite is too many steps.",
"It was great for communicating with family and friends, but the app wouldn't always communicate with the wifi, so the messaging wouldn't always work. But other than that it was awesome for looking at activities, menus, and locations and hours. One thing I would like, is if there is some way that the wave phones could connect with the apps messages.",
"The app is good, but know it will not fully replace your paper navigator. Cast members told us after we were late to an event, because the app time had the wrong start time, not to trust what's in the app and only what's on the paper copy. This seems poor at best. Also, this really should let you sign in so your planned events are shown as well as the navigator ones. I.e. Palo at 7 so that you can truly plan your entire day in the app.",
"The daily itenerary updates are great.  The chat was somewhat intermittent. Would be nice if you could call other parties and wave phones from the app as well.  Another improvement would be to enable / disable WiFi internet access directly.  Most phone OS's assume WiFi is free and perform background syncs when connected.  This consumed most of my purchased data.  After realizing this, I disabled WiFi on the phone and only used it when I wanted to use the Internet.  This makes the chat pretty useless.",
"Very useful as a digital version of the daily plan for the cruise. Chat was a good idea but was flaky unless you have internet access - messages won't send until you ""sign in to wifi"" periodically. I'd like to see a day planner added to the app - there's so much going on it would be helpful to call out things that look especially good and get notifications.",
"In the chat feature, if I misspelled a word, I hit backspace and it would jump to a random spot, so had to type message all over. Not sure if it's just my phone or the app but it would keep connecting to DCL crew for wi-fi instead of staying connected to DCL guest, like I selected. I would miss messages because of that.",
The group chat ability stopped working on Day 2 and wouldn't work at all for one group member. The notification reminders for events we had favorited rang nonstop for 15 minutes of every showing of the event. There was no way to silence/shut off. Better off using wave phones (even though archaic) to text group.,
"When your off board you can use it to track days, hours, minutes, and seconds to track how many days until your on board. When your on board you login to wifi, and login to texting to send disney emoji and important texts. Then you can go to activities and favorite them and get reminders to go to it a few minutes early to get in line for many diffrent things.",
"This app has a lot of promise, but completely failed. We were on a seven day cruise and the messenger part completely reset itself three times. That meant I had get my party's contact numbers each time before I could contact them. My wife had the same thing happen. Also, the app started freezing more often as the trip went on.",
"Let's you text on board, see everything from events to what's for dinner. You can set reminders for everything you want to do. Only negative is that it reset 3 times on my 7 night cruise, so I lost all of my favorites and couldn't get chat notifications until I signed in again.",
When the app was working it was wonderful. But every once in a while none of the messages that I sent to my other family members on board ship went through and I did not know that right away it was several hours later. All in all it probably is a good thing. But there needs to be more quality control to keep it working 24/7 while on board ship. The Disney Experience is one that I will not forget this was our second Cruise loved it.,
"This app is very helpful when it works and some of the occasions it did not work. Top of the frustration list is, when you have to correct something: back button deletes previous letter than the immediate letter! Next improvement should be auto fill in the words. List of programs and timings are not accurate some times.. as a family we did use this app extensively and was helpful.",
"Works okay for messaging (will not always get notice of a message) and is great for seeing ""All Activities"" over a cruise but try and filter Activities by a location and you'll need to force stop the app to again get working.  One great add-on they could do would be either to incorporate ones booked activities (since one has to register by cabin and guest) or allow one to add their own activity to what is shown in favorites.",
"This app was lime having a personal concierge agent with me. I knew what was happening and when, convenient to keep in touch with the very large group I was traveling with and the deck maps,  dinner menus,  etc were nice to have in hand. Only complaints are that mine wouldn't update on the ship. A new movie came out and the schedule change wouldn't load for all of us at sea. And the IMs wouldn't always come through in real time,  so it's be a few hours and then a flood of IMs would hit.",
"More often than not the app would not work. It worked great before we set sail. I don't know if the WiFi that it operates on was overwhelmed with users or what, but usually it wouldn't load and I'd just end up getting messages hours late. My group definitely would have been better off not relying on the app and just using the ""Personal Navigator"" paper and planning meet ups instead of relying on the app.   It also DESTROYED the battery life of everyone in my party. I don't think it was the app itself, but the ship's WiFi (that the app relies on).  It could be great and I'll probably try the app out again if I take future Disney Cruises.   My trip was last week on the Disney Wonder.",
"Calendar is a must have for the cruise.  Chat option was not even an available icon on my phone for 2 days, then mysterious showed up.  Frustrating as hell as I needed to enable it others on the cruise.   With wi-fi, a 3D interactive map of the ship and others in the party, magic band enabled, is a no brainer.  Build  reservations of on-ship activities like the spa from the app.",
App is easy to use and extremely handy for tracking activities and looking up menus.  Chat feature was great to have but has a few glitches with the timeliness and notifications.  One in our group also kept getting kicked out and having to re add contacts.  Overall great to have!!  Just needs a few fixes,
App itself is very cool. First 2 days on the ship it worked beautifully. However after that it continued to lose information such that I had to reload everything and reenter all chat  info. After several crashes I just stopped using it and relied on the paper version.,
It was great to be able to talk to your family or new friends if you didn't have international data. But I gave it 4 stars because you would loose Wi-Fi alot so you couldn't get notifications when unconnected from the Wi-Fi.,
I loved this app because you were able to see all the categories of events happening on the ship for the whole duration of your trip. I loved that I was able to see other times of a specific event if one didn't work at that time but did at a different time and/or day. I loved that I got notifications of my favourite events.  I was able to stay in contact with my family so we could meet up. The messaging was off sometimes (not getting a message until a few hours after it was sent) which was annoying because it made me miss doing things with my family.,
Nice app. Useful for communicating with cabin mates but you have to log into the chat often or you won't get real time messages. I also used it to browse the dining menus and locations. You can also look at deck plans and more.,
"Onboard chat  feature worked great for keeping everyone informed.  Occasionally some members of our party (but not others) had the app shut down in the background and this resulted in messages being received well after time sent.  The personal navigator info was handy to have electronically, but we couldn't get the app updated during the cruise; there were itinerary changes near the end that weren't reflected in app.   Would have liked to be able to input port adventures/dining reservations into the app.",
Better than nothing.  Was nice to see activities on the boat and schedules menus etc.   could not get the communicator feature to work with the other party we were with.  Should be customizable so you put in your information so it reminds you where you're eating dinner and scheduled activities.,
Really helpful to keep us updated on what was coming up each day and what would be repeated or what was one-offs.  Also to view menus ahead of time.  Would be great if you could link your booked activities - e.g. Princess greeting.,
"The app is basically pretty good. Easy to find information about the day and any available activities. Restaurant menus are also easily accessible. For some reason the auto correct doesn't work on the Android (and SwiftKey) keyboard when sending messages via the app. Also, the are no notification sounds or even notification settings today make sure you don't miss messages from your family. Finally, my phone kept losing connection to the ships WiFi and I had to continuously reset it.",
"The schedule of activities is quite nice, as are the ship maps. It makes it easy to plan and locate activities. The chat function is awful. It was very difficult to actually get connected, it would not display the predictive text bar on any keyboard I tried, it crashed repeatedly, and group management was almost non existent. We had several families traveling together and even though our reservations were linked, we had to track down everyone's chat id, and group chat would drop people out randomly",
"Good app, but just a digital version of the Navigator.   I'd like to see the ability to enter in personal plans, dinner reservations, spa times and shore excursions.   It would also be nice to be able to look at your on board account as well as book things right in the app.",
"Used this on a cruise I just took.  It had some helpful things like the activity list and ship map, but all those things were easily accessible elsewhere.  Was really looking forward to using the ship chat feature and it was more frustrating than anything else.  The app frequently froze, multiple times a day while sending and receiving messages.  Message delivery was extremely delayed and often messages did not go through at all.  The messaging interface was terrible and I could not erase characters on my phone or use predictive text.  It was really frustrating to type properly with this app.  I wouldn't want to use this again.  It was really poorly built.",
Love this app! I have used it on 3 Disney cruises and it's great to see all ship activities in one place. It's awesome to message all of the members in your party when you lose them. Love being able to mark favorites and get reminders. Im5totally in love with the new emojis. Now for the bad news. The app stopped working on several phones mid-vacation. There were 16 of us and half could not use app for last few days of the trip. Download before you go  When you get on board you can't download it using ship wifi.,
Great start to have all the ships activities on an app for the boat. Would be better to have more descriptions when you click on the activity and be able to rate them there too. I've also seen other apps upload images of each activity to share with other passengers.,
"Good app, with some space for improvement like management of restaurants times for dinner and make changes in case needed. Communicator is helpful, but would be even more if you could send photos and audios! Some predictive keyboards like SwiftKey not working right in Android!",
"This app had a wealth of information about the ship, itineraries, activities, maps, et cetera. We got it primarily for the messenger system which worked very quickly with no perceivable lag. My only complaints/suggestions are that there isn't any obvious way to setup audio alerts for when you receive a message, and there is no way to create alerts or reminders (""your movie starts in 15 minutes"" or ""the Aquaduck is open!"" - that kinda thing). Otherwise, it was fantastic.",
We looked forward to using the app on our last cruise.   When it didn't work we went to the on board app fixit guy.  He said the app does not work with a galaxy s5 phone.  Dissappointed.,
"The texts were not always prompt,  a few took over night ):  the day and time constantly changed, we would have to manually change it. The app ran our phones dead and we would have to charge 3x per day. Make sure your phone is set to airplane mode.            The ship activities, the menu   features were great and I used that only, never looked at the navigator! Perfect green idea...love it",
Great app! Just finished 1st Disney Cruise and this app was very helpful. It lets you mark favorite things you want to do while on board. Loved being able to see the dinner menu all day so you can plan ahead especially dessert.,
"Make sure to use this app to keep up with all the activities.  Put a star for the things you want to see our do and it will remind you 15 mins before.  Also,  you can text and keep up with each other.  Fun icons and tons of information including ship maps for each event.  Well worth the time to install and use.  Thanks,  Disney!!",
"The app is great in theory and has many great features. But it kept signing me out of my account and then I'd loose all my contacts and their messaging numbers. Not a big deal if you have one person to message, but we traveled with a big group and had 7 numbers and conversations going. It was obnoxious.",
"While my wife still loves the traditional Navigators, I love being able to see the itinerary for the entire cruise on day one. Makes it easy to find the activities you want and to remind you they are coming up. Also, I love seeing the menus before dinner!",
"Good overall. Mostly used it as a messaging app while onboard. There seems to be a bug in the chat interface for the latest version of Android. People in my party with Nexus or pixel phones had difficulty correcting mistakes in the chat. More of an annoyance since it would be impossible to delete the furthest right character without highlighting and deleting. Still, quite useful to have on the cruise, especially since it doesn't count against your data usage. Just make sure you actively check the app since messages that should come in while your phone is locked or asleep may not appear until you do.",
Overall it worked very well and was a valuable part of the trip. The only thing missing is the ability to see your personal itinerary for the day. It would be nice if it showed things like which room you were dining in on that day or where to meet for your booked excursions.,
Great way to communicate but would not always conected and time is the time it was read and not sent.  That means if a text was sent at night and you did not get it till the morning it would have a morning time stamp and is difficult to understand.  Also would be good team be able to text pictures.,
"Loved being able to star activities and have notifications pop up 15 minutes prior to an event. Kept everything at my fingertips - I always knew what was going on and when. I didn't use the chat, I heard it was glitchy.",
This app would have been amazing if it worked. Most of the time the messages would not send to other members of my party and I don't like that I was not able to look people up.,
I didn't have any issues with this app. It was updated whenever the schedule changed - great way to stay updated about events. I loved the in-app reminders. It was also nice to be able stay in contact with my family members & find each other while on the cruise.,
"The app is a MUST for keeping connected with your group while on the ship.   However, it would be nice if the activities list was 100% accurate and complete.  Sometimes it falls short of the paper-based Navigator.",
It was nice but I wish when you get a message it would make a sound not just vibrant. But other then that vary useful.,
This app was 1 step above better than nothing. The keyboard is broken and the app freezes constantly. I kept the system menu open so I could force close it every time I had my phone off. Absolutely terrible QA.,
2016Nov we used this app the whole time during the cruise. With no carrier signals on board this was more helpful with messaging and more usefull info on all activities on board. Must use app on board.... VJ.,
Needs lots of work.  Doesn't work if not open.  Delete key deletes one left of cursor.  Put more effort into Android version,
"The backspace had a glitch, meaning I couldn't effectively use swipe, and the app didn't work with the voice to text. Other than that, good app",
App was very handy to plan for the shows and events that we wanted to watch and participate. Used it all the time. Messaging option was awesome.. just that it did not ping..when a new message was sent.,
It made planning the day so easy.  We made it to EVERY character meeting with no problem.  We were usually the first there too.  Loved this app,
This app was very helpful navigating around the ship and knowing what is going on where onboard. It was very easy to use. It also allowed everyone in our party to communicate.,
This app was so useful on our cruise.  It was right at our finger tips on what was going on throughout the cruise.  We didn't have to carry around the itinerary that was left in our rooms.,
Great app to keep in contact with your family. Helps with character appearance and show times. Only problem I found you cant access your stateroom account to Settle any outstanding bills.,
Was very nice to see the restaurant menus. We had difficulty with the texting; couldn't delete the last character so had weird stuff at the end of every message.,
"With our party covering 3 staterooms, the chat function really easy.  The chat function did apparently ""hang up""  midweek on an older Samsung.  The activity tracker and scheduler was a fantastic help.",
"The app was great, but the chatting feature had some problems. It wouldn't work for one of my party members, and eventually just didn't work for me. Please fix that problem.",
For ship information it was great. For texting each other on board it was not great. There was a lag in texting and quite often you wouldn't receive notification you had a message unless you went into the app to check. It also locked up quite a bit on my galaxy note.,
Awkward communication between family members. Feel that the data technology on app and ship is ten years behind,
My husband and I used this app as well as our 16 year old.  It was great to be able to transition seamlessly to texting using the app from texting using our message app.,
"Worked great.  Just be careful if you purchase a sea to shore Internet, background apps will very quickly use up your data.  Sign out of your internet to shore account when not using it to stop using up your data plan onboard.",
This app works well. Kept kicking us off wi-fi but easy to get back on. Very useful being able to stay in touch with my family,
The Wi-Fi on the ship was very spotty and I kept having to reconnect to the Wi-Fi to send and receive messages (like every minute).,
"Great app to bookmark activities all over the ship, and keeps all the important info at your fingertips throughout your cruise. Does not require you to purchase on-board wifi utilize, either! Only function that I could never use was the on-board chat option. Kept getting an error message. Probably human operator error!",
"The app definitely helps with keeping in touch. It is great for quick planning. It could use a few tweaks, but overall exceptionally useful.  My only complaint was not really with the app as much as WiFi issues that affected the app. Otherwise great!",
Loved the app.  It made it very easy to stay in contact with our teenaged children and friends we were traveling with.  It was also a great way to keep track of all the daily events and activities.  Would highly recommend this app.,
App overall is helpful in planning your day. But battery drains fairly quickly when had WiFi and app running. Also it crashed quiet often. But I liked that you could stay connected to your family on the ship. Overall pleased with it.,
"The emojis, schedule, and map of the ship were fantastic!  The two biggest problems is that the app kept crashing and messages downloaded in batches instead of when they were sent.",
"This app helped us out a lot. Whenever we got a little lost or could figure out what was going on, we used this app. We looked at menus and itineraries along with anything else we were curious about.",
Useful when I forgot the navigator newsletter. Easier to find activities on paper than the app. Notifications were good for activities. Notifications for chats were poor. Probably to do with ships wifi not the app. Keyboard functionality SUCKED.,
So helpful to know what was going on and being able to communicate with others.  Loved the emojies.  There is so much room for improvement in the app and mine kept resetting so communication with other rooms became a hastle.,
Very good app u can set a group chat up with your family and friend so u don't have to text every body individually and it's the only way you could communicate with your family on the boat because there's no service anywhere,
The free WiFi didn't recognize my email bit it was no big deal. The only cruise I will ever go on will be disney it was a blast.  Thank you all the staff.  Best vacation ever.,
"This app was so easy to use and helped us navigate the boat, activities and stay connected to our party.",
The app is very handy while on board. I wish you could send photos to one another and I also would have times when it wouldn't notify me that I had new messages.,
"The app is great for quick reference to schedules, menus, shows, etc., and the on board chat feature is useful when it works. Not sure if the chat glitches were in the app or the ship's WiFi.",
The app locked up a couple times a day for me. And messages sometimes take awhile to go through. But as a way of communicating it worked well and it's nice that it's free.,
The chat has a lot of issues. It doesn't permit you to use a keyboard that does autocorrect and it randomly makes you log in again.,
"The app was great.   But if you lost the wi-fi connection,  it did not automatically reconnect.",
This app was essential during our cruise. We could chat back and forth and find out where we were. We made favorites and we're reminded of our upcoming events. I adore the Disney emoticons as well.,
"Works great for knowing what activities are going for the day and what time and location. Messaging barely worked, messages would be sent or recieved hours later or not at all.",
Great app! Loved that I could favorite activities and it sent me reminders.  Has a chat feature but never used it.  Loved the character location in the app too.,
Loved having the events on board at my fingertips. It also sent me reminders of the things I didn't want to miss and allowed easy on board communication with my family.,
Great app very useful and great chat feature. Would be helpful if there was a sound notification for chats. It would be also helpful for a ship position locator and current ship time zone.,
I wish you had the capability to open it prior to the cruise to do planning. Also to book things. Having a link to looking for future cruises would be helpful too.,
I loved the cruise and the app helped a lot. Tell that British chick in Sea Treasures I said hello. She gave a good hug.,
"Struggled with messages loading properly. Would open the app and get a slew of messages all at once. Other than that, the app is great.",
Just came back from our trip and this app was very helpful. It tells you the time and I kept in contact with those in my party.,
"It was great to use this in addition to the paper navigator.   If there were two activities we wanted to attend at overlapping times, we could check app and it would show additional times that activity is offered",
We used this daily as a countdown 5th cruise and several times a day while in board to choose our activities and to communicate.  Brilliant!,
Very useful for keeping in touch & up-to-date with events but becomes a distraction for teens who misuse it.,
Connecting was initially difficult but once connected the app wasn't too bad.  Fun chat emojis and good scheduling notifications.,
The app was very useful for communication among our group. The schedule was handy to have when the actual Navigator schedule wasn't nearby.,
"This app is amazing for staying in contact with your group on the ship, choosing how to spend your time and seeing everything that is happening.  Don't know how I survived the last cruise without it!",
I liked it because i got to know things ahead of time on the cruise. But the only problem was that when you connet to the wi-fi it would sometimes disconnect from the wi-fi.,
"We traveled on the Disney Fantasy (7day) with a 20+ in our group and having on board chat was of utmost importance. The app worked flawlessly and it was clever the way you added people privately and the security included for our younger ones on the app were much appreciated. However, after a day at sea, my Android app crashed and I lost all group chats. Even though I was part of group chats, I did not recieve any messages. I had to walk around to all my group members and get their information and setup a new group chat again. Another day or so went by and the same thing happened, I lost all group chats and was unable to receive. I gave up on group chats and missed out on all the planning and coordination. I pretty much had to keep asking my children to see the chats on their phones.  Of course this happened to both the Android phones in our party. iOS phones had a flawless chat experience until near the end of the cruise where everyone in our party was complaining that the app took 30+ seconds to load and their phones were unresponsive everytime they went to chat.  Anyway, the app provided good information about the events on the cruise. But the app failed us for chat.",
Great but does not fully replace your paper Navigator. A bit of room for improvement.,
the app was very helpful during our vacation. The chat feature was extremely important for our family to stay connected. The only feature I would like to see is the reservations for activities and dining also added to this app somehow.,
I love this app because it actually help me during the cruise when I was trying to find my family. Great job Disney.,
It is a great way to keep up with people especially your kids on board. Would have giving 5 stars if the notification wasn't only vibration. Very good for keeping up with daily activities also.,
I use this app every day each time we cruise. Suggestion would be to add option to add custom notes and items to the favorites. Like my personal reservations to Palo and the spa etc. Otherwise well done.,
I hope this works as well this time. The communication feature was very useful. And for event planning it was terrific.,
It would be nice if the general announcements were sent as notifications through the app. It would be nice if it contained a tv guide to plan movies for the kids.,
This app was super helpful & amazing! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is bc I really wish it would give you a sound notification for messaging. You have to constantly check your phone and open the app to see if you have a new message from someone in your party. Other than that- SO GREAT!,
It worked well but would have been nicer if it gave more information. Maybe even some fun facts or mini games for when kids are using it.,
"The app requires WiFi, but WiFi is not free. I did not take the expensive package so the app never worked.",
This app came in handy numerous times throughout our trip!  It was a great way to set reminders for anything we wanted to try and attend!,
"Handy, but messages didn't always go through right away. It was really nice to have the navigator right at your fingertips at all times though.",
Loved this app to make sure I had a full menu of activities and events to refer to throughout the week.  Particularly loved how I could select favorites.  Also loved how the app also provided a map of the ship location where the activity takes place.  Fun to review the dinner menus so I could plan my meals for the day.,
Great app. Would like it even more if it actually made noise when a text came in. Other than that it is wonderful.,
This app was SUPER useful and came in handy on our vacation. Highly recommend downloading before any Disney Cruise.,
"Chat was useful but we had to reenter our info a few times a day. Also, our favourites would disappear and later reappear. But it did help us with the kid's Oceaneer Club schedule with reminders.",
Huge help in navigating the ship and events! Would like to see a scheduler included and one page snap shot of events like with the hard copy.,
The only negative was the Wi-Fi. It disconnected a lot. When it gets disconnected you don't get your messages.,
This app is awesome!!  It made it easy to know all of the activites going on on the cruise and I could easily communicate with others.  One person sent a LOT of emoji and the app became messed up but there was an easy way to fix it.,
"Great tool when on board ship. It would be super convenient if you could search the chat option for others you're traveling who aren't in your stateroom. I also had to reload everyone after stopping at Castaway Cay. Overall, a great way to keep up with everything happening while on our Disney Cruise!",
The app allows you to know all activities going on including the movie schedule and dinner menus.  The texting feature is ideal and preferred over the wave phones.,
Very useful app. I didn't always get the alert that someone had sent me a message which was a little inconvenient at times but for the most part worked amazing!,
"We were a party of 6. We all had the app, but it was not a good way of communication. The app froze most of the time and the messages were delayed or never received. When it worked it was great, but it did not work most of the time.",
This app was sooo awesome. It allows you to stay in touch with your party & also plan your day according to all the activities you want to attend. Plus it sends you a reminder 15 mins prior to the event. Definitely allowed my family to enjoy all we could. Thank you,
"Frequently crashes, didn't always get messages right away",
"The app was a great asset.  I could look at menu to the restaurants ahead of time, check activities, times and locations at any time. Good job!",
It was really good app. It helped to chat with our family inside the cruise. Easy to use and get all the information about the events thats happening on the particular day.,
This made finding out what was going on and planning our days a breeze. Plus being able to stay in touch with our group no matter where we were on this ship was amazing!,
Good app.  Wish it would allow you to break out individual chat from a group.   Better deck mapa,
"I like it but it takes like 20 minutes for me to send a text message. It is also hard to follow the menu, other than that it is good.",
"This app makes navigating and planning your day to day events amazingly easier, the hardest part is choosing which to attend.  With alerts before events start and a map of the ship showing where you need to be",
"My friends and I were able to connect while on the ship. Also,activities I signed up for sent reminders too. Thanks",
Doesn't always work on ship and lags alot. Sometime you don't get messages until after its too late. Crashes alot!,
Very good app while we were on our cruise.  Lots of useful information about daily ship events.  We were able to connect with family taking the cruise with us via the text function which made meeting up a breeze.  This app is a must have while on a Disney Cruise.,
Great at informing you as to what is happening on the ship. The chat feature was a bit off kilter so we gave up using it. At one point it wanted me to reenter my profile to enable the use of chat.,
When we would chat each other neither of us knew we had a message waiting.  No indication popped up on either phone.,
"Great app easy to communicate with others on our party with on board chat. However I was frequently disconnected from on board WiFi which was incredibly inconveinent, and the Connect at Sea liason was unable to fix this on my phone",
"We were able to stay in constant communication will all parties during our cruise. Even in Castaway Key. Ability to stay connected when off the dcl-guest wifi and on the islands would really be a plus. Adding the ability to see where the ship is just as they post on the TV screens around the ship would be another nice feature. Overall, a very valuable app to have while cruising.",
Chatting didn't ring just Vibrate and most time you just had to check frequently for chat messages,
"Great for finding out what was going on every day on the cruise. Loved being able to check out the menus before hand. Chat feature was very handy. Overall, great app.",
A definite must when cruising with Disney! So easy to communicate with others on the ship and everything you need to know about activities is right at your finger tips!,
Great app on the ship. Found you have to refresh by hitting home button to see a new message come in for the onboard chat feature between family members.,
This app was helpful for the most part but for some reason it deleted my account and so my contacts were erased every day.,
Wonderful app and great features....but how frustrating that it is not working properly on android.  Crashes a lot and freezes the phone. It worked flawlessly on iphone however.,
Awesome app as long as you aren't trying to use Samsung S4 or S5. It keeps looking for a network thus disconnecting you from the WiFi. Samsung S7 will work just fine. My wife and son used Apple  phones and the WiFi stayed connected. Very useful.,
Easier than carrying the paper Navigator around with you. Nice to have access to dining menus and times available.,
The app is very intuitive. It's the perfect way to keep track of your activities during your Disney Cruise. Plus the messaging is handy and fun. There are emojies that are unique to Disney.,
Easy to keep in touch around ship when out of home cell network. We coordinated a group of 12 guests with it.,
"Very helpful to find out when different events were happening, filtered by what you are looking for. Characters, stage shows, etc. However there weren't opportunities to set alarms to remind you that something was happening when you have marked it as a favorite. That's the one improvement I would recommend",
"Had done everything right up until adding friends in group and then it wiped all friends out, reset and only left me with my husband's contact as a suggestion. I was so annoyed so instead of using app, I used the wave phone with the built in messaging feature.",
"It is a good app, but it would be even better if you could bring in your scheduled shore and ship excursions for alerts.  It would be even better if you could see your  personalized agenda in a calendar format and select the available activities in the calendar format so you don't try to double book activities.",
I'm a software engineer with over 28 years of experience and I impressed with this app.  The layout is intuitive and easy to use.  The only part that needs work is the massaging feature. This is why it gets 4 stars.,
"I found the app useful however it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Didn't use a lot of the functions, may do so next time.",
I loved the app and the free of charge to use it was great.  I think the only thing I would add if possible would be to share pics but other then that loved it,
Only drawback is erasing errors in text feature doesn't work well.,
Made the trip so much better. We didn't miss a thing and didn't have to carry around the daily schedule. Love it.,
"Great idea and COULD have been useful, however is super kludgy and rarely worked.",
"Great app, that is a must if you're going on a Disney cruise.  All the activities, dining options and more are at your fingertips.  Messaging is so easy on the app, and everyone in your party can participate.",
"The app lets you set reminders for activities on board, lets you preview dinner menus and gives you a map of the ship anytime. You can carry the paper navigator tas a back up but this worked perfectly.",
Really works well to see when things are happening and where they are onboard.  I would have literally been lost without it.,
We cruised with a group of 25. I don't know how we would have done it without the app to let each other know where they were. And the activities part was incredibly helpful in planning our days.,
Great for finding out what's happening and locations. Messages weren't very good!,
"This app was nice to keep in contact, though it used too much of our wifi plan. It shouldn't count on the wifi plan if the app has 'free' wifi.",
The notifications didn't always work. Wish it would work a little better,
"I think the app is great for not having service on the boat or at sea, however, I think there are some things I'd like to see. I traveled with a big group, so sharing pictures while texting would be great! Using a call feature like Voxer or what's app would be great too.",
"Super user friendly. Made communicating on board easy. Lived that you can view activity schedule, menus, and characters. Ship map and links to it made finding locations simple.",
Useful to look at dining menus and activities. Only complaint was it would randomly stop and not alerting to texts,
Great app for staying on top of ship activities though it was slightly sluggish at times with map loading...,
"Extremely helpful for keeping track of all the activities, games, movies, etc. that I didn't want to miss, and remembering their location on the ship.",
This app is fantastic!  We had 12 people in our travel party so this app made it easy to communicate with each other.  I also referred to it frequently for information on dining and entertainment.  Would highly recommend it to anyone going on the cruise (which was an amazing time!),
The latest update crashes after log in every time. I haven't been able to see any of the new features.,
"The app is a great feature, only thing that would make it better is if the kids club could use that to contact you instead of the wave phone.",
"Not bad app, had to keep reseting my kids permissions and it wouldn't let me connect with some people from my party but nice when it worked.",
This app helped us stay in contact and know the haps on the trip! I would love for the kids club and nursery texts to go to the app as well. Also to have the ability to show another person/group your favorites activities would be great!,
"I don't know how to start the game,put on the airplane mode and the wifi.and it doesn't come on",
Gotta have it on a Disney cruise! We were first timers and didn't know all of the offerings on the ship but this app gave us the power! We would have been late or missed a lot of great stuff with out it!,
Great for while on the cruise not much use before or after but great for info while on the trip,
Love the text and favorites notification setup but sometimes it would reset and you lose texts and favorite activities.,
App worked amazing while on the ship. Kept us up to date the whole time with all the activities going on at all times.,
Really helpful app to have in board.  But keyboard on chat has problems.,
Some trivia or other enrichment events were not shown in the app or in the Navigator.,
"We traveled in a group of 12. Once on the cruise, we were able to text in a group or privately. Disney emojis were also available and adorable. We were able to flag activities we wanted to attend and our phones would buzz to remind us of the activities. The Oceaneer's  Club was also able to text is when our little one was ready to be picked up. GREAT app!!!",
"Decent app, but crashed several times on the ship. We lost the contact numbers for our group.  You just need to keep a memo of everyone's number.",
"Pretty good. Loved how we could see all menus for entire cruise and plan character meet and greets, shows,  etc.  Good for texting on ship.  Maybe they can make the notifications work better for texting. But otherwise,  very useful.",
Couldn't get the messenger to work but other than that it was extremely helpful at keeping track of and scheduling activities,
Just finished our cruise and used this ap several times a day.,
Very nice but forces you to carry your phone. Which not everyone wants to do on vacation,
Group chat function stopped working 3 days into our cruise.,
The all kept kicking me out of the chat function requiring me to relogin all the time,
I prefer to carry my phone over ship phone.  Lots of information at my fingertips was much better than the paper schedules.,
The app worked great while onboard the ship and off the ship. Loved having everything at my fingertips wherever I was.,
Loved this app while on our cruise Nov 28th-Dec 2nd. You can keep up with your friends and family onboard. Also has all activities going on throughout the whole day! I used it constantly and will use it on our next disney cruise.,
"Only thing stopping this from being a 5 star is, I want to see a map of where you are at sea on this app.",
This app is amazing. It was a great help while on board and I liked the fact that I could use it castaway cay.,
It was useful to a point but often said come back later for daily events,
"This app does it all, and with ease. It's user friendly and requires no instructions to work! You'll love it!",
"So useful, loved being able to connect with family to find out where they are.",
Worked so well we didn't even use the wave phones to communicate.,
It was so handy to have the Navigator with me at all times. Also nice to check the dinner menus ahead of time.,
"This app was easy to use and all the activities, dining, port info was at your fingertips.",
A must to communicate with others in your group on a Disney cruise. Having on line navigator schedule very helpful too!,
It'd be even better if it let us know our balance and we could make payments :),
Needs work to be accurate with times and finding things on the  navigator. Also messaging could be improved.,
"Such a great app, you just simply cannot cruise on a Disney ship without it.",
Only things that need repairs is the connection and letting the clients use the app after an hour to text the people,
It was really great that my friend and I could keep in contact with was other on the cruise! Having the navigator on the app was fantastic! So easy to see what was going on and times! Can't wait to use it again!,
"We used this app for our cruise, it was very helpful and we were able to keep track of our kids for the week:)",
Loved this app... It kept us up to date with everything happening on the boat. I wish all cruises had such an app.,
So handy! We used this app during our cruise all the time. And we loved the pre-cruise countdown!,
I had such an awesome time.  Everyone and everything was great.  This app made it so much easier to find family and friends.  Where can i get the Disney emojis from?,
Works well on the ship but occasionally loses WiFi connection and makes the text feature unreliable,
This app made it easy for us to communicate with our group and view all of the menus and activity times.,
would not stay connected to wifi so could not use the messenger feature,
This app was so useful and accurate. We were also able to communicate with everyone in our party.,
"I couldn't imagine being on Disney's boat without it!  It was extremely helpful finding your way around, finding out activity and  show times, and much more.  I loved the app!!",
Great app very useful for large groups. Gives info about the ship and what's going on aboard.,
"Could use some improving. Quite often notification of a text didn't come through (when expecting a response). Would like to be able to send pictures via app, but understand that would require more bandwidth. App can be improved by adding more personalization: show excursions bookings, reservations at Palo/Remy and spa bookings. Overall, I was pleased that I could use my cell and not carry around wave phones.",
Excellent tool for keeping track of your kids or anyone in your circle. Can't imagine traveling without it.,
Used this every day on the cruise! Full of info about daily events and it let's you commicate with family on the ship. 🚢⚓👍,
Really helpful in planning your days on the ship.  Texting feature is an awesome bonus.,
You can talk to who ever you want and talk to your family to go.❤,
The app was always up to date with activities and made it so easy for our family to coordinate our plans. Very convenient!,
Does not work as well with Android systems as it does with Apple.,
Great way to be connected while still being disconnected,
Saves a lot of time while on board. Wish it had some small game or something for playing while waiting,
Loved it overall! Just wish the chat feature wouldn't go in and out of service.,
What's  going on... this app alerts you 15 min. before your activity. You can chat with family/friends on the ship... we used it to remind  our son in the Edge to come down for dinner. PERFECT!!,
I used this for keeping in touch w shipmates & finding my way around.,
This app has all of the information you'll need for your cruise.,
Messaging did not work properly most of the time on board.,
Very helpful for keeping track of activities onboard and staying connected to your party with text chat.,
"This app is very handy especially to stay connected with other people in your group, but mine reset twice while on the ship and I lost my contacts in the messenger. It was much better than last time we went though! Also being able to have the kids look at the dinner menu before we got there was great! My daughter loved always being able to know where the characters were. Will definitely be using it on our next cruise also!",
Very helpful to keep track of all that there was to offer on ship! Would definitely use again.,
20 + group all connected at all times,
"Up to date information, helped me schedule my trip activities!",
"Loved being able to see all activities on the ship, with times and locations! Very useful!",
It's Amazing tells you all you need to know about activities  aboard the ship !,
Our family was able to keep in touch onboard and easily find activities. Great app,
Was useful when it worked. Shouldve worked under their WI-FI but dodnt for me.,
Excellent for on-board information and keeping in contact with family members and friends.,
It's OK but stops working often.,
THIS WAS AN AMA ZING APP TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH MY FAM!,
It was helpful. Would have been even better if it also had our schedule!,
So helpful having the daily activity schedules super handy!,
"Very nice app to keep up with what's going on and menus, etc.",
If only the parks app worked as well.,
"Also, kept us informed everyday.",
It's was a good to use good map of the ship. It was a good way to keep in touch with your party.,
"Litally, an electronic navigator, and helps with daily restaurant  menus!! Amazing!!! Oh yeah, don't forget to use your disney emojis when you are commuting on the ship with others. Love it!!!",
Allow whole party to communicate anywhere on the ship and never had to use the cabin phone.,
It was useful when on board. I had a hard time staying connected to the WiFi though.,
Very useful but wished it showed our location during the cruse.,
It just keeps getting better.  Great to help make your cruise better.  A+++,
Great information and ability to communicate with our party.,
"This app is and was so helpful,i knew when all the cool show's and activites",
Loved it on the ship to keep in touch with kids as well as up to date activities on board.,
You always have the times of activities ready. I like the reminders.,
I was able to start up to date on my cruise. Worked perfect.,
This is a great app with all the times on it so you won't miss a thing,
This app works great with keeping you up to date on ship.  Excellent tool.,
This app works great for staying up to date on the activities that are available while cruising.,
This app came in handy keeping up with cruise activities and also was instrumental in navigating the ship. Thanks!,
Helpful app. Able to view daily events and keep in touch with group members,
Great for if you are going on the cruise or counting down to go.,
The app kept us up to date on everything that was happening around the ship.,
Must have app for all your on board fun and activities. Works well,
"Easy, easy, easy application to use. Always up to date. Done in true Disney fair...with a little magic.",
Great way to see what is happening on ship and to communicate with the group!,
It was easy to use and helped me stay in touch with my family while on the cruise.,
Very helpful for planning activities and other scheduling info and accessing dining info.,
It was great being able to keep in touch with friends and family on board. Absolutely loved the Disney emojis!,
Very useful when it worked without resetting itself!,
As someone who made lots of friends made it easy to keep in contact and make plans onboard!,
I wish the text worked better.,
It's so good that my booty cheeks fell off,
Cool and helpful but needs more to be able to be read eseyer,
It was beyond convenient and entertaining at times since youre on a boat,
It was an easy way to find out times and places it helped me a lot,
Always showed the correct information onto what was going on,
This is a have for a cruise to contact your family and gives directions and menus and activities,
I loved being able to track all the activities and check out menus in advance.,
My family and I used this app and it was very helpful,
Very useful for planning and making the best use of time,
Wonderful app was so helpful to have in the ship and a great way to keep track of countdown til our trip,
"Idk it was good for the cruise but can,be easily forgotten",
This app made it easy for us to keep in touch with our kids when we were at sea,
This app is awesome and so are all of the Disney cruises along with all of the Disney cruise members and the good qualities that the ships have,
So i liked it and it is really helpful with planning the activities but you should work on the chat i often only got messages when i clicked on the chat with the person and that wasnt good,
Nice app. Just found emojiis. So cute,
We had a large party of several different staterooms and this really helped us communicate.   Cutest emojis ever!,
It was very useful. Would use it again in the future.,
"It was convenient but, it froze up and was slow.",
"Works great to keep in touch while one the ship outside the country, and was also helpful to see the dinner menus!",
This was so useful when I was with my friends and wanted to tell my mom where I was going and I found a lot of things to do without having to go everywhere,
Amazing way to stay in touch on the boat! Dont leave without it!,
This was a great help.,
It was an excellent way to communicate with your family and made the disney experience great for me,
"Easy way to know, communicate, and plan what to do so you don't miss anything onboard.",
Very fun and helped with the cruise schedule and getting around the boat!,
Very helpful to navigate times and locations of activities on board.,
Love having all the information at my fingertips.,
Overall good. Would like to see selected activities listed,
Great app especially with four staterooms and 10 in our party!,
Glitchy.  Had to restart multiple times.,
Cannot do anything with app. Do we need to wait until we are on board? Doesn't that defeat the purpose for pre planning?,
I loved it i wish i could go on it again,
Nice for checking on event and contacting members of you party,
Great app to keep in touch with  other  family members,
Easy to keep in touch with other members of our party.,
Another great innovation by Disney!,
Very easy to use and very helpful!,
Great app to text family traveling with you.,
Outstanding shows and activities.,
Need the ability to send pics tho.,
Better than using the wave phones.,
Very helpful but useless anywhere but onboard,
Easy to use so informative loved the app,
Worked great onboard the disney fantasy!,
Kept me up to date on the shows and events,
Could use some updates on staying connected,
App GREAT! Internet service on Fantasy shak,
It was awesome to have everything at your fingertips!!!,
No need for paper or Connected@Sea!,
Invaluable for knowing what's going on and staying in touch.,
Great app.  Used it every day,
Very helpful on our cruise!,
LOVE LOVE LOVE the chat option!,
Always works,
Improvement could be made such as making notifications ring instead of vibrating,
Wow the entire ship at your fingertips,
Very helpful and user-friendly,
"Useful app, but connection keeps dropping",
Excellent application. Works as expected while on board.,
So easy to communicate with everyone in our group!,
It worked well,
Super handy. Cruise essential,
Wish they can add pictures taken though like in Disney app,
Must have for your cruise.,
Everything you need,
Used this app non stop on the cruise.,
The app. failed frequently.,
"This was a lifesaver during our cruise. Schedule at fingertips, deck plans and chat with people in your party.",
But for a couple glitches this app was fantastic.,
We used it lots of times to check activity schedules and where we needed to be on the ship,
very helpfully with events going on.,
Very nice to have onboard.,
Splotchy - isn't as useful as it needs to be,
Very useful and fun app.,
The in app messaging service was very buggy with Google keyboard.,
Only a few minor updates that might make it even better!,
Fantastic app!!,
This recent update causes random alarms on pixel devices.,
1st Disney Cruise to Puerto Rico,
Great way to communiate with others!!!,
I think this app is great!!!,
Awesome!!!!,
Very helpful!,
Very Helpful!,
Gotta love it!,
Works good!,
App is a time-saver,
Great app!,
Works well.,
Crashes on group chat,
Unstable and Excessive Freezing,
"Helpful, great!",
Great when on the cruise ship.,
Very useful on the go!,
This is a must have for any Disney cruise,
It helped me text my family,
Helpful on the ships!,
This app is a must if you are going on a disney cruise. It kept all our family member in touch.,
Loved it!,
Perfect!,
5 stars everywhere,
Made the cruise more enjoyable,
Worked great.,
Love it!!!,
Was very helpful,

"If you plan on taking a Disney Cruise you must download this app. It's basically all the info you need before, during and after your trip. Has ship map, activities schedule and a lot more!",
Limited use,
디즈니 매직 크루즈을 터고 아주좋은 여행을 할수있어 행복했고 앱 을 이용하니 아침점심저녁으로 행사나 저녁메뉴랑 을 미리알수있고 유익한 앱 이였어요 최고입니다,
App,
:),
😍😍😍😍,
A little wonky on putting messages through sometimes.  Would be nice if it would ring.  Great too if you could do wifi calling instead of carrying the wave phone also.  Missed a couple of messages from oceaneears club because it was difficult to carry two devices. Love the emoji feature.  Wish you could more easily contact those in linked reservations. Would also like a view like the navigator had for everything happening at the same time.,
"Has a lot of the info you need each day: menus, activities, etc. But the interface isn't as user friendly as you'd expect a Disney product to be. To me the best example of this is that if you want to ❤ an event to save it to your favorites, clicking on the time you wanted took you to the map of the location instead of letting you select it. Instead you had to tap the title, select from another menu for times and then back out of it to look at the next one. The texting feature is handy & works in most areas.",
"Very useful on ship. The chat was great. I'd like to see a search function to help locate specific content. The app has plenty of info, but it can be difficult to find. The emojis were fun, but a photo attachment option would be nice to message others in your party where you are and what you're seeing. Overall, a very helpful tool on ship, but a couple improvements would make it great.",
"Great for keeping track of menus and activities. I wish it had the ability to mark individuals' activities by color to coordinate  everyone' s chosen activities at once. And to add additional activities (beach, nap) to a schedule. Best part of texting app is being able to see when the recipient actually read their text. And the notification buzzes for long enough, you rarely miss it. Disney emoticons are fun. Android didn't have autocorrect for texting but iPhone did.",
"This is app was incredibly useful to find which activities that we wanted to participate in on board, even receiving notifications for events I had bookmarked. Maps and menus were accurate and helpful. However, the messaging was terrible. Half the time I wanted to use it, the other person was listed as ""away"" and never received the message.",
"Loved being able to view all of the ships daily activities and menus. Very handy to ""favorite"" those you wanted to take part in as well.  The map was a big help bc I apparently have no sense of port vs starboard when I'm inside the ship, lol.   We had a LOT of problems with the Chat function, however. It was constantly disconnecting and would require a reboot of the app and sometimes the phone itself.  With a large party like ours, this was a real pain when trying to figure out where everyone was, who had whose kids, etc. Hope they work out the bugs bc otherwise it was a fantastic addition to our cruise.",
"This would have been awesome if it was actually correct for our trip.  We were using it to contact each other and to use it to find things to do on ship so we didn't have to drag the paper around with us.  We were told after missing something we wanted to do by crew not to use it for the schedule.  It had what we wanted to do for our last day, and it had been on the first day.  We would see it, then it would disappear then we would see it again.",
Could use a bit more integration.  It would be nice to use just the app for corresponding with the kids labs.  Same thing for their RFID bracelets and tracking their location.  Kind of a pain where it reloads the DCL internet service every half hour or so and you have to click out of it.  It has a ton of useful information about the cruise,
"Timely, daily schedules to plan your day. . .catch up with Disney characters for photo ops. . .even decide what you'll order for dinner before you get there. Not to mention the benefit of texting your travel companions to meet up after going to separate activities. Loved it!",
"Pretty solid app that answers most of your questions about the ship itinerary, dining and entertainment.  It's free while onnoard and doesn't use paid data.  The best feature for those travelling together is the on board chat function, although it doesn't work off ship, and it sometimes wouldn't send messages.  If they can link this app with your existing schedule of excursions and appointments, it would be awesome.",
"A very good app to help you plan your day and keep in contact with your group. There are some small issues on how movie times/locations are displayed, and the menus option only showed that nights' dinner menu.",
"A must have if your on a Disney Cruise line. Very detailed to keep you up to date with everything the ship has to offer. I'm so glad I downloaded it before I arrived. It will save you a lot of time wondering where everything is located.  Check it out, you will be glad you did! Best trip ever!",
"Just got back and we used this app throughout the trip. On board chat was very useful. Only issues are: everyday you should close out and reopen app, and you won't get messages if app isn't opened. However, it's really the only function you'll need for the phone (or at least it should be...you're on vacation)...I'm sure disney is working on ways to improve (communication with oceaneer's club, integrating excursions/appointments, accessing photos)",
Deck plans for every floor. Activities available to favorite to notify before events. Chat abilities to keep up w/ family & even friends made on board. Activities also broken done by age or family. Dinner menus for each day per restaurants to view ahead of time. & hours of every location/pool/shop.,
Very helpful.  Only thing is u have to make sure u change the time on your phone. I was pleased with all the app did for me.,
So handy. The only drawback is that I now carry my phone around on a cruise because this app is so convenient to use.,
Served the purpose for the trip but constant rebooting to update and would be nice if it integrates with other apps (SwiftKey).,
"It was great to be able to see the descriptions on the deck. It was ok to communicate. IMO you should be able to call each other instead of text. The texts didn't go through in a timely enough manner. Sometimes you needed to reboot the app for it to work, and your texts to come through.",
"A great app to help us make our way around the ship. As first time cruisers we relied on it for everything from character activities, show times and dinner menus.",
It's ok. You can do just as well without  it. Halfway through the trip I stopped using it and just used the daily schedules placed in your room every night.,
"The chat function needs a lot of work, the app constantly needed to be restarted to get/send messages. It was informative and intuitive for the schedule and event details.",
Dropped service quite often  on my Android phone. Not a user up on technology and  uses these app things.  No Introduction of how to use - a walk through for elderly persons.,
"Would like to link in state room, reservation number, and such so that excursions appear in activities and photos are viewable, would also be cool if shipmates could upload and download photos to share",
Having the entire schedule in the palm if your hand is fantastic. It was quick to bring up and easy to move through the schedule. The only issue was the Chat feature didn't always work. It would say we were away even if we were standing next to each other on the ship.,
"Not only did our family stay connected with all the events that were happening throughout the day on the ship, we were able to stay connected with each other very quickly, while not incurring any costs.",
"Wish you could book things on it like spa, dinner, or excursions. Wish it had pricing for things.",
"Would be better if could use in landscape mode. Wish I could add personal appts like spa times, etc",
"Worked well on the ship, only lost connection 1 time. Chat feature was really nice only wished I could have setup a group for the family instead of doing each one at a time.",
So update with things going on around the ship. The chat feature is a life saver.,
"This was extremely HELPFUL during our cruise with keeping in contact with my teenager and other family members. The only disadvantage for me was there was no sound notification only blinking light, other than that it was GREAT.",
Worked great even on the Castaway Cay. Not getting 5 stars bc sometimes it had trouble loading. But over all great.,
The app was great.  It was better than carrying a paper around the whole time.  I was able to keep up with showtimes and character appearances. Plus we were able to communicate through the chat.,
"Everything I needed was right there in this app, from kid's activities to dining room menus to entertainment schedules and more. I love it.",
"This app made it super simple to keep in touch with family. Although the event times were not always correct, the map helped greatly!",
Thus app has lots of issues. Times for events were almost never right,
The app is great and works well. It may have spoiled me because I would have liked for it to do more.,
"By using the favorite feature, we never missed any activity. It would be great to see a running total of the charges to the state room.",
Need to fix the delay in the chats. Plus add gps location especially for kids with the wrist bands. Where you can find them on the anywhere ship. Good app for meal and character meet and greet,
Let me know what was happening around the ship and the kids club for me and my sister. Thanks! Will use this on next Disney cruise.,
"I found this app is much better than the paper navigator.  Especially for tracking characters.  Also, being able to check out the dining menu ahead of time is really great.",
It was really nice to use while on the ship.   I could create favorites and plan my say easily.  Never had to carry a bulky wave phone.,
This app is wonderful.  Was so easy to use. Very accurate so we never missed a thing.  Would be even better is if it had a GPS to be able to show you where you are on the ship.,
"They fixed almost all issues, only complaint is that there is no sound, and only a single vibration.",
"We found the app very useful while onboard the Disney Dream for staying in contact with family members, for finding out what activities are going on, and for finding our way around the ship. I wish it also had a map of Castaway Cay so we wouldn't need to carry a paper map of the island with us.",
Great for schedules and menus.  Would have been 5 star but communications between family  members on three cruise sometimes took 2 days to receive.  Not a good on ship communication tool,
Needs a couple more features for 5 star but a truly solid app for keeping track of all the stuff to do aboard the cruise.,
The best for your cruise.  This gives you everything that your cruise navigator has on.    This is great because you can set everything you want to do and not carry the paper navigator with you.  You can also see what's happening the whole cruise.,
We used this app while on vacation with our 2 sons while on the Disney Dream cruise. My husband planned this for my 50th Birthday!  This app was fun and counted down up to departure.  Great and easy to use while on ship to see the Navigator on cell and to plan our activities and movie/show schedule. :),
"Wonderful source of great info while on our cruise. There was so much to do, this really helped us know where to go and what to do.",
This app is majorly helpful on the cruise.  You can set reminders for things you want to do.  And the sorting system is very good as well.,
"Disney wave phones don't allow for group text. Plus App allowed for quick info check for activities,  meal times, etc.",
"Great way to know what is going on throughout the day from character greetings to shows to activities, as well as being able to text chat with friends you meet on the ship.",
"I love having access to all the activities, menus, and character appearances at my fingers. And I use the countdown feature to help motivate me through the long work weeks while I'm waiting to be home onboard again. So glad this app is here, and I'd really recommend it for anyone planning to go on a Disney cruise!",
"Works great. I believe there is a lot more functionality which can be added to the app.  How about replacing the room phones with the ability to use a smartphone for on ship calling, rather than just messaging.",
"Would like to see an update that permits use 5 to 7 days prior to departure (yes, the information would only be accurate for the cruise prior), to allow less tech savvy individuals to become more familiar with functions and navigation.  Overall,  great app!",
"Primary way we kept touch with our party of 10. There were periodic delays, but not too bad.",
Very useful onboard. Didn't need the paper navigator that was left every night. My daughter was always taking my phone to look up what was going on at a certain time.,
"This app was wonderful. We were about to plan our day and keep on schedule to ensure we did everything we said we wanted to do, the reminders were perfect. Plus the maps and menus were fantastic",
Continually disconnects wifi several times a day and the keyboard has no auto spell check leaving me making grammar corrections while I'm supposed to be vacationing. Still way better than the staterooms have and carry phones.,
We got a lot of use out of the app! It kept our three families in contact over the course of the trip. We also liked saving the activities we were interested in for each day and the reminders helped keep us from being late. The only criticism is that it didnt include our preplanned reservations. We missed one event bc we became so reliant on this app and forgot to double check our paper tickets one day.,
Was a good way to chat while on board. I used the paper navigator more than the app tho. Wish there was live ship info. Location. Heading etc. Useless while not on the ship,
It was great having this app to see what was going on and texting my party members.  I also enjoyed checking the menu for lunch and dinner.,
"This app made the cruise so much easier. This was our family's first cruise, which in itself was a bit overwhelming. Figuring out deck locations and times for various events was less stressful with this smartly-designed app.",
Found this app easy to use and everyday it had what was going on. You could favourite an activity and it would remind you.,
"Easy to use, and stay connected. Could see all events and categorized intuitively. My favorite was being able to see the dinner menu to start thinking about it early, like at breakfast!",
"It was helpful, but didnt contain the latest information and also when you are out of the app the onboard chat doesnt work unless you pay for it, so it wasnt helpful when you only want to communicate with your party onboard",
Great app to keep up with all that goes on. Really like the way you can favorite things and then have a My Favorite Things Schedule.,
Great app to use when you're on a Disney cruis ship. Doesn't count against your data.,
Used it on a recent transatlantic cruise... Was incredibly helpful to communicate with everyone else in group. Kept track of events on the ships.. Loved the reminders. And it was free to use even better,
We liked the app a lot as a way to talk to our teens and decide our plans for the day. The disney emojis are fun too.... Hope they can add auto correct soon and also a screen with the ships position on a map and speed etc,
"This is a great app to organize and communicate while onboard. I would love to see more options before boarding, such as looking at cruise details and booking activities/excursions.",
On the dream and the chat function was horrible.  The app itself needs to be updated as menu's were not correct.,
Great way to keep up to date on what events are taking place and when. As well as character schedules and dining menus!,
"Wonderful app as expected from Disney. Always knew where and when events were happening along with a 15 min notification prior to the event. Abilities to mark favorite activities and see days ahead  for dining menu, activities, character appearances, kids activities, etc.",
"Disney has improved the app from the hot mess that it was last year. It is still inconsistent at times, though. And, for android, the sync for sunrise/sunset stopped after the first day.",
Wished it linked to oceaneer club/lab so i didnt need to carry the wave phone too. It's a little glitchy but liked the text feature for my group.,
"The app was a great help. It was nice being able to see what was for dinner, where the characters were and what was happening on the ship.",
"App was very helpful on the ship. Was able to get info on what was going on.  Dining room menus, movie times, character places and times and the ship lay out.",
Wonderful to help you plan your day. Dinning and movies could be also included in the schedule to make it complete.,
It has all the shows and movies times. The menus for the restaurants. My only complaint is I wish it had a map of  the ship. Other than that good amp to have on a Disney Cruise.,
"Gave daily updates regarding show tines, dinner menus, character appearances, pretty much everything you wanted to know while on the ship.",
Easy to find out all the events of the day. The time. The location. Even had a layout of the ship to help you find your way!,
Everything about this app is good except the messaging tool.  It quit working during our cruise and our family members weren't getting messages.  Other than that I highly recommend it!,
You were able to see all of the activities that were going on during the cruise. The online chat was great to in some places on the ship it didnt work but it still was very useful.,
Much easier for me to find times and activities while onboard.  Make sure you load it before you set sail.,
"Messages came up to a 1 day delay! Good concept, poor performance.",
This app made our cruise so much easier to plan our activities and keep up with family members. It had all the information that we needed.,
Good but had to keep re-starting app to see messages. Also make sure everyone you want to communicate with is on your list.,
I had no issues with this app. Connected to the WiFi like it said. Let me talk to my family members like it said. It gave me updates of the events coming up...like it said. All good things.,
The app will great. But wish we could get notification when sosomeone chatted with us on board. Other than that we loved it!,
"It shows everything going on , on the ship, we loved it.I stayed connected with my family with it.We planned activities using it.",
"Often not responsive, no spell checking or auto complete. The main function that I used was onboard chat. This would just hang in the middle of typing a word - very frequently and for 20 secs or more.",
Great app super helpful with keeping up with events and deck plans. Get this app as soon as you get on ship,
"Everything you need at your fingertips. Stay in touch with your cabin mates, kids or new friends. Decide what you'll be having for dinner by checking out the menu. Bookmark events you want to attend and more.",
This app was a great way to communicate with other members of your family and also keep up with all the cruise activities.,
The app worked as designed on board and made keeping in touch with our party easy.  5 stars if the figure out how to have the app be more than a count down calendar leading up to the trip.,
This app is a great way to communicate with others while you are onboard without being charged for WiFi or through your provider. I wish it showed your location on a map but that isn't a big issue.,
"Just came back from the disney cruise, (the Dream) and this app was perfect, could text, check time and events. Only wish we could call in the future instead of using wave phones.",
This app was wonderful. Definitely helped us around the ship and keep track of everything that was going on and all of the character appearances.,
"Very helpful app to have for cruising. We could check the menus for dining each evening, and find out about everything that was going on on board including times and locations. Handy for keeping in touch with your fellow cruisers too",
App was updated daily so we never missed a thing. Very accurate and easy to use.,
"It took a few days to get to know all the features, but it was very helpful even before I realized all the information it contained.",
"The only flaw, is the messenger part. Sometimes it takes forever to receive a message. But other than that, i absolutely LOVE this app, and cant wait for my next cruise!!",
This was awesome and a good thing to have to keep you updated on daily activities. I would use it again.,
This app made it super easy to communicate with family aboard the ship as well as navigate through all of the activities and decks! Great job Disney!!,
"Only knock on it, not always up to date",
Great app to stay in touch on what is the size of a floating Disney city on water...Very informative! You always know what's on.,
Very good app to used around disney cruise ship. 1 bad thing notification only vibrate no tone sound.. everything are perfect.,
"this app is very helpful with show times, character meet and greet, menus and more. Absolutelylovethe countdown. to your trip!",
Great app when on the ship without Internet tells you what activities there are and stuff very helpful,
"So easy yo use,  keep in touch and not miss a single event.  Loved it.",
Knowing what's going on all the time was perfect! Being able to text was perfect especially since I didn't 100% have the wave phones down packed! I would only suggest the kids club being able to text through the app.,
Extremely helpful and easy to use. Particularly liked the on board chat feature. No need to tote around a wave phone!,
Made keeping up with all activities for everyone so much easier! Recommend to all to use when sailing DCL.,
We had such a large group sailing with us I can't imagine going without the chat feature in the app. I loved being able to see the times and locations of all the events as well as get a sneak peak of each menu!,
"It was easy to use. Was able to know what was going on at all time, and add activities to favorites.",
"It was nice to have on the cruise, especially to 'favorite'  some activities I wanted to check out. Would be nice to include the dinner menu at Cabanas. Would be nice if the maps showed bathrooms and laundry too:)",
Great way to stay in touch and meet up with family members. Also great way to see activity lineups and descriptions.,
The app while on board would drop off the network alot.  It would be great to be able to get the notifications for pickup of the kids on the app and not needing to go pick up a wave phone from the stateroom,
Free guest WiFi on board for use of this app. Great to review activity schedule and keep in contact with friends on board.,
Very helpful when looking for when things are happening.  Never really looked at the paper Navigators.,
Missing some of the activities that were going on. And they didn't update it when some of the characters were out and about.,
This app was helpful in keeping us informed of all onboard events as well as giving us the ability to stay in touch with other guests through its texting platform.,
"This app was a great way to communicate with the rest of the family on board and to know about all the activities and their schedule, restaurants and menus. All together was an amazing experience and impeccable service... thank you!!",
We had so much fun and would have been totally lost without this app. Thanks so much for having it. We cannot wait for our next cruise already!!,
Great app. Would like spell check & something other then vibrate for notices,
Made it so easy to navigate the ship and know when events came up. Chat parts needs work.,
Very helpful throughout our 5 day cruise! Keeps us on schedule and super easy to use. The chat function was our main way of communicating with each other between 4 families.,
App freezes a lot on Galaxy/ android phones.... very useful when functioning .,
"Used this in conjunction with the Navigator they give you each day. Very useful, well organized and used it to group text everyone in our group!!",
Great tool to have while on board. Easy to keep up with family members and to know what activities are going on,
This app helped us get around so quickly and efficiently! You can find everything in one place without carrying a ton of paper around!,
It would be great if you could access the text conversations once you are off the ship.   Get a fellow cruiser's information?  There's no way to dig it out of the app once you are out of wifi range.  The app becomes a brick.,
This app was exactly what our family needed to keep in contact with each other on the ship.,
This app is amazing. It had all the info I needed on the cruise. Everything!,
We are platinum DCL cruisers and know well the need to highlight and carry the paper navigator to ensure your days plans are on track. The navigator app puts this on your phone and all is you to make specific activities favorites with notifications automatic 15 minutes prior to the event. The chat feature is an excellent addition!! I would like to see a feature to add reminders not related to listed events (e.g. sunset).,
This app is a Navigator in your hands! It also allows you to text people on the ship! You don't need Data just turn Airplane mode on and start chatting!,
I loved that my husband and I could message each other thru the app! Perfect for on board activities and highly recommend!,
"So much easier to find out where events were happening, save events I definitely wanted to attend so I would receive a notice when they were approaching, and keep up to date on everything Disney!! Loved it!!",
"This was sooo helpful throughout our cruise! Easy to navigate, and fun to use.",
"This app was a lifesaver, kept me organized and on time for every activity and character appearances.",
This app was amazing.  It helped us get the most out of our cruise.,
"Overall, great app. It would be beneficial to combine the schedule.",
I had no problem with the app on the ship. It gave me alerts and information I needed.,
It was a great tool for us on the trip but it was hard to get our whole party in the same chat. We had 13 people with 5 rooms in our party and some times the message would come through almost the next day when we were trying to get ahold of each other. I all so didn't under stand why the phone didn't have sound when you got a message or even make it so you could with being on the ship it was easy to miss messages just as well and not even getting them.,
App was easy to use. Cruise was incredible! We used the app for all our activity choices.,
This app was very helpful to navigate me around and whenever I was board I checked here and there was always something to do. Thank You Disney,
Excellent app to have! Helps plan out your days ahead of time by checking out the activities available ahead of time! Easy to use!,
"Very helpful app. Really helpful when sailing to clarify menus,  activities,  and character appearances.",
So much better than carrying around paper schedules and maps!,
Used it on previous cruises. Excellent! Other cruise lines should take note.,
This app is easy to use and has the day-to-day itinerary for the cruise. Definitely download it for your cruise!,
So much info at your fingertips. Loved it! Use it every cruise.,
"The chat function is super convenient, and it helps to have deck maps, dining menus, announcements, and daily activity guides aboard. It would be even better if it was also synched with the cruise planner (pre-cruise website tool), because once you're on board and see all there is to do, it's easy to forget about your ticketed plans. The app would be fantastic if it could reliably connect passengers ashore with the ship & their onboard party in case of emergency.",
Helpful staying in touch with family and seeing scheduled events and activities!!!,
NEED NEW EMOJIS! Very good app tho. Extremely useful and nicely designed.,
Love knowing when things are going on even if I lose the paper navigator :),
Helped us manage time and get the most out of our trip. Awesome!,
A great tool to have to stay informed and communicate with our family while on the ship. It needed to be reset a few times which means loosing all your favorites and chat info,
As others have said great but could be incredible given some UI tweeks.,
Great way to interact and have all of your cruise info at your fingertips during the trip!,
This app was so nice. We were able to keep up with all the activities.,
Just did the cruise last week and this was so helpful! Love it.,
Just got back & used this app everyday!,
It help out so much with getting around the ship.,
"I really liked the app, everything you need is in this app, including adding your favorite activities with a reminder!",
The Disney emojis were really fun!! I wish I had them on my regular phone!!,
Did not have a problem the entire time I was on the ship.,
Great for families to keep in touch in the cruise to coordinate meeting for events.,
Wonderful app and easy to use. Everything about the cruise is on this app,
Simple to use and keeps you informed of everything going on for the day and the entire trip.,
"Easy, on time, and fun as usual.",
This app is so wonderful. It's easy to keep track of all the fun around the ship!,
"This app was used extensively, and was very helpful while on the ship!!  Easy to navigate around!!",
Its awesome great i love it i love it the best app ever,
would be better if you could add your own events such as spa appointments and excursions,
Really came in handy for activities and keeping in touch with people you are traveling with,
Especially helpful for finding character times on the go,
Made it very easy to keep up with what was going on on the ship,
Great app simple and easy to use and great when your on board the ship,
Everything you need in one place!,
Very convenient to have on the ship.,
Wonderful way to communicate with others in our party. Loved the different emojis while texting!,
Very helpful so is the people that help you at the help desk,
"Perfect and very helpful for cruise , thank you.",
Loved using it on the boat. :) Very helpful.,
Really useful.Worked quickly and easily.,
Loved the app.  Wish I knew how to make it louder for the notifications.,
This app is Great!!! It kept us in formed of everything going on in the cruise. Character appearances to show times etc.,
This  app was very helpful,
Great  idea works well..,
Loved every minute of it.,
Love this app. It helps so much when you are on the ship,
Great!,
Useful for enjoying all the features of the cruise,
This app is so cool my kids love it,
This app was very helpful while on our cruise,
Worked great to communicate with each other on the boat,
"Very useful, very easy to use",
This app is amazing.,
Very helpful and save lots of time!,
Great app for everything I needed.,
Could not find ships position on the app.,
This app really helped !,
Very helpful both before and during the cruise,
Good tool to keep up with activities on ship,
A quick easy way to stay connected,
"Very easy to use, and helpful",
Love it all information in your hand.,
Super easy to use. It made our cruise even more enjoyable!!!!,
Great way to know what is happening on the ship and way to communicate.,
Wonderful way of communication onboard.,
Gave great information.,
Menus not always consistent,
I wish there was a countdown widget to go along with the app so I could see a count down to our next cruise!,
Great app!,
Really useful & helpful.,
Worked well...,
It doesnt have a search bar,
Great Tool!!,
Family vacation,
Good app,
Loved it!!!,
Great!,
This was so helpful,

Dcl Navigator app,
App worked well,
Life saver,
Really helpful,
Coolest cruise,
Very practical,
Great app,
Worked graet,
I love it,

☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆,
"I use the app mostly for the countdown feature prior to a cruise. On board I put my phone in the safe and lock it up so I can enjoy being with my family and friends. We did try to use the new chat feature last month while on the ship, but found it difficult to get some of our group member added, so the phone went back in the safe.",
"I found it to be intuitive and User friendly. The ability to favorite activities, which creates alerts, and be able to see the full cruise helps to prioritize activities that occur later. However, I Miss the ability of offline post-cruise review of favorited events offered by paper, especially for journalling. Consistent dropping of Wifi network onboard led to poor communication of family members. Forces family to stare at phone at dinner to plan.",
"Very nice app, some inconsistencies with times or locations but most of the time it was spot on.  Nice that it sends you reminders before events you added as favorites.  The ship maps were helpful.  I used the messenger aspect most (with new friends we made on the ship and kids friends as well). As a bonus it worked seamlessly with my smart watch (grear s)",
"Being able to see all the activities & save ones I was interested in was great. Having the menus for each restaurant was also very helpful. The chat system has some issues. We started a group chat but half way through the cruise people weren't getting the group messages only individual ones. Overall, I think it was a very useful app.",
"I forgot to put my phone in airplane mode and just turned off my data until it was too late. My clock synced up to some odd random time and then had trouble getting things to work because my time was off by about 7 hours.  This was not the apps fault, but did make using the app difficult.  Don't forget to put your phone in airplane mode and you'll be fine.",
We have an awesome time on the Disney cuise. Just 2 cautious. Don't buy work that people try to sell you on the first day. Second once you experience disney you are ruined for life. No other company can even be compared to disney. They have the best staff in the world. And of course they have thought of everything. Well done disney.,
"The app is useful. It has info on all the shows and activities on the cruise. It also allows you to chat with friends and family on the cruise as well. It works by connecting to the shipboard wifi network. BUT: my phone and app routinely lost connection to the shipboard wifi, so the chat function is almost useless. I think that might be an issue with their network configuration. Also, it would be useful to add a search function. Then I could type in keywords like ""movie"" or ""trivia"".",
My husband and I loved the chat feature so we could communicate when we weren't together.  The ability to see dinner menus in advance is great. Plus the ability to see all the upcoming times a character is scheduled for the entire cruise makes planning convenient. The only thing missing is the ability to add personal appointments like spa treatments,
Half of the time would disconnect from Wi-Fi so we weren't getting or text. The other half you would send a text and it would take hours to reach the other person. If these two things were corrected I would have gave 5 stars and it would be the best. Also wish you would extend this to castaway key.,
This app gets 5 stars for the fun countdown calendar and onboard activity management system. We had significant issues on board with the texts. Some were received and others were not. As a result communication through the texting part of the app easy not something we could rely on therefore we ended up carrying 2 phones on board: the wave phones to call others in our party and our cell phones for the activities feature. Hope this can be fixed in the future,
"It crashed a lot on all of our devices. The navigator is not as updated as paper version and chat messages sometimes would come hours later. We ended up using whatsApp more even though it used up our data. I hope this app will get better and better for future cruises. I like the reminder for events and if the chat worked, it would have been perfect.",
"For those that already do everything on your phone, this is a great app for your Disney Cruise. Didn't have to carry around the paper navigators and the chat function is great. Only issue we had, and it might have just been our phones, is the notification when you get a chat message was only the vibrate. We never did figure out how to get the sound to work. But still a very handy tool that kept us on schedule.",
"Fabulous app to give you all the daily information you need to be ""In the Know"" when onboard. Gives you the schedule of activities,  menus for the Disney Cruise restaurants etc. You can also tag an activity as Favorite to remind you so you don't miss it. Even better, you can stay in touch with members of your party onboard. Totally convenient app!",
I loved the app to keep in touch with other family members in my group. The only thing was we kept losing connection and had to keep connecting to the ship's Wi-Fi. We also were able to find out what was going on around the ship like activities for all the kids groups and character greetings and shows!,
"I loved this app on our cruise a couple years ago. A very useful resource. They now added chat, which would be great for us because we were a group of 18. But worse than not having a chat feature is to have one that's not reliable. It repeatedly wouldn't send my messages because it said I wasn't connected to WiFi (I was). It would also not receive messages. Group chat was cool when worked, but I didn't get a group chat icon, so couldn't access it. I had a notice of an unread chat, but couldn't read it.",
"We just returned from a 7 night trip on the fantasy and we used this app a lot.  It was great for all the content and the countdown feature but we kept dropping WiFi.  We constantly had to reconnect to get out texts,  so needless to say we missed a lot of messages.  I'd  give this app 5 stars if the WiFi issues could be resolved.  Both my husband and are using S5s running android 5.1.1.",
The app would not stay connected. Throughout the cruise I had to keep connecting to WiFi any time I wanted  to email our friends through the app who were also on the boat. It was more trouble than it was worth. I have a droid she has an iphone and she had no trouble. So disappointed!,
"Not nearly as useful as the regular disney parks app,  which lists all your dining reservations and fast passes. This one doesn't list already reserved shore excursions,  spa appointments,  etc. So while it has plenty of info it doesn't customize itself to you and your schedule.",
This app was excellent! I used it to tag favorites for activities daily and it would alarm to let one know that the event was approaching. Made the experience that much more organized and enjoyable. I wouldn't even look at the daily paper schedule. Only issue was that texts we're not always received and would remain in a pending status. Definitely recommend.,
"The app was OK for keeping up with activities, but there were two issues... 1) the request to buy an upgraded Internet connection kept popping up and 2) all the messages from a group text reloaded every 10 minutes. This happened for three days. I even had the app reset by the IT guy on the ship. Had to stop using it because it was so annoying.",
"I rated it low in hopes my review will be seen. We just finished our 1st ever cruise, Thanks Disney now we are hooked :) The app was very helpful. I would like to see it have more personal items. Like our dining times or reservation times for Palo. It would be sweet to have some sort of gps or ship location feature. I kept getting lost. Over all a great app keep up the good work.",
"I used the app quite a bit keeping track of dinner menus as well as times for all activities, character meet ups, shows, restaurant times.  Also used the ship chat to keep in touch with everyone if we were split up",
"It was so helpful and easy! I looked up what to do for adults and it listed everything by time and a description and where it was on the ship. if you weren't sure it showed a map of how to get there.  There was so much more, restaurants, menus,  times , ect, just another thing that Disney does better than every other cruise line.",
"Would have given it 5 stars, if we could have been able to use it before we got on the ship to help plan our vacation. Also some of the information changed, and wasn't updated. A fantastic application otherwise. We knew exactly what we were going to do on the ship every day because of it.",
"This ap is great for pre-cruise countdown  and decent for onboard navigator.  It was terrible,  though, for onboard messaging.  Kept disconnecting from wifi and messages were delayed by hours. No audible signal/notification that a message finally came through (again, if you hadn't been dropped by wifi). Step it up Disney!",
"This app helped us get around and learn what was going on during our cruise. Most useful (to me) were the dining menus, the chat feature, and the ability to get notifications when the scheduled time of a""favorite"" activity approached. Some suggested enhancements would be better integration with on board WiFi services (EG being able to check usage from the app), and maybe figuring out a way to integrate with the detective agency game. Did crash a few times.",
"Data was occasionally out of date, especially menus, but generally very useful. Liked being able to text other members of my party. The custom emojis were super cute. It would have been great if there was a way to download the app for free once aboard, since not everyone in my group remembered to pre-load it. Those slight changes, plus being able to share photos over the app, would have made it 5 star.",
"As some others have mentioned, the app is great except the texting, which is the main reason why we used this app (we like the calendar feature on the Navigator better than the app anyways to see a nice overview of the activities). I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and my husband an HTC One. His phone worked way better with the app than mine. For me, connection would constantly drop and I would get msgs bundled together hours after they were sent. Also, I wish there was an easier way to search for people.",
"It had a few glitches here and there. Whenever I would open Onboard Activities, the app would crash. Also, it would be nice to have access to it prior to boarding in order to plan ahead. At least 2 weeks in advanced would be acceptable. There was a lot going on and not a lot of time to do everything. A lot of the characters were in places around the ship and no announcement or schedule was made to let us know. It was a hit or miss. Also, please find a way to post meal cutoff times for breakfast and lunch.",
"Just finished the 7 night Fantasy cruise.  App worked as advertised,  but I would like to see the following changes:  make it work on Castaway cay.   Add the 'bridge information' such as position,  depth,  map of position and weather.   Maybe add a Shutters component se we can add/ order photos instead of waiting in long lines.  Overall I like the app.",
"It would be nice to be able to enter my reservation # and chat with others that will be on the same cruise.  Also, a sneak peek at the itinerary or schedule would be nice before the cruise as well so we can roughly plan out what we might want to do ahead of time. I know we'll change our minds a few dozen times before the actual cruise,  but half the fun is the anticipation.  Right  now,  the only thing it's good for before the cruise is the count down timer and I had higher hopes before I downloaded it.",
"I've used this app on every Disney cruise I've been on. Love the app on the ship. I used to love the count down. It was fun when it was a suitcase, now its... blah. Very disappointed with that. 😐 BTW Carnival Cruiseline's countdown is more fun. I guess I'll be searching for another cruise countdown that will look more fun for my Disney cruises.",
"Enjoyed the app. Having the navigator for the entire cruise in the palm of my hand was sweet. I loved the chat feature as we had more folks than phones.     Downside was it kept dropping the WiFi so I would lose contact. It was tiresome to keep re-connecting all the time.  Also an audible chirp would help as I couldn't feel the vibe. They said they didn't add it because it would be a distraction in the shows, but honestly like there aren't already distractions on a cruise full of KIDS lol.",
"This app has promise to make communication and planning onboard easier. But, everyone in my party, with 2 different kinds of phones, kept getting disconnected from the wifi, meaning we weren't getting texts until we manually reconnected.",
"Absolute necessity to keep informed and connected with each other on the ship.  You will probably have to change your time setting to not get the time from the Wi-Fi server and just set it manually. We could see what was happening, mark our favorites, and text each other where we and our kids were.  It was a million times better than the onboard phones they give you.",
How to us to plan our trip at breakfast every morning. We knew where we wanted to go and where we wanted to be. It allowed my husband and I to keep track of all of our children and to let them know where we expected them to be so we could do things as a family and they could do things on their own. We have taken several cruises but we will never take another cruise that is not supported by Disney.,
"Very useful once onboard with daily schedule and messaging. Pre-cruise functionality is weak. Would like to be able to access own reservation and schedule for spa/dining/excursions/etc. Could use a ship locator, deck plans and weather. Being able to play the mickey whistles would be a fun function for this app.",
"Essentially just like having a Personal Navigator on your phone, except it's interactive and you can look back or forward through the daily itineraries and dinner menus. It makes planning each day of your trip, from activities to dining, so much easier, without having to wait for your Personal Navigator to be delivered to your stateroom reach night. Planning would be made even easier if the capability to filter out activities you're not interested in or a personal itinerary maker were added.",
"The chat was super useful but buggy. Once you create a group and send a message, you couldn't add new people to it. The app is not personalized to your scheduled activities which would make it better. They could also easily use the app for the feedback survey instead of paper.",
"It was so helpful on board.  I could look up activities for the week, so it helped me more than the paper navigator which only showed you the next day.  I also liked to look at the menus for the restaurants so i could plan my other meals.",
"This app was very helpful. It kept me updated with all the daily activities. It also allowed me to communicate with friends and family onboard. If I could add one thing, it would be the ability to see where other members of your party are on the ship (with their consent of course).",
"Used the app all week last week, I'm not sure if you should ever cruise without it, anything you wanted to know or do, easy to find,  not to mention texting those in your party when no cell service can be found.",
"It has a chat feature that will help you connect with other passengers that also have a smart phone. I gave it three stars because of a couple items.  1. The chat feature needs to be integrated into the smart device's alerts. I didn't even know I received a message unless I looked at my phone,  which in a large group comes in handy when you found someone's child.  2. Alerts that are sent to the room's wave phone should also alert this app. (If tied into 1., then very useful). Installed on a GALAXY S5 Active",
"Awesome. Being able to chat real-time with the group was a crucial feature in terms of maximizing our time doing activities around the ship with the whole family and minimizing the time spent finding them.  Sends you notifications when your starred events are upcoming and also comes with a deck level layout for not if...but WHEN you get turned around.  Well played Disney...well played. The only drawback is that the app goes Mission Impossible on you after the cruise is over. It self-destructs your info, and reverts back to just a countdown timer. It would have been really cool to be able to look back on all the events and activities, laugh at stupid texts, etc...take screenshots if you have any interest in that I suppose.  Also...offering an option for a direct line to the Oceaneers club would be probably start to minimize the wavephones onboard, which are pretty weak sauce.",
"Just came off a wonderful 5 night cruise on the Magic!  We all have Samsung Galaxy phones and had downloaded the app.  My kids could use the chat service, but we couldn't as ours was a whopping 1 year older than theirs and the DCL Internet kept dropping.  If all 4 of us could have chatted thru the app, I would give it 5 stars!",
"The concept is great, but it is really difficult to share and store chat numbers. Chats don't always come through in a timely manner, even if the app is running. Navigator content doesn't stay updated with the latest offerings when they change throughout the day.",
"This app is awesome and I love that it will give me reminders of what is going on around the ship! My only complaint is the text feature.  At first it worked fine with all of us (we were a party of 20). Then I couldn't receive group texts and my brother in law would get them hours later. By the middle of our stay,  we had just given up. I plan on cruising again so PLEASE OH PLEASE fix the texting part of the app!!",
"Very clean, simple, effective.  If only every conference had an app like this as well! Would have loved device to device VoIP or even video.  Samsung's WiFi wouldn't stay connected because it didn't think it was on the internet.  Not the apps fault, but if your on-ship server could trick it into believing the internet is OK, this app would have been 100x more helpful for chat.  Also, would have been nice to get even a PDF of all my liked events just as a reminder of all the great fun!",
"We were a family of 6, across 3 state rooms, traveled Dec. 26, 2015-jan 2, 2016 on Fantasy. We had a combo of i phone, android and i pad devices. This app was an easier choice for communication v. the Wave phones on board. Constantly had to restart the WiFi so there was a delay in sending/receiving messages so not the most reliable. I did not receive group texts but others in my party had no problem. Excellent in terms of info about on board activities, dining, maps, etc.",
They need to add a few updates including ability to book spa or dinner. This app was helpful mostly for keeping in touch with the kids.  The app should also include detailed instructions on how to shut down other apps on android and iPhone during the cruise.,
"Surprisingly usefully while on board the ship, the app keeps you informed of the day to day activities, let's you tag activities that interests you, and provides reminders for the items you tag. In addition, it has its own, useful chat system to IM with family members on the ship. My one regret was not bringing along some old unused Android phones for the kids to carry around the ship so I could easily chat with them. Next time!",
"We've been on Disney before & didnt have the app so this time was an even better experience! Before all we had was the navigator set out the night before to know the next day schedule. This app worked out so well especially with texting & being able to get in touch with friends/family anywhere on board. This made things so much easier. I especially loved knowing when the next disney movie was coming on & where. The app was easy to use, will definitely recommend & get again next cruise!",
"Just got home from the Disney Fantasy Caribbean Cruise and this app is a priceless piece of your cruise. The favorites with reminders makes sure you'll get to do everything you want! And that chat is a must to keep in touch with everyone. Especially if you're traveling with teenagers. Only drawback was that I don't think this app has a ring tone. It vibrates, but no sound for alerts for either chat or reminders. Still worth 5 stars regardless! Enjoy",
"The app was good...I would have given it five stars, but the times on some of the activities were wrong, causing us to miss a few things.  After that, we went back to the more reliable paper Navigator",
Always losing or destroying my navigator left me guessing plans or locations.  Keeping my phone with me allowed me to find events or forgotten locations.  Didn't use the chat but it is a great option.  Would like to have chat open with the Oceaneer Lab so we wouldn't have to carry the ship phone around.  Trust my waterproof case than I did those phones.,
"I would have been so lost without this app!!!!  Was super helpful to keep track of all character events, shows, map of ship and so much more!  I am going to miss having something on my phone to keep me organized on a trip like this app did!  I would give more stars if I could.  See ya real soon Mickey.",
"We never got lost, we were never late to events.  If I could make any suggestion it would be that you give us a calendar and the things we favorite show up there.  This way we could keep track of Port adventures, meet N greets, dinner times, etc.",
"The fact that you cannot get an audio alert when you get a text in the group chat, keeps the score low.",
"I love the app and what it can do. Love the improved texting and all the Emojis! Consider adding more emojis!!! PLEASE ALLOW TO BE ABLE TO ADD PERSONAL EVENTS, LIKE MEET UP WITH FAMILY, SPA VISIT, SHOPPING TIME, SHORE EXCURSIONS OR CASTAWAY CLUB EVENTS THAT ARE NOT ON THE SCHEDULE. Consider adding a note section so you have a spot for family members stateroom numbers for when you can't remember it. Need to work on battery draining, it has improved but it still drains it.  Need to streamline for finding and adding favorites, there are TOO MANY clicks in order to add something to your schedule.  Option for personalizing and layout would be a nice feature. Found dinner menus, this was a nice feature. Would love to see breakfast and lunch menus.  Consider adding the capability of ordering dinner in advance via the app.",
Over all the app was ok. Messages were not always delivered quickly. Scheduled events were not always listed or easy to find.,
"Loved having this app onboard! The messaging was more convenient than the wave phones provided and everything was at my fingertips. The only thing I would have liked different is to see the schedule set up more like the navigator, rather than divided into categories.",
Just came off a Disney cruise and this app was a great companion. It kept me up to date with all that was happening on the cruise. And the chatting feature was very handy. Thank for a well developed app.,
App is always improving.  I used it s lot on my last cruise.  A search function would be great as sometimes it is hard to remember where you found stuff or make more categories  (especially in activities).,
I love the improvements from the last time I used it. One more improvement I would suggest is to be able to send a group text to avoid sending the same message a number of times to different people in your party.,
Nice app but has issues on some later android versions.  It wouldn't stay connected.  The tech support guy couldn't get it fixed for me.  Worked great on iPhone.,
Loved this app made communication on. on board so easy loved deck plans and port info can't wait for our next cruise,
Easy to find things to do and set reminders. Can message others in party who also have app. Used it constantly.,
An event planner for everyday on the cruise. We didn't miss one second of the endless fun on the ship.,
"Loved this app, so helpful and informative.  The only things that would make it better would be if we could get reminders of excursions & spa appointments.  Also would be great if we could communicate with guest services,  and kids area through app.",
"The only issue I had was that I wish you could add activities to your calendar such as the times you got tickets for character greetings.  That would be so nice to have everything in one calendar.  Very awesome though, especially for traveling with multiple staterooms.",
This was perfect for our first cruise with disney and the best thing is it worked with out WiFi. It help my family make the most of our time on the cruise.,
Might have been better if the onboard wi-fi worked in the staterooms and more consistently in public areas.  Menus and activities worked well tjough.  The onboard chat was horrendous.  Messages wouldnt come through for 24 hours sometimes.,
Extremely useful while we were onboard. Knew exact times for all activites and dining areas. Chat option was perfect for times we split up on the ship an needed to communicate. Can't wait for our next cruise.,
So handy never seen anything like it. It seemed a little wonky on apple device but I never had any problems,
"It is called ""navigator""...please add a page so you can see the approximate location of the ship. Great to have contact with your party though while you're out at sea.",
Doesn't offer much use other than a day counter prior to cruise. It's not worth having my cellphone on during the cruise.,
"It was great being able to messages each other. Also, I could easily plan activities by marking my favorites",
"I can't even begin to explain what a wonderful experience it was on the 4 day cruise on the Disney Dream!  The service,  friendliness of all the staff,  cleanliness,  comfort  and fun was a dream come true! Thank you Disney and to all of the staff that took care of us! ♡",
"A but disappointing. No information other than countdown before cruise. Set my device up while in port. Others in party couldn't get set up once we left port. Like the app, but could be better.",
"It was really great to have a schedule for everything going on on the ship. And with the layout on the app, plus a chat to keep up with everyone, it couldn't have been anymore helpful",
The chat doesn't really let you know when there is a message except for a vibration and if you're not looking at it or have it in your hand you never know there are messages. Otherwise the app is great,
Cool app!,
Easy to use and handy once abroad ship.  Used it many times and reminded me 15min before activties that I chose.,
This app was great for our cruise to keep up with what was happening on our ship. I only wish that my phone would vibrate when it was supposed to remind me when my favorites were happening instead of to the on board phone. I could never figure out how to use it. I do love this app in spite of that fact.,
"This app was great for using the menu when the servers forget.  Other that that this app wasn't a very good communicator, and the featured activity was only the after diner show.",
I use app just for count down. I get excited knowing my vacation is soon.i don't use it for an thing else cuz I've been on 10 disney cruises.i no my way around 3 of the ships.,
Very useful app. Provided lots of info at our fingertips without having to carry around the daily schedule in paper form.,
"Very useful. Only issue was withconnecting to shipboard wifi, which often had a weak signal, so my phone would disconnect frequently. This messed up the chat function.",
Great app with lots of info to help planning. However the on ship WiFi is spotty at best. Fix this and then def a 5 star app.,
Amazing. Just wish that it would always notify me when I had new messages. Sometimes I missed them because it didn't show on my notification bar.,
"The count down and navigator portions are phenomenal. The connectivity onboard if you aren't utilizing internet access (a paid service) is terrible, and that impacts the texting feature drastically.",
We used this app everyday on the cruise. Great way to keep up with everything going on each day on the boat. Great way to send a message to the family,
"Loved the count down feature prior to our cruise, but once we were on the ship, we had a hard time getting it to work.",
I love the new app. I only wish they would link it to kids club though so we can do away with the wave phone,
This was a very useful tool to have both prior to and during our cruise. My daughter loved the count down feature and online navigator was great. Thank you.,
Good app for finding your way around and keeping up with events. Chat app is very basic. It could use some fine tuning.,
This app was so useful and helpful.  It was easy to communicate with others in our party. The only improvement I would like is some type of loud noise notification when you get a message from someone else in your party.,
Great while on the boat. Chat is clunky. Would be nice if chat number was related to your stateroom number. Maps of decks should be one of main pages. Wish I could see and review pictures take by photographers.,
I found it really useful for checking out the evening menus and all stuff going on aboard. Can't see how anyone can fault it to be honest 5 stars from me,
"Very helpful. Liked the texting for family to keep in touch. Great for checking on all the events and activities on board on the go. Cool emoticons, going to miss them.",
It counts down the days and on the cruise gives you all the information for the current day and the rest of the cruise. It also allows you to like something and gives you a remainder about that activity.,
Even though they place the daily navigator in your stateroom each day there was nothing more convenient than having this app inform us all we needed to know for our scheduling of our daily plans and how to find the ship location.,
"Getting better every time we cruise.  Voice chat is sorely needed, make this happen!  A snapshot (for shopping) would be a nice add along with working on Castaway Cay.",
I used the app everyday to lookup events on the ship. I also used the chat feature to communicate with family members since my mobile plan was roaming.,
Great app...when wave phone didn't work half way this app made chatting easier.  Also the navigator page and reminder service was very helpful.  If your going disney this is a must,
"I loved the reminders for various events around the ship, the chat function is also handy. The only issue I had with the app was my phones(?) inability to handle group chats in the app. I would get a notification with short text, but I could never see the group chat in the app.",
On board wireless was weak throughout the Fantasy ship. Also app has differences whether you use Android or iPhone. One has spell checking while the other one does not.,
"This app rocks, when you are able to connect to the WiFi onboard (and p.s.- don't pay for the WiFi to use this app.) Additionally, spell check doesn't work with the chat feature, which is a little bit of a bummer.",
Aspect we found useful was contacting each other by messenger. Knowing whereabouts of characters was useful. Overall WIFI was not dependable.,
Only thing I would suggest to add is a audible sound when a message is recieved from the on board app. Just the vibration alone isn't a good enough notification.,
"Very useful, make sure to download before leaving port otherwise you'll have to use the free 50mb web on first day.",
Very helpful in planning our days on the cruise. Including choosing dinner for the picky eaters to look at the menu ahead of time. Also the maps to where things were happening was a huge help since the ship is huge.,
This application was awesome. Helped out a lot on our Disney cruise and you didn't have to carry the navigator paper to stay informed of events on the ship.,
"WOW!!! Before they added that chat feature on this app it was invaluable... now it is just PERFECT for on-board use!! Great job folks!! You have done a truly smashing job with this app. I wish there was more content to be viewed before arriving at the ship, though. It would be so cool to be able to see details of our upcoming reservation(s) on the app. But really, it is just perfect the way it is!",
This is a great app to see everything offered from shows to character appearances to shopping and dining.,
"We had 29 family members traveling on the Disney Dream. I had LOTS of trouble with the wave phones, but this app worked well, even for the kids!",
"Only issue we had is that when we sent text messages to multiple addresses simultaneously they never went through. Other than that, the app was very user friendly and informative.  Used it more than the printed navigator we got every night.",
"Good app for count down, available activities, ship map, texting feature nice but didn't always work. Love the emojis.",
Great way to stay connected with friends & family on board.  It would be fun to have the ship's horn & Mickey chime as optional notifications.,
I use this app last year when we went on a Disney cruise and it worked great you can find everything out about the ship and what's going on of the day you're using it I'm going to use it again this year when we go on a Disney cruise ship,
"Great for the countdown and menus, but a bit cumbersome for other things. Went back to the paper navigator. Would have been nice to set up personal schedules and reminders for our group. Chat never worked properly for our group.",
I love the emojis. This was a great way too stay connected with family members. Loved that we had constant access to the goings on aboard ship and the menu for meals.,
Great to keep in touch with friends and family onboard ship. Just wish there was a ringer instead of just vibrating. Spent more time looking at my phone to see if I got any messages.,
We use it all the time. Very convenient and user friendly not only for activities but for keeping in touch with my kids and friends aboard!,
I would recommend this app. I used it all the time on board and I'm looking forward to using more features on my next Disney cruise.,
"Just finished a cruise on Magic. We referenced the activities schedule constantly. Much more convenient than the paper the ship distributed. The chat feature needs work, but was fairly useful. It would not use my installed keyboard or autocorrect. Keep it up and keep improving it. Much appreciated on the ship.",
The app was helpful during the cruise. But I would strongly recommend that the message function include  a sound when a message is sent/received.,
"Made our first cruise easier with what was going on, and helped me keep track of a 13 year old.",
"I loved this App. The countdown helped me get all excited for my adventure, and then kept me up to date with what was happening in the ship and where everything was it made everything easier.",
This app was very handy on the boat.  Helped us to keep track of all the activities.  The group chat feature was also nice.  Wish that there would have been more features open before we left for the cruise.,
"This app made it much easier to stay in contact with our group, but the chat didn't always work. It also showed all the activities and their locations. Very useful",
Loved the app. .the countdown kept me sane waiting for the cruise everyone in our path wad able to keep in touch on board,
The app does what it needs to do.  Take advantage of the favorites feature in the activities section and allow push notifications.  This really kept us organized on our recent Disney cruise to the Bahamas.  I love the reminder feature for the activities with favorited.  Very convenient and extremely easy to use.,
App was easy to use and had the events listed. Liked the chat function and was able to keep updated on the next events around the ship.,
Fun to chat with others on the cruise.  Loved having the Personal Navigator on my phone and seeing the menus.  It was great to keep updated on favorites.,
"So easy to use! Only one issue and it was all my phone (wouldn't stay connected-Galaxy S5 Sprint). Loved having access to the menus, the schedule and more.",
App was good for texting. Wish there was a way to use it as a phone. Also it should make a sound when chatting so you can hear it instead of just viberating,
"We just got back ! This app was very accurate. I did not connect with the online chat, so couldn't rate that part, phone was on airplane mode. Disney is TOP NOTCH along with all its latest technology!! Love Disney!",
"Loved this app,  EXCEPT for the text messaging feature.  Otherwise,  it kept us informed as to what was going on,  when,  where,  and even gave us menus for where we were dining!",
"Other than being useful, it gave my phone a purpose during the cruise. During port days, if you want to use your data roaming, you'd have to toggle between WiFi and mobile data. App doesn't seem to work properly while on mobile data.",
"It's good for easy communication, but sometimes it can be slow when you chat. Someone sent a message to me at 11:30 and I didn't get it until 9 in the morning",
Loved that I could look at the youth activities and find my kids for lunch etc. Text works well. We used our ipods so we didn't have to worry about roaming charges on our cell phones. Great for day planning.,
Easy to use and excellent because you can find your family members and friends every where.  I love it.,
The application made finding out info real quick and easy. Also allow easy access to ship internet,
"Overall good experience being able to chat, find activities and places, etc. As an Android user, my beef is that the app didn't use swipe texting.",
Had difficulty setting up texting but mobile Navigator and dinner menus in advance are great.,
"I'd love it if there was a way to add in your own special events onto your favorites schedule. Such as any tastings, meet and greets, palo reservations, Vista spa appointments.",
We used it to find out when character meet and greets were great app. Will us for next cruise for sure,
"App is a huge step up from the wave phones for communication with my kids, but wish the app was also available for Windows phones. Also wish people could be added to group chats without starting over. Sharing pix would be great as would having the app work on Castaway Cay.",
"Content was not always accurate, but otherwise it worked well.",
This app is AWESOME. Only thing I would change is on-board wi-fi timed out frequently so text messages were not received or transmitted.,
"Made my experience amazing. I was never least on board, I was well informed and I never missed anything I wanted to see and do.",
Excellent source for cruise information while on board.  Didn't have to carry the cruise navigator around and was great for texting people in our party.,
"Countdown feature is fun. Once on the ship, though, it's great. Just flip through the schedule and ""like"" the events and activities in which you're most interested. The app will then notify you 15 minutes before each of your favorites. I used this much more than the paper ""Navigator.""",
This is a great app to stay connected to other people that traveled with you. It also has daily info about ports and activities. Highly recommended.,
Was a wonderful way to keep track of what was going on everyyday. And the chat app feature was great way to communicate with our party. I can't wait to use it again. Our grandkids loved the countdown to cruise part.,
"This app is great, definitely helped us find our way around the ships and keep up with Character appearances and other fun activities.",
There were 4 of us going in different directions all the time.   The app was awesome for keeping in contact and meeting up when we needed to.,
My whole family used this on the Disney Fantasy for our whole cruise and it was the biggest help. Our last cruise didn't have the app and we always had to deal with that paper and it was so aggrivating. This app made everything easily accessible. Made our cruise 100% better.,
"Great way to find out what is happening and navigate the decks to find events. Loved the ""favorite"" activity feature. Wish it would set dinner reservations and dining locations as a favorite as well.",
"I loved this app to keep track of what I wanted to do. Reminders of things I favorited, texting the kids, cute emojis, everything.  Only drawback was that it stopped working on the last night after the show.",
Helped remind when character appearances were going to happen. Easy to use and plan the day with.,
"If you have multiple smartphone users going with you on a Disney cruise, this is the perfect app to have to get into contact with them. Besides being able to see all of the day's events and drink specials, you can utitilize the on board chat function. Fantastic app for anyone on a Disney cruise!",
This app is great for keeping track of all the activities while onboard either the Dream or Fantasy.  The onboard chat is a nice feature addition.,
We loved the APP we used to keep checking days til. It really kept little guys happy counting down to vacation. Loved using app once onboard. I will use again next year.,
"Very useful for finding scheduled events, dinner menus and sending texts to the rest of your party all cruise long free of charge. And with really cool emojis!",
"There were a few things that could have been a little better with this app, but overall, very helpful.",
liked it on ship  but didnt like that had to have app open to get messages.  LOVED the emojis and want them on my phone for use  every day!,
"Loved that it worked without Wi-Fi!  This app was very helpful.  We used it everyday and got a lot done because of it.  I loved that when you add an activity that you were interested in to you favorites, the app would send you a reminder when that activity was about to start!",
Very useful while on board.  I wish I could have used it in advance to pre plan more but either way it's great.,
"I didn't even need the paper navigator. The app categorizes activities by age, and allows you to save your favorite activities, and will send you reminders before the event starts. The app also has a very useful chat feature, allowing you to communicate with others in your party.",
This app saved me from having to carry around the paper navigator . All the information I needed was at my fingertips!,
On-board chat is an awesome feature. Having the navigator with all activities shown in my pocket at all times is so helpful.,
I had a GREAT time on the disney cruise. This app helped alot with figuring out where to go and what to do with my free time. I hope to go again and use this app it is so helpful!!!!,
Loved this App during our cruise. The Disney emoji's are awesome. You can find everything you need and more!,
You have everything from the on-board Navigator at your fingertips. The that feature is the best! Great way to connect with friends and family on board.,
I was able to connect with my family and find out about all the events. I really loved the reminders about events I  had chosen to attend.,
This was our first cruise and loved it. Such a handy tool to navigate through all the choices. The texting/chat feature was perfect.,
And that's about it. If you loose connection to the ship's wireless it becomes useless.,
"WiFi was difficult to keep while on board, app is great for keeping in touch though",
"get this before you even get on the ship!! all the ships activities, dinning menus and much more for the whole cruise are on your phone before you leave!",
The bad part is you can not make he app beep or ring hen you get a msg only 1 quick vibration.,
Would be nice to see where the shop is on a map in the app.  Similar to what the airlines have.  Would also be nice to see all the activities and meals etc to plan ahead rather than taking time onboard to do it.  Overall a great start.,
Constendly had to reconnect to ships WiFi to send a message and app doesn't run on the background so unless you had it app open and phone on at all times you didn't get ur message right away. Waste of a download!,
"This was so helpful finding schedules, deck plans, being able to communicate with family members. Could plan around pics with Characters & preview menu for the day. Loved it 😊",
"Loved it,  used it everyday. Checked the dinner menus, Show times and port info.  It is a must have if you are sailing DCL.",
App worked great for info but the texting part of the app did not work well because the WiFi connection constantly disconnected.,
This app is awesome! I use it for the countdown feature and to chat onboard with friends. This app is a way of life when under the sea!,
"Nos ayudo a recordar las actividades, shows q nos interesaban. Y a mantenernos en comunicacion entre nosotros.",
"My family with 3 children 4,5 and 7 had a great time.  Kids club activities were wonderful.  Kids had a great time in there while my wife and I enjoyed a great dinner alone at Palo. Pirate show with fireworks was very enjoyable.  Thanks for a great time Disney Cruise! App was a ton of help.",
"May - June 2016 Alaska Cruise,  This app helped keep us organized.  When and where everything that was happening on the ship.  Dinning menu was great to plan meals. In app texting kept everyone in Stateroom connected.",
Very useful and user-friendly app! It helped us quite a bit while we were just aboard the Disney Dream.,
It was really helpful to have all the information I needed all on this app. I was able to send msgs to all of our family members using the chat feature which was extremely helpful to plan where to meet and what activities to do.,
"This app was great, especially with an active family. My only suggestion would be if your reservations of activities on/off the ship (I.e. Palos, tastings, shore excursions) could be seen on a tab. Other then that, no problems",
Just got back from a Disney cruise and this app was amazing...so helpful...never needed the printed out navigators...loved the chat feature,
"Love that i can txt with my kids and know how they are doing, i ck menus ahead of time, read about upcoming events...basically everything you need to knw is there. I didn't have to worry, love it!",
Very useful on board for information regarding activities and meals.  Chat feature is a great idea but doesn't work most of the time.  It's unreliability is really annoying.  Needs work.,
"Group chat doesn't work well, can't add more people to the chat and sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Kids club notifications don't work at all with it so still have to have the wave phone",
Would give it 5 stars if you can call the phones onboard that have the app or call the state room.,
Very helpful to have. Just a few kinks to work out.,
Takes all the guess work out of a cruise! Has the dinner menus for you to see before dinner. When and where the characters will be. Where free food is and where you'll have to pay for food. Experience much more of the cruise with this app!,
"With cell phones becoming the primary camera used these days, and any time you can reduce the amount of stuff you have to carry around when you have 4 kids it's super helpful. The texting was a big bonus too!",
This is the perfect app to take on your Disney Cruise. It was easy to find events and to easy to keep in contact with my family.,
Excellent app for being aboard the Disney Cruise. Was able to get the full experience thanks to this!! A MUST download for any passenger. Bon voyage!!,
"This app helped us navigate the ship and the days so well.  It's perfect for keeping track of activities. The ""favorite"" option was extremely useful.  The chat feature even more useful and easy to use.  A must for any Disney cruise.",
It does not always work and is clunky.  Just like the cruise website.,
Loved the app. Worked great while on the cruise to keep me updated on activities and allowed me to text other family members on the ship,
I used the paper navigator than the phone. It's just easier.,
"This was a great tool for keeping up with family, learning about events, and it has lots of cool features!  Even used when at Castaway Cay!  Can't wait for our next Family get away!!",
This app along with the nightly updates is a must to keep you on your toes aboard the ship.,
This app helped me a lot when I was on the Disney cruise. Also I loved checking how many more days until my cruise when I wasnt on the cruise,
"Great app.  Not without minor issues, but very helpful.",
"Handy app with deck plans, activities, dining information and more. The onboard chat is filled with favorite character emoji and is a welcome addition. Highly recommend!",
Texting was spotty at best.   Does not contain all information found in the daily navigator,
Love being able to chat with me mates.  Checking the agenda has been made easy.,
The app worked great helped me and my daughter communicate while on the ship.,
Greatest app ever! Everything you need to know at all times on the ship!  Kids adults pools movies food and port stops this app has everything you need!,
"Great app for your cruise.  Would be best with an add your own appt for spa and port adventures etc.  Otherwise 5 stars Used it again in 2017- still good, still needs apptment ability to add into your day's events.  Also would be better if they added the date change to all pages especially the dinner menus.   Adding photo link would be nice as well and phone directory to make it a one stop app.",
This app was amazing on the ship had me up to date on all the events going on by category. Also the text app is great you can txt anyone on the ship as long as you have thier code number .great to keep in touch with family  love the disney cruise and all the staff and app,
It was so much fun to do the count down I just got off the ship it is so fun it is Mon. May 23rd,
"This is a very helpful tool, to know what's happening aboard ship and for the Port Adventures.  Made traveling the ship easy.",
Used the app more than the papers they gave us and was a lot easier to figure out.,
Messages lagged sometimes but overall good app. Nice to have all info readily available.,
"Loved the navigator and the chat! Please, please add laundry locations under general information!",
A great trip for children and adults. At some point in life everyone should take a Disney cruise.,
"very informative app. has all the activities, characters apperearances, & locations listed for everyday so you won't miss a beat!! also enjoyed seeing the dinner menu ahead of time along with the drink of the day. all around this is a wonderful app.",
No need to hold on to the printed navigator.. Instant when where and all info for entire cruise as soon as you step into port Canaveral!! We planed our trip as we awaited our boarding group.. Once on board it was amazing! Reminders for our events teal time messaging.,
Loves using this app preparing for our 2 cruises over the past couple of years. Using it on board the ships was a MUST for me! Thank you for making my cruise easier!,
Easy to use and it always kept me up to date on what was going on with ship activities and dining and much more!! Definitely would recommend having when on a Disney ship!,
This app was a life saver on our recent cruise. I was able to keep track of all the events and character appearances with ease. The alarm kept us from missing anything!,
Love the app. Its easier to comunicate and find out about activities taking place in the shift.,
"This is a great tool to use well on the ships, and makes getting in touch with family easy and convenient.",
It was a great app to have while on board. We got to chat and see our daily activities.,
Made it easy to find out what was going on and communicating with friends. Would like to see wfi on Castaway Cay.,
"I expected the app to have a place where I could find my times for shore excursions, spa appointments, and similar. MDE has it, why not this app? It would be a great improvement.",
"Lees Family 1st Disney Cruise, the app was awesome for keeping in touch with all 10 of us! Very helpful for directions and activities! The countdown was so exciting, how great ;-)",
"Great, but should add ability to review shipboard account and a voyage map / ships speed and position dashboard",
Great app! Everything worked out great while we were cruising. We were able to get information on all and everything happening during our cruise. I would recommend this app to all who are cruising DCL!!,
"App worked great on the Fantasy,  everything was laid out so easy to navigate through.",
We were able to keep in touch via on board texting. Just wish we could share photos,
We were able to see all activities for each day on the ship.  We were also able to communicate with the other parties we were with.,
The Navigator Chat was great for keeping in touch with everyone in our group while on the ship... Great addition to the cruise experience.,
"It  was so handy to use on the ship for the schedules, menus, and communicating with each other.  It works so much better than the wave phones with so much more functionality!",
"Loved the chat feature, but so much info from Navigator is not updated on app",
We used this app on our 7 night cruise in January. We used it to help plan our days at sea. Just add an event to your favorites and you will get an alert 15 minutes prior to it starting. We used the chat feature to stay in touch with our 2 teens and other people in our traveling party. Love the emoticons. The only real compliant I have is there are no adible ring tones for chat or alerts. With my phone it would vibrant but the kids ipod touches there was no alert at all. Please add a ring tone feature.,
this app is great made finding out what was going on easy and showed you were to go as well and told you what was on the menu as well,
It would be nice is the app could be used to plan activities during the cruise prior to embarkation.,
"Aside from the most helpful, knowledgeable, and very friendly staff this app is the #1 sidekick to helping you squeeze every little bit out of cruise. With this app you can stay in contact with your large family group and all activities that are going on all around you meanwhile having loads of fun with all the Disney emoji'!!!! A true must have for a complete disney experience.....",
"Easy to follow instructions and information about activities, events etc and board chat was excellent tool to communicate with family members.",
"This little program is a LIFE SAVER (no pun intended, it is a ship program afterall!) If I had to make a request though, it would be to add a ringer sound for on-ship text messages. Beyond that, its a must for your Disney Cruise!",
"This app was very handy for finding out when,  where,  and what was happening on the ship! Very user friendly and accurate.  Will be using again on the next cruise!",
"This was so helpful while on the ship.  If you are not on the ship, it looks like just a countdown. But when you board and sign in its the most amazing tool ever!!!",
Loved the new on board chat function! It was fun and super helpful. Also enjoyed being able to look at the dinner menus. We had a large party and it helped speed up the decision process. The app makes it easy to choose favorite activities and make plans with family!  Only neg was that some days the app activities didn't match the navigator and we weren't sure what was and what wasn't going to take place.  Overall the upgrades to the app since our last cruise were just magical!,
Update app,
The maps helped out a lot when we were lost on the ship.,
"This app was very useful! We used it to text each other while on the cruise.  The reminders for events, ship map, dining menus and much more were all very helpful.",
Provides much needed info. without having to carry around papers and printed schedules,
Great to use for chat instead of the wave phone. Menus were super helpful.,
Loved that I could 'text' with my party so we didn't have to take the wave phone with us. And the Disney emojis were adorable! Map was helpful too. Definitely will keep it and use in my next cruise!,
Able to keep track of all the kids throughout the cruise with no problems,
Very useful however  needs to enable ringtone on phone  vibrations  are not always  heard,
This app really helped my family to navigate around the ship as well as set our own personal itinerary for events that we wanted to participate in. Great Job DiSnEy!!!!,
Used it everyday on the ship. It is more detailed than the paper navigator. Easy to find things to do by age group. Loved it!!,
I would give it 5 stars if it actually showed you where to go,
"Was super easy to keep in touch with family members while on the ship. Much easier to use than wave phones. Would like to have the ability to give permission to minors to use the app from any parent account. I set up my phone first and my daughter's ipod, but my husband had to set up an account before my daughter received permission to use the chat on her ipod. My husband has a blackberry, so we could not set him up on that. Luckily we also had a tablet with us. Liked the easy access to activities too!",
"This app was a wonderful assistant in board!   I use my phone as my camera and carry it everywhere, so having this app to refer to for character meetings, movie times, and deck layout was wonderful!   Menus are all available, too, although our last night's menu was not updated. No biggie...it did help to decide if you want the sit down meal or just head to the buffet. Highly recommended!!!!",
A lot of messages were delayed by more than an hour.,
Loved it!!! Great countdown feature and I loved that you could see the schedule and dining menus each day while on board!!!,
"This was a great tool for our first cruise! We used it primarily for the activities feature,  which lists all the events and activities happening onboard in a nicely organized way and allows you to save the ones you want to do as ""favorites"" which is useful . Then later when it's time to head to your activity the app gives you a reminder notification so you don't miss out on the fun!  We also really enjoyed being able to view the dinner menus for the different restaurants on the app.  Loved it overall!",
Did everything we needed accurately! Loved the texting feature and updated activity lists!,
"Our first cruise ever and we had an amazing time! The employees of this cruise line, even down to the contracted employees at Castaway Cay, were nothing less than phenomenal!!! Disney, you've thought of everyone & everything!",
Onboard chat function was great. Wish they would release the Disney emojis publicly to download like the ones that open in the chat menu,
"Used this app for our January 2016 cruise and it was so handy!!! You can text the people in your group, look at all the events for the day, and find character appearances! Plus, the map of where everything is, is super helpful! Will definitely be using again on our March 2017 cruise! OH and the emojis are super cute!!!",
It did not work with my Samsung note 4...so sad.  Verry frustrating.  Kept disconnecting. Unusable.,
Great app for the ship! Did have a little trouble keeping it connected,

The app was awesome to stay in touch with our family!,
This was our second cruise and really made use of this helpful app this time!,
This was a must for our trip. Thanks for making our trip a little easier!,

Everything you need and quick reference.,
To communicate & get info on your phone using disney wifi,
Add music to the app from Disney radio.,
Was very useful but the wifi did not work well,

Awesome app worked really well and kept me up to date while vacationing,
Great way to keep all activities at my fingertips,
This is a great app to keep in contact with people you are on the cruise with,
Can navigate our journey from beginning to end,
"This app was sooo good, so helpful.",
The app is great but they should allow picture texting and tracking for kids,
Excellent app that makes your life in the cruise more efficient,
Not very flexible.,
If your on a Disney cruise it helps you keep track of all activities that are happening,
Bad,
Great tool to keep up with all the activities on the cruise,
Loved it! It was very helpful.,

Worked well for texting.,
Very helpful and easy to use,
Was a life saver on the ship.,
Excellent app for info & to stay in touch with the family,
Must have!,
The group chat especially was nice.,

Permite comunicarte con otros tripulantes. Te avisa de las actividades y los lugares. Fue super util en mi ultimo viaje!,
Cool beans,
It worked !,
Helpful,
Excellent,
Es muy sencilla de utilizar. Tiene toda la información que se requiere durante la travesía en el crucero. Esta actualizada en todo momento.,
Ram,
The paper navigator would not have worked for me. It would have gotten lost. I loved the favorites  feature. It gave you the option to favourite something for the day...or for multiple days so you could plan and prioritize for the day. Then it sent you reminders. Only used the text option with those that had phones.  Wish there was away it could allow you to add your scheduled things. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.,
The strangest thing is the day we were supposed to go to castaway key and my events for the day was not even close to the two people I was with.  Other negative is app would constantly disconnect from WiFi in our cabin.  Other than that great for keeping in touch with family and seeing events.  I say ( supposed to go to castaway key) because we were on the fantasy that did not make it there because of the hurricane.  We were disappointed that Disney would not give us anything for missing it.,
"Went with three groups.  The app allowed individual and group texting which is super useful when our phones are in airplane mode.  It also had the daily schedule where you can mark as favorite to send you reminders, and location and hours of each place along with the map.  Excellent app!  If only we can call within the app so we dont also have to carry wave phones.",
"Overall, app was great. Could look through all activities and if set as favorite, it will alert you 15 minutes before activity. I could never get it to sound on my GS5, only vibrate. Also would like to either import or manually add your shore excursions so all activities are added in one location instead of having to store those somewhere else on your device and flop between apps.",
We did not miss anything because of this app.. all activities was easy to plan and schedule throughout the day.. checking it was my first thing to do every single morning during our trip on Disney magic line... totally recommend it,
"Too many times I never saw responses to texts until well after they were sent, sometimes the next day.  Since it's used as a method to communicate with others in my party, getting a notification even when the app isn't active would be nice.",
Just used the app. Love that I can look at all the scheduled activities and be able add to my favorite list and check out the dinner menus and hours of the restaurants all within my reach instead of carrying the paper copy. The only thing that would make it awesome is to be able to link to my reservation so I can access my account and have my own calendar of events like my dining schedule and excursions.,
"For the most part, it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Shows you who what where and when everything is.  A few more links would be nice within the app, specifically clicking on a room on the map doesn't go to a description of what the area is, so you have to back track to get that info.",
"Loved it, never any problems. Only addition I would make would be to add your own activity and set reminder (i.e. spa appointment or sports sumulator, etc...) at some point would be amazing to link up the port adventures to the app as well. But, did love it...",
"8-20-14. Just came home from the Fantasy. Used it every day and it was quite reliable.  It would be great if there was a messenger or text feature on it much like regular texting. The ""wave phones"" they offer don't have a qwerty keyboard. ***** August 28, 2015. Just left the ship again after the DVC Members Cruise. Awesome time! 16 people in our party and we all used the app to chat. Rarely did it drop the wifi. If it did the signal came back and was fine. Thanks!",
"Just got off the Fantasy and the app was a HUGE help.  Every activity, character appearance, hours for all locations, deck plans, daily dinner menu based on location....So nice to not have to hunt down a crew member when you have a question.  Also, the chat feature made it so easy to communicate with family and new friends.  I wish every cruise line had the same thing!",
I much preferred browsing activities in the app rather than the paper navigator which can be overwhelming.  The onboard chat is a great plus as well.  Two recommendations: Please consider adding descriptions for the drinks of the day and allow access the emoticons after we disembark.,
"Definitely use it on a Disney Cruise. Pros: Countdown before cruise, dinner menus for kids and adults, dining schedules for each eatery, activities schedule, onboard chat similar to Google hangouts we rarely used the wave phones. Cons: alerts and notifications only vibrate. Not using this app would be like not having a cell phone.",
This app is set up a little better than the Disney park app.  Lines up all the activity according to time schedule versus being alli over the place on a map.  Too bad it cannot give you your current location in a gps format and directions to your destination of selected activity.   Would be nice to show if activity is busy or suggested to attend or change to a later time.  Also to mark activity as attended do you can scratch off your to do list.,
"We used the text feature most of our seven day cruise.  There were times when texts were pending and wouldn't send, but overall a great way to stay informed about cruise activities and to stay in contact with each other.",
"on a three night cruise, the app was down for two days i was on the wonder in May 2015. Useless...have to carry the room phone everywhere",
"The Disney Cruise Line Navigator was so helpful to me on my previous Disney Cruise.   I would highly recommend it to anyone who is planning on taking a Disney Cruise and is unfamiliar with a ship.   Or,  maybe you're an expert,  but the extra help is always nice!  Thank you Disney for this wonderful app!",
This was a great app. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the messages between cruisers was slow.,
Love that you can text on the ship.  All info is at your fingertips. Needs some bug fixes. It knocked me out of the app about 3 times while on board.  Still loved it.,
Made my cruise so much easier when keeping up with and communicating with family members. Also very handy  for checking activity times. Didnt have to carry the daily page.,
Chat notifications need to be improved. Otherwise it's great to have navigator at your fingertips & be reminded of activities you want to check out.,
"While on our cruise to the bahamas, there was no need for the paper daily intenirary. Access to everything on the app. All of the Character appearances and everything. I enjoyed this app as much as the cruise. Map of Cast away island and the cruise ship. Loved it.",
Would be nice if there is a pull down that shows the activity by time.  We missed the last night going away party.,
"Worked great for us, we found one issue that people need to post their chat number to Facebook as soon as they get it if not people will not be able see it or find them.  You also need to sign up for the free 50 megabytes of internet on the first day or you cannot sign up for it",
Was very useful especially on being able to communicate with other people our party while on the cruise.  Having the Navigator on this app was also an added plus.,
Definitely get it if going on a Disney cruise. Easy to see what activities are going on and to contact family on board to see where they are/schedule meeting times and locations.,
Makes travelling on the Disney cruise ship a breeze.  It kept us updated on everything going on the ship and reminded us of things we wanted to do.,
During the trip I could text without getting fined and I soooooooooooooooooo llllllooooovvvveee the emojis there soo cute ♡♡♡♡ you should so get this app oh and it also tells u where to go and things like that it's a guide for u this is a very useful app so get it when u go on ur cruise no matter what,
Love being able to see all of the menues for the week at ask the MRD. I just wish the WiFi would stay on all the time.  It ran my battery and i would nor always get chat  messages in a timely fashion.,
Just got back from the Disney Magic . the chat option is free and my kids Love it more than the wave phones,
"East to use, never lost connectivity. Was able to plan everything with the use of the favorites star, which alerts you to upcoming events.",
We used the app a lot but it didn't seem to be as organized as the actual navigator. But overall it was very useful.,
"I enjoyed the count down until cruise day. Once on board, it was great to learn fun facts, check the schedule, preview the menu.",
"Once you get in board, the app gives you info on everything. It works really well on the Samsung S5 with no problems.",
"Three suggestions 1) saving chat even after leaving ship. 2) a personal calendar so you can save your favorites in a calendar and add other activities 3) give out chat ids prior to cruise so we can exchange them. Also a chat list function, so we can chat with groups",
This app was great. I was able to find all sorts of activities that were going on during my cruise.  It was also noce to be able to look at the menu for the rotation seating,
I mostly used it for the countdown to my cruise.  Turned off my phone after we left port.,
Easy to navigate and find everything for us to do on board the Dream.  Was able to highlight what we wanted to do and got.tbe notifications when the activities started. Disney does cruising right!,
"App is not personalized. Most functionality only works when connected to on board guest wifi, which won't stay connected because it keeps prompting to sign up for a wifi access plan.",
"Awesome to use. The only thing was that I was never able to use the chat in the app. Besides that, it is simple to use and lets you know what is going on the ship!",
Was able to text family throughout ship to coordinate with each other. All activities were published for entire voyage. Wish it had weather and location of ship.,
This app is way easier to find out what is going on around the ship than the daily paper navigator they put in your stateroom.  The texting feature is great as well.  No more carrying that phone and hoping your kids don't lose it.,
Just returned from a cruise on the Dream. The app was accurate and very useful. I depended on it exclusively. The texting is limited to the ship and will not work on Castaway Cay. Be sure it is installed BEFORE arriving at the ship.,
Used this app on our 7day Alaska cruise and it was wonderful in finding out what was going on. And was nice to be able to see dinner menu ahead of time.,
"This is a great app to have on a cruise, especially to see shipboard activities and schedules and menus. I didn't use the chat option, and object on principle to Disney's bloated wifi fees.",
"Worked great, would be nice if you could set a sound alarm for texts.  Auto rotate would help for the Cast-A-Way Key day to see the map better.",
Must have for on the go information.  Day view let us see ahead and the chat function was handy for us and eliminated carrying the on board wave phones.,
Drains the battery like crazy.  Good to keep in touch with the family on the ship though...,
"Absolutely lived being able to connect with our group of 22 while on the ship! Was able to turn our phones to airplane mode so we weren't charged international rates, and the app doesn't even require wifi for you to chat, look at activity schedules, lunch/dinner menus, etc.",
The onboard chat feature was extremely helpful to have on board. We were a large group and it was nice to be able to locate each other easily when needed.,
"App is handy to reference what is going on the ship, when things are open and browse the menu got all the onboard restaurants. Only complaint is that doesn't push instant messages when the phone is locked.",
"The app was very helpful for planning the days of the trip and letting in contact with one's party, I'd only hope they add in group chat, more robust activity browsing, and make the Disney emojis available offline.",
I prefer digital over print and this app helps with that. All info of activities around the ship at your fingertips. Would be better if they had a way to install this while on the ship as a friend was unable to install it.,
"The chat tool some times can get slow,  but the tool is fantastic",
Essential and convenient while on the cruise. Chat is great. Could benefit of search capabilities and group chats,
Great app! The idea of it is superb! Needed a search bar and I struggled using the group chat with my android phone. The rest of my party has Apple and they had no problem.,
"This app is an absolute MUST for people going on Disney cruises who have and use mobile devices. Everything you could want to know about during your cruise is found using this app. From dinner menus for the whole week to times and locations for all the activities, this app makes the cruise all the more enjoyable by making it so easy to get what you want out of the opportunities on the cruise. One of the best features is the free messaging among others on the cruise that are in your circle of friends.",
The app is brilliant and soon becomes essential onboard. We tagged our favorites which are listed in chronological order so we could quickly see each days itinerary. The messenger included was great for keeping in touch,
We used the on-board chat to keep track of my daughter! It was easy to meet up and it help with my peace of mind! We loved the maps and it was easy to find things to do! This App Is a necessity....just download before you are away from wifi!!!!,
It would have been better if there was a GPS location of the ship and an in depth weather report since there was zero internet.,
"The app was FANTASTIC with scheduling, finding our way around the boat and investigating the many available activities at our leisure. Having the list of menu options and choices was also advantageous! Thank you!",
the on board chat functionality is a great feature however the notifications don't work on ios unless the app is running in the foreground.,
It was a great tool on the ship once we figured it out. A must have to make the cruise relaxing!,
"Used thus app quite a bit; texting, checking on activities, and dinner menu.",
App works and would like to see some improvement on wifi on board.,
Loved the convenience of discovering chatacter greetings and upcoming events on my phone. Worked as expected with no issues.,
"It worked well, but a searchable ship diagram would be helpful.",
Was great to find out all activities going on the boat without having to carry the paper itinerary... Also great for chatting with others in your group,
Didn't use it at the beginning of the cruise but wish I did. Used it the last 2 days and it was awesome.  Use this app on the ship! It is very useful.,
The app was very useful but you should download it before boarding as it is difficult or impossible to download once onboard.,
Works great you can text through the app with family and friends. Works at all times. Good for navigation and to be aware of all activities at all times.,
"Didn't have to tote maps &/or schedules around, it was all there. Thanks °o°. When upgraded, would love to see extras like excursions that we booked  & extra services like spa treatments.",
"Always know when the meet and greets are, shows etc! Loved being able to see what's for dinner too!",
"This epic app allowed me to direct and plan all of our activities, dining and entertainment on our Alaskan cruise like a pro!!!! Never leave port without this!!! I REALLY loved that you could choose and save favorite events too!!! It allowed us to meet ALL of my daughter's favorite characters and made the experience even more magical!",
Only complaint is make the emojis available outside the app.,
Loved it!! Loved that it would send you reminders of the favorite activities or character appearances that you picked to do/see,
Essential for restaurant menus and activities. It's basically an electronic navigator for the entire cruise!,
"Could look at menus, activities, etc and decide before it ever happened!  Nice!",
Everything worked great on the app for use on our Disney Fantasy Caribbean Cruise!,
Its helpful and will let you know what's going on all the time..,
I love the disney cruise line. Been on it for the first time,
Loved the app found it useful to keep Granddaughter update as to what was on and menu's for evening meals,
I liked the app. I have reset it for my next cruise.,
"Schedule is handy, but the ability to chat onboard was fantastic",
Helped me a lot navigating around the ship,
Totally made my trip easier and more manageable,
Love the application it remind me of show times n upcoming events,
I would have given it 5 stars but for 5he fact that you can not down load the emoji keyboard and use it later on,
Like it very much wish it was tied into the ships music though,
"Very useful app, but didn't get to use it since the price of Internet on the ship is so high for so little data... $20 for 50 megabytes and $90 for 1 gig? Way too steep.",
Great app needs to have a notification sound,
Worked perfectly on our cruise and was so handy,
Excellent resource while on your Cruise,
Needs some improvement to make it a great app.,
This was absolutely the best app for our Disney cruise.,
Great App had everything at my fingertips.,
Great app. Used it the whole trip,
A great app for the whole family.,
Loved the cruise and loved the app,
Best way to keep up with everything on board!,
Hopefully it will remain working now that it has been updated.,
Great for keeping up with members of your party.,
Worked great for our trip.,
Best vacation app with disneycruise Dream,
Worked great and helped a lot!,
There's no sound... And doesn't connect sometimes,
It helped  me alot,
Very helpful app.,
Loved it.,
Disney is the best!,
It worked so well,
Magical,
Best app ever,
Disney Cruise app,
Really useful,
Loved it,
Nice,
The cruise ship,
Great to know what is happening where and for how long to help stay organized and to ensure you don't miss a thing...,
This is the best app for those on a Disney Cruise Line ship. I had the convenience of knowing everything happening at all times. I could plan out my dinner,
"For people experiencing trouble with the application at 7/20/15, there is an easy fix. Just uninstall and re-install. Hope this helps.",
We found it more useful than the paper navigator but could be so much better. Organization of activities is the weakest aspect. I wish it included port excursions and other reservations such as spa appointments. Chat worked fine as long as we had WiFi onboard. Overall a good app but could be great with some improvements.,
"I would like to have ways to add things to my schedule (Remy, Palo,  meeting friends, etc). I would also like to rate things I attend and provide feedback in app immediately. It would be cool to be able to favorite items on the menus so that if you looked in advance you could choose foods and even rate what you had afterwards.",
"I'd give it a 5 for looking at the navigators and dining room menus..The favorite feature that will notify you of an event time that you've chosen is also very useful. While the IM feature was extremely useful to stay in contact with our party, I found it spotty at times. If disney fixes this issue,  I'd rate it a 5 overall.  All in all, not bad...",
"My Family and I very recently used this application on an Eastern Caribbean cruise on the Disney Fantasy, and we found it easy to navigate and extremely helpful. Although I understand why it is unable to give a daily itinerary before arriving at your port, I really wish I could see a preliminary agenda while I was packing so I could plan my days and outfits better, but, that's just me splitting hairs!!",
"I would have loved access to the excursions and our reservations before the cruise. Disney games for the kids would be nice also for the long wait in lines for the characters.  Also pop up options with a vibrate reminder for when our  favorites were happening would have been awesome.  A list of contact numbers for Remy, small world,  etc. Would have been great. The application was fine but had a lot of room for improvement.",
"Just returned from a 5 night trip to the Bahamas on the Disney Magic. The app was very useful for finding out nightly menus and ship activities. Highly recommended for first time Disney Cruise travelers for finding their way around the ship. The texting feature for ship board use was nice, no charge as long as you stay on airplane mode.",
The app is pretty useful it has all the agendas for the day listed with times and categorized for each age group. Even has a msg board where you can get txt other ppl on the ship. Only thing is that I wish the app notified your phone whole the screen is off,
"This app is perfect for planning and organizing activities, much easier than using the paper navigators. One issue is that my family and I seemed to not always get each other's messages, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Would give 5 stars if it had more pre cruise functions, like the ability to view your reservation and booked activities, or even just have available general information about the ships and activities.",
"We used this on the Disney Magic in May 2015. With all of the great activities onboard, this was very helpful for planning and reminders. We didn't have kids with us, but it would have been critical for that. There were a couple times that the listed time on the app was 15 minutes off of the printed schedule, but not a huge concern. Make sure you're other apps are shut down if you are using the Connect @ Sea subscription. The Navigator app data usage is free.",
"EVERY time I wanted to us the app, I had to reconnect to the ships WiFi. At first I thought it was just my phone, bit our entire party of 14 were all having the same issue. Both on Android and iPhone. It made the messaging pointless since you never received a message until you logged back in. We ended up using the wave phones from our state room. This would have been great if it had the WiFi to back it.",
"When I got a text it barely buzzed so i missed some texts from my parents and there was no way to get a ringer on it. Also the app failed to work for some people that had to use the room wave phones, which was hard becuse we couldnt contact those people via the app. Also no calling feature which couldve been very helpful. But honestly it was better than the actual wave phone and worked 80% of the time and while at sea theres not much more I could've asked for. Overall its an ok app but you can make it work.",
"This honestly is the most helpful thing ever. The only thing I can complain about is sometimes every once in a while (not often) there is a large gap in between the time you send a message and when a person gets it if they haven't been in the app for a while, but its already a problem they recognize and are trying to solve! Honestly other than that it runs so smoothly and its so easy and fast to get ahold of your family and friends on the boat and great for making a plan for the day and not need a navigator",
Great app for the cruise. Being able to text each other for locations of family members was great... Especially since the wave phones were useless. Great activity finder as well. Dining menu's were helpful as well,
"Found all we needed with the exception of the Beach Blanket dinner menu on the Wonder. When I pointed out they were not serving what was listed, they fixed it by removing the dinner menu for that restaurant.",
So much better than relying on wave phones. Loved it. Thank you DCL💖 You should make group chats available and be able to send pictures through chats.,
"The app is great. It's perfect for having all of the cruise activity information at your fingertips. However, the WiFi connection, especially in the room, was poor and kept disconnecting. Not helpful when it's at night & you're trying to use the chat feature with your teen in the Vibe teen club.",
This application was quite handy; it simplified locating activities and events. Would rate a 5 if there was a search function.,
"This app is great for tracking on-board activities and character appearances, as well as checking the evening's menu.  Just make sure you install the app before you leave home for your cruise, so you don't have to pay for data to download it.",
"You must have this app on the ship - it makes finding activities, dining, entertainment, etc. very easy.  The One thing it is missing, and ought to have, is support for all the port activities. It should show a list of these, include descriptions, meeting locations, reminders, etc.",
App was generally good but didn't have dinner menu loaded the last night and a few bugs that caused us to restart.,
Used it all the time.  Very nice.  Only thing I would suggest somehow add your excursions that you booked.  Kind of like they do with fast passes and your dining.,
"A great app for when you're on board. There were a few times information wasn't updated, but overall a way better method for figuring out what activities are happening, where they're happening and how to get there.",
"Good app once your on board, one thing though add the castaway cay map. Also make it more of a celebration when your cruise comes.",
"It worked well on Fantasy last year but on Dream it kept kicking me off Wi-Fi.  Great app otherwise, easier then carrying around the Navigator.",
Was great while onboard. Especially loved the messaging. Would have been better if it worked more in our stateroom.,
It's a great app to give you the ship's activities/times.  I also liked that it told you the location on the ship. Very helpful when it was our first Disney Cruise.,
"Great app.  The chat feature was great for our 3 family group.  Menus, activities etc are all at your fingertips.  The only drawback was the wifi on the ship wasn't that great and my normally strong battery performance wasn't up to par.",
"It is mostly useful when you get on the ship, but Disney is adding new features now and then. It's great to be able to look at the dinner menus ahead of time.",
This was such a great option since the Wave phone on board are terrible for texting. We used this constantly to keep in touch with our other family members.,
Great app. Love each feature. Deck plans. Location specifics. Could plan dinner. Chat was teriffic. No service on castaway cay tho. Used it many times each day. Could plan things spur of the moment. Reminder alarm for favorites very helpful. Thank you for this,
We used the app on the Dream and it was really helpful.   It would be nice if the deck plans were available before getting to the ship so you can familiarize yourself before hand but other than that no issues.   We used the standard onboard Wi-Fi and it was enough to use the app and disconnect from the rest of the world!,
"Especially for the Dream and Fantasy, if they could add a ""You are here"" feature. Other than that it is very helpful.",
"I enjoyed previewing the activities, character schedules and menus before getting the paper Navigator. Would love to see Disney come up with fun ways for the app to interact with the ship.",
"Spent time having to close and reopen, close and reopen... When it worked, it was great. Information was not always accurate.",
"Once you're on board of your disney cruise, this app will be very helpful. It tells you what your having for dinner and where everything is. For kids, it helps keep in contact with the parents.",
It's very convenient with deck plans and schedule. The messaging capability is great. Just sometimes has a delay,
Some features great. Chat feature is totally useless unless you think 20 minute to one day delivery of message is ok. Tv channels should be added.,
Fantastic app. Easy to see what activities are happening at a certain time and the chat app is very handy while on board. Paper Personal Navigator was still easier to see the entire day at a glance.,
The app help with providing the times and location of events.   Also helpful with being able to text message one another while on board without paying for outrageous roaming fees.,
Only thing that would be better is if you could manually input to your favorites list to have a daily itinerary for yourself.,
App is wonderful once aboard the ship..Did not have to use the Disney paper navigator at all and all the information was always at my fingertips Loved it,
"We use this aboard the Disney Wonder. I love how it sends you a reminder after you set an activity as a favorite. 15 minutes before each activity we selected, we got a reminder on the phone. Very easy to use and well designed",
This app was very helpful. Check with your navigator to make sure that activities are correct. Others wise I loved it. I really liked the favorites that you could quickly see what you wanted to do for each day. A fun way to tour the ship because it shows you the plans for each deck. Have fun on your cruise!,
"Great app. Needs some improvement for reliability, but really IS useful to have an electronic version of the navigator.",
"Great app. Loved the count down function. Knew about the activities, shows, and nightly menus with easy accessibility.",
Just sailed on the Fantasy. Worked great and kept us in touch.  The messenger worked great with our phones.  Alarm feature was also nice to remind about favorite events saved.  Definitely recommend if cruising with disney.,
Just got home from the Disney Dream. This app helped so much with the day to day. We had ten people in our group and it was so great to be able to chat and communicate.,
This app kept us abreast of all the happenings aboard the Disney Dream. Will definitely use it on the next Disney Cruise.,
The on board chat feature was a great addition.  Wish the kids clubs could contact you through the app too.,
"Having access to the various menus provided topics for conversation all day. Loved that! The app is a great source of very enjoyable and useful information. I love being able to text while onboard..very convenient. However, being able to extend the texting feature to Castaway Cay would be an asset.",
"We used this app on the June 2015 Alaska cruise on the wonder. It had every bit of information we could possibly use every day of the cruise. Character appearances, menus, shows, you name it, it was on here.",
"Don't neglect to check the daily navigator pamphlet left in the the stateroom, as it will contain info that may not be in the app. But the app is indispensable, and user friendly.",
Loved having this app and being able to communicate with my family while on board. Maybe other cruise lines will catch on and do the same.,
While on cruise. Very helpful daily cruise info. Could use more pre-cruise planning to get ready for the wonderful vacation!,
Great (almost indispensable) companion to sailing with Disney Cruise Line.  (Note that full features only work onboard the ship.),
"Consulted this app often to check on activities, times, places, deck plans and menus. Would have liked an option to hide the kid activities since I cruised without children. A map view like the map on the TV would have been nice too, especially if I could pan and zoom to see where we were in relation to land and destinations. Great job!",
It worked so well with me and my family. We all had this app and could stay in touch anywhere in the ship using its messager. It also pretty much replaces you having to bring a personal navigator because it shows you all of the activities and what time they are at. They also show you what movies are playing and in which theater. Overall this app deserves a 6 out of 5 stars!,
This was our first family vacation ever and an excellent choice. The ship was extremely clean and service from our stateroom to our dining experience was incredible. I will definitely cruise with Disney AGAIN! This app was very helpful keeping with everything on board especially the numerous character appearances. Thank You!,
Just went on our cruise & this app was so handy! The onboard texting was great to keep in touch with the older kids.,
The Disney Cruise Line Navigator app is fantastic!  They keep it updated so that you know what is going on while you are on the ship.  The countdown feature before you board is great too.  We used the chat function within my family so that we could keep in touch even though we didn't have an international calling plan.  Love this app and will use it again if we go on another Disney Cruise.,
"This App was very helpful in keeping up with our day to day and hour to hour activities happening on the ship. My kids really enjoyed being able to see and know where to go to meet all of the different Disney Characters. Can't wait til 2017, we'll be sailing with you all again and again hopefully!!!!",
Really relied on this app! It came in very handy while on our cruise.,
"The fact that I can text other people who are onboard the ship with, me makes this app invaluable.",
Absolutely loved the app during my cruise. Very helpful for navigating activities around the ship.,
"This was awesome to have for the family. Easy to use, kept us to date on all our favorite activities we chose, and we could text each other if needed to thru the app. We loved it!!",
"I love that you can see schedules and menus days in advance, great planning tool.",
I was able to stay on top of everything happening on the cruise. This was a huge help in not missing the Characters and events.,
Was nice to use but wifi connections drops several times.,
"Used it on Fantasy June 2015 and Castaway Cay, worked very well. Would like to see group chat & picture sharing added.",
App very helpful to keep up with family. Need better signal when you receive an on board chat.,
"Liked the app, very helpful for activities and maps of the ship. Great for texting most of the time.",
App worked great when in use. Shows all the times of all activities as well as menus etc.,
Just used this for the first time onboard The Magic for my honeymoon. My wife and I would look through the paper personal navigator and then favorite all the activities we agreed upon in the DCL app. It definitely helped us remember what was coming up next. It also let us know what was on the menu for the evening so we could plan our meals. I gave it only four stars because the chat feature takes a while for messages to be sent through.,
"Very useful for activities,  but so much potential.  Suggestions : link to the kids club, personal excursion info, ability to communicate with key staff onboard, etickets for on board activities  (like fast pass?), and more!",
The app is very helpful especially when trying to find out what activities are on board and at what time everything is at.,
Alot easier and better then the paper navigator and I hate having my phone on vacation but I loved it,
I used this several times a day. It was very very useful.,
"It works well, but I wish changes to the schedules were communicated better",
"Great app, wish that you could add notification tone... on ship chat was the best.",
Needs more detail about the events onboard. Loved every moment of the cruise though.,
Worked well updated daily.  Had no issues with times always was updated.  Worked really well for the daily dinner menu as well.,
Used it every day for everything from activity times and locations to dinner menus. Very easy to use!,
"Incredibly helpful and very easy-to-use!! Download this app, you will be able to ""text"" your party even though you won't have service, it's great!",
Great app. Used it daily to text our family and to view the menus before dining.,
Excellent way to stay informed and navigate the ship.,
Much more handy than carrying the paper copy around the ship.,
The upgrades have improved this app to one that matches the navigator on board.,
It is only helpful on the boat.   But it is a great app on the boat.   And it is completely free to use,
Great for on board info on Disney ships. Easy to keep up with activities and dining info.,
Very helpful around the ship when you need to know what is going on.,
Worked great to keep up with family as well as our activities onboard.  Great addition to the cruise!,
The app was great and even works on the boat and islands.,
Helped a few times during the cruise. Definitely download!,
Very helpful for onboard schedules and very much loved the texting feature.,
Great app.a lot easier than carrying around the paper navigator,
Easy to use. Everyday everything at your finger tips.,
This app allowed me to keep up with my family and all of the events on the ship.,
Super helpful i suggest to any one on a Disney Cruise to download and use,
"We user the app on our recent cruise and it was great....easy to use, very informative, and a great way to communicate with the family",
We especially loved being able to text each other on the cruise and checking for updates.  Thanks!,
Excellent... Always knew what was going on and where to be.,
Very helpful for activities and chatting with family,
Needs to have an itinerary builder as well.,
The app was great during our cruise on the Dream. It kept you informed of exactly what was going on at all times and where..... You could view dinner menus prior to dinner....characters appear next...and so much more.,
Lots of info and the perfect travel companion!,
We went on Disney Dream and it was so much fun,
"Great app, very helpful!",
App is awesome and the onboard chat is great,
7 night cruise,
It was easy to use and very helpful,
Easy to use & user friendly,
Great tool while on board!,
Very useful!,
Great app!,
you can see what where and when everything was,
Helped 24 7,
Very helpful on the cruise,
Great,
Great app,
Is the best,
Works good enough to text other members of your party. Couldn't figure out how to get audible notifications instead of vibrate only which was ok.  I wish they would add a GPS location part to see where all of my kids are at that time. The most common question to my son was where are you to which he hardly ever answered.  If I could check GPS there would be no need to ask.  Navigator information was good.  Maybe add a compass to point you in the right direction.,
"The app has been counting down to our cruise date since December.  Got a notification of update, now getting ""Unfortunately, Disney Cruise has stopped.""  The app is installed on a Galaxy Tab 3.  Tried a reinstall but it hasn't helped.  Would be nice to check it out on the cruise.",
"This was awesome onboard!! There's a chat feature to ""text"" others in your party, ways to get reminders and alerts about upcoming activities, and all dining menus. The only thing that would have made this app perfect would be a way to input shore excursions and dinners at Palo and Remy. Otherwise though this was great! Used it multiple times a day.",
Worked awesome on the ship. A must have when going on a disney cruise. All the activities and even meal choices for the day are right at your fingertips.,
Super helpful. We could get to the activities and have them always at our hands without paper handling. Is a sustainable tool to be organized.,
"Made the trip more magical, as it let's you plan your trip throughout the day. It setup with there WiFi for free and easy. A must have download before you get on the cruise.",
"Gave all the character appearances,  activities, drink of the day, dinner menus, map of the ship, locations, even keeps you in contact with family and friends aboard the ship. You'll want to at least give it a chance and download it be for you leave port or you won't have another chance without paying a lot for Internet access.",
Worked well before cruise and when on cruise.  It was so much better than taking the paper navigator with me while there.  It was also good for planning ahead and not waiting until we got back to the cabin.  Thanks for a great way to stay informed.,
"Having a bit more info on daily activities would have been great, but over all this app was a good time saver, specially on menu selection.",
This made keeping info close at hand while cruising easy a day favourite and activity and it sends a reminder. No thinking required while on vacation! Truly magical,
Really helpful on board was so sad to delete it when the the trip was sadly over.,
I wish there was a way to send group messages in the app. I also wish there was a way to 'toggle' using the data on the account and still have access to the app/messaging.,
App was very helpful. Gives you the character times & locations. You can see the dinner menu for  the restaurants before you go.,
Great for finding where the characters were and the daily schedule of events.,
So useful prior to and during the cruise! Thank you!,
Able to plan day easily and quickly find what is available to do,
Told me everything onboard!,
Cannot open app on Samsung SCH-S738C.  Uninstalled and reinstalled and still won't work . . .. frustrating!!!,
Great app.,
Such a great app while on the sbip,
"Great way to see what's going on,  what's for dinner,  and much more.  Loved the ""favorites"" option!",
Must have on a disney cruise a+,
Great app!,
Very  useful,
Great app,
This worked great for knowing what's going on and when and for whom. However my biggest issue concerning this app is the lack of notification settings. The app only. Made my phone vibrate once for a message and no notification sound. So I did miss a lot of messages sent on board. If that could be fixed I'd give this a 5.,
"We used this app every day during our trip.  We were able to set favorite activities and it gave us a notification so we wouldn't miss anything.  I recommend this app to everyone going on the disney cruise.  Only thing I wish it did have was a "" you are here"" feature maybe set up through the in house wifi. Not a complaint just a sugestion. All in all it was a great app and an asset for the vacation",
"App designers please take note of this app,  this is how you write an app that provides a great experience while on board the ship.   Everything is within 1 or 2 clicks.  Very well thought out.   My only complaint would be to update the ship maps with the laundry locations.",
"We just got off the Fantasy and were very pleased with the app. The messaging feature worked well, and was much more convenient than the wave phone. Some nice enhancements would be to enable real-time updates (for example, some activities were canceled on deck one day to high winds. A notification on the app would have been useful) and enabling use on Castaway Cay.",
"Love the ability to communicate with other cruisers on board.  Allows all cruisers of a group to ""be independent"" yet arrange to meet for joint activities/meals.   Great access to the electronic Navigator!  Makes it sooo easy to discover activities and actually get to them on time and at the right location with the ship map/deck plan that is included.  Love this app.  Would like a little improvement in the communication portion...difficult to establish first communication.",
"Best part was getting the reminders for things you ""liked."" Only thing is you had to be connected to internet to get reminders. But app works without internet just fine although no reminders. Loved the maps. If they could just add a way to view your room charges so you could track them!",
"Although wave phones are provided, our group found the best way to communicate throughout our cruise was using this app. It helped our 3 families stay in touch with our daily plans and find eachother on the ship and helped plan our day. However, two notable improvements should be considered: 1)Group chats would really help instead of texting the same message to multiple people. 2)We could not use this on Castaway Cay and were not able to coordinate location because wave phones kept on getting busy signals.",
"I loved it.  This app was very useful, and I used it in place of the paper navigator in most circumstances.  I did not utilize it to its full potential, but wonder if it would be possible to connect/chat to other guests not in the same stateroom, or perhaps have an onboard chat room where the guests can meet and exchange information.  I never thought of using it on castaway cay, but would have if the kids weren't having so much fun in the water, to find activities and character appearances.  Good job Disney",
"I went aboard the wonderful Disney Fantasy with a party if 7 occupying two rooms.   We were able to communicate and coordinate our activities very effectively.  The navigator features were super helpful, but walt says anything is possible if you  believe.  I believe  this app would be well serverd to allow for group chat, the ability to invite people to events.  It would also be great if you could see your account balance and build a schedule from your application.  Another super",
This was a huge help and convience while on the cruise.  Kids could run around and still stay in touch...loved it! We all got to do whay we wanted and then gathered together for things we all wanted to do. Wish they gave us access to this great app on castaway cay.  They could easily allow access on castaway cay but it was not available there and that made it impossible to find everyone on the island.  They need to allow pics and group chat.,
"This App was extremely useful during our cruise!  The ability to communicate to family and friends while onboard the ship, via text, is a very nice feature.  The 'electronic' Navigator and Deck Plans were used almost exclusively versus paper.  Suggestions for improvement: 1) Having the ability to communicate on Castaway Cay.  2) Integrating the 'Wave Phone' features into the App. 3) Making sure activity listing, with time and location, were accurate.  We only found two, very minor errors.",
"We used this a lot on our cruise.  We would have used the chat feature all the time, but it was inconsistent.",
The daily navigator onboard didno't  always match the times and locations presented by my app.  If there's  any changes... you won't know!  Still great to have.. juat keep a paper one around too.  Loved the activities feature and dining information too!,
The app is good but as with all apps some improvements are needed. A tone or audible  alert for messages or when a event you want to see or do.,
Still would like more interactive features with it. The idea previously mentioning as a replacement of the wave phone (which I consider useless and in need of updating) or sync with wave phone would be great! Because of food allergies the ability to see the menus was very nice.,
"This app allowed me to look at show times for the shows I wanted to watch in the theaters and menus on the ship which work perfectly if u travel with young ones to know if they'll like what's on the menu or not it also has a feature in which u can text between others for  no cost as long as you are connected to he ships wi fi  which again works great if someone in your party has separated and has a device to text you with, this app has no glitches and is perfect.",
"This made everything on the cruise so much easier. Finding where things are on board, knowing what's going on, and even being able to chat with other people on the ship made our time more fun and easier",
"Was very happy with the app...made using the paper navigator redundant.  Especially liked the messenger feature...you can use this on the ship's WiFi for free and keep in contact with your family.  Two enhancements I'd like to see are a page showing current ship info like course, speed and wind direction.  I'd also like to see a page with current charges for the room.  This app was a huge asset in enhancing my ability to plan our days.  Very well done!!!",
I used both paper navigator and the app. I like the favorite button so I could remember and see the items I wanted to do that day in place.,
This app broke everything according to catargory... a plus to carry around with us,
"This app was great; way more useful than the wave phones. I'd suggest merging the calls and notifications from the kids club on the app instead of the phone which didn't work on Castaway Cay. Overall, loved the app!",
"This application not only keeps you updated with the many options for planning your day, but it allows communication among those you meet on board.  My wife and I connected with many couples on the ship and this was great for coordinating last minute plans.  Definitely a must have for any cruiser!",
"Great app to find out what's going on the cruise, show/movie times, map to show locations. Also has a chat feature to talk to family members and new friends.",
From the countdown to the on ship navigator this is a must have for Disney cruises.   Love it!  Nice to see the menu for the entire trip ad well as see what's going on in the theaters and at ports.,
"Loved using this on the ship. Only downside is once you're logged into the ships wifi, it interfers with the regular connection while still in U.S.",
Would be so much better if they had an instant messaging feature built in...even if you could only use it with other passengers on the ship,
The app worked well as a personal Navigator of activities. The chat function only worked on one device. There is no tech support.,
"App worked as advertised on the cruise. The ability to communicate with others that had that app was great. A lot of great information in the app including daily schedule,  menus and ship map.                                             One feature I would like to see added to the apps is the ability for people to check into certain events or location.  Just a simple quick way to notify interested parties of your location.",
This was a great way to stay on top of all the activities going on aboard the ship. All activities include where everything takes place. A must for anyone cruising.,
Loved everything. Only think that would be cool is interactive things on it. Like maybe a scavenger hunt involving the app,
"At this time, the Disney Wonder does not support in app chat/messaging. The app is great for checking ""all activities"". This helps coordinate character signing. Also very handy for checking the dinner menu ahead of time. Disney only serves excellent meals.",
Disney Cruise Line is doing a great effort to keep this app updated and adding new features like the chat (that I used on my last cruise). Good job!,
Very useful app!  It made it so much easier to see what activities were going on and what times they were starting.  Also liked seeing the dinner menus before sitting down to eat.  The ability to text others in your party made it easy to communicate if you didn't want to carry or forgot grab a room phone.,
"Got some great info, but texting still not available on Wonder.",
Used this on our cruise and all the information was amazing. The WiFi for it to update you needed to reconnect anytime you used the app and reconnect to receive messages so you wouldn't get messages unless the app was open  it also wouldn't update times untill you disconnected and reconnect everything but really cool idea can't wait for the update and it to be at 100%,
"This app is meant to be used on a Disney Cruise. It gives you the Daily Navigators (itinerary), menus, ship maps, port information, etc. Very useful tool during the cruise. Information is not available until you are actually on the cruise ship and connect to the on board WiFi",
"Easy access to the ""what and when"" on board. Like to see what the options for dinner were ahead of time. If options didn't look good we ate in Cabanas!",
"Made knowing what was happening on the ship at all times simple and quick. I could check dinner menus with it also so I could plan ahead,  and check times and locations of character appearances anytime, anywhere. You need this app, trust me.",
"Great concept,  definitely should try to add to it to take the place of wave phones...or be able to text with the app",
"Enjoyed having daily reminders of events going on during the day.  Also, liked being able to look at menus and restaurants' menus.",
"Very handy, a quick way to figure out what's going on in the ship and to check out the dinner menu before hand...",
"This proved to be a very beneficial app, always providing UP TO DATE and timely information on the trip --- from suggestions, meal selections, deck plans, activities, and more.    However, the addition of ""Bridge Reports"" or bridge views would be nice additions!",
If Disney could add talk (voip) for it would replace the wave phones on board.  Otherwise it was very useful.,
Easy to keep track of shipboard events.  Only recommendations for improvement is to keep adding more.  Add excursions.  Add shipboard announcements.,
"Every time I keep getting a warning message saying ""Sorry, data connection has been interrupted! Please try again later."" Already uninstalled and reinstalled but no luck. Beyond frustrated.",
"App is great for knowing what is happening on ship, dinner menus, deck plans and best of all, the texting to communicate with family.",
"Great idea, and loved it when it worked, but our phones (4 of them, with different makes and models) would frequently disconnect from the ship's Wi-Fi with no warning, and we wouldn't realize we weren't getting messages as a result. So the app was great, when we were connected...",
"The app was great. One big improvement would be to allow the kid's club to communicate via the app and not just with the wave phone. When the kids were in the club and we wanted to be available in case they wanted to leave, we had to also carry a wave phone. It would have been nice to have been able to register our unique chat numbers with the kids club as we did when sharing with other cruisers and just carry our phones. Other than that, we loved using the app on our cruise last week.",
"Overall very helpful, although its connection to the shipboard network was iffy at times.",
It helped me of where I was located if my mother and father needed to get up with me they could send me a message from the app.it also helped me find the activities I would like to do and where the activities would be located. I would really recommend this app if you go on a disney cruise,
Best way to keep up on activities on board the ship and set reminders so you don't miss a thing.,
Worked exactly as expected. Chat was great and the schedule helped us keep track of events,
"Great way to get around the ship and see what's going on. We never figured out how to 'message' others within the app but it's just a ship, how far away can people be?",
This app made it so much easier to organize our days on the cruise. Fantastic!,
"One of the best example, how the technology can be used today to make the vacation even more better!",
I haven't used the app on board yet but would love an update for a countdown widget!,
"We loved using the Disney Cruise app.  It was wonderful every day to count down to our sail date!  Once on board, we loved the text feature, schedules, and events!  Can't wait for our next cruise!!",
Dream Cruise was the best trip of my life! Did not pay for onboard internet so didn't use the app.,
"Great app.easy to use,  easy to.keep up with on board activities!",
Fantastic app...Disney went over and beyond with it. Great job!,
This app made it easy to select desired activities. I loved it!,
Worked great on our recent cruise. Did not try the messaging function.,
It was better to use our phones to keep in touch with family instead of the wave phones.,
It was very helpful during our cruise! Kept us informed.,
"Excellent app keeps you informed of all activities, map of ship and meal info",
Love to be able to stay in touch with the people in my cabin.,
This worked great with no issues. It was great to have dining options and activities at my fingertips.,
I love it because this app can tell were you are,
Really helped keep track and navigated very well,
Letn me see what was happening and the dinner menu,
This app made my cruise so much easier,
Great app. Made my vacation. Had everything at my fingertips.,
Good app.  Needs to be more interactive.,
Helps to communicate with family while aboard.,
24 hour in touch with everything!,
The Anticipation has us excited!,
Was very useful and accurate,
Works great very useful!,
Had an awesome time! App kept us informed the whole trip...we didn't miss anything!,
"I absolutely loved this app!! I've used it on both my cruises and will have it for my next cruise. It is an absolute life saver!!!! It really keeps up up to date with what's going on, and in my case kept me organized and on schedule!!!! GREAT JOB DISNEY AS ALWAY!!!!",
Very helpful and great for contacting family,
Could be improved on but i love the features,
Great tool to preview dinner menu,
Great app! Must have.,
Loved the navigator and communication ability.,
Great countdown to your vacation!,
Great tool!,
Great tool!,
Really helpful on the cruise.,
Love it !,
Best app ever,
Like the chat option,
Extremely helpful,
Great app,
So helpful,
Loved it,
"The only app needed.   Navigator in hand at all times. And new chat option on the Dream. We use it at least 20 times a day for movie listings, show times and much more.",
Disney Cruise,
,
,
"This app basically gives you on-demand access to all activities and information related to your specific Disney Cruise and pretty much negates the need to carry around the paper Navigator you're given each day. We used it many, many times on the fly and it was such a wonderful convenience.",
This app was so perfect! I could text the friends I met on the boat without needing service and without using the annoying wave phones lol. The app changed everyday to match the menus and the activities. There was a map of the ship with restaurants and clubs so you can never get lost. It's basically a navigator on your phone. It's wonderful.,
Good app very helpful on the dinner menus and keep track of the activities. ...wish it could alert u to stuff and have more features but it's good for now till someone figures out how to keep everyone connected to wifi while on board,
We used it for our December 2014 Dream cruise. This should be done by every cruise line. App even let you set favorites that remind you when events will happen. Very easy set up and install. The chat is awesome as well. Typical Disney....above and beyond the rest.,
"Used this app on 2 crises now. New chat feature is great, albeit slow. but be aware it does not work on Castaway Cay. You would figure it wouldn't work on other islands, but since CC is Disney's island, you might assume it would...not yet. Also...we were traveling in a group of 6...1 person had an older phone who's version of android wouldn't support the app (disappointing) and 1 other who had a brand new iPhone-exact same as his wife's-worked, but he received no notifications from the app.",
"This is an awesome idea. The app was so useful in finding where to go, what activities were available, etc. If other cruise lines aren't doing this, they better start. HOWEVER, the chat had some very annoying bugs. In one instance, I sent a message to my father in law, and he didn't get it for a few hours. The worst was that your message would often just disappear as you were typing it. It looks like the app has since been updated, so, hopefully, these have been address. Great overall!",
"Worked great on the new years cruise on the fantasy.  It was a great way to communicate with family (easier than wave phones). It was easy to navigate activities,  menus, character meetings, etc. You could ""favorite"" activities and the app would buzz and remind you.  You can still access the navigator on castaway cay, but you cant send/receive messages,  so you have to switch to wave phones.  If possible, it would be nice to get account info and message multiple people at once.",
"Unfortunately, the app was so hit and miss on the fantasy that I stopped using it. Really cool idea but would literally say to check back once we have set sail. Fyi, I am a tech guy too so i know it wasn't wifi settings.",
"Could include your particular cruise specifics. Things like dining rotation, names of servers, your booked excursions. Also a way to access your ship account would be helpful. The messenger is a little laggy sometimes. Overall good! Love the navigator on the app and the list of favorites along with the reminders.",
Absolutely loved that you could use the app for free on the ship's wi-fi. We used the app to chat and synch up when we did different activities and to check on the weather and dinner menus.,
Loved the app for scheduling and chatting with family on board. Doesn't work at Castaway Cay and with that expansive space it would have been nice to use. Also it's hard to find people -- wish there was a search feature to find friends by name or cabin number to request chat.,
We used this for the New  Years Eve cruise aboard the Magic.   The app wasn't always updating. We did have to restart our phones A LOT!!  It was nice when it worked to keep up to date with activities and to have the reminders for favorites.,
This app works great on the cruise.  You can text your party on board so its easy to stay in touch.  Better than the wave phones.  Only draw back is that you can not group message.,
Great app...  Very easy to use.  Comes in very handy when you need info on the go.   Could only suggest that there is more detailed descriptions for the shows and events.,
The app was much easier to use than the paper navigator. I just went through and hearted my activities then they were easy to find.,
"It is great to choose what to do. All the activities and anything else you want to know about what  is going on on the ship is there, but the chat part of it did not work but still it was  a great app to have onboard",
This app was fabulous on our cruise. We were able to see & be part of every daily attraction because of it. It's a must have.,
"Some of the activities listed were not accurate.  Otherwise,  great way to keep up with activities and chat with others on the app.",
It did shut down a few times when we opened items for more detail.  Otherwise good app. Used the app a 2nd time no issues. Loved it!,
"The app worked great.  The paper Navigator should be replaced by this app for both iOS and Android. You get all the deck plans, menu for the dining options, and shows,  movies and activities. Would be a great idea to get the survey they give at the end of the cruise as part of app offering as well to get higher responses to the survey.",
Great for seeing what is on the menus before dinner. It would be better if it could be used on Kindles and other readers and pads.,
"Along with anything Disney does, it's first class. App worked great. It keeps you well informed to the events of the day and to what's going on throughout the week. A must have. They do provide a written schedule every evening at bed turn down, but the app is great on the go. Works great througout the ship.",
"We used this app on the Disney Magic. Generally very handy. It was a multi step process to refresh the app,  trying to figure it out the first time was a pain. A refresh button in the app would be nice.",
Great app. Lots of great info. I wish it let you choose a ring tone. Vibrant is the only option and sometimes you don't notice it.,
"Worked well.  A little trouble connecting on day 1.  Messaging was a great feature, but needs more prominent notifications.",
Had it on me all the time it let me set favorites for activities that I wanted to see and do. Only down side is when not on the ship you can't access  basic information like ship map and needs a countdown refresh so u can set your own pictures as background.,
Great ago for letting you know what's going on. You can select your favorites and it sort of puts together a daily schedule for you. The chat tool is a nice way of keeping track of everyone. Much better than the wave phones.,
A must have. You don't want to carry around paper navigators. This is a great app to have on board. Would have liked ability to send chat message to multiple people in our party.,
It keeps you up to date on the current activities and everything going on in the ship and the texting function worked great as well. I wish I could use it outside the ship being home now :/,
"I just used it for my fifth disney cruise. When you first get on the ship, you only have to connect to the free internet specifically for this app once. You can go the rest of the cruise without wifi for this application to update its self. This app is extremely easy to use and has even more information than you would find on the real navigators. It also has a countdown to your next cruise. If you are going on a disney cruise, make sure you have this app.",
awesome app! Loved not having to carry around the paper the whole time.  Very accurate.  Loved the alert features too!,
You can find all the menus at each restaurant easily. We couldn't get the texting to work,
"The app made it easy to figure out our day and if we lost our Navigator paper, we could easily look up character appearances, dinner menus, deck plans, etc... without having to find another daily Navigator.",
Was so easy to use and better than carrying around paper with activities on it.I would recommend it for everyone.,
It helped so much. I loved that I could look at every activity during the day and got to decide what sounded good for dinner when I first woke up. Great app!!!,
Very useful app  keeps one informed  of all All activities  available  during cruise.,
This app is a great help. It allowed us to know the activities and schedule as well as look at where and what we could eat.,
"It really helped organize the day, had reminders and easy to use.   Really enjoyed it",
Good work well. Would have been better if you had free WiFi on the ship to have full use.,
"Menu choices on future days very good to see, main navigator for planning was obviously better but still good to have everything on hand!",
"Although the app has bugs, it's very useful to use during your cruise.",
This app kept my family in touch with all activities and menus. I wouldn't change a thing,
the app is a huge help. Much better than carrying around a paper navigator!,
"App works however, needs a better ui, hard to navigate.",
"This app is an extremely handy tool to have onboard with DCL! Works great and provides accurate maps, character times, dinner menus, etc. Highly recommend!",
The new chat feature was so much nicer than using wave phones! As always... nice job Disney!,
"We used this app on our second Disney cruise. It made it so much easier to communicate with each other on board with the instant messaging. That said, only 90% of the texts were received. The best part was the app  made it much easier to find out what activities were going on at any given time or day. You can also set up a personalized calendar of your favorite  activities including reminders. Great  job Disney, just fix the messaging.",
"Used this app the whole time during our cruise in January 2015! We knew what was for dinner, what characters were out taking pics and a map of the ship!",
Extremely nice to be able to look at menus in advance as well as being able to keep informed of activities.,
The app does a great job. Just got off the dream on Monday 1/26/15 and utilized it for alot of information while on board...,
No need for the Navigator. Everything you need to know while cruising is at the tip of your fingers.,
Great app!  Just wished the ship texting feature worked in December while on The Wonder.,
Was very helpful! We used it on the dream last week!,
Was a huge help! Worked great! Looking forward to using it next year!,
Awesome cruise and this app was a great tool.,
Loved that you could even sort favorites each day.,
So easy to see the time and location of all activities on board!! Love it !!!,
Employees are excellent. They will go above and beyond your requests.,
5 stars for Mickey and the whole crew! Navigator is very helpful for all on board activities!,
This app was all I needed to keep me up on all the activities.,
We used it for January 2015 cruise. It is helpful for the activities and for your menus for dining.,
Very handy on the ship. Would like to have a better messenger feature.,
Helped me to keep up with all events on the cruise,
I wouldn't have been able to keep up with all the meet and greets and parties without this app!,
"Everything was great! Great service, great food and lots of fun activities! Look forward to the next time! :-)",
"If you're sailing with Disney this is a portable schedule, advisor, and map. Download it!",
Cruise was so so.  App was great.,
Great overall. Chat feature was a must-have.,
Worked great.,
Very useful in determining what to do and when.,
The texted works great now,
Needs notification of texts.,
Did not use much since I could not use the text features on the Magic,
Great app on board.  Lots of useful information,
Nice to check out menus before dinner.,
Great app it worked perfectly on the Dream,
Worked like a charm on our cruise,
"It's a great app...fun to use, very helpful",
Does its job well.,
Only Disney does it as well as they do !,
Very helpful tool!!!,
Loved it!,
This app  rocks!!!,
Navigator in your hand.,

"Like the chat update to the app. Used on 11/1/14 Fantasy Cruise. Enjoyed messaging feature but it still has some quirks. Would be nice to add people by cabin number or name lookup than be able to accept or reject their ""friend request"" rather than only by unique ID. Found some discrepancies between app and printed Navigator. Always rely on printed copy.",
I was on fantasy and I didn't miss a thing with this app. Indeed of weeding through a paper everyday I was able to find out showtimes and character showings at a glance. The chart option is a great feature but they need to add a sound when the messages come in currently it only vibrates. I had both android and Apple and it runs a lot smoother on the android.,
"The texting aspect of this app was very spotty.  Sometimes it wouldnt work, sometimes it wouldn't vibrate, sometimes I got kicked off Wi-Fi all together.  I wish there had been a way to call instead of text.  Also some of the schedules were conflicting.  I did like the favorites notification, and the menus.  I think with a little work this app will be great....Just not yet",
"Disappointed there were no deck plans and activities lists before boarding. Navigator was most helpful. In a large group, most found it too inconsistent when trying to chat. Messages didn't always make it or were delayed, causing confusion or missed connections. Please add a sound feature. Look forward to better features on our next trip.",
"This app really helped us on our trip aboard the Disney Wonder. Menus, floor plans, and activities were all available in the app. However, it did have some errors in times and menus. Also it advised that a (onboard paid for) data connection was needed to get the most out of the app. I also would have liked for automatic notifications to be pushed to my phone concerning announcements and updates.",
My wife and I cruised in January 2014 and the app was not much more than a novelty countdown app. We just got off of our December 2014 cruise and we were really pleased with all of the new features. Especially useful is the chat app which allows you to IM anyone else in your post who has  the app. Since no one really uses the wave phones in the staterooms this is an awesome addition.,
"Had a lot of trouble with the messaging field deleting itself and having to start over.  Info on the app many times did not match the printed navigator, missing movies times etc.  I also missed several messages because I simply could not hear it...no sound notification.",
"Really convenient while you are on the ship,  it lacks live updates when exceptional situations happen.  In our case due to weather we weren't able to go to Grand Cayman or castaway cay and the app didn't update in the whole day when the new schedule of activities.",
"Worked great on my android based S5. Had to uninstall and reinstall before it would work on my wife's iPhone 5s. Never did get it working on my iPad as I didn't want to use up the ships data plan to do so as that would use up my data. There are times when the app isn't updated when there are changes, so the paper navigator needed to be consulted and carried at all times. Disney needs to work on syncing the data so that last minute changes are reflected on the app and then I would give it 5 stars.",
"Loved this app, since it gave me and my extended family a chance to talk on the ship without cell service. Sometimes, the messenger would randomly delete all the text in the typing field. I thought it was an anomoly, but my brother expierenced the same problem. Likewise, I had to re-log into the WiFi every time I opened the app, though I'm not sure whether that's a fault of my phone or the app. Otherwise, wonderful app and it would get 5 stars besides the (almost perfect) chat feature.",
It does not list all the goings on as the paper Navigator does. It does have detailed menu listings for all the ships restaurants. It does have a messaging app. It runs off the ships free wi-fi and it is also the link to the for a fee wi-fi run by Connect at Sea.,
"I rely on this app for on board info.  It's very helpful for planning.  What would make it 5 stars would be for it to pick up your spa appointments, port excursions, dinner reservations, and dining rotation info, too, with an extra login, such as reservation number, room number, and last name.",
"The app crashed anytime I tried to access it from the drop down menu widget. It would also delete my text mid way through typing a chat message. Two thumbs down. Developers need to test the app in production. I would also recommend Disney list the app as beta, so expectations are not so high.",
This is a great app to know what is going on on the ship and where everything is. The chat part of the app needs work. It's very slow and sometimes you wouldn't get the message till the next day. If they fix that then 5 stars.,
First off the Disney Dream was incredible. Lots of none stop fun and food. Castaway Cay was a great Island that Disney owns. Second of all going back to this app.  It's a must have for anyone going on a Disney Cruise. It is up to date with the activities that are happening throughout the day. In short must get this app if booking a Disney Cruise. Enjoy...,
"I found that I couldn't rely on the accuracy 100% of the time and needed to double check with the hard copy of the Navigator. For instance, it had lunch ending at 3:00 one day. It seemed like a logical possibility but it wasn't and lunch actually ended at the usual 2:00. Menus were sketchy, too. I'll continue to give it a go on future cruises.",
"Great app. Would be perfect with a few items: search option, diary or journal of events attended, take pictures and tag them with events, use the app as your wave phone for voice calls, place room service orders, review images to purchase from shutters, review bill, fill out survey.",
"This app gives you all shows, appearances, and activities in one handy place, so you'll never miss them. Add each one too your favorites and create your own itinerary. The only thing missing is a messaging feature.",
"Prior to being onboard, the app is all but useless.   It has a countdown to sailing date that you have to reset any time the app updates. Once onboard, it does have a nice layout for scheduling activities. The chat is also useful for communicating. The problems: the chat app will only notify with vibrate. Not useful if  your device does not have a vibrate function. Not all the events and activities are shown on the schedule.  Suggested improvements: automatically list activities you have registered for.",
"This app was great on my cruise on the Fantasy in October! I'd only add a couple things: 1. Ability to set reminders on your phone with push notifications for activities you want to do. 2. Ability to filter out certain categories of activities (I don't care what's going on in Vibe, for instance). And 3. More features for when you're not on board. Seriously, as it is right now, you can't even look at maps of the ships until you're on board.",
"Great app. Love the addition of activity reminder.  If there were a better way to find contacts in chat function that would be great. Until I found someone in person, I had no way to add them. Missed meeting online friends.",
"A good app to help you with all activities happening on the ship during your cruise. The only problem with it is that if you don't pay for wifi, you may not have your phone with you much of the time. So you may not use the convenient features in the app very often.",
Very handy to have with you if you are carrying your phone anyways. Convenient to look at dinner menus ahead of time. Allows you to 'favorite' activities and then pull up all your favorites in a personalized schedule.  Does not allow you to add your own plans.,
"This app is wonderful for keeping up with everything hapening onboard. The only issue we had was with the chat feature. More times than not our chat messages weren't delivered on time, if at all. This created a lot of confusion and missed opportunities while we tried to find the rest of our party.",
The menus for therestaurarestaurants weren't always complete but it was still a handy app.  It would be nice if you could view your on board account from the app but I will still use it on our next cruise regardless.,
Came in very handy to manage activity times and menus. One minor flaw I had was text deleting as I type in the chat function. Overall I was very glad to have it on this cruise.,
Not able to add/link dining reservations or port activities.   Adding a messenger and a twitter-like feed would also be cool.,
"We used it to plan ahead in our ordering for dinner and to narrow our activities searching.  Especially liked the ability to look ahead on other days to see the menu and activities as well. We could then schedule the whole week as for activities, dinner and shopping.",
A wonderful app that worked great.  It keep us informed of everything happening  for the 9 of us.  It made the thanksgiving  week easy.,
"Some times you just don't feel like carrying around the Navigator, so this is great.",
Used it daily on the Wonder. Suggestions for enhancements would be a map of the ship's course and where you are and an easier way to see your data usage.,
This app came in very useful. It had a lot of things/activities that were not on the paper activities handout. Great and highly recommended.,
Decent app if carrying phone around but if a port of call is canceled or there is a change schedule they don't update it.,
"We just got back from the Dream and the app worked flawlessly onboad and is a must have. Makes schedules, getting around, and finding charachter appearances much easier. Galaxy S4 and iphone 5s (no its not mine).",
"This app doesn't cost any data on the ship, it connects to the free guest wifi which is awesome! You always know what's going on and where to be! A huge help when trying to juggle princess appearances and times for the shows!",
It was very useful for the navigator portion plus other info. But for texting it just wasn't useful only because our kids are so young if they were teenagers it would be great,
Party of 10 mixed android and iOS worked for some and not others on & off. My install was mostly good,
"Needs chat notifications,  group chat feature,  and an easier way to find people, for instance by their name! The number assigned is not a convenient way to connect with others sailing together in different staterooms.",
Had a few times when the times were incorrect or they were on the printed navigator but not listed in the app.  Had to clear data a few times for it to update as things changed throughout the week too.,
I used the app all cruise.  Only glanced at the paper navigator then used the app the rest of the day.,
Their was 3 family's using the app. It was very helpful with times and dinner menus and locations. The chat would have been great and I would have given 5 stars if the messages wouldn't have taken 20 minutes to go through at times.,
Worked great on our cruise last week. Really helped entire family plan out activities and arranged meals with menus available in the app.,
"It is a digital navigator. The app would be better if there was more interactivity. Such as adding personal, scheduled port excursions. Providing the user with the opportunity to have an Outlook-like look of the daily activities you would like to do along with those you have scheduled, both on-board and off.",
Really enjoyed having this app on our cruise. We were able to easily send messages to others and keep tracking activities we wanted to attend. Really liked having the reminders sent for upcoming favourite activities.  Would have been nice to have the kids club be able to text us on this app as well so we didn't have to carry the wave phones with us.,
This is a handy app. The chat function is great but sometimes your message erases before you send and you have to start all over.,
Our 1st Disney cruise wonder and all of us are satisfied. Loved the navigator especially my son who never go anywhere without the apps. Very helpful and informative.,
My husband and I used the app constantly to keep track of the various activities onboard. Would be great if it was integrated with our onboard account to keep track of purchases. Also would have liked the capabilities to reserve nursery time and spa services via the app. But overall it's a life saver onboard to keep track of character appearances and to stay connected!,
My whole family had the app and loved it was great to be able to set up favorites and not have to worry about forgetting a time!,
Chat messaging a bit slow and not always able to receive messages if app is not opened. Great for navigator info though.,
This is a great app that keeps you up to date on ship activities . Gives you a method to stay in touch with fellow cruisers via text messages.,
I liked it - sometimes when I was in the middle of texting the words would randomly disappear - but all in all it's a good app. Room for improvement.,
Great app for Disney cruisers.  I would like to see further functionality of the app by adding group chat and incorporating the kids club notification to eliminate carrying both cell phone and wave phone.,
Loved the fact I could mark favorites and my phone kept us on schedule to make the most of our vacation with our grandchildren.,
This app worked great on our recent cruise. We knew about everything that was happening without referring to the paper navigator. It gave us all the menus and onboard ship directions. Highly recommend for Disney cruisers.,
Used on the Wonder in October and was okay.  Liking forward to trying out the chat features  on the  Fantasy next month.,
"Really helped keep track of entertainment offerings, all aboard times and character appearances, as well as viewing dinner menus ahead of time.",
Perfect for keeping up with all the activities of the day.  Also liked the deck plans for figuring out where everything was located.,
Great onboard app but the App would be better if you could look at the schedule BEFORE you boarded the ship.  This way you could plan activities before you get onboard.,
"Would be perfect if the message part actually gave an audible notification.  Missed many messages because I wasn't continually looking at phone.  Otherwise, I think it is an awesome app!!!",
I could never get chat to work on my phone. Worked great for my daughter.,
Didnt work most of the time on the Wonder.  When it was working the times were all wrong.,
Loved being able to make plans each morning for what we would do and get push notifications to remind me...,
Just got off a 7 day cruise on the Fantasy and this app worked great. Came in handy many times.,
Would be great if you can set a reminder or alarm for upcoming events to ensure you do not miss anything :),
"We had this the first day the chat went live on the Dream.   App feature was fine for checking activities, but the chat feature itself wasn't reliable.  Many texts were late or lost completely.",
Sometimes the information  was  in error,
"I found the app to be useful on the ship. Sometimes it didn't always show the same information as the daily Navigator,  but no big deal.",
The app is great onboard the cruise ship. The app keeps you current with daily activities and the dining menu. The countdown feature is nice as well as it builds anticipation to go on your cruise.,
"Loved everything about it.  Great service, comfortable,  friendly, great food,  friendly,  and amazing!  One small detail though...shows are a little dated.   Keep up the great work!",
You can't convert to your next cruise on a back-to-back. The countdown won't start the day of the cruise it has to be the day after. The app needs to get more fine  tuned,
"Everyone in my party loved the app. Perfect source of information, from the day's menu to the character meets. When they give the warning to download the app before you disembark, make sure you get it!",
This app was stellar straight out of the box. Took a very short time once aboard ship to have the character tomes updated. The maps were very accurate. Another great product from Disney! Galaxy S4.,
Twice during my cruise I had to refavorite all my events because the app crashed. But otherwise a great app for keeping up with everything on the ship. Very useful.,
"Does not matter if it is your first or fifth cruise,  this is a must have to make the most out of your trip. From menus, to movie times, to shows and even when your favorite Disney person will be out for pics, it was all at my fingertips 24/7",
"I found the app helpful, when it was accurate. It didn't respond to changes and everything needs to be double checked with the Navigator that you got in you room or answers on board. It would be great if, once you booked an excursion or an appointment on board, the app automatically updated.",
"User friendly, convenient, and super helpful. I loved being able to ""favorite"" activities to help schedule my day. Also loved it for seeing the dinner menus ahead of time.",
This app worked every time I needed it without fail and was extremely helpful. Was able to see what activities were going on at any given time including where all the characters were and what was available to eat at any given time. Also has maps of the ship which was nice. Very awesome!,
"I loved being able to see what the menus where prior to going to the restaurant, also what activities were going on all day.",
She was able to stay on top of all the activities on the ship for the whole day. It was very helpful.,
Loved it!  So convenient to check menus and keep up with events.  I marked my favorites and got reminders so I didn't miss a thing! Had no problems with it at all on my android phone.,
I never had to use the paper compass agenda because of this app.,
"Download right away, you won't be d isappointed! Great for planning, finding you way and Character showings.  Don't forget the maps and especially for Castaway Key! Love it",
Great App and really helps you plan your day.  Works great and is just amazing.,
Was easy to use and extremely helpful. Used it often to keep track of the many activities and their locations.,
Used this all the time to find out what is going on during the cruise.  Had a few problems setting up chat but all in all would definitely recommend using this.  Way to go Disney with using apps!,
I especially liked being able to view the schedule of events and seeing the menus ahead of time for dinner.,
Would be good to have some of the basic information like deck plans avaliable even when not on board.,
I loved using it on the ship. I didn't have to keep up with the paper navigator :-),
This app works like a champ it was very informative with daily events and ship activities including character meet and greets i highly recommend to use while cruising disney.,
Excellent way to keep informed of all that goes on while on board a Disney cruise ship. Highly recommend using it while on your cruise,
I am pretty sure they charge to use their wifi and if not you will probably be receiving huge charges from ur cell phone company to use at sea so unless there are no hidden fees this is useless because u can't even pre schedule. I was hoping to be able to book excursions and view the ship layout before I got there.,
Make us easy to know everything that was happening....Thanks Disney,
didn't see daily menus of each dining option,
It was so convenient having all the info in my phone....and really handy being able to tag things!,
Great way to keep u with what and when things were happening,
This application help me to save a lot of time in the cruise finding the shows and so....,
"Of course it did, it's Disney!   Helped us keep track of the events and dinner menu's. Kids loved the countdown before the cruise!",
A must have if you are on a Disney Cruise.,
"Smooth sailing! Very easy to use,  kept us informed",
Loved the messaging part within the app with other passengers. ...and the events and programs schedules.,
Easy way to see what is happening on board by time.  Dining menus were accurate.,
I used this everyday of our cruise. It was always up to date.,
The app worked great could tell when activity were going on.,
Worked awesome for so many different uses.,
Nice and useful functionality but it is somewhat buggy and the messaging was not reliable which caused a missing appointment,
Doesn't always match paper Navigator.,
"Worked great, better then looking all over for the paper navigators.",
Was able to check at all times what was going on on the ship.,
Would have been nice to have ship info and location of ship,
"Works great, tell me everything I needed to know, Easy to use,  love it.",
Kept me up to date and on track leading up to the cruise as well as on the cruise,
Overall very useful and helpful application!,
Great app when it worked  Crashed multiple times and last two days even resident techie could not fix issue,
Everything is awsome except chat needs to notify you,
Worked well! Better than carrying a Navigator.,
Just wish it(chat) worked on castaway cay too!,
Used it on our cruise .. perfect to plan your day and find out what's going on ... a must have!,
Very handy during a cruise on the Magic.,
Used during cruise and told me everything I needed to know while I was on the ship and where all events were happening,
Super way to stay in touch with the ship and events.,
Loved having this availability!   So easy and convenient!,
Nice handy app to have on board!,
Very easy to use and helpful,
Still has some bugs but works good,
We were always aware of the program.,
"Great app for on board, and planning",
Cool for finding out events going on the ship.,
This app was the best Disney app ever,
Helped out immensly on the cruise!,
Great way to keep up with daily activities.,
Love it. Specifically now with the messaging feature.,
Quite helpful during our stay.,
Enjoyed the info and information,
Worked well on the ship highly recommend,
We had a day on the ship that was not the same day on our app,
"There Is Nothing Wrong With This App, Flawless! !!!!!!!!!!!",
Whats going happening on board.,
Very helpful onboard! !!!! Times places ( which deck ) etc.. had a total blast! !!!!! Superior service as well ! !!!!!!!!,
Very helpful!,
Handy tool to carry around ship.....,
Easy to use!,
Great app!,
Very useful on the ships!,
Best cruise line hands down!!!!!,
Magical!,
Loved this app.,
Love it!!!,
Great app.,
Great!!!!,
Loved it!!!!,
Usefull onboard App,
It was great,
Not too shabby,
Nice app,
Helpfull tool,
Works great,
Excellent,
Good,
,
App crashes everytime I try to open it. It was better before.  Hope disney fixes this soon.,
"After an update I can't get it to open, it crashes every time.  Leave no for our cruise in less than 90 days. Think we can get it fixed before then?",
Great way to keep tray,
"Very smooth app, but lacks the ability to Input ALL of your scheduled activities. I missed our sports simulator appointments (not free $$) and was super late for our dinner setting using the app exclusively for our agenda. Will use the old fashioned paper navigator next time with hand written notes until updates are made.",
"My wife, myself and our son took our fourth Disney cruise this past week. I was excited when we arrived and learned that Disney had their own cruise app that ran on the ships wireless network. Once it was downloaded everything was at my fingertips: showtimes, character appearances, kids and adult activities...literally everything. It was great. That is until three days into the cruise when the app stopped working. I tried everything I could think of but I couldn't get it working again. HTC Droid DNA.",
"This was a very helpful app to schedule my activities while onboard. Connectivity on the Dream was great, so I got reminders all over the ship of upcoming events I had marked as favorites. I would love it in a future release to add nap times and snack times.  Down the road, it would be awesome to view streaming content, such as stage shows or special events that one may have missed onboard. Since the Magic disappointingly did not get on-demand video in the staterooms, this would be a big win to expand entertainment choices.",
"This was a really useful app for carrying around onboard. It allows you to see everything that's going on during your cruise, you can select your favorite activities and then you'll receive automatic notifications when an activity is starting.",
It was very useful on our cruise. I used it to look up activities for the day as well as getting a jump start on the menu for the day. I wished it allowed you to mark the things you want to do for the day & maybe give you a little alarm before so you don't forget. Other than that... very good app.,
"Possibly THEE most useful app I've ever used!  I used it for a Disney Dream cruise in June/July 2014.  It was incredibly handy. Very easy to use. Well organized. Great to have all the info about the ship's happenings right in my pocket.  It was also kept very up to date!  When they wound up changing our day at sea to a stop at Castaway Cay, the app was updated very shortly after the update was announced. Which made it 100 times more useful than the paper schedule they give out each night. (Although, they did have updated printed scheduled out fairly quickly, but the app was first!) All apps should be this useful. Download it! You will not be sorry.",
The Disney Fantasy was amazing and being able to still use my phone and this app and not carry around the navigator. Love you disney.,
really liked the app. We sailed on the fantasy and used it every day. It was great not having to carry around the navigator to see what was going on Everything was at your fingertips. it was great for seeing layout of the ship as well as seeing what shows were going on at that exact moment. It was also great to see what was open for food.,
"A map at your fingertips, no looking for a map and getting lost. Schedule is easy to read and makes planning each day effortless. The reminder change is awesome.",
It was great to have everything right at your fingertips.   We sailed last week and actually  told others about it onboard.  So useful.,
"Really easy to use. Wonderful addition to the Navigator. Only suggestion is to be able to link favorites with others in your party, and the ability to add excursion to the schedule. Great app.",
Love it. Now can not imagine cruising without it. Love to be able to create personal favorite list of  can't miss things. Easy to navigate. Great app.,
"Does what it says on the tin. Very useful onboard. A GPS style map would be an improvement, to help guests navigate their way around ship more easily.",
The app is best onboard. The menus are handy for each day to find an option that works best for you. It includes both adult and kid menus each night. Making choices easy.,
It was so handy to have this app on our phones to keep up with activities and to have easy access to deck plans before we figured out where things were.,
Easy to use very basic not always lists everything on ship or all dinning used in recent Disney dream cruise was handy!,
"Very simple to use and accurate. Like that you can use onboard without incurring charges for Wi-Fi. A useful app, especially liked the dinner menus and restaurant times",
"The Disney Cruise App was extremely useful and allowed me to access to relevant information for the daily cruise activities, dinner menus, port information and character appearances. My kids were able plan activities around the character appeatance schedules, so they never missed a chance to meet all of the Disney and Pixar characters.",
This app was super usefull. From having notifications for your fav activities to checking the dinning menu...great. It would be great if you could see ship's purchases and the character pictures taken in the ship.,
"Very helpful and useful, reminds you of things to do so you don't always have to check the navigator",
This App was very helpful. It gave me all the right info to not miss anything. Great app.,
"A great app to use whilst on a Disney Cruise. Worked well and provided a great deal of information.  The ""reminder"" function was useful. Worked reliably on Xoom2 tablet.",
"Fabulous, kept us up to date so we didnt miss anything at all. Brilliant !",
"This app Was extremely helpful while on Cruise, oppose to the paper Navigator that comes to your room.",
"This app has all ship information. Dining, daily activities, movies, shows, etc.. Just go through and save your Favorites and it reminds you.",
Loved being able to check out all of the on board activities on my phone. Just wish it was more useful while not actually on the cruise.,
It really helpful to guide what's go on daily to get preview the lunch and dinner menu on apps before go into dining room. The map is helpful to go maze path to right place since Disney Dream is so mega ship and easy to get lost if not have the app to show map.  Thanks Disney for having great app for mobile.  Keep up and we will return to cruise next year.,
Never went on any cruise (afraid to sail) but it was nice seeing wht it could be  loved it,
Great app to view the daily navigator and to text members of your party. I will be using it on our next cruise!,
"This app is great for keeping you update on activities, dining, characters, etc.  Only works on board.",
Perfect for family of 5... Made favorites of all events we didn't want to miss... Worked beautifully!,
"Great app, could keep up with all the happenings of the day.",
Hardly read the daily navigators that were left in the state room.,
"The app was extremely helpful and useful,no more carrying around paper. ..Thanks Disney.",
Get app when we were aboard. Everything worked like clock work.,
Very helpful while of board. Best vacation of our life.,
Used this on the Fantasy. All the info you need at your fingertips.,
"it was very easy to know what was happening around the ship, great app!",
Used on the fantasy. My children used on ipods. Great for Edge activities!!,
Very useful onboard ship. I found it easier to use than the paper navigator.,
"Great app! Works well, full of necessary ship information.",
Got  a reminder 15 mins before each character appearance.,
Daily schedule of activities and info. Great tool,
Loved being able to mark favorites and get alerts when events were starting,
Just finished our first disney cruise this app was extremely helpful!,
Great app!!! Very Helpful while on the cruise ship,
Loved this app. I used it everyday allday!,
Great to see what's available by category.,
And that's it.,
Easy to follow all activties,
"Great app,  could use without Wi-Fi.",
Used on the Disney magic really useful app,
Better than carrying paper navigation,
This was most useful app.,
"Listed activities, menus, deck plans!! Really helped with planning our days on board!!",
Most of the time. An excellent 1st edition,
Great app for a great trip!,
Disney sets the benchmark for others once again.,
Unstable wii fi onboard,
Works great on the ship.,
Disney map,
Easy to use,
Amazingg app,
Needs to have ship map,
Very useful,
great tool,
Hot,
Amazing,
Awesome,
Worth it,
"The app was fun prior to our cruise because of the countdown clock, but when we were onboard, we didn't use it much. It kept trying to sell us the wireless connection while we were trying to look at the free information it provides. It got a little annoying after a while, so we just referred to the activity paper Disney would leave in our stateroom each night. I did not have international service on my phone, so I rarely carried my phone with me anyway.",
"Just got back from a wonderful cruise on the Disney Fantasy.  The app was an amazing tool, providing lots of info in an easy to read format.  I only wish the app didn't clear after the cruise!  I found myself going fuzzy after the trip talking with friends, and would have loved to have gone back through the days to remember everything.",
This app would have been much more useful if it didn't need wifi on so often.   Especially as wifi was so expensive.,
"Needed a better way to view activities via category and time. Otherwise, great app, especially if you don't have the daily Navigator handy.",
Disney leads the way again. The app was so helpful. Never looked at the paper guide the entire cruise. Other cruise lines will try to mimick in the future.,
Tells you all that is happening on board. Even let's you see menus for your dining all trip. Difficult to connect it and useless off the boat. Would be great if it gave some info before leaving,
Every activity was listed along with the time and place. All the menus could be reviewed before going to dinners,
This app was so helpful on the boat.  We easily viewed activities throughout the day (and there is sooooo much to do).,
"This was great to have while onboard, shows dinner menu in advance so my son could spend as much time as he needed to decide.",
"Used it on the boat, worked just fine.   Helped out alot with planning activities.",
"Really useful app for those like me that seem to carry their phone on them regardless. One addition would make it perfect for me, and that's adding in reminders for events - linking it in with the Favourite activities feature would seem the most appropriate way to do it.",
Sure beats carrying a pamphlet around the whole time. Plus they provide free WiFi (to operate this app only) even when phone is in airplane mode. Great app. Convenient.,
Great for finding what's going on.  Highly recommend. Would be nice if we could communicate with one another by allowing us to send messages or IM's.,
"Definitely worth using on the Disney cruise. Helped us keep track of all the wonderful activities on board. You have to connect to their WiFi system, but as long as you don't download anything else there are no charges.",
"U loved the app! Although you get the paper version, it is way more practical to get your way around the ship.",
"We used this app to stay abreast of all the onboard activities! The only problem was putting my phone in airplane mode, caused the time on my phone to be an hour behind. Not sure if it was the phone or user error. :-)",
This app is handy for anything you need on the cruise. Highly recommend everyone in your party download. Great for a busy family who wanted to do it all!,
This app was very helpful. It really helped us make our way to wherever we wanted to be. It also was a great help for planning meals. And of course everything Disney does is incredible.,
Easy to use. Was very helpful to find out the character schedules (times & place) for each day. Gave locations of each activity/show which was nice because it was a huge ship.,
"I'm going on a cruise in October.  The only feature available to me at the moment is the Countdown Timer...it is off by 1 hour.  In March when we change the clocks, it will be correct....would be great to have the app auto adjust to be correct no matter what time standard we're currently using.  I'm looking forward to seeing this app in action in October.",
The only part that I did not like ed the fact my phone had to be in airplane mode in order to use it.. help guide Mr to things going on on the ship and all character activities.,
Great app just gives you a  little trouble connecting when you are abord the ship the wifi knocks you off when u are at port.,
Sometimes the countdown stoped working and you would have to reset the clock. Other than that the app works amazingly.,
"Shows all the details of what's happening, how to get there.  Also shows dinner menus categorized along with sperate  vegetarian options and no sugar added desserts.  Great aid in planning the day!",
"Needs to be a little easier to navigate considering it took half way thru the cruise to figure it out completely, but overall very helpful to get you planning what to do on the boat!",
Only problem is that their internet offer to buy internet constantly comes out and interupts when u are taking pics.,
"Let me know the daily schedule.  I could check out the shows,  menus in the restaurants & activities around the ship.",
This app was easy to use and a great alternative to carrying the paper navigator in my pocket. This also kept you informed of extra character appearances at did not appear on the print copy.,
"For looking up menus or times for shows, etc...this app was invaluable ! Absolutely necessary on a Disney cruise !",
"You don't have to carry around the paper map or Navigator newsletter.  All the entertainment, dining, etc. is on your phone. Just wish it had a map of the route that was updated regularly so you could follow the ship's progress.",
This app was really helpful... it helped us knowing what was going on each day. Only suggestion I really had was that none of the prices were on the spa services or photo prices.,
Worked awesome on the boat. Used it frequently and found out a lot about the ship.,
I love this app it was my first time on a cruise and it helped me so much I recommend this app if you are going on a disney cruise enjoy,
This app was very useful.  It was our first Disney cruise and it made planning easy.,
I didn't have a single problem accessing and using it once on board the ship. I really enjoyed having all the information at my fingertips!  Thanks Disney!,
"This was so helpful to have on the cruise!  I always had my phone on me to take pics and was able to check this app for info on activities,  ship floor plans,  open hours for restaurants and kids Club,  even the weather!  No glitches either!",
"Once I got it loaded, extremely   easy to use. Love the fact you could check days in advanced for activities so you could always plan your day accordingly. Loved it!!",
"Very useful during our cruise. Provided countdown to cruise, daily activities, times and menus for each restaurant.",
Thi s app helps so much in locating all the activities going on and all the character locations too.,
Wonderful app.  Keeps you updated on character appearances and dinner menus and other stuff happening on the boat.,
Cruise was amazing just got  off this morning wish it was longer and this app helps you know when all the fun is happening around the ship.,
Made looking for things to do while on our cruise very easy.,
While family used it even our teenager. Loved having phone on me for pictures and scheduling.,
"Came in handy, made things very simple. Definitely recommend!",
Very handy... A search option would be even more helpful.,
Loved having this on my cruise! I will upgrade to 5 stars when it is installed on the wave phones so that I don't have to carry both around.,
This app was a life saver on so many occasions. I always left that navigator in my room and this app was there. It categorized everything so you wasn't searching for it. And the navigator didn't show everything like the app did. When you seen a character and the line was long you could use the app to see others days and times the characters would be out. It gave information on the Spa and other adult services but what could of made it more useful was having the prices available. But overall the app is great,
"This came in handy on while on the ship to view activities and the menus. Oh yeah, get ready to eat!",
"Amazing app!! Works Great, Just like having a copy of the daily navigator in digital format, shows deck location/plans. Daily itinerary, and character greeting times. Very useful app.",
Almost perfect! 85 percent of the info provided on the print version.  Loved the my favorite activities function.  Really helped with getting the most out of our week long cruise experience! :-),
I wish the app had real time updates like activity time changes and cancellations and also weather updates,
So fun to count down to count to the cruise.  Once on board was the perfect way to stay informed.,
Needs to display more of the activities throughout the day. Maybe have a daily planner,
Good app. Be nice if it showed you where you are.,
Great app for my cruise. Used it the entire time. Great for planning meals and activities. Cant wait for the next time !,
Used this app the whole cruise! Told us where and when everything was happening!,
Great way to plan the week.  You don't have to wait for your Daily Navigator.,
"When we originally downloaded this app, it was listed to work on Disney Wonder- now the Wonder isn't listed. At least the countdown is fun...",
This app kept us on top of the happenings at all times.,
This app was very easy to use and put all of the answers to your questions at your fingertips.,
I love this app so much! There is never a problem. I wish there were an app like this for every cruise!,
Disney out does themselves. This app was fantastic,
Gave me the days schedule of events down to the dinner menu!,
Answered my questions and helped plan our cruise.,
Love being able to see what was on the menu at each of the rotational dining venues.,
Really helped with the activities and dinner menus! Made the trip much easier,
I can't wait to use this on the Magic!,
I was able to maneuver with ease aboard the ship and get to the different programs for the kids,
Helped me find out what activities were going on,
Awesome like everything Disney.  Thanks for the cruise and memories Disney Dream,
Very easy to use.  Convenient to use while on board instead of a paper schedule,
Static web page. No info about my dinners etc.,
Very helpful. Told us everything we needed to know.,
"Extremely helpful, I wouldn't cruise without it",
Worked great.  Had all the info I needed.,
Works great but could be better organized.,
I used this constantly on the cruise,
Everything you need to know on the ship!,
Everything needed for the cruise is in this app. Excellent design.,
What a great resource on our cruise!,
Make sure you download it before you leave!!!! You will not want to be on the ship with out it!!,
Loved it! It worked out great on the ship...kept me on time!,
So very useful,
Great app comes in very handy,
This app is very use full. It tells you everything you need to know. From dinning to entertainment.  Great app?,
DISNEY NAVIGATOR APP,
The only way to cruise on Disney!!....the app is GREAT!!!!!,
Very helpful!,
Good info for on the cruise.,
Is this going to work for the Disney Wonder in the near future?,
Amazing app!!!,
Thanks,
112.  Dec.  4.   2013,
"Excellente! All updates, time scheds, photos, and destinations are placed inside the app during actual dates of activities and even before the date of the activities themselves!!! :))",

This is a fun app that we used a lot on our last cruise.  The information it provided was useful.  My only complaint was with the Wi-Fi network.  My Galaxy SIII wouldn't stay connected because the network wanted me to sign in to access the internet.  It wouldn't stay connected for the app.  IPhone version stayed connected without a problem.,
"The app itself is very helpful. It would be more convenient with 2 major differences. 1- the DCL-Guest wifi on the ship would stay connected. (I had to reconnect every 3-4 minutes or I'd only get partial functionality). 2- there were a better description on certain activities.  For example when entertainment offered a show it gave a brief description of what you will see. As I said it was helpful...When it worked. It took me 3 unsuccessful talks with guest services and a lot of tinkering, and 3 missed days",
"Compared to running around with a paper flyer all day this app is hands down better.  However, there are important features missing, simple add to calendar or reminder would save me from having to constantly look at it (not like things get rescheduled in Disney), also marking something favorite simply adds to a list with no sort criteria or ability to decipher without opening each (would server better in a calendar or time order).  Just seems a hair short of the usual Disney magic.",
This would be a very excellent app if you could do almost anything before you got to the ship. What you are allowed to view before you get to the ship is crap!!!! Once on board it is totally awesome. Let people play with the app so they are at least familiar with it. The map is ok. Maybe if you didn't have to go all the way out then back in to change decks.   Overall all a worth while app. But don't waste the time to download it until the day before you go..... or get to the terminal.,
Easy to use and made finding activities and their location easy. Only issue was that sometimes the activities shown were for the day before so just had to reselect the date again to refresh.,
"It's great to not have to carry around the daily navigator, but Disney needs to learn to update events on the fly and also to review the day's info for accuracy.  We found several discrepancies between the paper navigator and this app. In addition, while we were on board, discovered that a menu from Xmas was included on one night.  Got to dining all ready to order only to find out that this particular meal wasn't being served.  Kind of disappointing!",
"Was easy to know what was going on throughout the cruise. Only wish I had was that it would have a ""you are here"" in port or to let you know what islad you are passing at days at sea - but anytime on the ship my gps was wonky.",
Found some activities mismarked while sailing on the Dream (11/24-11/27). Also would be very helpful to have your favorites alert you when close to the time. The floor layout is helpful. Would be great if important announcements were listed.,
"Had trouble with the app staying connected. I agree with another review that it would have been cool to get a preview before hand, but otherwise I liked it.",
"Has lots of potential, but after  missing a few activities We stopped using it.  The daily paper navigator is more accurate. Just use it.",
GREAT... only could use a  overall picture of events to better see over laps,
"A found this to be our entertainment lifeblood while on the cruise.  From kids activities to dinner options, this app worked great!",
"Works very well. It was more informative than the daily printed navigator.  It was not 100 percent accurate,  but very close.",
"The app was very helpful while on the ship. It occasionally reverted to other pages or opened while I was taking a picture, but the pros outweighed the cons.",
Easy way to have a ton of information at your fingertips.   It really is an electronic navigator that has every day's activities and events on your mobile device.,
"App worked really well on board. The maps were really nice as well as the schedule of events. Nice being able to just carry a phone instead of the whole navigator. It would be really nice if they added a daily planner. A planner that notifies you where to go next and what your doing, for people who plan their day ahead.",
Well done... Made all the info I needed easy to get thru my phone.  Much easier than carrying the navigator printout,
Great for planning and keeping up with activities. Camera+planner+guide+map+watch=one convenient phone thanks to the app.,
Excellent tool for Maximizimg  the cruise.  Eliminates the need for paper Navigator.  Would be better of it was a logon by castaway number and could keep a record of my tips - like Delta's sky miles app.,
This app was very helpful on our cruise.   I would give it 5 stars if you could filter by your favorites with the dates and times available.   I also wish it would work off board the week prior to sailing.,
"Suggestion would be Barcodes on the wall or doors/signs to provide current location,  then a navigation feature to give you the best route.",
", This was such a big help and wonderfully entertaining throughout our sail with you. Had a fabulous time. Hope to see y'all real soom!",
"Great way to navigate the ship, events and activities.  I love the ships personal navigator, but this is a nice addition to your trip.",
This app is so much more easier than using the actual navigator because on the cruise it kept getting lost! This app works very well.,
Made it easier to make sure I don't miss a thing! Will definitely use it again next time.,
Had no problems on the Fantasy December 2013. Looking forward to using on Dream in February 2014.,
The app was like a pocket-sized personal navigator. It was very helpful to find the times and locations of character meet and greets and activity times. Made the experience more enjoyable overall!!,
We did out 15th & 16th B2B on the Dream and not once I looked at the printed Navigator. It never left over stateroom.,
Just went on the Fantasy over Christmas.  This app was so handy ! Disney thinks of everything !,
All and all the app is good and was a very useful tool for us on our recent cruise on the Disney Dream.  It would have been great to have some sort of GPS system allowing us to see where we were on the ship at any given moment like the park apps do.  I know there is limited internet access but there should be a way to do it.  We definitely enjoyed the vacation countdown and taking screenshots to post on our media websites!  ;),
"Easy to use, great info and made a big difference to our trip.",
We used it in our trip two weeks ago,
Always knew what was going on and where to find it on the ship.  Easy to navigate.,
nice info but wish it could be set to give reminders,
This is a useful app to check on schedules and menu without using data and relying on the ship WiFi,
My work getting easy..,
This was a wonderful tool to be able to enhance the cruise experience.,
Add schedules for the individual clubs.,
Please add compatibility to the Magic by January 2014.,
Super easy to use and keep you on track,
Want to know more about disney games!,
Made it easy to know what's going on,
Please add the Disney Wonder by end of Nov!,
Perfect addition to our cruise.,
Very informative in helping find our way around. ...,
Loved it!  It worked great,
Love it!!,
forget your paper guide,
Very Useful,
Easy to use,
Amazing,
Worked well,
,
"It was ok, nice having dinner menus.  I dont like carrying my phone on vacation, but Im probably in the minority there.	It would be nice to be able to add things to the navigator, and also notes...such as a new friends stateroom number.",
"This app needs to become compatible with the Dream at the very least.   It's understandable to see why the older ships might not be getting this app soon, but there is no reason the Dream shouldn't have it by now.  The countdown timer is nice, but it will be awful if i can't use the main app on the Dream.",
Used it alot.  Much more convenient than paper.   Would like the ability to add ad-hoc activities like mixology and possibly a personal calendar to show schedule of items marked as favorites. Great job Imagineers!,
Used this for the daily list of events and the food menu every day while on our Fantasy cruise.  Way easier than carrying around the paper copies of the navigator!,
"Deck plans, dinner menus, character appearances, movie and show times, etc. This app has it all for your Fantasy cruise.",
Very useful on board! Loved having menus ahead of time to help my picky eaters decide for dinner. Really liked being able to easily check times of all activities.,
"I would recommend this for Disney Cruise particpants, so you will always have the latest information handy!",
Easy and fun to use.  Loved looking up what was for dinner each night.,
It is great for looking ahead at the week. Enjoyed menu options.,
Really great way to monitor ;all the activities on board. Very easy to use.,
Great app. Worked like a charm onboard the Disney Fantasy!!,
great app! Would be good if you could per order your food for dinner and book excruision,
Huge help!,
I think DCL is missing a huge marketing audience by only letting passengers view this app. There are many of us Castaway club members and others that would love to see what is happening on the ship. Please open it for everyone. Shouldn't be a big technical issue to do this.,
Now the same Navigator Newsletter that they give on the ship becomes an app. This app will only work while you on the Disney Fantasy only. So don't give it a bad review if your not on the Disney Fantasy ship.,
Wish that it would have an alarm feature that would allow you to select the event then notify when time approached.,
This ap shows a lot of promise. Refine it and grow it to include persona based interactions and dynamic scheduling + feedback and you will have a winner.,
"I loved using this app,it allowed me to not worry about what was happening on the cruise and I could just easily check my phone for something fun to do.",
"Very clean, simple to use, and once again, Disney is looking towards the future. Can't wait to see the App after it has been out for awhile and am excited to see any update Disney may add!",
This app made viewing the navigator so much easier and convenient especially for character appearances.  I hope this app gets rolled out for all ships!  Thanks!,
"Very convenient app on board the ship. We liked it. Three tweaks. 1. There was no way to load the app on an iPod or wifi only device once we found out about the app at the terminal until we found wifi at the first port of call. 2. On my Android phone, the ship time did not update with the time zone changes. 3. The kid's menu food was not noted separately from the adult menu so there were times we though we had options that were not full size. Yes, you can order the kid's menu food if you wish.",
"Great app to find your way around the ship and activities. Everything was 
accurate and easy to find. Only problem is the chatting would be slow and 
send a few hours later so there was no point in using the texting. It also 
kept saying I wasn't connected to the wifi even though I was, but it was 
still working. Overall, excellent app for the cruise and I very much 
recommend it if you are going on a disney cruise.",
This app was fantastically useful during my cruise with a larger group. The only reason  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not consistently provided notifications for new text messages. I loved that there were Disney emoticons available to use in texts. I also frequently used the app to track onboard activities.,
"Great to check activities and menus and set reminders.   Would have loved to be able to enter my scheduled activities like the tea party, bbb appt, ticketed character meet and greets, Palo res etc.  Would be awesome to set faves and click on a calendar to see everything including those on my screen in a daily calendar format to see if anything is double booked.",
"This app sounded great in theory, but once we got on the ship it would not work. It constantly froze and crashed, and even when it worked it would not send chat messages. We ended up having to communicate by pen and paper notes in the stateroom. We all have different phones so we know it's not just a compatibility issue.",
"Clunky! The app does not keep filters like adult activities vs. not...we 
constantly had to reset them each time we opened it. It doesn't notify you 
except through the notifications panel - we're on the Android. It also 
doesn't give you your whole itinerary. And doesn't buzz or pop up a chat 
message sent to you. It seriously needs work.",
"Horrible, but necessary app if you are going on a Disney cruise. It has all 
the daily happenings, and allows filtering (but the filters reset each time 
you navigate away from the list). It allows chatting between passengers 
(but is SERIOUSLY unreliable). Be aware of the battery drain... It kills my 
phone battery quickly, and will drain my Android Wear within 5 hours.",
"Great being able to have all activities, movies and restaurant information at your fingertips. The text messaging was a bit of a let down as there was a real delay in sending and receiving messages during our June 2016 Bahama cruise. Otherwise, it really seemed to enhance our trip enjoyment!",
"App was a nightmare. Information wasn't always accurate and the chat 
function (you know, most important feature) worked maybe 15% of the time. 
I'd have to restart the app 4-5 times just to get messages (usually hours 
after they were sent)",
"Useless and annoying app. Chat could use a spell- checker, and wouldn't work unless the app was open and running on-screen. Even then, there were NO notifications when someone texted you. And how about providing free wi-fi while on board? I  was never so happy to delete an app when we docked!",
"A large number of glitches undermine the obvious quality that this app could have. Most issues lurk in the onboard chat feature. Without a reliable data connection, an integrated chat service is a great feature—when it works. If the app is closed, you won't get any notifications from new messages. Unfortunately, most users close apps when they aren't using them. You also won't get notifications from a conversation that you're currently viewing — even when the app is in the background.",
"It's fantastic to have something on my phone like this. Officially supported, up to date. And, according to the hands on the ship, will be rolled out to the entire fleet hopefully next year. Since I'm a frequent Disney ""Cruiser"" this app has become a permanent fixture on my Nexus 4. Can't wait to see what other magical features Disney adds to this app!",
"This app is almost total garbage. iPhone users state that it works well, but on my android it was horrible. It can't erase text easily, you have to select the whole word and then retype. It crashed multiple times daily, usually when trying to reply to a message. It can't be set to sound, just vibrate. The tech support guy on the cruise ship said that LG phones tended to have the biggest issues. This app is your lifetime on those ships. It really needs to be stable.",
App works beautifully on board! I have no complaints about that. Just wish you could access reservation information prior to the cruise. To check anything or make changes before the cruise you have to log in to their actual website. Access to this on the app would be very helpful.,
"Since I first used this app in 2016, it has improved- back then I couldn't message my family at all (wave phones are much more reliable) and didn't overall find it useful.  BUT, it's still rather behind where I would expect any app I download to be.  In short, the messenger part still needs to get better connection- on average, there was maybe a 5-10 minute delay between receiving messages.  I would also like for the activities part to sync with the most recent navigator- there was a tour I wanted to go on and the app had the old time so I missed the tour. I'm assuming this is not the only instance, but perhaps it was. I do find having the activities on the app and being able to get reminders very helpful. I also really like the messenger app (outside the timing issues). I would also like to be able to put in our port adventures/Paleo reservations/spa reservations into the app. I'd be willing to type it in, if that's part of the issue. (I can see security being an issue on a shared network, but if there's a personal section part of the app- like a notes page for this stuff- I would hope that could be private enough. Since our cards are checked for those activities too). So, I recommend the app, but it does need improvements 😀",
"Great idea, poor execution.  Reliable onboard chat would be fantastic, but it can take hours for texts to appear unless you have the app in the foreground.  You're also often unable to send messages, and crashes are common.  Good work on activity lists onboard, though.  Could be a great app with some love.",
Just got off of our first cruise on the wonder. So worth the money. Excellent service great quality.. All the employees were so nice. We all had a ball.definitely gotta plan another one..app is very helpful too,
Great app to replace the Daily Navigator but it was sometimes incorrect on locations. It would have been nice to have it always be updated. It could also provide more data like breakfast and lunch menus as well as my important beers by location.,
"The app was perfect for keeping track of activities, seeing menus, and most importantly chatting with others in our party. No need to carry around the wave phone any more. Took off one star because it's missing group chat so I often had to copy/paste the same text to multiple people. Add that and it's five stars. Six stars if they added Shutters professional photo integration so you could view and buy your professional photos from the app.",
"I was too busy having fun on board, this helped to keep events for these kids, like character pictures and autographs easy.  It could probably be more interactive, like the picture package thing with the theme parks, but that's it.  Good tool, overall.",
We just sailed on the Disney Fantasy and the app was good.  My first problem that many others complained about was the inability to access app before cruise.  (They could allow access a week before the cruise based on reservation number.   The other thing they could do is to sync entries into favorites based on reservation number so you don't have to input it on a second device. And  each person in the party can have the same info.   Excursions and spa appointments should be able to be added into the app sc,
"I did not like the app. First of all you need Wi-Fi to use it. But you have 
to pay for Wi-Fi on the cruise. which is ridiculous. All the money you pay 
for the trip and you can't get free WiFi. So after the first 50mb they give 
you for free the app was useless. Other them this app the trio was amazing. 
😁",
"This app was helpful for communicating although I could not get notifactions from kids club, which was our main use for it,on mine (LG) but my husband could (iphone). I also used it for character appearances onboard, that was great! I wish you could add notifications for ticketed onboard activities.",
"The features of this app are fantastic, unfortunately the app hangs and crashes so frequently it bacame unusable. I heard similar complaints from others on board running a variety of Android and Apple phones.  One feature request, find a way to text between room phones and the app.",
"The most useful part of the app for me was the scheduler. Each morning, I picked out which activities and shows I wanted to do and see. After that, I just let the app notify me 15 minutes before each event. I never had to look at a clock.   TIP: Download and install right BEFORE the ship leaves port. The ship's WiFi was messed up during our cruise. But, since I had already loaded the schedule, it didn't matter.",
"The concept is great and worth 5 stars except there are problems with the chat system onboard.  Do NOT let your kids get a hold of the phone before you set up the chat.  Our daughter put in the wrong birthday: it must match the reservation & there's no undo.  Some at onboard services can help by giving a web address that clears it, but many of them have no idea it exists.  Also you can't reset unless you have active internet which costs $$$ underway.  DISNEY please add a chat system reset into the app!",
Terrible. The app crashed constantly for my entire group. It also halved my phone's battery life. Absolutely terrible Disney.,
Liked the app. Not sure if it was the app or our phones but they all jumped 4 hrs ahead after installing app. After that fix all was well. Only thing I can think of to make even better would be a reference of where you are at when using the app.,
Very useful information and easy to use.  All the ships information at the touch of a button.  WiFi signal is spotty on the ship though.  Chat feature is slow but works most of the time.,
"This app is wonderful! It has a list of activities everyday, through out the day. It also let's you know what part of the ship those events are in! It let us know about different kids activities and adult activities. We loved it! It was a bit slow at times, but most of the time worked great!",
We were able to keep up with all the activities with this wonderfully laid out app.,
Can't send pics in chat feature.  Need to be able to add a person to an existing group chat without starting a new chat thread.  Can't delete chat threads.  Navigator feature was handy.  Loved the activity reminder option.,
"Crashes, crashes everywhere. Just returned from my cruise on board the Disney Magic and this app is extremely useful, when it works. As a mobile app dev myself, I can't believe this app is a live app in production, especially since it came from Disney. The simple fact that this app kept crashing over and over is what warranted this one star. I expect nothing but the best from Disney with all their unlimited resources, and a mobile app that continuously freezes my phone, and crashes is unacceptable. Now, it may have been due to poor wifi connection onboard the ship, idk why that would be an issue, but the app should not completely crash just because it doesn't have a connection. Please test and fix, and this app would be an easy 5 star.",
"The app was super helpful! It made making plans  and finding  things  to do easy, fast and fun. Setting reminders for things you dont want miss is just a heart press away. We had a blast thanks to this app!",
How to get around on the boat.  Doesn't send pictures and has occasional lag.  Still a great way to figure out what and where.,
"Ever since the last update in April, app doesn't work on my LG phone.  Loved using the app on our cruise last August.  Hope it works again for us next summer.",
"This app was so very helpful and such a great asset. Only issue I had was needing to reload and reset it a handful of times. Otherswise, awesome.",
"It's a great app, it just rarely works. And when it doesn't work, it drains your phone battery searching for a signal.",
I loved this app so easy to read everything going on each day and you don't need wifi for it too work.,
"Did not work most of the time. Would make my phone glitch and would rarely 
send any messages. Terrible app because it didn't work for its sole purpose.",
The texting on board was sketchy. Sometimes the messages were delivered hours later. Other times it was fine. The schedule in hand was really nice! I'd say a 3.5,
Loved the countdown to my vacation and then while on board knowing all that was going on and when. The chat feature was cool too.,
Useful when you are there. Update u daily food and activities. Wish they would let u be familiarised with it before day1 and wish there is a chat to customer service. Otherwise amazing app and very useful,
"I loved the app, but couldn't always get it to work :(  might have been my phone",
App does not work anymore on my phone. Cruise is coming up and I had been looking forward to using it. Please update so I can reinstall,
Changes during the trip weren't updated when music venues moved. A time when teens program ended was incorrect. otherwise it worked well for us. great having means to connect while on board.,
"The app provides basic information for activities, dinning, highlights, ship map and  chats. It will be great if the voice and photo can be added. Also, the message in group chat sometimes went missing.",
"Wanted to use the count down for my cruise but the app won't open. Only says ""sorry, app stopped"". Very disappointed.",
I suggest it so you won't miss any events. You can stay in touch with anyone on your list. Good for hooking up with new friends.,
Cannot get it to install on my phone. Going on a Disney Cruise in 2 weeks and this app would be handy to have.,
Won't download...I've tried several times over the past couple of days and it only shows that it is trying to download but never actually does.,
Great for keeping up with schedules but the messaging between users never worked. The app constantly showed members of our group as offline and would not send messages to them.,
"The app worked during our 2016 cruise, but not as well during our 2017 cruise. The TEXT/CHAT portion was very hard to setup, would not connect, and would not deliver the message. The rest of app worked perfectly.",
A great tool to use while on ship. Be sure not to agree to the internet service unless that was your intention.,
"This app is great! It gives you the time for when the activities start and 
other stuff. I denfetily be using this app next year when I go back!",
Helpful but could use some additional features like online bill review and sending pictures via the messenger app.,
Love the app. Makes the entire cruise experience. No papers to fold up and reference and the reminders are great. Never mind the text services! !,
Very useful and user friendly. Will love it even more if it can show where the users are so it's easier for me to track down my children.,
No signal on ship so chat feature was PERFECT!  Thanks for all the character appearance updates. A MUST for any good planner on board,
"I was trying to get the app, but I couldn't get it. I guess Disney Dream has bad WiFi.",
Got the most out of our cruise with the app. I loved that it stored a time lined agenda of the daily activities on board and the text message  reminders. I was also able to communicate with my family via text. The Disney emoticons were fun.,
"When it worked, the app was fine but not delightful (as you'd expect from Disney). App crashed often and the chat feature usually required an app restart to send or receive messages.",
"I love the app,  it's  really helpful, but it would be better if when we get texts we would have some noise/ring so we know that we got a/the message. It helped throughout the cruise. ❤",
I love all the features the app has to offer. A map to let you know where all the activities are and the time. Plus a reminder of your activities & character meet & greet.  Chat features that let's you stay in touch with other guest on board. Just make sure your phone is on airplane mode & shut off the mobile data roaming on your phone. You will not occur additional charges if you follow those steps.,
The app is really nice and helpful but it started crashing near the end of the cruise,
Chat is excruciating because the keyboard assists are all disabled. Please address.,
It is an onboard texting app. The only problem is you got the notifications hours later. You can see what is on the agenda each day and you can share the things you like with family members. Allows you to see your spending as well but is harder to find.,
"It falls just short of being an amazing app. Ease-of-use factor was there, but you had to explore on your own to understand it. Maybe a quick tutorial page or two would help.",
"Would have been a really great app, if it didn't continuously crash after 3 
minutes of being open",
This app was really helpful on my recent Disney cruise since I was consistently forgetting and/or losing the paper copy of the daily schedule of events. Having the dining room menus on hand was also incredibly helpful.,
"Sort of buggy. The keyboard in the app misbehaves constantly. If you try to erase a word, backspace is not useful.",
This app was wonderful to have on our cruise. It allowed us to stay in touch with one another and kept us up to date on all the wonderful activities the ship offered!,
"If the app would have allowed to upload and share pictures, I would rate this 5 stars. It served its purpose and did what it was supposed to do",
I really liked having this app on board. Having the days activities at your fingertips was very helpful! Ability to purchase tickets to on board activities would be a great feature to add. Room account access would be nice as well.,
"Useful for the events calendar and for communicating with people on the ship when there is no signal. In theory the app is great, but it is super slow and everyone of the 8 adults in my party that used the app had trouble with it freezing and and crashing.",
Never have to remember what activities are coming up when you have this app.  Lets you text friends on board using the ships WiFi.  All for free!,
This app is a must have for future cruises. Great addition to the cruise experience. This app is just one more reason why nobody does it like Disney! Thanks for a GREAT cruise.,
Good information Texting portion has lots to be desired.  It appears to be still in the development phase.,
Ignorant application switches to portrait mode without any regard for how i am holding the tablet,
"Terrable! Super slow, messenger only works while you have it open and looking at it, once you closr your phone it stops sendimg or receviving.",
We could not have scheduled our activities and not missed anything without this app.  A++++,
It is great and very useful especialy to chat with your family and friends when you get lost on the cruse,
"Everything worked fine, absolutely no issues. I really liked how you could favorite certain activities and would receive a reminder notification prior to the activity! Also nothing beats DCL",
The only thing I can think of that would make it better is an option for tracking other members of your party.,
Best way to keep up to date and not miss any of the fun! Highly recommended,
I love it cause I could talk to my parents so they  would not get lost.,
Good concept but needs some work. Crashes frequently and hangs often.,
Sailing on 9/21. Would love to give useful feedback. This app looks very useful.,
It was great to help find things and schedule activities. The chat is also a great feature.,
This was the 1st of what we hope to be many DCL vacations for our family.  Disney just does it right!!! The app was very helpful in planning our day.  It was mostly easy to navigate with my Android.,
Loved having this for our trip! Made it easy to keep track of all the fun things we wanted to do.,
I think it is game by seeing sample pictures,
Problems with the app since day 1,
The app it works ok but the chat have some delay and also crash sometimes,
"App crashed alot and would get messages several hours after they were sent 
from the kids club",
Great app for the ship. Delay sometimes with chat.,
Was a wonderful tool once I started using it and figured it out.,
"Very intuitive, has all the information you could possibly be looking for and more. Events, programs, character appearances, location, menu... you name it. PLUS, it has chat feature, easy way to stay in touch with anyone you know on the ship.",
Get app to have on the ship. Helps you find everything on the ship and know when events happened,
It's very useful to stay in touch with people around the ship and good for little kids you want to meet characters and also to know what older kids may be doing and at what time,
Need to work on connectivity issues  while on board the ship.,
excellent way to stay informed through out your trip! didn't miss a thing.,
This app was great for daily activities. I would recommend the messages to be pushwd instead of always logging in to receive them,
Used this on our 7 day cruise on the Fantasy. Really helped us plan our day!,
Loved using this every morning. Especially to see the dinner menu! The chat was helpful too.,
Don't always get notifications. Had problems with it running consistently.,
This app was well designed.  It was easy to use and very helpful during our cruise!,
Mostly informative. Chat  component of app not  always useful.,
Really good I just wish you could do a bit more before the trip.with it.,
Beats the goofy out of royal Caribbean,
Loved this app. Very informative & useful. Disney never ceases to amaze!,
This would be great if it were available for the Wonder as well. Any idea when or if those of us sailing on the Wonder will be able to use this app?,
"The app is fine, but the Magic needs more server capacity.",
Love the app and chat.  No more paper navigators or wave phones needed!,
Had a party of 7 and we all had the app. We could get a hold of each other and have a navigator on our app that updated every night. Recommend for sure.,
Love having all the information right at my fingertips!,
"Loved this app, we used it over n over again on disney cruise!!!",
Great tool to keep us aware of the activities !,
"Brilliant for keeping in touch with family members and up to date with what 
was going on round the ship.",
Would be a great improvement to be able to see favorite events in a schedule view.,
Please update the spa times for the Disney wonder.  General times for the spa shows 8am to 8pm it should be 8am to 10pm.,
This is a great app for a cruise ship to have I wish that I had this on the other cruises that I've been on,
Good but means I have to carry the phone defeating the purpose of vacation.,
Worked flawless during our cruise!,
I been wanting to go to Disney world all my life when I was a little girl and now I can thank you Jesus Christ,
Great to stay connected with everyone you are cruising with excellent way to keep track of activities and character meets and locations,
Nice to text to others on ship using the app,
Helped me find my family it is so much better that the way phone,
My cellphone was not working with DCL's Wifi at all. I gave-up.,
Can't get in with Google pixel 2 phone.,
Best day of my life! Thanks for taking us mom!,
My LG-G3 works perfectly with this app 😄,
It was very useful when me and my friends were on the cruise but it could be better make it to where you can send photos and call,
This is a great way to plan your time in a DCL!,
Worked great on the cruise! No issues.,
App work when it wants to. Messaging feature can't be relied on,
It was a great way to meet friends find what's going on and chat,
Wonderful for finding your way around the ship and finding those in your party!,
"Works great, user friendly and fun",
All the info you need at sea,
Defective​---automatically sets the alarm on my Moto x,
I think it is amazing but how do you play I think it's amazing how do you play,
Sad that the suitcase is gone. Loved that suitcase,
"Pretty awesome app, very convenient.",
App tells you everything you need to know about your cruise.,
"So handy, worked perfectly.",
Didn't work at all on the cruise,
I loved this app it was so easy to use,
It was easy to use and very helpful.,
Very convenient for families to keep in touch.,
Won't let me download the app.,
It Has Everything You Need,
"Can't say much else about it. The app worked, and it worked as expected.",
Made planning our day super easy.,
Great way to stay connected,
This app was great during our cruise.,
User friendly and very useful,

Worked very well for navigating all the activities during our cruise.,
It is a cool😀😁😂😅😄😃🤣😆,
Wouldn't cruise without it!,
Very useful at sea.,
"Love IT, guess where I hade the best time in my life?",
Doesn't work to communicate,
